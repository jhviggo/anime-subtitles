WEBVTT

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.020
GOOD LUCK, CHIHIRO
WE'LL MEET AGAIN

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.020
Chihiro. Chihiro!

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.690
We're almost there.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.530
This really is the middle of nowhere.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.450
I'll have to shop in the next town.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.990
It'll be great, once we get used to it.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.040
Look, there's the school.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.830
That's your new school, Chihiro.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.040
It doesn't look so bad.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.880
I liked my old school...

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.850
Mommy... My flowers died.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.730
No wonder, the way you clung to them.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.730
A little water when we get there
and they'll perk right up.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.400
My very first bouquet
is farewell flowers, how sad.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.860
What about that rose
you got for your birthday.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.160
One rose isn't a bouquet.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.910
You dropped your card.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.450
I'm opening the window.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.660
C'mon now, behave yourself.
It's a big day for all of us.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.740
Hey... Did I take the wrong turn?

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.120
I don't get it.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.290
That must be it, look.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.090
It must be that blue one over there.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.920
That's it.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:16.920
I must've missed the exit.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.220
I bet this road'll get us there.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.850
This is always how you get us lost.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.890
Just a little farther, OK.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.140
What are those little houses?

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.890
They're shrines. People pray to them.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.490
Daddy, are we lost?

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.200
We're fine, we've got four-wheel drive.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.030
Sit down, Chihiro.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.510
You're going to kill us.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.560
A tunnel.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.700
What's this strange building?

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.950
Must be the entrance.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.160
Honey...

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.870
Let's go back, honey.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.750
Chihiro.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.000
No...

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.960
It's just plaster.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.300
This building's pretty new.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.480
The wind's going in.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.230
What is it?

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.480
Let's have a look. There's a way through.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.230
It's creepy, Daddy, let's go back.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.110
No need to be scared.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.990
Just a little farther, OK?

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.990
The moving van'll get there before us.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.330
So, let 'em, they've got the keys.
Let the movers move us.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.450
I know, but...

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.410
No! I won't go.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.710
Daddy, let's go back.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.040
Nothing to be scared of.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.170
I won't go.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.850
Chihiro, you wait in the car.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.690
Mommy.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.770
Wait.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.110
Watch your step.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.410
You'll make me trip, Chihiro,
clinging like that.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.570
Where are we?

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.860
Say, do you hear that?

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:32.660
It's a train.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.580
Maybe we're near the station.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.540
Let's go and find out.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.540
What are those houses doing here?

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.120
I knew it.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.370
This must be an abandoned theme park.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.630
They built so many in the early '90s,

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.220
but they all went down with the economy.

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.930
This must be one of 'em.

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.050
What! No.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.720
Let's go back, Daddy.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.350
C'mon.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.070
Mommy, that building's moaning.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.120
It's just the wind.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.580
What a lovely spot.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.120
We should've brought our lunch with us.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.170
They were making a river.

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.220
Hey, you smell that?

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:14.010
See, it smells great.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.220
You're right.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.060
Maybe they're still open.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:19.850
Hurry up, Chihiro.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:21.980
Wait for me.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:56.600
This way.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.230
Can you believe it,
they're all restaurants.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:06.400
Where is everybody?

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:10.440
Over there.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:16.780
Hey.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.500
In here.

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:34.340
How amazing!

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:37.350
Hello, anybody here?

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:39.890
Come in, Chihiro, it looks delicious.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:41.220
Hello!

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:49.860
Oh, don't worry.
We can pay them when they get back.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.530
You're right. That one looks great...

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:54.860
I wonder what this is called.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:59.240
Delicious! Chihiro, taste it.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:01.120
I don't want to.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.870
Let's go! They're gonna be mad at us.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:07.460
Don't worry, you've got Daddy here.

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:09.590
I've got credit cards and cash.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:16.470
Take some, Chihiro, it's so tender.

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.140
Mustard.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:19.970
Thank you.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.480
Mommy! Daddy!

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:06.560
OIL

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.240
OIL

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.340
OIL

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.260
Weird...

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:52.400
OIL

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.780
BATHHOUSE

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:15.920
There's a train.

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:28.270
You're not allowed here. Go back.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:29.350
Wha--

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:32.270
It's almost night!
Leave before it gets dark.

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:34.020
BATHHOUSE

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.190
They're lighting the lamps. Go.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:39.780
I'll distract them.
Get back across the river.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.410
OIL

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.210
What's his problem?

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:05.850
Daddy.

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:08.640
Daddy, let's go home.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.350
Let's go, Daddy.

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:40.170
Daddy! Mommy!

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.720
Mommy!

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.080
It's water.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:29.510
This can't be...

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.390
I'm dreaming, dreaming.

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:36.140
Wake up!

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.270
Wake... up...

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:46.990
It's just a dream, a dream.

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:50.120
Go away, disappear.

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:51.530
Disappear.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.420
I can see through.

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.630
It's a dream, it's got to be.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.650
Don't be afraid, I'm a friend.

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:03.810
No, no, no.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.940
Open your mouth and eat this.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.150
Unless you eat something from this world,
you'll vanish.

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.400
No!

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:15.370
Don't worry.

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:17.790
It won't turn you into a pig.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:19.580
Chew it and swallow.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:31.880
Good girl, you're fine.

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:33.430
See for yourself.

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:42.900
I'm back again...

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.230
You see? Now come.

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:49.360
What about my mom and dad? They
didn't really turn into pigs, did they?

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.200
You can't see them now, but you will.

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:56.410
Quiet.

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:16.050
It's looking for you.

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.220
There's no time, let's run.

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:21.640
I... I can't stand! Oh, no.

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.140
My legs don't work.

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:25.730
Calm, now. Take a deep breath.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:33.490
In the name of the wind and the water
within thee... Unbind her.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:34.780
Get up.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.710
NO ENTRY

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:09.020
OIL

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.160
Hold your breath
while we're on the bridge.

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:23.500
Even a tiny breath

00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:26.620
will break the spell
and the attendants will see you.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.170
I'm scared.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:34.760
Be calm.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:38.010
Welcome. Always nice to see you.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:40.260
Welcome.

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:41.930
I'm back from my task.

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:43.770
Welcome back, sir.

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.810
A deep breath...

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:49.060
And hold...

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:09.670
Welcome back! We missed you!

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.750
Hang on, we're almost...

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:15.260
Master Haku.

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:17.630
Where have you...

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:20.840
Wha... A human.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:22.970
Run.

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:26.640
What...

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.910
Master Haku!

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:44.660
Chase after it. A human intruder.

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:47.080
I smell humans! The stench of humans.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.160
They know you're here.

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:49.920
I'm sorry, I took a breath.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.040
No, Chihiro, you did very well.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:55.050
Listen and I'll tell you what to do.

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:56.550
Stay here, and they'll find you.

00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:00.590
I'll distract them.
In the meantime, you escape.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.050
No, don't go! Stay with me, please.

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:06.890
You have no choice,
if you want to survive here.

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:08.560
And save your parents, too.

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:12.440
So they did turn into pigs...
I wasn't dreaming...

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.900
Be still...

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:18.280
When things quiet down,
go out by the back gate.

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.110
Take the stairs, all the way down.

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:24.910
Until you reach the boiler room,
where they stoke the fires.

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:27.660
Kamaji's there, so look for him.

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:29.200
Ask him for work.

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:30.040
Kamaji?

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:33.790
Even if he refuses, insist.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.290
If you don't work,

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:39.300
Yubaba will turn you into an animal.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.130
Yubaba.

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.800
You'll see.
She's the sorceress who rules our world.

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.560
Kamaji will turn you away,
trick you into you leaving,

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.060
but keep on asking him for work.

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:51.980
It'll be hard work,
but it will give you a chance.

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:54.100
Then even Yubaba can't harm you.

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:55.060
OK.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:58.070
Master Haku.

00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.610
I have to go.

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:02.320
Remember, Chihiro. I'm your friend.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.820
How do you know my name?

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:06.330
I've known you since you were small.

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:08.830
My name is Haku.

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.080
Here I am!

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:17.590
Master Haku, Yubaba wants you.

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:20.710
I know. It's about my task.

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.710
Um...

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:33.260
Excuse me.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.730
Um...

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.230
Um, are you Kamaji?

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:01.580
Um, Haku sent me here.
Please let me work here.

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:09.500
Darn, all at once...

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:12.340
Get to work, you little runts.

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:16.130
I'm... Kamaji.

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:19.010
Slave to the boilers that heat the baths.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:21.430
Step on it, boys.

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:24.350
Um, please let me work here.

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:28.810
I've got all the help I need.
The place is full of soot.

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.780
Plenty of replacements.

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:48.290
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.050
Please wait.

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:07.350
Outta the way.

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:02.700
Um... What should I do with this?

00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:11.000
Do I just leave it?

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.500
Finish what you start.

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:17.150
Hey, you runts! Wanna turn back into soot?

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:20.940
And you, watch it.
You can't just take someone's job.

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:24.450
If they don't work, the spell wears off.

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:27.700
Got no work for you here. Look elsewhere.

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:39.460
You sootballs got a problem?

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:40.920
Get to work! To work.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.970
Chow time.

00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:46.390
What? You guys at it again.

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:50.100
Cut it out.

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:51.430
Where's your bowl?

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.270
I keep telling you to leave it out.

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:56.810
Meal time! Take a break!

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:14.660
A human! You're in trouble.

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:17.250
They're having a fit about it upstairs.

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:20.000
That's my granddaughter.

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:21.500
Granddaughter?

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:26.180
Says she wants to work,
but I've got all the help I need.

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:29.890
Would you take her to Yubaba?

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:31.640
The girl can handle her, I'm sure.

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.390
Not a chance! And risk my life?

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.480
Take this, then. A roasted newt.

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.520
Real quality.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:45.280
If you want to work,
you'll have to make a deal with Yubaba.

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.530
Might as well try your luck.

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:51.530
Fine! You there, follow me.

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.630
Can't you even manage
a "Yes ma'am," or "Thank you"?

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:01.960
Yes... yes ma'am.

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:03.670
You sure are slow. Hurry.

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:04.880
Yes ma'am.

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:10.760
What do you need shoes for! Or socks!

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:19.150
Did you even thank Kamaji?

00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:21.060
He's looking out for you.

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:25.030
Thank you very much, sir.

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:27.860
Good luck.

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:40.750
Yubaba lives way up at the top,
in the back.

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:57.480
Get over here.

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:03.820
You wanna lose your nose?

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:29.800
We're almost there.

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.010
Right.

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:36.310
Here we are.

00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:41.020
Wel... welcome.

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:51.780
This elevator is not in service, sir.
Please use another.

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:55.160
DOWN ONLY

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:17.100
-He's following us...
-Quit gawking.

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:21.520
UP

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:34.490
Here we are.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.500
Your room is on the right.

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:44.710
Lin.

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:46.960
Yes.

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:50.300
What's that smell?

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.880
It's human. You reek of human.

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:53.720
Is that so?

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:57.970
I smell it, I do.
Smells mighty tasty, too.

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:00.970
You're hiding something.

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.480
Tell me the truth, now.

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:04.480
This smell.

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:07.400
Roasted... Gimme.

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:10.610
Not a chance. It's for the other girls.

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:14.110
I'm begging you. I'll settle for a leg.

00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:17.870
Anyone going up, pull down on the lever.

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:43.390
SECOND SKY

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:08.540
SKY

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:47.000
OIL

00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:05.220
Not going to knock?

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:08.980
What a pathetic little girl.

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:21.240
Come closer...

00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:26.620
I said closer.

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:43.590
Ow...

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:56.570
You're making a racket. Keep it down.

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:16.710
Um...

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:19.210
Please let me work here.

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:31.180
Stop babbling.

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:34.190
You're just a useless weakling.

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:39.030
Besides, this is no place for humans.

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:42.570
It's a bath house,

00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:46.570
where eight million spirits
can rest their weary bones.

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:50.660
Your parents had some nerve.

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:54.080
Gobbling up our guests' food like pigs!

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:56.580
Just desserts, I'd say.

00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:00.050
And you'll never see...

00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:02.510
your world again either.

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:08.890
You'd make a lovely piglet.

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:11.850
Or maybe a lump of coal.

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:21.530
I see you're trembling.

00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:25.400
Actually,
I'm impressed you made it this far.

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:28.370
Someone must've helped you.

00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:31.040
I must thank your friend.

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:35.500
Just who was it, my dear? You can tell me.

00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:40.040
Please let me work here.

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:41.710
Not that again!

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.260
I want to work here!

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:47.390
Shut up!

00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:56.230
Why should I hire you?

00:37:56.310 --> 00:38:00.650
Anyone can see
you're a lazy, spoiled, crybaby.

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:03.190
Stupid to boot.

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.780
I've nothing for you.

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:07.910
Forget it.

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:11.530
I've got all the bums I need around here.

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:16.960
Or maybe you'd like the worst,

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:19.130
nastiest job I've got,

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:24.170
until you breathe your very last breath?

00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:39.730
Stop that! What's wrong...

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:43.480
I'll be right there.
That's a good baby, now.

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:46.240
What? You still here! Get out.

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:48.280
I want to work here.

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.990
Don't shout.

00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:56.200
I'll be right there...

00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:59.290
That's a good baby, there, there.

00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:01.670
Please let me work!

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.840
OK, OK, just pipe down.

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:09.380
There, there, now.

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:31.610
Your contract.

00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:34.580
Sign your name.

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.870
I'll put you to work.

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:40.330
But one peep out of you about anything,

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:42.630
and I'll turn you right into a piglet.

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:45.840
Um, I sign my name here?

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:49.260
That's right.
Quit dilly-dallying and do it.

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:56.060
Unbelievable.

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:59.390
That ridiculous oath I took.

00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:04.400
To give a job to whoever asks.

00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:08.530
-Signed it?
-Yes.

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:15.370
-You're Chihiro, huh?
-Yes.

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:18.580
What an extravagant name.

00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:22.160
CHIHIRO

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:23.750
SEN

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.550
From now on, you'll be Sen.

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:33.090
You got that? You're Sen.

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:35.800
Answer me, Sen.

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:37.430
Yes...

00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:38.970
Did you call?

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:45.060
This child's starting work as of now.
Look after her.

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:45.940
Yes.

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:47.820
Your name?

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:49.020
What?

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:51.570
Chi... Oh, I'm Sen.

00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:54.280
Follow me, then, Sen.

00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:03.870
Haku... Um...

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:06.130
No idle chatter.

00:41:06.210 --> 00:41:08.840
Call me Master Haku.

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:27.650
Even on Yubaba's orders...

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:29.020
We can't allow humans.

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:31.320
Her contract's signed.

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:32.110
What...

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:33.400
Thank you, everyone.

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:37.160
-Don't send her to us.
-Can't bear that human stink.

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:41.040
Three days of eating our food
and her smell will vanish.

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:42.660
If she's still useless then,

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.750
fry her, boil her,
do with her as you will.

00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:49.170
Back to work! Where's Lin?

00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:51.670
Don't dump her on me.

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:53.840
You wanted help?

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:57.050
That's right, Lin's just perfect.

00:41:57.130 --> 00:41:59.260
-Go, Sen.
-Yes, Sir.

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:03.270
What a pain. You're gonna pay for this.

00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:05.390
Off you go.

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:09.310
C'mon.

00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:19.410
So you pulled it off, huh?

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:22.160
You're so thick, I was worried.

00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:26.500
Keep your wits, now.
If you need something, ask me, OK?

00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:29.670
What's wrong?

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:32.670
I'm dizzy.

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:39.510
So this is our room.

00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:42.890
A little food and some sleep
and you'll be fine.

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:48.890
You wash your own apron! Pants.

00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:52.020
You're so puny.

00:42:52.650 --> 00:42:54.190
Too big...

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:57.860
Um, Lin...

00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:58.950
What?

00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:00.910
Are there two Hakus here?

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:02.410
Two?

00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:05.290
Of him? I sure hope not.

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:06.410
Still too big.

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:09.040
He's Yubaba's henchman. Watch out for him.

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:14.880
Where the...

00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:17.760
Here it is.

00:43:19.090 --> 00:43:23.220
What's wrong? Are you OK?

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:26.560
What's all the fuss, Lin?

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:29.180
New girl. Says she feels faint.

00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:05.490
Meet me at the bridge.
I'll show you your mother and father.

00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:50.370
My shoes...

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:05.920
Thank you.

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:39.580
BATHHOUSE

00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:10.990
BATHHOUSE

00:47:14.830 --> 00:47:16.330
Follow me.

00:47:59.330 --> 00:48:01.920
Daddy, Mommy, it's me.

00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:03.670
It's Sen.

00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:07.090
Mommy, Daddy.

00:48:10.050 --> 00:48:11.930
Are they sick or hurt?

00:48:12.010 --> 00:48:14.680
No, they ate too much. Sleeping it off.

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:18.430
They don't even remember being human.

00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:26.690
Daddy, Mommy, I promise I'll save you.

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:29.900
Don't get too fat, or they'll eat you.

00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:39.910
Hide these.

00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:44.370
I thought they were gone.

00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:46.250
You'll need them to get home.

00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:54.890
This was a farewell card...

00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:57.550
Chi-hi-ro.

00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:01.220
Chihiro... That's my name.

00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:04.560
Yubaba rules others
by stealing their names.

00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:09.650
You're Sen here,
but keep your real name a secret.

00:49:09.730 --> 00:49:12.820
She almost got mine.
I'd nearly turned into Sen.

00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:17.120
If she steals your name,
you'll never find your way home.

00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:20.330
I no longer remember mine.

00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:22.330
Your real name?

00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:26.120
But it's strange. I remembered yours.

00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:31.170
Go ahead, eat, you must be hungry.

00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:32.880
I don't want to.

00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:36.970
I put a spell on it
to give you back your strength, eat it.

00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:16.220
You've had a hard time. Eat some more.

00:50:27.310 --> 00:50:29.810
OIL

00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:32.440
Can you find your way back?

00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:35.150
Yes, Haku, thank you. I'll work very hard.

00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:36.530
Good.

00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:12.580
Where were you? I was worried.

00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:13.790
I'm sorry.

00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:24.930
Outta my way.

00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:40.280
Is that the best you can do?

00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:43.110
You and Sen get the big tub as of today.

00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:45.530
What! But that's Frog work.

00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:48.620
Orders from the top.
Better give it your all.

00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:10.640
Aren't you... getting wet?

00:53:14.730 --> 00:53:16.480
Hurry up, Sen!

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:17.900
Coming!

00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:20.030
I'll leave this open.

00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:49.550
-On the big tub, Lin?
-Lay off me.

00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:56.440
Jerks! They haven't scrubbed this in ages.

00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:14.290
This bath is reserved
for our filthiest guests.

00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:15.870
It's caked with sludge.

00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:18.630
Lin, Sen, first customers are here.

00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:20.630
Right away...

00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:22.880
Shoot, clearly harassment.

00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:26.130
This tub needs an herbal soak.
Get a tag from the foreman.

00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:27.220
A tag?

00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:33.260
-An herbal soak tag.
-Right.

00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:36.230
What's a foreman, Lin?

00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:43.270
Something's coming. I wonder what.

00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:56.120
Some useless scum,
under cover of rainfall...

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:23.020
I can't waste that on you.

00:55:23.110 --> 00:55:24.980
Why good morning!

00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:27.150
Feeling refreshed?

00:55:27.650 --> 00:55:28.860
For Kasuga sama.

00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:31.240
One deluxe sulfur soak.

00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:33.870
No point in standing there. Back to work.

00:55:34.330 --> 00:55:36.120
Scrub with your hands.

00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:37.870
Good morning!

00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:38.870
Your hands, I say.

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:42.380
But... Um... It has to be an herbal soak.

00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:44.130
You sure are dense.

00:55:44.210 --> 00:55:48.380
Oh... A fragrant bath coming up.
Relax and enjoy...

00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:00.190
Hello, foreman here. Yes, ma'am...

00:56:02.350 --> 00:56:03.400
Thank you so much.

00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:04.690
That's not...

00:56:04.770 --> 00:56:06.230
Hey, you, wait.

00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:08.690
<i>-What's the trouble?</i>
-Why, nothing at all...

00:56:09.150 --> 00:56:10.740
We have an intruder.

00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:11.780
<i>Is it human?</i>

00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:14.700
You figure it out. Haku's out today.

00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:17.490
Wow, you got a really good one.

00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:20.040
This goes to Kamaji.

00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:23.370
Water'll be right up,
it's not too busy now.

00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:32.510
Yank on this for hot water.

00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:43.520
You're such a klutz.

00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:45.730
Look at that color!

00:56:45.810 --> 00:56:48.020
That's the dried worm salts.

00:56:48.690 --> 00:56:51.690
With water this murky,
who's gonna see the sludge?

00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:56.570
Yank it again when it's full. It'll stop.

00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:58.700
Go ahead, let go.

00:56:58.790 --> 00:57:00.410
I'll get our breakfast.

00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:01.750
Sure.

00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:26.350
Ouch.

00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:32.900
Um... The bath's not ready yet.

00:57:38.450 --> 00:57:39.830
But, there are so many...

00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:44.460
Wha... They're for me?

00:57:47.790 --> 00:57:50.090
But... I don't need this many.

00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:54.590
No, just one.

00:58:09.810 --> 00:58:10.650
Madam.

00:58:10.730 --> 00:58:12.070
It's a Stink Spirit?

00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:14.280
An Extra Large Stinker at that.

00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:16.030
Headed straight for the bridge!

00:58:16.110 --> 00:58:18.530
Please turn back!

00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:22.540
Please withdraw!
The bath is closed for the night.

00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:25.410
Please withdraw, please.

00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:28.040
Peeeee-ewy...

00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:32.250
Something's fishy.
Didn't seem like a Stink Spirit, to me...

00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:34.800
Well, now that it's here,
better go greet it.

00:58:35.590 --> 00:58:39.140
Just try to get rid of it,
as fast as you can.

00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:42.310
Please retire to your rooms!
So terribly sorry.

00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:43.310
Please hurry.

00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:47.520
Lin and Sen, Yubaba's calling.

00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:48.310
Yes sir.

00:58:48.690 --> 00:58:51.270
Listen, this is your first job.

00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:54.070
You take this customer to the big tub.

00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:55.110
Um...

00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:57.070
One peep out of you and you're coal.

00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:58.200
Got that?

00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:00.240
It has arrived.

00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:12.630
Don't insult the customer.

00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:24.560
Welggum to our bazzs...

00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:29.640
Oh... Money...

00:59:29.730 --> 00:59:32.310
Sen, hurry, take it.

00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:34.020
Yes ma'am.

00:59:41.950 --> 00:59:46.580
Zhow him de bazz.

00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:48.450
Pl... Pleazze.

01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:08.810
Sen!

01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:15.400
Awful...

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:17.360
Our food...

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.570
Open the windows! All of 'em.

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:05.820
What? Just a minute.

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:12.330
Truly filthy.

01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:13.960
This is no laughing matter.

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:15.540
Let's see what she does.

01:01:20.050 --> 01:01:22.840
Ah, she intends to re-fill the tub.

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:25.590
Oh, no, soiling the walls
with those filthy hands.

01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:40.780
Did you give Sen new tags?

01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:42.360
Never, what a waste!

01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:27.320
Oh no! All that precious herbal formula!

01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:55.310
Sen! Sen, where are you?

01:02:55.930 --> 01:02:56.850
Lin!

01:02:56.930 --> 01:02:58.140
You OK?

01:02:58.230 --> 01:03:00.810
I asked Kamaji to give us
all the water he's got!

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:03.440
He's sending the best herbal soak ever.

01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:07.200
Thank you. He's got a thorn stuck in him.

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:08.320
A thorn?

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:09.950
It's in so deep, it won't come out.

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:12.870
Thorn!? She said thorn?

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:16.040
Rally the help downstairs.

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:16.830
Step on it.

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:22.040
Sen and Lin.

01:03:22.130 --> 01:03:24.460
That's no Stink Spirit in there.

01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:28.130
Grab this rope.

01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:29.430
Yes ma'am.

01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:40.810
-Hold on tight!
-Yes ma'am.

01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:44.820
Hustle now,
and get the women to help them.

01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:46.820
I tied it.

01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:51.530
Everyone, all of you! All together now.

01:03:51.610 --> 01:03:54.330
Heave!

01:03:55.030 --> 01:03:56.830
And heave!

01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:59.330
And heave!

01:03:59.410 --> 01:04:01.710
And heave!

01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:10.380
A bicycle.

01:04:11.050 --> 01:04:14.350
As I suspected! Now, pull!

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:17.180
And heave.

01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:51.300
Sen, you OK?

01:05:01.730 --> 01:05:04.980
Well done...

01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:35.760
Gold! It's gold!

01:05:36.090 --> 01:05:38.600
Hands off! That's company property!

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:42.270
Be still. Our guest is still with us.

01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:51.190
Sen, you're in our guest's way.
Get out and open the door.

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:53.690
Open the main gates! He's leaving!

01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:24.640
Sen! You did great! You made us a bundle!

01:06:25.350 --> 01:06:27.980
That River Spirit's famous.

01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:29.650
You can all learn from Sen.

01:06:30.310 --> 01:06:32.690
Sake's on the house, tonight.

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:35.740
Now! Time to hand over
all that gold you picked up.

01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:51.130
Want some? I swiped it.

01:06:51.630 --> 01:06:53.090
Thank you.

01:06:53.170 --> 01:06:55.340
Man, oh, man.

01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:59.430
I didn't see Haku.

01:06:59.510 --> 01:07:01.180
Not Haku again.

01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:04.680
He just disappears sometimes.

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:08.810
They say Yubaba makes him do bad stuff.

01:07:08.890 --> 01:07:09.770
Really...

01:07:09.850 --> 01:07:12.060
-Lights out, Lin
-Right.

01:07:37.590 --> 01:07:40.260
There's a town. Looks like the ocean...

01:07:40.550 --> 01:07:43.350
What did you expect after all that rain?

01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:49.270
Some day, I swear I'll get to that town.
I'm gonna get out of here.

01:08:13.790 --> 01:08:15.340
What's wrong?

01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:46.160
Gold.

01:08:48.990 --> 01:08:52.120
Who are you? You're no customer.

01:08:52.210 --> 01:08:53.790
You're not allowed in there.

01:09:00.510 --> 01:09:03.590
Hey! It's gold, gold! It's for me.

01:09:08.970 --> 01:09:11.230
You can make gold.

01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:17.730
Gimme!

01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:27.660
Who goes there?

01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:31.160
It's way past bedtime.

01:09:34.710 --> 01:09:37.920
Hey boss, I'm hungry.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.300
Starving.

01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:40.460
That voice...

01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:42.170
There, I'll pay you now.

01:09:43.010 --> 01:09:45.680
I'm a customer, I want a bath!

01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:47.300
Wake everyone up.

01:09:52.890 --> 01:09:56.270
Mommy, Daddy,
the River Spirit gave me this cake.

01:09:56.350 --> 01:09:59.360
I'm sure if you eat it,
you'll turn back into people.

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:05.450
Dad, Mom, where are you?

01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:06.910
Dad!

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:19.170
Bad dream.

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:21.920
Lin...

01:10:26.090 --> 01:10:27.760
Where is everybody?

01:10:34.270 --> 01:10:37.060
Wow... it really did turn into an ocean!

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:45.320
I can see where Mom and Dad are from here.

01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:53.450
Kamaji's already lit the fires?
Did I sleep that long?

01:10:56.710 --> 01:10:59.630
The customer's waiting. Hurry it up!

01:10:59.710 --> 01:11:03.750
Serve everything you've got,
even leftovers.

01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:06.760
Sen!

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:08.010
Lin!

01:11:08.090 --> 01:11:10.720
I was just going to wake you up. Look.

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:13.220
Real gold! He gave it to me.

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:15.720
This guest's a real high roller.

01:11:15.810 --> 01:11:18.190
Please, sir, try this.

01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:20.100
Taste the very best.

01:11:23.730 --> 01:11:24.860
Throw us some gold.

01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:26.690
Your blessings.

01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:30.320
I'm starving, bring it all.

01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:36.120
That guest...

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:39.960
Come, Sen, Yubaba's still asleep.
Now's your chance!

01:11:40.330 --> 01:11:42.130
I'm going to see Kamaji.

01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:45.000
I wouldn't go right now.

01:11:45.090 --> 01:11:47.590
He's in a foul mood
'cause they woke him up.

01:11:47.670 --> 01:11:48.590
Let's go back for more, Lin.

01:12:14.530 --> 01:12:18.000
What if I don't recognize my parents?

01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:21.500
I hope Dad hasn't gotten too fat.

01:12:49.690 --> 01:12:51.110
The dragon I saw before!

01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:53.030
It's coming this way.

01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:57.160
What are they? Not birds!

01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:11.670
Fight back, Haku! This way!

01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:12.590
Haku?

01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:14.430
Haku!

01:13:32.610 --> 01:13:34.910
Oh... It's just paper...

01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:05.440
Haku? That is you, right?

01:14:11.610 --> 01:14:14.950
Are you hurt? Those paper birds are gone.

01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:16.240
You're safe, now.

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:31.170
He's going to Yubaba...

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:34.210
Oh, no! He'll die.

01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:46.560
<i>The richest man himself has come</i>

01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:50.810
<i>To grace us with his presence</i>

01:14:52.150 --> 01:14:54.230
Welcome.

01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:57.400
<i>Time to beg for tips</i>
<i>Time to start begging</i>

01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:00.990
<i>Now beg</i>

01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:04.580
-Please, sir!
-Over here.

01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:06.330
Gold springs from his palms.

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:10.500
Toss some this way, sir.

01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:15.840
What are you doing?

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:16.920
I'm going upstairs.

01:15:17.010 --> 01:15:19.050
No, you don't. What's this?

01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:20.840
It's blood!

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:27.020
Move, move. Let our guest through.

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:30.600
Thank you for helping me before.

01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:32.730
Don't just stand there...

01:15:55.130 --> 01:15:56.800
I don't want any. Don't need any.

01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:02.430
I'm busy, please excuse me.

01:16:13.770 --> 01:16:16.570
Quiet! Quiet down.

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:18.940
Back, get back.

01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:21.450
Please forgive her manners.

01:16:21.530 --> 01:16:25.200
After all, the girl is only human
and new here...

01:16:27.490 --> 01:16:30.580
Wipe that smile off your face.
I saw that look.

01:16:30.660 --> 01:16:31.870
Why, I would never...

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:39.130
He ate them!

01:18:06.090 --> 01:18:07.590
Yubaba!

01:19:20.170 --> 01:19:23.170
We're in a fine mess, now.

01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:25.630
Actually, he's a No Face.

01:19:25.710 --> 01:19:27.630
That's right, a No Face.

01:19:27.970 --> 01:19:30.840
Your greed attracted
quite a guest, all right.

01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:34.640
Don't do anything stupid
until I get down there.

01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:38.940
Look, the carpet's a mess.
Get Haku out of here.

01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:41.940
He's no use to me now.

01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:07.510
Sleeping outside of your crib again.

01:20:11.470 --> 01:20:15.760
Oh, I'm sorry,
you were sleeping like such a good baby.

01:20:15.850 --> 01:20:18.680
Baba still has work to do.

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:24.400
Go back to sleep now. Good baby.

01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:54.640
Ouch, let go!

01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:56.640
Oh, thank you for helping me.

01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:00.100
But I'm in a hurry. Please let me go.

01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:02.770
You came here to make me sick.

01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:05.610
Bad germs outside, bad.

01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:10.360
I'm a human.
Maybe you never saw one before.

01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:12.990
You'll get sick out there.

01:21:13.070 --> 01:21:15.120
Stay here and play with me.

01:21:15.530 --> 01:21:16.950
Are you sick?

01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:19.830
I'm in here 'cause I'll get sick outside.

01:21:19.910 --> 01:21:22.460
It's staying in here
that'll make you sick.

01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:26.330
You see, somebody I really care about
got hurt very badly.

01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:29.500
So I've got to go right now.
Please let go of my arm.

01:21:30.050 --> 01:21:31.420
If you go, I'll start crying.

01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:35.010
If I cry, Baba will come and kill you.

01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:36.850
I'll break your little arm.

01:21:36.930 --> 01:21:38.050
That hurts!

01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:40.640
Please, I'll come play with you later.

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:42.390
No, I wanna play now.

01:21:46.690 --> 01:21:48.610
That's blood! Get it! It's blood.

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:01.950
Haku!

01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:04.160
Stop, go away! Scat, scat.

01:22:04.250 --> 01:22:05.290
Haku! It is you, right?

01:22:05.370 --> 01:22:06.880
Hang on.

01:22:07.290 --> 01:22:09.500
Be quiet! Haku!

01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:16.260
Shoo, go away.

01:22:18.970 --> 01:22:20.310
Oh, no.

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:39.120
I'm not afraid of blood.
I'll cry if you don't play.

01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:41.120
Please be a good boy and wait.

01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:44.540
If you don't play with me, I'll cry...

01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:48.000
Please, wait.

01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:51.340
What a racket! Simmer down.

01:22:52.750 --> 01:22:55.550
You're a little butterball, aren't you...

01:23:02.890 --> 01:23:05.180
Guess I'm still a little transparent.

01:23:05.270 --> 01:23:06.060
Baba.

01:23:06.730 --> 01:23:10.860
Oh, dear, can't you even tell me
from your own mother?

01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:22.830
There,
that gives you a little more freedom.

01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:25.160
Let's see now...
What shall we turn you into?

01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:45.220
This is our little secret.

01:23:45.310 --> 01:23:48.060
You tell anyone, I'll rip your mouth out.

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:50.810
Who are you?

01:23:51.270 --> 01:23:53.570
Yubaba's twin sister.

01:23:53.650 --> 01:23:57.490
Thanks to you, I've had a good look
at this place, enjoyed myself.

01:23:57.570 --> 01:23:59.320
Now hand over the dragon.

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:01.950
What do you want with Haku?
He's badly hurt.

01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:05.330
That dragon's a thief, my sister's lackey.

01:24:05.410 --> 01:24:08.580
Stole a precious seal from my house.

01:24:08.660 --> 01:24:11.460
Haku would never! He's so kind.

01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:15.590
All dragons are kind. Kind and stupid.

01:24:15.670 --> 01:24:20.220
Eager to learn my sister's magical ways.

01:24:20.630 --> 01:24:24.470
This boy here will do anything
that greedy woman wants.

01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:26.640
Move away.

01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:29.230
It's too late for him anyway.

01:24:29.310 --> 01:24:32.520
The seal was protected by a charm...

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:34.690
Any who try to steal it must die.

01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:37.150
No, you can't.

01:24:44.660 --> 01:24:46.700
What's gotten into them?

01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:49.450
Hey there, cut it out!
Go back to your room.

01:24:57.300 --> 01:24:59.710
Oh, dear, seems I was careless.

01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:01.050
Haku! Oh, no!

01:25:22.490 --> 01:25:23.660
Haku.

01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:54.850
What on earth is this? Hey! Just wait!

01:25:57.690 --> 01:25:59.110
Haku.

01:26:02.570 --> 01:26:04.200
Does it hurt?

01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:09.910
This is serious.

01:26:11.910 --> 01:26:13.250
Haku, don't give up!

01:26:13.330 --> 01:26:15.080
Oh, no, he's going to die!

01:26:15.580 --> 01:26:18.380
There's something inside him
that's killing him.

01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:19.630
Inside him?

01:26:19.710 --> 01:26:22.960
It's a good spell. Nothing I can do.

01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:26.630
Haku, the River Spirit gave me this.

01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:28.850
Eat it, maybe it'll help.

01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:33.350
Haku, open your mouth.

01:26:33.890 --> 01:26:36.230
Please, Haku, eat it.

01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:39.730
See, it's safe.

01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:42.110
Is it an herbal cake?

01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:45.400
Open. That's a good boy...

01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:50.990
That's it.

01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:52.540
Swallow.

01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:12.260
He spit it out! That's it!

01:27:24.980 --> 01:27:26.190
The seal!

01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:28.200
It got away! There! Over there.

01:27:48.010 --> 01:27:50.590
Gross, gross, Sen! Totally gross.

01:27:54.810 --> 01:27:55.720
Clean.

01:27:55.810 --> 01:27:58.600
Haku took this
from Yubaba's sister, Kamaji.

01:27:58.980 --> 01:28:01.600
From Zeniba? A witch's seal.

01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:04.270
Precious loot, I'd say.

01:28:06.780 --> 01:28:08.740
Oh... I knew it was Haku!

01:28:08.820 --> 01:28:10.410
Look, Kamaji, it's Haku!

01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:15.200
Haku!

01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:19.580
Kamaji! He's not breathing!

01:28:19.660 --> 01:28:23.210
Yes he is, but he's still very ill
from the spell...

01:28:32.510 --> 01:28:35.510
That should calm him some.

01:28:38.060 --> 01:28:43.150
Haku turned up one day,
just like you.

01:28:43.230 --> 01:28:46.270
He said he wanted to learn magic.

01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:48.320
I didn't approve...

01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:51.860
of him becoming
a sorcerer's apprentice...

01:28:52.950 --> 01:28:54.740
I warned him,

01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:56.700
but he wouldn't listen.

01:28:56.780 --> 01:29:00.330
Said he had nowhere left to go.
He signed up to be Yubaba's apprentice.

01:29:00.830 --> 01:29:03.960
As time went by,
he turned increasingly pale,

01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:06.960
and his eyes took on a sharp gleam.

01:29:09.050 --> 01:29:12.970
Kamaji, I'm going to give this back
to Yubaba's sister.

01:29:13.510 --> 01:29:16.890
Give it back, apologize,
and ask her to help Haku.

01:29:16.970 --> 01:29:18.850
Tell me where she lives.

01:29:19.270 --> 01:29:21.600
Go to Zeniba's?

01:29:22.060 --> 01:29:23.980
She's one scary sorceress.

01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:24.850
Please.

01:29:24.940 --> 01:29:29.110
Haku helped me. Now I want to help him.

01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:34.030
You can get there all right...

01:29:34.110 --> 01:29:36.070
But getting back...

01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:38.120
Wait here.

01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:43.870
Let's see now...
It's around here, I think...

01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:47.630
Everyone, I need my shoes
and my clothes, please.

01:29:55.970 --> 01:29:58.970
Sen! I've been looking for you everywhere.

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:02.680
Lin.

01:30:02.770 --> 01:30:05.480
That's Haku. What happened here?

01:30:06.150 --> 01:30:07.150
Who are these guys?

01:30:08.270 --> 01:30:10.530
My new friends.

01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:14.070
Yubaba's tearing the place apart
looking for you.

01:30:14.150 --> 01:30:17.780
The big tipper turned out
to be a horrible monster, No Face.

01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:20.950
Yubaba says you led him here.

01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:25.330
Maybe I did.

01:30:25.710 --> 01:30:27.580
You serious?

01:30:27.670 --> 01:30:29.540
I just thought he was a customer...

01:30:29.630 --> 01:30:32.590
He's already swallowed
three of our people.

01:30:33.010 --> 01:30:36.010
Found it! Here it is, Sen.

01:30:36.380 --> 01:30:38.140
We're busy, gramps.

01:30:38.220 --> 01:30:39.050
You can use this.

01:30:39.140 --> 01:30:40.810
TRAIN TICKETS

01:30:41.180 --> 01:30:44.100
Train tickets.
Where'd you get them?

01:30:44.180 --> 01:30:46.850
I've had them for 40 years.

01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:50.440
Now listen, it's the sixth stop,
called Swamp Bottom.

01:30:50.730 --> 01:30:51.980
Swamp Bottom.

01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:53.900
That's right, it's the sixth stop.

01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.940
The sixth stop.

01:30:55.030 --> 01:30:58.990
Make sure you get it right.
There used to be a return train,

01:30:59.070 --> 01:31:02.700
but these days it's a one-way ride.
Still interested.

01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:06.250
Yup. I'll walk back, along the tracks.

01:31:07.790 --> 01:31:09.580
But what about Yubaba?

01:31:09.670 --> 01:31:11.210
I'll go to her now.

01:31:11.590 --> 01:31:15.510
I promise I'll be back, Haku.
You can't die.

01:31:16.170 --> 01:31:18.090
What's going on here?

01:31:18.380 --> 01:31:20.850
Don't you see? It's called... love...

01:31:28.810 --> 01:31:30.810
It just keeps getting bigger.

01:31:30.900 --> 01:31:32.940
Don't let it swallow me.

01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:33.860
Here she comes.

01:31:41.490 --> 01:31:42.950
Thank goodness, Sen.

01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:45.580
Yubaba can't control him.

01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:52.340
There's no need to get upset.
I'm sure Sen will turn up.

01:31:52.750 --> 01:31:55.000
Where's Sen! I want Sen.

01:31:55.550 --> 01:31:57.220
Go, hurry.

01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:04.510
Yubaba, it's Sen.

01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:06.100
Where were you?

01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:10.560
Sen has come, dear guest.
We'll be right with you.

01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:14.690
What took you so long!
This is a complete disaster.

01:32:14.770 --> 01:32:17.570
Suck up to him and squeeze
all his gold out of him.

01:32:21.570 --> 01:32:23.910
What's that filthy rat?

01:32:25.660 --> 01:32:28.040
Don't you recognize him?

01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:31.120
Of course not, how disgusting.

01:32:31.210 --> 01:32:32.630
Now, in you go.

01:32:34.130 --> 01:32:36.380
Call if you need us.

01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:39.720
Is she all right in there by herself?

01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:41.680
Want to take her place?

01:33:02.150 --> 01:33:05.320
Try this, it's yummy.

01:33:07.450 --> 01:33:11.710
Want some gold?
I'm not giving it to anybody else.

01:33:15.710 --> 01:33:17.500
Come over here, Sen.

01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:21.220
What is it you want? You can tell me.

01:33:21.550 --> 01:33:23.510
Where did you come from?

01:33:23.590 --> 01:33:25.970
There's someplace I have to go right away.

01:33:28.350 --> 01:33:30.850
You should go back where you came from.

01:33:30.930 --> 01:33:33.980
You can't help me with what I want.

01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:38.860
Where's your home?
Don't you have a mom and dad?

01:33:39.690 --> 01:33:42.990
I don't wanna...

01:33:43.950 --> 01:33:47.870
I'm lonely...

01:33:48.530 --> 01:33:50.040
Can't you get back home?

01:33:50.410 --> 01:33:53.960
I want Sen.

01:33:54.580 --> 01:33:55.710
Take the gold.

01:33:56.250 --> 01:33:58.460
-Are you going to eat me?
-Take it.

01:33:58.540 --> 01:33:59.340
Take it.

01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:11.310
If you're going to eat me,
have this first.

01:34:11.930 --> 01:34:15.940
I was saving it for my parents,
but you can have it.

01:34:36.790 --> 01:34:38.170
Sen.

01:34:40.630 --> 01:34:44.800
Girl! What did you feed me?

01:34:59.650 --> 01:35:00.980
Out of my way!

01:35:02.230 --> 01:35:04.150
Not on my premises!

01:35:17.420 --> 01:35:18.830
Over here!

01:35:19.630 --> 01:35:20.960
Here!

01:36:05.710 --> 01:36:07.380
You'll pay for this.

01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:26.900
Sen, over here!

01:36:43.250 --> 01:36:45.540
There he is. Over here!

01:36:45.630 --> 01:36:47.300
Don't call him over.

01:36:51.090 --> 01:36:54.800
He's only bad in the bath house.
He needs to get out of there.

01:36:54.890 --> 01:36:57.140
But take him where?

01:36:57.220 --> 01:36:58.220
I don't know...

01:36:58.310 --> 01:37:02.810
You don't know... He's following us.

01:37:20.330 --> 01:37:21.620
From here, you walk.

01:37:22.540 --> 01:37:24.330
You'll find the station.

01:37:24.420 --> 01:37:25.830
Thank you.

01:37:26.460 --> 01:37:28.340
You better come back.

01:37:33.470 --> 01:37:37.010
I know I called you a klutz!

01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:38.680
I take it back!

01:37:46.810 --> 01:37:50.820
No Face, if you so much as touch
that girl, you'll pay for it.

01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:55.610
There it is.

01:38:07.170 --> 01:38:09.550
Train's coming, here we go.

01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:35.280
I'm riding to Swamp Bottom.

01:38:41.870 --> 01:38:43.540
You want to come, too?

01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:47.040
Him too, please.

01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:28.920
Come here.

01:39:29.540 --> 01:39:31.210
Behave yourself, OK?

01:41:33.370 --> 01:41:34.830
Kamaji.

01:41:37.170 --> 01:41:39.920
Oh, Haku... You're awake.

01:41:40.010 --> 01:41:41.470
Where's Sen?

01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:44.470
What happened? Please tell me.

01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:47.600
Don't you remember anything?

01:41:48.310 --> 01:41:50.560
Just little pieces.

01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:53.560
Chihiro kept calling my name
in the darkness.

01:41:54.060 --> 01:41:57.860
I followed her voice
and woke up lying here...

01:41:58.230 --> 01:42:00.280
Chihiro, huh...

01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:03.110
Her real name's Chihiro.

01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:07.240
Can't beat the power of love...

01:42:10.910 --> 01:42:12.910
This gold hardly covers the damage.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:14.120
That fool, Sen.

01:42:14.210 --> 01:42:17.040
She just cost me a fortune.

01:42:17.540 --> 01:42:21.340
But, Sen did save us, after all.

01:42:21.420 --> 01:42:22.550
Silence!

01:42:22.630 --> 01:42:25.090
She started it all,

01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:27.510
and now she's run away.

01:42:27.590 --> 01:42:30.260
Even abandoned her own parents!

01:42:30.930 --> 01:42:34.770
They must be fine fat pigs by now.
Turn them into bacon or ham.

01:42:35.310 --> 01:42:36.770
Please wait.

01:42:37.900 --> 01:42:39.060
Master Haku.

01:42:39.150 --> 01:42:41.400
What, you still alive?

01:42:43.780 --> 01:42:47.160
You still can't see
that you've lost something precious.

01:42:47.610 --> 01:42:50.490
Don't get fresh with me.

01:42:50.580 --> 01:42:53.040
Since when do you talk that way?

01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:46.670
Baby...

01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:54.310
Baby!

01:43:54.390 --> 01:43:55.390
It's just sand.

01:43:55.470 --> 01:43:58.350
Baby!

01:43:58.810 --> 01:44:02.650
Where are you, baby?

01:44:02.980 --> 01:44:05.650
Come out, please.

01:44:18.580 --> 01:44:21.670
You!

01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:25.960
Tell me!

01:44:28.380 --> 01:44:32.550
Where did you hide my baby?

01:44:33.010 --> 01:44:34.850
He's with Zeniba.

01:44:34.930 --> 01:44:36.930
Zeniba?

01:44:57.910 --> 01:45:01.710
I get it, that evil witch.

01:45:01.790 --> 01:45:04.460
So she thinks she's beaten me.

01:45:06.090 --> 01:45:08.340
So, what's your plan?

01:45:08.710 --> 01:45:10.970
I'll bring baby back.

01:45:11.050 --> 01:45:15.350
But in exchange, return Sen
and her parents to the human world.

01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:17.850
And what becomes of you?

01:45:17.930 --> 01:45:21.850
Let's say I tear you to pieces
after sending them back!

01:46:08.650 --> 01:46:10.780
I think this is the right stop...

01:46:11.610 --> 01:46:12.940
Let's go.

01:46:39.810 --> 01:46:41.680
You can ride on my shoulder.

01:48:00.260 --> 01:48:01.930
Come in.

01:48:06.730 --> 01:48:08.560
Excuse us.

01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:12.940
Well, hurry up and come in, then.

01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:14.730
C'mon.

01:48:18.030 --> 01:48:19.860
So you all made it.

01:48:19.950 --> 01:48:20.530
Um...

01:48:21.070 --> 01:48:22.200
Have a seat.

01:48:22.530 --> 01:48:24.950
I'll make you some tea.

01:48:30.580 --> 01:48:34.750
Zeniba, Haku stole this from you.
I brought it back.

01:48:38.090 --> 01:48:40.470
Do you know what this is?

01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:43.890
No, but I know it's very precious.

01:48:43.970 --> 01:48:47.600
I'm here to apologize for Haku. I'm sorry.

01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:52.520
-You felt fine while you held it?
-What?

01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:55.320
What's this? The spell is gone.

01:48:56.570 --> 01:48:59.740
I'm sorry. I stepped on that strange bug

01:48:59.820 --> 01:49:01.570
that was on the seal and squashed it.

01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:04.160
Squashed it?

01:49:06.410 --> 01:49:09.750
You know,
my sister snuck that bug into the dragon,

01:49:09.830 --> 01:49:12.670
so she could control her apprentice.

01:49:12.750 --> 01:49:14.920
Squashed it...

01:49:18.090 --> 01:49:19.840
You sit too.

01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:22.680
You're No Face, aren't you? You sit, too.

01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:27.560
Oh, um, please turn
them back into themselves.

01:49:27.640 --> 01:49:30.640
Why my dears, the spell's long broken.

01:49:30.730 --> 01:49:33.100
You can turn yourselves back.

01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:44.280
My sister and I are two halves of a whole,
but we really don't get along.

01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:46.990
You've seen what bad taste she has.

01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:50.160
Sorceress twins
are just a recipe for trouble.

01:49:54.170 --> 01:49:58.710
I'd like to help you, dear,
but there's nothing I can do.

01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:00.710
It's one of our rules here.

01:50:01.300 --> 01:50:04.300
You've got to take care of your parents
and that dragon boyfriend of yours,

01:50:04.380 --> 01:50:06.050
on your own.

01:50:06.140 --> 01:50:08.970
But, um, can't you even give me a hint?

01:50:09.430 --> 01:50:13.020
I feel like Haku and I met
a long time ago.

01:50:13.100 --> 01:50:14.980
In that case, it's easy.

01:50:15.310 --> 01:50:18.230
Nothing that happens, is ever forgotten,

01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:20.280
even if you can't remember it.

01:50:21.610 --> 01:50:24.950
It's already late.
Why don't you stay the night?

01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:28.160
You boys give me a hand.

01:50:34.290 --> 01:50:36.290
Keep at it.

01:50:39.290 --> 01:50:43.510
That's right, you're terrific.
You're a big help...

01:50:44.340 --> 01:50:47.640
A magic one won't do the trick.

01:50:48.970 --> 01:50:53.350
Pull it through there... And do it again.

01:50:53.430 --> 01:50:56.190
I really have to go home, Granny.

01:50:56.600 --> 01:51:00.320
Haku could die
while I'm just sitting here...

01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:03.990
They might eat my mom and dad.

01:51:06.150 --> 01:51:08.370
Just wait a little longer.

01:51:08.990 --> 01:51:10.490
There we are.

01:51:11.370 --> 01:51:13.660
Use it to tie back your hair.

01:51:17.790 --> 01:51:19.380
It's so pretty.

01:51:19.670 --> 01:51:24.510
It'll protect you.
I made it from the thread they spun.

01:51:24.840 --> 01:51:26.420
Thank you.

01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:39.560
What good timing.
We've got another guest, let him in.

01:51:39.650 --> 01:51:40.730
Sure.

01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:55.080
Haku!

01:51:58.370 --> 01:51:59.960
Thank goodness.

01:52:00.250 --> 01:52:02.750
Aren't you hurt? You sure you're OK?

01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:03.960
Thank goodness.

01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:08.130
Good timing, I'd say.

01:52:08.970 --> 01:52:11.260
Look, Granny, Haku's alive.

01:52:11.760 --> 01:52:15.970
Haku, I no longer blame you
for what you did.

01:52:16.060 --> 01:52:19.350
Just be sure you protect the girl.

01:52:19.770 --> 01:52:22.730
OK, boys, time to go home.

01:52:22.810 --> 01:52:24.940
Come back soon.

01:52:25.610 --> 01:52:29.990
You, stick around and be my helper.

01:52:32.450 --> 01:52:33.370
Granny!

01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:36.240
Thank you, I'm going now.

01:52:36.330 --> 01:52:39.460
I'm sure you can manage everything.

01:52:39.540 --> 01:52:42.830
My real name is Chihiro.

01:52:42.920 --> 01:52:45.420
Chihiro... What a nice name.

01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:48.260
-Take good care of it, it's yours.
-I will!

01:52:48.340 --> 01:52:50.130
-Off you go.
-Yes.

01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:54.930
Thank you, granny. Good bye.

01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:45.730
Listen, Haku.

01:53:45.810 --> 01:53:49.360
I don't remember it, but my mom told me...

01:53:49.780 --> 01:53:53.360
Once, when I was little,
I fell into a river.

01:53:53.860 --> 01:53:57.530
She said they'd drained it
and built things on top.

01:53:57.870 --> 01:54:00.040
But I've just remembered.

01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:02.830
The river was called...

01:54:03.210 --> 01:54:06.460
Its name was the Kohaku River.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:10.210
Your real name is Kohaku.

01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:33.110
Chihiro, thank you.

01:54:33.190 --> 01:54:36.360
My real name is Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi.

01:54:36.910 --> 01:54:37.950
Nigihayami?

01:54:38.030 --> 01:54:40.290
Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi.

01:54:40.370 --> 01:54:42.870
What a name!
Sounds like a guardian spirit.

01:54:43.250 --> 01:54:47.710
I also remember
how you fell into me as a child.

01:54:47.790 --> 01:54:49.460
You were chasing your shoe.

01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:54.300
Yes, you carried me
to shallow water, Kohaku.

01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:56.130
I'm so grateful...

01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:30.670
They're back!

01:55:43.970 --> 01:55:46.770
You brought Baby back with you, right?

01:55:49.270 --> 01:55:50.190
Baba.

01:55:50.270 --> 01:55:54.730
You're not hurt?
What a terrible time you had.

01:55:56.110 --> 01:55:59.030
Baby, you're standing all by yourself?
When...

01:55:59.660 --> 01:56:01.950
Yubaba, you promised.

01:56:02.030 --> 01:56:04.790
Please return Chihiro's family
to the human world.

01:56:05.330 --> 01:56:07.870
Not so fast.

01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:10.960
This world has rules, you know.

01:56:11.670 --> 01:56:12.880
Shut up!

01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:15.510
Baba, don't be so mean. Just do it.

01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:18.380
Baby had such a good time.

01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:21.720
But, a rule's a rule.

01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:24.060
Otherwise I can't break the spell.

01:56:24.350 --> 01:56:27.430
If you make Sen cry,
I won't like you anymore, Baba.

01:56:27.980 --> 01:56:29.140
Why that's--

01:56:29.230 --> 01:56:30.600
Granny.

01:56:30.690 --> 01:56:31.940
Granny?

01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:34.400
I'm coming to you.

01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:48.160
Haku told me all about the rule.

01:56:48.250 --> 01:56:50.080
At least you've got guts.

01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:53.460
Here's your contract. Come over here.

01:56:53.540 --> 01:56:56.000
I won't be a minute, Baby.

01:56:56.710 --> 01:56:58.050
Don't worry.

01:57:02.510 --> 01:57:06.350
See if you can guess
which of them are yours.

01:57:15.690 --> 01:57:17.190
You only get one guess.

01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:19.820
Get it right, and you're all free.

01:57:31.750 --> 01:57:35.330
Granny, this is no good.
My parents aren't here.

01:57:35.710 --> 01:57:39.090
Not here? That's your answer?

01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:41.670
Yes.

01:57:44.550 --> 01:57:47.510
Bingo!

01:57:47.850 --> 01:57:50.390
Thatta girl! Right on!

01:57:54.270 --> 01:57:55.650
Thank you, everyone.

01:57:55.730 --> 01:57:58.980
Go! You win. Just get out of here.

01:57:59.440 --> 01:58:01.400
Thank you for everything.

01:58:02.070 --> 01:58:03.360
Good bye.

01:58:04.110 --> 01:58:05.240
Thank you.

01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:06.370
Come and see us.

01:58:06.740 --> 01:58:08.410
-Haku...
-Let's go.

01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:11.700
-Where are Mom and Dad?
-They've gone on ahead.

01:58:19.300 --> 01:58:20.670
There's no water.

01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:22.260
I can't go any farther.

01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:25.130
Go back the way you came, Chihiro.

01:58:25.220 --> 01:58:28.140
But don't ever look back.
Not until you're out of the tunnel.

01:58:28.350 --> 01:58:30.520
What about you, Haku?

01:58:31.390 --> 01:58:33.850
I'll speak to Yubaba.
Quit my apprenticeship.

01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:36.400
I'm fine, now that I have my name back.

01:58:36.980 --> 01:58:38.860
I'll go back to my world, too.

01:58:38.940 --> 01:58:41.320
-Can we meet again?
-I'm sure.

01:58:41.400 --> 01:58:43.030
-Promise?
-Promise.

01:58:43.110 --> 01:58:45.660
Now go, and don't look back.

01:59:08.340 --> 01:59:09.890
Chihiro.

01:59:10.300 --> 01:59:12.890
Where have you been? Hurry up.

01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:18.310
Mom! Dad!

01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:20.190
You can't just run off like that.

01:59:20.270 --> 01:59:21.610
Away we go.

01:59:22.020 --> 01:59:24.240
Mom, are you sure you're OK?

01:59:24.320 --> 01:59:28.570
What?
I'm sure the moving van's there by now.

01:59:37.960 --> 01:59:40.210
Hurry along, Chihiro.

01:59:48.890 --> 01:59:50.680
Watch your step.

01:59:50.760 --> 01:59:54.060
You'll make me trip, Chihiro,
clinging like that.

02:00:06.320 --> 02:00:07.820
The end of the tunnel.

02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:09.450
Hey...

02:00:09.740 --> 02:00:11.070
What is it?

02:00:11.910 --> 02:00:13.700
Will you look at that...

02:00:14.910 --> 02:00:17.330
It's all dusty inside, too.

02:00:17.410 --> 02:00:18.920
-Some kind of joke?
-You think?

02:00:19.670 --> 02:00:22.170
I told you not to stop here.

02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:30.220
OK, all clear.

02:00:31.430 --> 02:00:33.720
We're off, Chihiro.

02:00:33.800 --> 02:00:36.600
Hurry up, Chihiro.

02:04:30.420 --> 02:04:31.460
THE END

02:04:31.540 --> 02:04:33.130
