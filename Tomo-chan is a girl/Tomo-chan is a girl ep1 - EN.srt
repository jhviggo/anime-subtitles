1
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,840
I love you, Jun!

2
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:31,870
Can I get your response now?

3
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,310
Right after I started high school,

4
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,260
I made a confession.

5
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,730
It was, without question,
a confession of love!

6
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,450
You're just telling me this now, Tomo?

7
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,070
But...

8
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,670
I love you too, best bud!

9
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,230
Y-Yeah...

10
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,200
This dude doesn't even see me as a girl!

11
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,950
But I, Aizawa Tomo...

12
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,880
am a girl!

13
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:24,020
I Want to Be Seen as a Girl!

14
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,560
"I Want to Be Seen as a Girl!"

15
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,940
I'm heading out.

16
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,650
Aizawa

17
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,320
Heya, Tomo.

18
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,030
Hey...

19
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,110
This guy, Kubota Junichiro,
lives next door to me,

20
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:43,160
so we've hung out together
a lot since we were little.

21
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,040
We went to different elementary schools,

22
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,460
but in middle school...

23
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,460
We can finally walk home together!

24
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,670
You know...

25
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,470
You're getting a little too
crazy with that skirt!

26
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,220
What kind of new start are you making?

27
00:01:59,220 --> 00:01:59,840
Huh?!

28
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,510
That was when I first realized

29
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,060
that Jun thought of me as a guy!

30
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,890
We're gonna miss the bus.

31
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,230
Let's move!

32
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,650
What's up?

33
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,320
This little...

34
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:20,740
What did I do?

35
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,780
Hmph!

36
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,490
By the way, I do karate.

37
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,740
Morning!

38
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,250
Hey.

39
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,960
Uenomizu High School

40
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,670
That stupid Jun!

41
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,630
Is he gonna treat me like a guy forever?

42
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,550
You gotta say something
to him for me, Misuzu!

43
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,100
Listen, Tomo...

44
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,100
I'm saying this as someone who's been
a friend to both of you for years.

45
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,100
Frankly, you're getting what you deserve.

46
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:50,980
Huh?

47
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,190
You only ever play games that boys play.

48
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,190
In middle school, you even fought
with kids from other schools.

49
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,820
And while I'm at it...

50
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,110
Even in kindergarten, whenever I asked
you to play house or dolls,

51
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,990
you never once played with me.

52
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,990
S-Sorry...

53
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,750
At this point, you might as
well just become a boy.

54
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,250
What do you say?

55
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,000
Don't ask me that!

56
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:19,130
What the heck? You're gonna
treat me like a guy, too?

57
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,090
Honestly, I'd like to, but...

58
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:25,390
Unlike Junichiro, I've seen certain things...

59
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,810
with a woman's eyes.

60
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,480
Anyway, your first problem
is the way you talk.

61
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,320
Yeah, but I can't just start
talkin' girly outta nowhere.

62
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,860
For starters, why not try
softening your tone a bit?

63
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,280
Try being more polite and less blunt.

64
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,330
Buying lunch from the school store?
What're you getting?

65
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,040
D-Do you mean me?

66
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,750
Gee, I don't know... Let me think...

67
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,090
Why are you talking like that?
You sound like an old man!

68
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,380
Old man...

69
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,670
Old man?!

70
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,590
What the hell is your problem?!

71
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,930
Huh?! What's your problem?!

72
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,180
Bring it!

73
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,260
Fine by me!

74
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,690
Whoa, wait! Time out!

75
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,480
Didn't you just tell me to bring it?!

76
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,070
I said knock it off!

77
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,110
I'm home.

78
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,370
Hey! Tomo!

79
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,450
What happened to your face?!

80
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,160
Ugh!

81
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,410
Got in a fight with Jun.

82
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,870
Jun-bo?!

83
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,090
You didn't lose to him, did you?!

84
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,460
Like I could win!

85
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,300
Don't be a wuss! You call yourself
the heir to the Aizawa style?!

86
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,220
Don't be crazy!

87
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,050
You've been teaching him karate too, Dad!

88
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,350
First of all, I'm a girl!

89
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,560
What'd you say?! Come to the dojo right now!

90
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,100
I'm gonna beat some guts into you!

91
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,150
Shut up, old man!

92
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:03,030
This is all because of the
stupid way you taught me!

93
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,240
All of it!

94
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,410
What are you talking about?!

95
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:12,750
C'mon, Tomo, I said I was
sorry about yesterday.

96
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,460
You're the one who hit me, anyway.

97
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,000
Just look at my face!

98
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,920
In fact, I feel like you've
been hitting me a lot lately.

99
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,050
Hey, c'mon! Talk to me already!

100
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,760
That is exactly why!

101
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,220
To be honest, I still don't really get it...

102
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,270
But I apologize, so don't be mad, okay?

103
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,980
Life's boring when you're not around.

104
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:44,230
I can't stand having you ignore
me for another second.

105
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:48,490
He's always like this
the day after we fight.

106
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,910
What is he trying to do to me?

107
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,950
F-Fine. I won't ignore you.

108
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,750
Really?!

109
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,670
You really are the best friend
I could ask for, Tomo!

110
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,960
Yeah, thanks.

111
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,920
He seriously doesn't get it!

112
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,720
You know, Tomo...

113
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,140
You and Junichiro always
come to school together,

114
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,810
and you're together throughout
the school day too, aren't you?

115
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,270
I guess so.

116
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,940
So why am I the one you
spend your lunch break with?

117
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,360
Well, I mean...

118
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,150
When a girl and a guy eat lunch
together, doesn't it look like...

119
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,900
they're dating or something?

120
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,320
Do you hear yourself?

121
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:31,200
But you'd rather eat lunch with him, right?

122
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,950
Huh?

123
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,120
Misuzu?

124
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,790
Leave it to me.

125
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,870
W-Wait, wait! What are you gonna do?!

126
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,790
The three of us can just eat together.

127
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,090
Not that! Anything but that!

128
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,670
You don't mind, do you, Junichiro?

129
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,510
What are you after, Gundo?

130
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,100
Why do I have to eat with you?

131
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,850
This isn't what I want, either.

132
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,350
This is why I didn't want to do this!

133
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,600
These two hate each other's guts!

134
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,860
Hey, that fried chicken looks good.

135
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,320
Here, you can have a piece.

136
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,610
Mm, that's good!

137
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:15,620
What do I do with these chopsticks now?!

138
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,540
Yo, Kubojun.

139
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,080
Hey, Tanabe.

140
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,630
Be honest. How far have you
gotten with Aizawa-san?

141
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,840
What are you talking about?

142
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,210
Don't play dumb!

143
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:33,050
What else could I mean but that intense
sport guys and girls do together?!

144
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,430
Intense sport guys and girls do together?

145
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,520
We've been doing that since we were kids.

146
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,480
Huh?!

147
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,230
For real?!

148
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,150
She does look like she has
a p-pretty amazing body!

149
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:51,650
Tomo's got good feet.
Good at using them, too.

150
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:52,570
Her feet?!

151
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,160
That's hardcore, man!

152
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:02,920
Junichiro was telling some guy that you and
he do an intense co-ed sport together.

153
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,790
Intense co-ed sport?

154
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,420
Oh, yeah, we do.

155
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,460
Not that sport.

156
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,010
Jun, you asshole!

157
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,720
Huh? Where'd that come from?

158
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,060
Whoa... Wait a...

159
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,190
Tanabe-kun, do you have a moment?

160
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:31,030
Gundo-san? Sure! No problem!

161
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,030
Huh? I misunderstood?

162
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,160
Yes. Those two aren't dating.

163
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,830
Junichiro doesn't even see Tomo as a girl.

164
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:40,490
Huh?!

165
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,870
Even though she's so... awesome?

166
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,620
I agree with you, but you're pure scum.

167
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:50,210
Anyway, I get it now. I didn't know
their relationship was so interesting.

168
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,800
Interesting?

169
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:56,090
There's no way both of
them feel nothing at all.

170
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,970
How can I give them a push?

171
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,050
Don't.

172
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,310
Oh, sorry.

173
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,310
You don't want anyone butting in
on your friends' love story, huh?

174
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,900
You've only known Junichiro since
starting high school, right?

175
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,480
Huh? Yeah...

176
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,230
Then remember this.

177
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,780
I'm the only one who's allowed
to play with those two.

178
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,820
P-Play?!

179
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,340
Oh, you forgot your umbrella, too?

180
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,170
Gundo...

181
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,210
I have one coming for me.

182
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,130
I have one coming for me, too.

183
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,090
Hey!

184
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,600
Does that mean it's a contest?

185
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,810
It does indeed.

186
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,350
Why are you beside me,
anyway? Go over there!

187
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,440
You really hate me, don't you?

188
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,310
The three of us used to play
together all the time, though.

189
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,400
Why did things turn out like this?

190
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:57,820
Yeah, the three of us did get up
to a lot of mischief together.

191
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,870
All the pranks you came
up with were so extreme.

192
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,950
But I never understood why...

193
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,040
Whenever the grown-ups yelled at us,

194
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,920
you were never around.

195
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,710
Wasn't I?

196
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,710
Why didn't you join any clubs?

197
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,510
You like sports, don't you?

198
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:19,640
I do karate at Tomo's family's dojo.

199
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:24,310
Besides, there's no point if boys' clubs
and girls' clubs are separate.

200
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:27,350
If I'm not in it with Tomo,
it wouldn't be any fun.

201
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,350
Seriously, what is your deal?

202
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,310
What deal?

203
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,070
If Tomo were to get a boyfriend...

204
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:34,860
Huh?

205
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,820
What would happen to you?

206
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,200
Have you ever imagined it?

207
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,490
Tomo cozying up to some guy who
isn't you, unbeknownst to you...

208
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,830
Then, with a red face, she says,

209
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,790
"There's no one else in
this world that I lo—"

210
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,180
Huh? What're you guys doing?

211
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,640
We both forgot our umbrellas.

212
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,600
Huh?

213
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,140
Just leave her and walk home with me.

214
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:09,890
Huh?!

215
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,980
Let's walk home together!

216
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,520
Why did you come to me?

217
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,610
I can't share an umbrella with him!

218
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,280
That's what I'm telling you to do.

219
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,990
Huh?! But...

220
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,530
Don't ask questions. Just go.

221
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,710
C'mon, get closer to me.

222
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,090
I-I'm fine right here.

223
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,420
No, you're not. You're getting wet.

224
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,090
I just came from practice,
so I smell sweaty.

225
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,970
That's what you're worried about?

226
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,730
You don't smell bad at all.

227
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,270
You idiot! Don't sniff me!

228
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,230
In fact, you smell kinda nice...

229
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,280
Hey! Tomo?!

230
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,080
Hey, Misuzu-chan!

231
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,830
"Misuzu-chan"?

232
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,620
Did you forget your umbrella?

233
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,830
Wanna get under mine?

234
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:16,590
You're sure?

235
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,050
Yeah, totally!

236
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,630
Just me alone, though?

237
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,220
Of course!

238
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,760
Thanks. You're pretty nice.

239
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,820
What the heck were you thinking?

240
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,230
Now you're soaking...

241
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,990
wet...

242
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,780
Huh? What... Jun?!

243
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,960
Wh-What the heck?

244
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,130
I seriously don't get him.

245
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,970
A Terrifying Challenge

246
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,760
"A Terrifying Challenge."

247
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,480
Aizawa-san is so amazing.

248
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,780
She's sharp, light on her feet, and...

249
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,820
stronger than anyone else!

250
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,570
My goddess has descended
into the karate club!

251
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,960
I'm sorry, Misaki-senpai!

252
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,620
I got all heated without realizing it...

253
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,470
You're still as strong as ever, huh?

254
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,220
I'm so sorry!

255
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,840
Don't worry about it.

256
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,010
Anyway, are you used to the boys' club now?

257
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,470
It must be tough being the only girl here.

258
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,060
Nah, I'm fine!

259
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:59,060
All the other students at my family's
dojo are guys, too, so I'm used to it.

260
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,730
If I'm being honest, I wish I could've had
this much fun with other girls, but...

261
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:07,910
Yeah, I bet. If you want to go back,
I can talk to someone for you.

262
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,410
I can't go back.

263
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,450
In the first match I got into to
test the new students' skills...

264
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,660
I got... a little carried away.

265
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,380
And after that, nobody
would practice with me.

266
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:24,590
I can see it. Even in the boys' club,
she's untouchable.

267
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,260
Boys' Karate Club

268
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,260
Girls' Karate Club

269
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,260
I joined the girls' club for
a change of surroundings...

270
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,680
And before I knew it, I was
surrounded by guys again.

271
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,970
Maybe I'm just a failure as a girl...

272
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,600
Th-That's not true!

273
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,230
I think... you're a very charming girl.

274
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:44,230
At least, that's how I see you.

275
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,190
Huh?!

276
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,160
It's the first time a guy ever
said something like that to me!

277
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:54,160
Please tell me, Senpai!
What about me seems girly?!

278
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,370
What should I put more emphasis on?!

279
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:02,420
Senpai, you've found my
womanly charm, right?!

280
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,130
Huh?!

281
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,800
S-S-Sorry! I wasn't looking!
I didn't find anything!

282
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,170
Nothing?!

283
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,170
I knew it...

284
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,680
N-Not that! That's not what I meant!

285
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,180
You have all kinds of charms!

286
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:19,560
But I don't think you should try
to emphasize just one thing.

287
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:23,560
I wouldn't want you to change like that.

288
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,900
You're plenty charming
just the way you are,

289
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,450
so I think you can have more
confidence in who you are now.

290
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,830
Today's the day we talk to Misaki-senpai!

291
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,340
Like, here he comes!

292
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,880
Hey, Senpai!

293
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,550
Thanks for your help today.

294
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,260
Like, who the heck is that?

295
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,770
He's pretty hot, too, though.

296
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:00,850
Wait, no! "He's" totally not!

297
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,560
She's wearing, like, a skirt,

298
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,770
and her boobs are, like, huge!

299
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,770
Like hell we're gonna let this happen!

300
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,860
What?

301
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,990
I hear Tomo has a friend
in the karate club.

302
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:19,120
Isn't that normal?
What are you smirking about?

303
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,790
A guy friend.

304
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,290
What's wrong? That's quite
the face you're making.

305
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,470
Oh, crap. I forgot my English textbook.

306
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,100
Jun, let me look at yours.

307
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:39,890
Sure.

308
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,350
Hey, Tomo...

309
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,980
I hear you made a friend
in the karate club.

310
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,560
You mean Misaki-senpai?

311
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,150
Misaki? And who is that?

312
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,820
The captain of the club.

313
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,740
Here's a pic.

314
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,320
Oh, it's a girl.

315
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:02,410
Are there any girls you're
closer to than Gundo?

316
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,500
Nope. Why?

317
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,630
I figured. I hate the thought of it, but...

318
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,340
How would you feel if she got a boyfriend?

319
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:16,890
If she got so wrapped up in him
that she stopped talking to you?

320
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,930
I can't even imagine
Misuzu being like that.

321
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,810
But... I guess...

322
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:28,060
I couldn't complain about it,
but I'd be a little lonely.

323
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,270
Right?!

324
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,440
Exactly! That's exactly it!

325
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,740
What are you talking about?

326
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,740
You're Aizawa-san from Class A, right?

327
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,710
I'm Mifune from Class B.

328
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,370
And, like, I'm Ogawa, also from Class B.

329
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:51,250
We wanna talk to you about
something. Meet us after school.

330
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,380
Like, behind the gym!

331
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:59,220
Doesn't sound like you're hoping
to become friends with me.

332
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,350
I dunno what you're up to,

333
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:06,190
but I don't get into half-assed fights.

334
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,690
Are you really ready for me?

335
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:09,230
Huh?

336
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,020
Figh...

337
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,190
I asked you if you're ready for me!

338
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,240
What the heck's her deal?!

339
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,200
She's, like, scary as hell!

340
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,410
You want to know about Aizawa-san?

341
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,080
Aizawa-san s-scares me!

342
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,790
I was matched up with her
in the karate club,

343
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:28,370
and her strength is seriously not human!

344
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:30,790
She moved to the boys' club
and still hasn't lost a match!

345
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,300
You're talking about a
fight with Aizawa-san?

346
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,260
I-I'd die if I fought with her!

347
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:39,090
Die? Am I... gonna die?

348
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,180
We gotta go apologize, like, right now!

349
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,640
These two girls I don't know picked
a fight with me outta nowhere.

350
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:50,270
I've never had an actual
throw-down with a girl before.

351
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,810
A throw-down?

352
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:54,780
You're not planning to
fistfight girls, are you?

353
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,820
C'mon, I'm not that ruthless!

354
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,530
I'll go easy on 'em.

355
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:03,370
High school girls don't
communicate with their fists.

356
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,370
I know that! But I'm not gonna make
nice with girls who pick fights!

357
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,670
I'm gonna take the initiative
and settle the score right—

358
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:10,830
You don't get it.

359
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:15,840
I think they just want to
verbally quarrel with you.

360
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,920
Verbally?

361
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,050
Yes. So you can't just come out swinging.

362
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:23,970
If you want to make counterarguments
or corrections, use your words.

363
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:24,680
Got it?

364
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,430
B-But...

365
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,890
No buts.

366
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,940
You really are frightening, you know that?

367
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,640
That said...

368
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:35,230
If they say anything too out of line, tell me.

369
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:38,360
I'll crush them socially.

370
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:42,110
I'd say you're a lot more
frightening than me.

371
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,080
Well? What is it you wanna say to me?

372
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,710
I-It's not that big a deal, really...

373
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,290
So for now...

374
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,050
Could you drop the fighting stance, at least?

375
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,380
Depends on what you say.

376
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,800
Carefully... Choose your words,
like, carefully!

377
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,930
I wanna go home right now!

378
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:11,440
S-See, there's... well... this guy we like...

379
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,150
And what's that got to do with me?

380
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,650
Well...

381
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,980
The guy we like is Misaki-senpai!

382
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,530
And we saw you being all
chummy with him, so...

383
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,870
So that's what this was about?

384
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:28,450
Huh?

385
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,500
You're saying...

386
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:36,090
You came to me for love advice
'cause I know Senpai?!

387
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,590
You should've said so from the start!

388
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,260
Huh?! Like, how did this happen?!

389
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,550
And why does she sound so happy?!

390
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:47,930
I never thought my little dream of giving
someone love advice would come true!

391
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:51,890
A girl who can be relied on in matters
of love is truly a girl among girls!

392
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,980
You want to get closer to Senpai, right?

393
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,150
So the first thing you gotta
do is be my friends!

394
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,490
If you're willing to accept
my help, I'm here.

395
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,200
S-Sure...

396
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,790
Why do I feel so reassured?

397
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:13,250
She's, like, so reliable somehow...

398
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:22,300
Man! I never thought I'd end
up giving love advice!

399
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,880
Feels like I'm totally
one of the girls now!

400
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,260
Maybe I actually have a
ton of feminine appeal?

401
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,600
I don't know about that.

402
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,850
Hey, Tomo.

403
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:39,860
Do you know what people called you
behind your back in middle school?

404
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,440
Huh? No idea.

405
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,400
The Natural Lady-Killer.

406
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:46,530
What the heck? I've never killed anyone.

407
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:51,950
Tomo! Let's hit up the school store!

408
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:54,080
Wait... Hang on, Jun!

409
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,460
All right! What do you wanna eat?

410
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,080
I don't...

411
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:59,210
She actually is a girl.

412
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,290
Totally a girl.

413
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:03,050
Seriously, he's so...

414
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:09,090
Just start treating me like a girl already!
