00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:16,030
When I throw a jab or a straight,
it always lands

2
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:21,160
But when I'm aiming for your heart,
I miss every time

3
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,500
Parallel, zigzagging, awkward, incoherent

4
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,010
When you look my way and move closer to me

5
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:36,760
I know it doesn't mean the same thing for you

6
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,810
But I wish we could stay like this forever

7
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:47,940
My changing feelings are driving me crazy

8
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,240
The moment you turn to face me,
take that! Telepathy

9
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:58,700
If only we could feel the same thing

10
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,580
I want to kick this pesky subtlety away

11
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:09,590
I want to know everything,
I want to know everything

12
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,130
I can't fool you forever

13
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,760
I can't keep this hidden

14
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,510
I want to shout out my secret, AHHH

15
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,970
Take that! Telepathy

16
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,440

Huh?

23
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,660
You wanted these, right?

24
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,080
Thanks! But why?

25
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,500
Today's your birthday, remember?

26
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,960
Oh, yeah! I guess it is!

27
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,800
I'm older than you now!

28
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,840
Show me some respect!

29
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,510

What are those?

35
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,730
Jun just gave them to me!

36
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,360
My birthday present! Pretty cool, right?

37
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,200
So yeah, I went ahead and turned 16 first!

38
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,120
Indeed. Happy birthday.

Wow, really? Thanks!

46
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,720
Oh, it's pretty heavy. What's in it?

47
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,220
Reference books.

48
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,970

I'm so glad you like it.

Happy birthday, dear—

Wait!

00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,490
Wait, wait, wait!

53
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,420
Um... What is this?

54
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,540
It's gold.

55
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,000
I have a bigger one at home,

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
but it was too heavy to carry to school.

57
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,670
I'm happy, but... this is
definitely too much.

58
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,890
Would you be interested in putting
that wealth of yours to use?

59
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:25,800
Misuzu-chan!

60
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,350
No!

61
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,930
Don't team up with her!

62
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,730
Tomo, want to come over
to my house this weekend?

63
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,730
We're gonna give you a big transformation!

64
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,990
Saturday

65
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,990
What's all this about transforming me?

66
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,080
You're gonna dress me up like you
did the day I went out with Jun?

67
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,660
First, you're putting on this skirt.

68
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,620
A skirt?!

69
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,620
Put this on, too.

70
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,420
A hairpiece?!

71
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,500
A wig.

72
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:58,130
So... what does all this mean?

73
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:02,930
It means we're using this opportunity
to make you as feminine as possible.

74
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,340
So I'm gonna dress like a girl?!

75
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,720
You say that as if you're not a girl.

76
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,270
Well? Aren't you done yet?

77
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,150
We're still on the basics.

78
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,530
It's kind of a weird feeling, though.

79
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,570
What is?

80
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,740
Me wearing makeup, I mean.

81
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,030
If I did it right,

82
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,000
could I have a pretty face like this, too?

83
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,250
Take over.

84
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,750
'Kay!

85
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:41,960
Huh?

86
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,640
H-H-How do I look?

87
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,350
You're pretty, Tomo-chan!

88
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,270
Indeed.

89
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,480
R-Really?!

90
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,190
Since we've done all this,
try talking more like a girl, too.

91
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,940
More like a girl? But I don't know how to...

92
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,990
Just start by speaking more politely.

93
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,450
H-Hello. My name is Aizawa Tomo.

94
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,910
It's a pleasure to meet you.

95
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,910
Am I doing this right?

96
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,370
You're super cute!

97
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,920
Indeed. Boys would probably like it.

98
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,790
Huh?!

99
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,880
I don't think you could make
friends with them, though.

100
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,720
You'd just be a thorn in their sides.

101
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,970
What's that supposed to mean?

102
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,600
I'm suddenly craving some ice cream.

103
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,980
Me, too.

104
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,850
Oh, I'll go buy some, then.

105
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,070
You've both done a lot for me, after all.

106
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,150
Really?

107
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,690
Sorry to make you do this.

108
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,280
Don't worry about it!

109
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,160
Just... let me change fir—

110
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,160
Wha—

111
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,950
Hey! Are you seriously making
me go out dressed like this?!

112
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,370
Absolutely.

113
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:58,460
There's no point in dressing like that
if we're the only ones who see it.

114
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,500
Yeah, but...

115
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,790
Off you go.

116
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,590
I wish you luck.

117
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,170
Hey! Misuz—

118
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,760
Damn those two!

119
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,390
They're staring at me!
I guess I really do look weird!

120
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,850
Wait, Jun?!

121
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,440
What do I do?! What excuse can
I give for being dressed like this?!

122
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,530
H-Huh?

123
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,580
Not sure what that's about, but...
if he doesn't recognize me, I'm golden!

124
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,620
I'll just buy my stuff and get outta here!

125
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,580
There's no way. There's no damn way.

126
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,500
Okay! I gotta get away from here quick!

127
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,140
Whoa, are you okay?

128
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,310
Her face looks just like Tomo's,

129
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:02,060
but she doesn't wear stuff like this. She doesn't wear makeup, either.

130
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,440
If this is Tomo, I don't... I mean...

131
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,530
I can't.

132
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,740
Do you need a hand?

133
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:18,040
Wh-What is this soft touch he's using?

134
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,370
Whoa...

135
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,670
Are you okay?

136
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,840
Why is he treating me like this?

137
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,510
Well, I'll be going now.

138
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,510
U-Um...

139
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,020
Would you mind if I walked
with you... for a while?

140
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,440
What the heck was I thinking?!

141
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,850
What do I do now?!

142
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,650
Now that we're walking together,
I'm sure of it.

143
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,820
This girl isn't Tomo.

144
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,780
Tomo's a little shorter than she is.

145
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,120
Um, please don't look at me so much.

146
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,740
Oh, I'm sorry.

147
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:02,040
I really do look strange, don't I?

148
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,540
Even I realize that.

149
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,210
Huh?

150
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,050
No, I think you just look pretty.

151
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,260
Today's the day I die, isn't it?!

152
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,090
That's it!

153
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,470
There you go!

154
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,760
You got it!

155
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,020
Way to go!

156
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:28,770
Here I go!

157
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,240
That kid's pretty good.

158
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,530
Go, go!

159
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,610
That's it! Go!

160
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,120
Shoot!

161
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,370
Aw, so close!

162
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,240
Huh?

163
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,040
Huh?

164
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:46,460
I'm sorry. I like watching sports and such.

165
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,670
That's surprising.

166
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,500
I get all fired up when I watch them.

167
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,630
That's not very ladylike, is it?

168
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,800
I don't know if it's ladylike or not,

169
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,600
but I like people like that.

170
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,560
What's with him today?!
Is he trying to kill me?!

171
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,730
Those two are pretty good, aren't they?

172
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,270
Huh? Oh... Yes, they do stand out.

173
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,440
They're clearly good friends.

174
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,240
Even though they're a boy and a girl...

175
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,700
What do you think will happen
to them in the future?

176
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,370
Huh? Well, uh...

177
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,910
I-It'd be nice if they became
boyfriend and girlfriend.

178
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,210
I figured you'd say that.

179
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,000
Huh?!

180
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,250
I have someone like that, too.

181
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,720
A girl who's... basically my best friend.

182
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:41,180
But lately, things aren't the same
as they were when we were kids.

183
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,270
How would you like things to
turn out with her in the future?

184
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,190
Well, I haven't really
given it much thought.

185
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,150
Well, you need to think about it!

186
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,320
My goal for the time being is...

187
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,110
to beat her, I guess.

188
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,820
Be—

189
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,740
At this point... should I just tell him?

190
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,410
I'll tell him I'm Tomo!

191
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,710
Then maybe he'll see me
as a little bit more...

192
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,880
Um, there's something I've been wondering...

193
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,580
Huh?!

194
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,630
You bought ice cream at the
convenience store. Is it okay out here?

195
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,260
Oh, crap!

196
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,970
Th-Thank you so much for all you've done today!

197
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,310
Uh, hang on...

198
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,190
I'd better be going now!

199
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,150
It couldn't be... right?

200
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,150
Sorry I took so long!

201
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:41,320
A lot happened on the... way...

202
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,780
Happy Birthday
Tomo-chan

203
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,330
This homemade cake is really good!

204
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,000
Thanks, both of you!

205
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:54,460
Forget about that. Did you really see
Junichiro at the convenience store?

206
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,420
Oh, yeah...

207
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,420
He said I looked pretty.

208
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,050
Wow! That's great!

209
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:06,100
Well... If I'm being honest,
I was super happy when he said it.

210
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:12,060
But I guess what I really want to
hear him say is something else.

211
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,820
You mean you'd rather be
called cute than pretty?

212
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,280
Let's try for that next time.

213
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,070
Uh, no, that's not what I meant...

214
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,290
What?

215
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:34,710
That hurt, damn it!
What the hell are you doing?!

216
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:35,960
Yeah, that's right.

217
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,670
That punch could only come from Tomo!

218
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:44,050
Why are you happy?!
A-Are you some kinda freak?!

219
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:50,020
Burn Up!

220
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:50,020
The Ball Sports Tournament

221
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,220
"Burn Up! The Ball Sports Tournament."

222
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:59,070
Damn. I missed.

223
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,610
Hey! Why are you running away?

224
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,370
Tomo-chan is kinda scary.

225
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:09,620
Because the class-versus-class ball
sports tournament is coming up.

226
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,330
She's always like that
before an athletic event.

227
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,790
Uh, so... For certain reasons...

228
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:23,630
Aizawa-san will be on the boys' dodgeball
team at the ball sports tournament.

229
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,090
All right!

230
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,440
This is awesome, Tomo! We can play together!

231
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,890
Why did this happen again?!

232
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:36,860
The Day of the Ball Sports Tournament

233
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,610
First Round

234
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,530
I heard there's a girl on the team
we're playing in the first round.

235
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,570
For real? This'll be a cakewalk!

236
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,330
We're ready!

237
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,290
Ready!

238
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:53,580
Sure, we'll play around with ya.

239
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,920
And we'll be giving this all we've got.

240
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,460
You'd better make sure you're prepared.

241
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:06,050
VS. Third-Year Punk Team

242
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,050
Instant Victory

243
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,430
Second Round

244
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,430
Let's have a good, fair match!

245
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,270
Yeah.

246
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,770
I know I don't have to hold
back against you, Senpai!

247
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,600
Let's make it a good game.

248
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,230
Wha...

249
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,940
Everyone, put your own
safety above all else!

250
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,610
Let's finish this match with
everyone still standing!

251
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,570
What're you talking about?

252
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,450
It's just a dodgeball match.

253
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,370
Misaki!

254
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,880
VS. Misaki-senpai and His Classmates

255
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,880
Overwhelming Victory

256
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,970
Well, the final round's next.

257
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:45,840
Yeah.

258
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,140
Hey! We've got trouble!

259
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,300
One of the guys on the other team
in the finals is like a gorilla!

260
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,600
That third-year in the judo club,
Goma Takeru-senpai, right?

261
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,100
The guy known as the strongest
kid in the school.

262
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,520
I'm not sure if even Jun and I can beat him.

263
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:04,360
I knew the day would come eventually
when we'd have to fight him...

264
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,610
But I didn't think we'd have
to fight him this soon.

265
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,990
Uh, no... You don't really
have to fight him.

266
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:14,120
What are you saying? He's the
strongest kid in the school!

267
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,210
We've gotta fight him at least once!

268
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,620
Sorry. I don't get you at all.

269
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,880
Too bad we lost at volleyball.

270
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,260
There was no way a team with
you and me on it could win.

271
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,590
True.

272
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,510
It's just about time for Tomo
and Junichiro's final round.

273
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,810
What are you snickering about?

274
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:39,270
I was just thinking, you and I
are together a lot lately.

275
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:42,310
Hey, don't go.

276
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,190
Final Round

277
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,570
We'll be giving everything
we've got to this final round.

278
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:53,490
Yep!

279
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,790
So you're Aizawa Tomo?

280
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,830
Yeah, that's me.

281
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,250
I heard you were the karate club's ace,

282
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,250
but frankly, I'm disappointed.

283
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:06,630
I didn't know you'd be such
a fragile-looking little lady.

284
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,430
"A fragile-looking little lady," he says!

285
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,180
Did you hear that?! Well?!

286
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,890
You do seem fairly strong...

287
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:18,390
But to be honest, you interest
me more than Aizawa.

288
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,310
Pardon?

289
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:23,860
I hear you're pretty athletic,
but you're not in any clubs.

290
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:28,280
How about this? If I win this
match, you join the judo club.

291
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:32,320
Fine. And if I win...

292
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,950
What should I say?

293
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:38,040
Way to fall flat at the
finish line! Don't ask me!

294
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:43,750
The final round of boys'
dodgeball will now begin.

295
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,210
Misuzu-chan is cheering me on!

296
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,920
Watch me. I'll win this match for you!

297
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,600
Tanabe!

298
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,140
He was sending you some sort of sign.

299
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,440
Was he? I wasn't watching.

300
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,980
He didn't waste any time!

301
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,150
Hey, Tanabe! You okay?!

302
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,940
Sports are great, aren't they?

303
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,620
It doesn't matter if you hurt someone,
as long as you follow the rules.

304
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,790
Damn that violent bastard!

305
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:21,080
What does he think sports are about?!

306
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,330
I don't think he's one to talk.

307
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,790
You can say that again.

308
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,670
Noda!

309
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,840
Fukaya!

310
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:36,260
Why aren't you throwing the ball at me?!

311
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,560
Don't be impatient.

312
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,270
I took out the guys who aren't fit
to stand on this court first.

313
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:51,780
And that means you're next, Aizawa!

314
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,370
Uh-oh!

315
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,990
Jun!

316
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:08,420
You idiot! What the hell were you doing?!

317
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,590
Dunno. My body just moved on its own.

318
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:17,930
Stay with me, Jun!

319
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,930
How dare you do that to Jun?

320
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,850
I'm gonna make you pay for that!

321
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:29,730
Oh? And how are you gonna make me pay?

322
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,740
It's down to a one-on-one between
Aizawa-san and the gorilla.

323
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,320
Is Aizawa-san gonna be okay?

324
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,410
Don't worry. No one can beat her.

325
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,870
I'm putting my all into this throw!

326
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,870
Here I go!

327
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,840
Take this, damn it!

328
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,300
Bring it on!

329
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:02,060
It dropped?! A between-the-legs pass?!

330
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,060
I'm not playing by myself here!

331
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,440
Go, Jun!

332
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,810
Huh?

333
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,230
Yah.

334
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,320
That concludes the match.

335
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,790
The boys' dodgeball winner is Class 1-A!

336
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,410
Congratulations.

337
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:31,210
Everyone, give Class 1-A
a round of applause!

338
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,390
Tomo-chan, congrats on the win.

339
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,180
Yeah, thanks.

340
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,560
What's wrong? You don't seem happy.

341
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:52,940
I had so much fun being
on a team with him today.

342
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,030
It was like we went back to the old days.

343
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,490
It kinda made me wish things
could stay like this forever.

344
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:07,040
I hope we can always have the kind of
relationship where we can goof around together.

345
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,120
But I guess we can't, huh?

346
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,920
Sorry, Tomo.

347
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:16,210
In the end, I can only do
things for my own gain.

348
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,640
Hey. Hold up.

349
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,850
You're not satisfied with
how that ended, are you?

350
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,560
Come with me for a minute.

351
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:37,360
Wh-What's the idea?! Why...

352
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,320
Why am I getting beat up by you,
when I do judo and you do karate?!

353
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,280
You let your guard down too much.

354
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,970
I managed to pull off more wins than him.

355
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:03,260
Damn it... I guess I still
can't beat you after all.

356
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,510
Is this really an outcome you
should be depressed over?

357
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,180
Huh?

358
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:11,140
You didn't even use karate on me once.

359
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,900
At this point, we might as well say I lost.

360
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,520
That's not the problem.

361
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,070
Hang on!

362
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,320
I hear you almost never
enter any tournaments.

363
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,950
Don't you feel like that's
a waste of talent?

364
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,290
What was your reason for getting so strong?

365
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:36,250
I just wanted to catch up to the
big back I saw in front of me.

366
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:39,130
But the situation changed,

367
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,420
and now I don't even know
how to approach it.

368
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,050
What do you think I should do?

369
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,510
Uh... I don't know.

370
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,640
I heard you fought with Goma-senpai.

371
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,640
Yeah, and I lost.

372
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,400
I see.

373
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,150
I lost, but I bet you could beat him.

374
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:03,700
You know, I've thought this for a while,

375
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,490
but you overestimate me way too much.

376
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:09,660
Do I? I don't think I'm overestimating you.

377
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:15,830
Then again, it wouldn't surprise
me if you started breathing fire.

378
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:18,420
Oh, you're finally counting
me as a monster, huh?

379
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:22,760
You're a guy, and I'm a girl.

380
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,930
You're obviously gonna be better than
me at any kind of physical contest.

381
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:32,670
During that match, I wasn't
expecting that pass at all.

382
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,980
I just believed that you
would win it in the end.

383
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:46,650
Maybe I'm still just a gamer kid who's only
strong-willed because you're by my side.

384
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,040
It's not physical strength.

385
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,010
What's up?

386
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,150
Oh, nothing.

387
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,180
I want...

388
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:05,900
to be like you.

389
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,560
(This suspicious behavior is...)

390
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,850
Hey, you know, I'm all mixed up

391
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:23,320
It's too complicated, I'm freaking out

392
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,860
I want to look cute to you

393
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:29,200
(crazy, crazy, drive me crazy, and that's…)

394
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,490
So I'm plotting, bargaining,
sly, and stubborn

395
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,990
Dizzying love

396
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,580
Just tell him to look at you

397
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:43,550
And watch him stiffen up even more,
because you're both so awkward

398
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:47,420
What? Even if we're alike in that way

399
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:52,010
It doesn't make me happy, 'cause it
means our love is going nowhere

400
00:22:52,010 --> 00:23:00,900
Cloudy heart, swirling emotions—
I sense rain coming

401
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:09,990
So I partly open my umbrella,
then sneakily scoot closer to you

402
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:13,950
Please notice the curl of my
eyelashes as I keep blinking

403
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:18,870
And don't say I'm acting weird

404
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:22,840
All this plotting and bargaining
is my sly plan to look cute to you

405
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,880
Try to solve the riddle of
this soft, dizzying love

406
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:30,010
(Buzzing, fidgeting)

407
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:34,430
Listen, I might be a bit
tangled in my own web now

408
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:38,850
But once you unravel the mystery,
you'll see pure lo-love
