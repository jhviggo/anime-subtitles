1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,900
When I was in grade school,

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,980
I was a gloomy, sullen, unpleasant child.

3
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,200
And because of that,
I didn't have any friends.

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,070
Ko-chan?

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,370
Your cousin, Carol-chan,
is here to play with you.

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,540
She's as pretty as a little angel!

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,130
Adults are always so quick to
describe little kids as "angels."

8
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:31,010
Oh, honey, do you have to be like that?

9
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,060
Hello.

10
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:51,730
She's...

11
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,650
an actual angel.

12
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:16,050
When I throw a jab or a straight,
it always lands

13
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:21,180
But when I'm aiming for your heart,
I miss every time

14
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,520
Parallel, zigzagging, awkward, incoherent

15
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,020
When you look my way and move closer to me

16
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,780
I know it doesn't mean the same thing for you

17
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,830
But I wish we could stay like this forever

18
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:47,960
My changing feelings are driving me crazy

19
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:53,250
The moment you turn to face me,
take that! Telepathy

20
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,720
If only we could feel the same thing

21
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,600
I want to kick this pesky subtlety away

22
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,600
I want to know everything,
I want to know everything

23
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,150
I can't fool you forever

24
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,780
I can't keep this hidden

25
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,530
I want to shout out my secret, AHHH

26
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,990
Take that! Telepathy

27
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,450
Te-te-te-telepathy

28
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,540
Telepathy

29
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,000
The Angel's

30
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,000
True Face

31
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,630
"The Angel's True Face."

32
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,760
I-It's good to meet you!

33
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,550
I'm Misaki Kosuke!

34
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,350
I admire your resolve to get stronger.

35
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,140
Thank you!

36
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,140
He said he wanted to join the dojo,
but I didn't think he really would.

37
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,650
But you are clearly...

38
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,230
weak.

39
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,570
You think so, too?!

40
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,530
No, wait.

41
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,160
I see something more behind the weakness.

42
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,530
Wh-What is it?

43
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,620
There's an evil spirit lurking in your soul.

44
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,210
You had best be careful.

45
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,080
Oh...

46
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,790
That's my dad for you.

47
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,420
Senpai, we'll start with running!

48
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,130
Osu!

49
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,680
We're only going up and
down 200 little steps!

50
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,560
Next is strength training.

51
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,110
Three sets of fifty push-ups!

52
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,320
You haven't pushed up once yet!

53
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,320
Senpai, you'll be having a match next!

54
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,570
R-Right now?!

55
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,580
"Train in extremes" is
our motto at this dojo.

56
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:51,750
Your opponent isn't gonna care
what kind of condition you're in.

57
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,580
Your first opponent...

58
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,500
will be me.

59
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,630
My first battle with Jun-kun...

60
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,010
I want him to face me seriously.

61
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:08,600
If I can beat you in this fight...

62
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:16,110
Do you think Aizawa-san will
actually acknowledge me a little?

63
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,900
Who knows?

64
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,410
This is Jun-kun's real strength!

65
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,580
He said Aizawa-san was stronger than him,

66
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,200
but there's no way!

67
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,290
He's overwhelming!

68
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,750
Jun looks like he's having a blast.

69
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,220
Nothing like when he's up against me.

70
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,850
Don't swing your arm out so wide.

71
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,810
And don't think you can get by
on just the heat of the moment.

72
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,440
If you want someone stronger
to acknowledge you,

73
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,990
you gotta cough up the effort, layer upon
bloody layer, until you surpass them.

74
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:08,070
There's no other way.

75
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,870
I know I can't win,

76
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,370
but if I can at least get one hit in...

77
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,550
Oh, crap.

78
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,600
Where am I?

79
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,480
In my room.

80
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,360
What about practice?

81
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,150
It's already over.

82
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,230
I'm sorry!

83
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,360
Jun really doesn't know how to hold back.

84
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,990
I really am pathetic, aren't I?

85
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,580
Of course not!

86
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:57,330
Also... were you hoping to get
stronger for Carol's sake?

87
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,330
Wha?!

88
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,630
Well, th-that's, uh...

89
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,710
Yeah.

90
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,260
That's right, actually.

91
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,760
So I was right!

92
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,140
Given the way she is,

93
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:14,010
she's gotten herself into trouble a
ton of times since we were little.

94
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:18,480
That's why I wanted to get
stronger for her sake.

95
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,690
But I've never been able
to do anything at all.

96
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,320
Like this last time...

97
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,860
I'm just so...

98
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,910
I told you, Senpai, you're not pathetic!

99
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,040
Just because someone's better
than you at one thing

100
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,000
doesn't make it right to reject
everything about yourself!

101
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,670
You said that yourself!

102
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,260
Besides, no matter how much
you train up your body,

103
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,550
the things you can resolve with this
are things that don't even matter.

104
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,390
There are different kinds of strength.

105
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,280
Ko-chan, you've seemed a
little more manly lately.

106
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,150
What? Really?

107
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,820
Yeah.

108
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:13,120
I've actually been going to
Aizawa-san's family dojo.

109
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,160
Huh?

110
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,830
Aizawa-san's dad is amazing!

111
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,000
Of course, that also makes
his practices tough...

112
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,210
But I want to become the kind
of man that she'll acknowledge!

113
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,250
Ko-chan...

114
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,550
How do you feel about Tomo-chan?

115
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,050
Huh? Why do you ask that?

116
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,470
Just tell me.

117
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,350
I see Aizawa-san as... well...

118
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,930
a role model, I guess.

119
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,310
It's obvious that she's physically strong,

120
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,310
but she's more than just that.

121
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,360
She's someone I want to catch up to

122
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,650
and be good enough to
stand alongside someday.

123
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,570
Huh...

124
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,290
Jun-kun, Jun-kun.

125
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,960
Want to hang out with me after school?

126
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,830
Huh?

127
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,800
I don't particularly want
to hang out with you, no.

128
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,010
I don't either, particularly.

129
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,630
Then why'd you ask?

130
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,300
I heard you asking Junichiro
to hang out with you today.

131
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,310
What are you planning?

132
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,600
Oh, you saw that, huh?

133
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,390
I don't know what you're up to,

134
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,150
but all of your meddling—

135
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,310
Hey, Misuzu-chan.

136
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,190
Do you still think everything's
going to go your way?

137
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,490
All right! This way!

138
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,240
Wait up!

139
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,420
Why did you want to come to the park?

140
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,290
To watch people playing.

141
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,380
Why would you just watch other people play?

142
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,420
Go play with them.

143
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,760
Tomo and Gundo would join you.

144
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,640
I don't think things will
work like that anymore.

145
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,760
Did something happen?

146
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,890
I said something really mean to
Misuzu-chan at school today,

147
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,270
and I'm doing something mean to Tomo now.

148
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,060
I'm not...

149
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,980
Don't take Tomo for a fool.

150
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,190
I don't know what you did,

151
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:17,410
but Tomo's not the type to give
up on a friend just like that.

152
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,120
Okay, fine. You've got me for today.

153
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,960
You'll play with me?

154
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,580
Only a little.

155
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,130
Why?

156
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,720
Why did this happen?

157
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,630
Wow, so this is your room, huh?

158
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,640
Just leave now. Please.

159
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,510
Nope.

160
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:46,640
See, the thing is, there's someone I like,

161
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,190
but it's just not panning out.

162
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,900
What does that have to do with me?

163
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,820
If it doesn't work out,
it's partially your fault.

164
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,490
What? My fault?

165
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,200
Yep.

166
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:02,120
So I came here to take out
my frustrations on you.

167
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,290
I'm gonna torture you
a little. Don't cry, okay?

168
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,790
Who, me?

169
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,920
Here I go.

170
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,460
Have it your way.

171
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,210
Go home once you get bored.

172
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,000
Mwah.

173
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,380
Wh-What the hell did you—

174
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:14,960
Slam!

175
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,930
Rawr.

176
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:27,060
Sh-She's scaring me!

177
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,440
Stop it!

178
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,570
I won't do anything.

179
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,990
Why are you so afraid of girls?

180
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,360
You react like that to
Tomo-chan, too, don't you?

181
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,330
Poor Tomo-chan.

182
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:47,580
If you keep that up, you won't
get to be with her anymore.

183
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,050
Jun? Weren't you hanging
out with Carol today?

184
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,680
J-Jun?!

185
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,930
Sorry.

186
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,650
I just kinda... got hit with
an attack I wasn't expecting.

187
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,400
What the heck did this to
a guy as tough as you?

188
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,280
That blonde chick was right.

189
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:28,790
But I still can't fully
accept that Tomo is a girl.

190
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,960
And I bet it's because...

191
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,340
We still haven't settled
that man-to-man score yet.

192
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,550
What's wrong?

193
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,920
I'll help if you need it.

194
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,670
Nah.

195
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,970
It's not something that you can help with.

196
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,720
I mean, we're talking about that—

197
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,800
Hi.

198
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,980
Jun-kun, Tomo-chan, I'm sorry.

199
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,520
Huh? O-Okay...

200
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,490
I'm sorry about yesterday, Misuzu-chan.

201
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,530
It's fine.

202
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,040
But how did Senpai react to the news?

203
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,500
Actually...

204
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,330
I hung out with Jun-kun yesterday.

205
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,630
Just the two of us.

206
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,460
Huh?

207
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:19,840
We went to the park, and then
we hung out in his room.

208
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,220
R-Really?

209
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,890
Did you have a good time?

210
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,560
Ko-chan made a really weird face.

211
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,020
You're a frightening woman.

212
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,640
There's no telling what you'd
do if left to your own devices.

213
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,850
Maybe I should just get you
together with Senpai already.

214
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,690
You can do that?

215
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,820
You're amazing, Misuzu-chan!

216
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,450
I feel like she's going to
be the bigger problem.

217
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:49,580
Carol, have you ever let Senpai
see you being serious?

218
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,590
Gundo-san, what did you want to talk about?

219
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,260
How do you feel about Carol?

220
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,050
Huh?!

221
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:07,430
H-How do I... I mean,
she's like a little sister to—

222
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,890
You can drop that front now.

223
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,890
You love her, don't you?

224
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:17,350
That's right. I love her.

225
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,810
No kidding.

226
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:22,110
Your murderous rampage at the
factory made that obvious.

227
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,110
H-Huh?

228
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:28,030
And you know how she feels, don't you?

229
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,780
Why won't you give her the answer she wants?

230
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,240
B-Because...

231
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:37,960
Carol is really strong, unlike me.

232
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,960
I've known her forever, but I've
never seen her in a weak state.

233
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:47,050
I thought I was drawn to her strength,

234
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:50,300
but once I started thinking about
having that kind of relationship,

235
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,930
I suddenly felt scared.

236
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,060
That whether I said something
to try to woo her

237
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,440
or pushed her away as coldly as I could,

238
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,650
she'd just accept it like it
was the most natural thing.

239
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,980
It's not that I want her to be hurt.

240
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,780
I don't, but...

241
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,110
He does have a point.

242
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,450
Basically, no matter how much time goes by,

243
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,200
she's just so dazzling that
I can't look straight at her.

244
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,080
I really am a sad excuse
for a man, aren't I?

245
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,790
What do you think of couples who keep saying

246
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,460
that they're going to
break up, but never do?

247
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,710
Uh, I don't think it's very—

248
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,010
I thought so.

249
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,430
You wish they'd just disappear, don't you?

250
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,930
No, I wouldn't go that far.

251
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:34,640
But I think a little bargaining
is necessary sometimes.

252
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,230
She seems to do it on occasion herself.

253
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,690
What? Carol wouldn't do that!

254
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,400
She would, and she is.

255
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,820
You're probably too nice
to pull it off, though,

256
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,400
so would you like me to do it?

257
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,360
Huh? Do what?

258
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,870
You want to see her in a
vulnerable state, don't you?

259
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,910
What? When did we get to that point?

260
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,710
Misuzu-chan, welcome back.

261
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,500
You went to talk to Ko-chan, right?

262
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,670
How did it go?

263
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:09,050
I'm sure she's going to hate me.

264
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:11,140
I didn't expect this to weigh on me so much.

265
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:15,010
But this is the only chance I'll
have to expose her real face.

266
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,230
Frankly, I don't think you have a chance.

267
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,850
Oh, no.

268
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,560
You mean—

269
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,440
You get it, don't you?

270
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,820
You know he doesn't even
think of you as a girl.

271
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:32,200
I know you used Junichiro
to try to shake him up,

272
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,580
but he probably just felt like a father
giving his daughter away to her groom.

273
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,620
I doubt that will even upset her at all.

274
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,250
Please be at least a little upset...

275
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,500
Liar.

276
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,340
So when they do that, you do this, right?

277
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,880
No, no! You gotta start up higher—

278
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,590
Hey, Carol! It's dangerous
to run in the hall.

279
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,850
Misaki-senpai...

280
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:05,940
Gundo-san?!

281
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:11,490
I told her she doesn't
have a chance with you.

282
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:12,450
What?!

283
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,370
I'm sorry. I didn't think it
would affect her that much.

284
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,330
What are you saying?!
What happened to Carol?!

285
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,250
You need to go to her house right now.

286
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,750
You should at least... at the very least...

287
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:30,090
see what she looks like right now.

288
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:43,270
Did Carol go home early because
of something you did?

289
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,140
Tomo...

290
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,520
Yes. It's because I was mean to her.

291
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,860
So what?

292
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,780
You can drop the bad girl act.
Just explain what happened.

293
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,820
Why am I the only one out of the loop?

294
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,370
You're not even going to admonish me?

295
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,620
Hah. Don't take me too lightly.

296
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,050
Um... I heard Carol came
home from school early...

297
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,470
We'll call this one a draw
due to injury, Kosuke-kun.

298
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,680
Come in.

299
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:25,810
Carol?

300
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:31,480
She thinks I indirectly rejected her, right?

301
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:37,200
So will she still greet me with
a smile like she always does?

302
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,280
I'm coming in.

303
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,330
Caro—

304
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm an absolute monster.

305
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,970
I couldn't see anything.

306
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:04,020
No... I never tried to see it.

307
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,440
She's not an angel, and she's not a goddess.

308
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,400
She's just a girl who gets lonely easily.

309
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,190
I'm sorry, Caro—

310
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:19,570
You jerk! Jerk! Why did you
come here?! Why are you here?!

311
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:23,200
Carol! Listen to me!
What Gundo-san said was a lie!

312
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,500
It was?

313
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:30,040
Yes, it was! She said it to try to
get you in a vulnerable state!

314
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,670
Carol?

315
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,840
Gundo!

316
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:40,340
Misuzu-chan! That jerk! What's her deal?!

317
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,810
It's not like that! I think
she was trying to help me!

318
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:48,480
Why would Misuzu-chan being
mean to me help you?

319
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,060
Huh?!

320
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,690
Er... well...

321
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,070
Tell me.

322
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,480
Y-Yes, ma'am!

323
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,400
Gundo-san made Carol
hate her instead of me.

324
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,320
And look at how much of herself
Carol is showing to me now.

325
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:05,870
I guess there's no way to run back
to being a coward at this point.

326
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,960
Gundo-san was trying to give me a push,

327
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,250
so I could tell you how I feel.

328
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,880
I love you, Carol.

329
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,890
Sorry it took me so long.

330
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,400
Banzai!

331
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:37,440
You know what? You know what?
I love you too, Ko-chan!

332
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,280
Thanks! That makes me happy!

333
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,740
What was it that made you like me?

334
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,120
Um... I never thought about it.

335
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,080
You didn't?!

336
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:52,830
I mean, you've always been by my side,

337
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,130
and you've always been kind to me.

338
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:59,670
I don't know when or why
it happened anymore.

339
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,680
I love you because I love you.

340
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,720
Ah...

341
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,680
Wait, Carol! What are you doing?!

342
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,850
That'll be all.

343
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,640
Boo.

344
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,320
The reason Carol-chan never stops smiling

345
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,950
is because I told her that she
looks cuter when she smiles.

346
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:27,910
What?

347
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,870
I said it when she was little to make
her feel better because she was crying,

348
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,380
but she said...

349
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,040
Okay!

350
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,670
And from then on, she wouldn't cry anymore.

351
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,590
I'm scared for her.

352
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:47,180
As it is, they say love changes a person,

353
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,850
but if you said anything like
that to her as her boyfriend,

354
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,850
there's no telling how it might change her.

355
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,850
It just worries me so much...

356
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:58,860
Well, I don't have any intention
of saying anything like that.

357
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,860
It'll be okay.

358
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:05,490
Carol has other important people in her
life now besides me and her family.

359
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,990
She has friends now.

360
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:11,750
I think she knows what it means
to be loved by those around her.

361
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,830
She wouldn't change just
because of something I said.

362
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,210
That made me trust you a little bit more.

363
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,920
About this much!

364
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,680
Looks like I've got a long road ahead.

365
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,930
Carol's late.

366
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,830
Is she not coming to school today?

367
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,290
I wouldn't blame her.

368
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:37,520
After what happened yesterday,
even she must be...

369
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:45,530
Misuzu-chan.

370
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,620
Wh-What?

371
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,070
She's mad! You gotta apologize, Misuzu!

372
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,290
Mwah.

373
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,680
Thank you!

374
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,240
You lost this one, Misuzu!

375
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,620
You lose!

376
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,470
I have not lost.

377
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,330
I swear...

378
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,600
(This suspicious behavior is...)

379
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,900
Hey, you know, I'm all mixed up

380
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:23,360
It's too complicated, I'm freaking out

381
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,900
I want to look cute to you

382
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:29,240
(crazy, crazy, drive me crazy, and that's…)

383
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,530
So I'm plotting, bargaining,
sly, and stubborn

384
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,040
Dizzying love

385
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,620
Just tell him to look at you

386
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:43,590
And watch him stiffen up even more,
because you're both so awkward

387
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:47,470
What? Even if we're alike in that way

388
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:52,050
It doesn't make me happy, 'cause it
means our love is going nowhere

389
00:22:52,050 --> 00:23:00,940
Cloudy heart, swirling emotions—
I sense rain coming

390
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:10,030
So I partly open my umbrella,
then sneakily scoot closer to you

391
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:13,990
Please notice the curl of my
eyelashes as I keep blinking

392
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:18,910
And don't say I'm acting weird

393
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:22,880
All this plotting and bargaining
is my sly plan to look cute to you

394
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,920
Try to solve the riddle of
this soft, dizzying love

395
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:30,050
(Buzzing, fidgeting)

396
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:34,850
Listen, I might be a bit
tangled in my own web now

397
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:38,890
But once you unravel the mystery,
you'll see pure lo-love
