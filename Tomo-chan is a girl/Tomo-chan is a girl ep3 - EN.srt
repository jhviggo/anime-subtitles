1
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:02,350
Huh?!

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:05,260
Wait, are you saying you
have a thing for Misuzu?!

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,050
Hell no.

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,900
You know we went out for a
while in middle school, right?

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:15,580
Huh?

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,190
Why didn't they tell me about this before?

7
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:25,510
Aren't they my best friends?

8
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:01,010
Best Bud's Secret

9
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,800
"Best Bud's Secret."

10
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,930
Hey, Misuzu!

11
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,180
What's this about you going out
with Jun in middle school?!

12
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,560
He finally let it slip, did he?

13
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,810
Why would you do that?!

14
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,530
You know how I feel about Jun, don't you?!

15
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,320
I didn't back then.

16
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:22,370
You didn't tell me you liked Junichiro until
right before we graduated middle school.

17
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:29,000
S-Still! If we were best friends,
you could've told me you had a boyfriend!

18
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,330
Both Junichiro and I wanted
to forget about it.

19
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,420
Besides, we didn't even
have time to tell you.

20
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,550
Huh?

21
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,180
Because we were only a couple for three days.

22
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,010
Three days?!

23
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,930
Now that you know, I might
as well tell you everything.

24
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,190
It was in the spring of our
second year of middle school.

25
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,860
He just asked me out of nowhere...

26
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,990
Gundo, would you...
maybe try going out with me?

27
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,080
That sounds like fun.

28
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,920
Even back then, a lot of girls
liked him for some reason,

29
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,290
so I kinda wanted to show him off.

30
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,630
Th-That was all it took?

31
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,760
Call it youthful indiscretion, I guess.

32
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,140
I started to feel like I was
reaching my limit the next day.

33
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,680
The next day?!

34
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,390
It was the day of our first date.

35
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,850
He invited me to go cycling with him,

36
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,440
so I agreed without giving
it much thought, and...

37
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,950
So... how far are we going?

38
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,580
We're almost there!

39
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:51,290
We repeated that exchange for two hours
while traveling forty kilometers one way.

40
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,920
Well?! Awesome view, right?!

41
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,340
View?

42
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,840
Are you a total moron?

43
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,550
Huh?

44
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,890
He dragged me all around again the next day.

45
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,430
I lost five kilograms in two days.

46
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,190
Uh... What was so bad about that?

47
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,900
You two are insane.

48
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,650
I had hit my limit both
physically and mentally,

49
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,610
so after the break, I approached
him to call it quits.

50
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,870
But then he said...

51
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,540
Sorry, Misuzu.

52
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,200
Huh?

53
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,330
I know this sounds weird when I'm
the one who asked you out, but...

54
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:38,040
I feel like maybe we're not
a good match after all.

55
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,630
So let's just give up on going out, okay?

56
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,680
He... beat me to it!

57
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:51,640
He put a permanent black mark on my life.

58
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,060
I'll never forgive him for it.

59
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,520
A lot of things suddenly make sense now.

60
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:59,320
So... you don't have any feelings
for Jun anymore, right?

61
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,820
Oh, I have feelings for him.
And all of them are hate.

62
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,280
I-I see...

63
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:09,740
A-Also, when you guys were
going out, did you... er, you know...

64
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,290
k-k-k-k...

65
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,500
kiss or anything?

66
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,750
The fact that we didn't share any mucosal
contact is our one silver lining.

67
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,290
Don't describe it as mucosal!

68
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,010
Well, if I had to say how far...

69
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,420
We called each other by our given names

70
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,970
and held hands while walking
to and from school.

71
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,470
But nothing major, really.

72
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,060
Feel better?

73
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,140
Yeah, I guess...

74
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:38,100
But I don't feel like I've been
discussing a relationship at all.

75
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,230
You told Tomo about us, didn't you?

76
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,440
I did plan to tell her eventually.

77
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,070
Yeah, yeah. Sorry.

78
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,660
It's fine.

79
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:52,740
Anyway, I didn't notice since I was
trying my hardest to forget it,

80
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:58,040
but you avoided Tomo for pretty much the
entire first year of middle school, didn't you?

81
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,380
I'll spare you all my questions about why.

82
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,840
But the time when you two went
back to being best friends

83
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,470
happened to be right when
you and I broke up.

84
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,350
Was that a coincidence?

85
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,220
I was entirely to blame for
everything that happened.

86
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,940
If you're mad about it,
it's not too late to hit me.

87
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,690
So there really was something going on.

88
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,980
Hit me all you want!

89
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,950
There's really nothing between
you and Misuzu anymore, right?

90
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,450
Really nothing?

91
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:33,580
I told you there's nothing.
How many times are you gonna ask?

92
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,950
Well, I was the only one
who didn't know about it!

93
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,830
I'm sorry, okay?

94
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,920
Okay, then...

95
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,710
Is there anyone you like now?

96
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,880
Huh? Of course not.

97
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,090
Really?

98
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:50,510
Yes, really. What's with you?

99
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,720
Oh, okay! As long as there isn't anyone!

100
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,100
There isn't!

101
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,810
Huh?

102
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,680
O-Okay...

103
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,640
I get it.

104
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,320
Morning, Aizawa-san!

105
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,530
Oh, hey, Misaki-senpai.

106
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,030
Misaki?

107
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,830
Wait, he's a guy.

108
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,580
Oh, yeah! Senpai, this here is Jun!

109
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,290
Oh!

110
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,210
Hi! I'm Misaki Kosuke, second-year.

111
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:28,920
Nice to—

112
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,050
What'd you do that for?!

113
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:32,970
Sorry. Reflex.

114
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,970
That wasn't a reflex!

115
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,140
I'm Kubota Junichiro. Sorry for what I did.

116
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,980
I-It's okay. No hard feelings here.

117
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,980
I hear you do karate?

118
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,450
Huh? Yeah.

119
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,400
Let's have a match sometime, then.

120
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,280
I'll crush you with every
ounce of strength I have.

121
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,110
Cru...

122
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:57,700
I'm so sorry, Senpai!
I'll give him a good talking-to!

123
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,660
That hurts, Tomo...

124
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,950
Can't breathe...

125
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,330
R-Really, it's okay. You can let him go.

126
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,330
Tomo... Hey...

127
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,340
Why are you so close to the
captain of the boys' club?

128
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,710
Aren't you in the girls' club?

129
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,260
Oh, I didn't tell you?

130
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,260
Stuff happened, and I'm
in the boys' club now.

131
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,300
What a disappointment.

132
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,980
The heir to the Aizawa style,
learning karate in school...

133
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,430
And what about you, Jun-bo?

134
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,980
I'll be sticking with you, sir!

135
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,150
Well said!

136
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,190
Wh-What's wrong?

137
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,200
Tomo, let's head home.

138
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,620
Sorry, I promised to get tea with
Misuzu and Carol after school.

139
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,040
Oh, come on! Don't pout!

140
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,540
I'm not pouting.

141
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,630
Yes, you are!

142
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,420
Tomorrow, okay? I'll walk
home with you tomorrow.

143
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,380
Tomorrow, then. You'd better stick to that.

144
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,130
Sure!

145
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,800
They're not dating, right?

146
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,140
That's right. Ridiculous, aren't they?

147
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,600
Uenomizu

148
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,060
Uenomizu
High
School

149
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,770
I... I can't believe I ran into him here!

150
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,280
Senpai's scared of me now
'cause you threatened him!

151
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,030
Next time you see him,
smooth it out! Got it?!

152
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,860
So you live this way, huh?

153
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,120
Yeah. I usually ride my bike,

154
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,830
but it's in for repairs right now.

155
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,790
And that's why you're taking
the bus today, huh?

156
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,500
Yeah.

157
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,880
Why are you standing so far away?

158
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,670
I-It's just your imagination!

159
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,180
Y-You don't want to join
the karate club, Jun-kun?

160
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,850
No.

161
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,310
I see... S-Sorry for asking.

162
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,980
I don't think I could beat Tomo, anyway.

163
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:55,110
That's another reason I don't
want to join the club.

164
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,570
I don't want to lose.

165
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:01,580
But Aizawa-san was saying there
was no way she could beat you.

166
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,580
That's just at her dad's dojo.

167
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,080
When there are actual rules
to follow, I don't stand a chance.

168
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,090
I can manage to beat her in a fight, though.

169
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:15,960
Fight? You mean you and
Aizawa-san just... punch each other?

170
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,010
Yeah, sometimes.

171
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,260
You can't do that!

172
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,510
Aizawa-san is a girl, you know!

173
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:26,520
It's not like I want to hurt Tomo.

174
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,850
She's the problem.

175
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,230
Whenever we fight,
she comes after me for real.

176
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:36,150
Well... I can see why you would feel
like your life was in danger, but...

177
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,950
If I can beat her in a contest of strength,
it's only because I'm a guy.

178
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,540
In a sport with fixed rules,
I'm still the challenger.

179
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:49,830
I see. She is pretty incredible, isn't she?

180
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,420
Too incredible.

181
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,500
I still wish I could be like her.

182
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,210
As I am now...

183
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:02,050
I see. He looks up to
Aizawa-san, just like me.

184
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,600
That makes me feel a sort
of kinship with him.

185
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,770
Oh, I get the feeling I just said a
lot of weird stuff without thinking.

186
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,810
If you go blabbing to Tomo...

187
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:14,770
I-I won't! I swear I won't!

188
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,280
Never mind! He's still scary!

189
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,200
I heard you took the same
bus home as Jun yesterday.

190
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,990
He didn't threaten you again, did he?

191
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,910
No, it was fine.

192
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,710
We talked a bit, and he
was actually pretty nice.

193
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,960
Yes! He really is!

194
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,670
I'm so glad you get it!

195
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:38,210
He started acting weirdly intimidating
around our second year of middle school,

196
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,420
and he couldn't make any friends.

197
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,680
I tried introducing him to
some guys I knew, but...

198
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,140
Rrrr...

199
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:49,140
They were all too scared
of him to be his friend.

200
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:53,730
I knew you'd understand him, though!

201
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,270
You're not like all those wusses!

202
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,190
I can't tell her that I'm
actually terrified of him.

203
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,950
Jun is a super nice guy,

204
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:05,620
but he doesn't see me as a girl at all.

205
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,330
Would it kill him to be
a little considerate?

206
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:08,990
Huh?

207
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,040
Actually, I think he probably knows.

208
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,670
I mean, he—

209
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,250
Senpai!

210
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:20,260
Looks like you two are
having fun. Can I join in?

211
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,270
S-Sorry...

212
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,970
I'm sorry!

213
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:26,300
They're such good friends now!

214
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:32,060
Let's Go

215
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:32,060
on a Date!

216
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,680
"Let's Go on a Date!"

217
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,480
So, be honest... What do
you think of Aizawa Tomo?

218
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,480
L-Like, whatever.

219
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,190
I mean, she's a girl.
She even, like, wears a skirt.

220
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:47,620
I know, right? That skirt is just wrong!

221
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,660
No matter how boyish she looks...

222
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,290
Hey!

223
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,500
It's Mifune and Ogawa!

224
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:59,000
What a coincidence!
You guys come here a lot, too?

225
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Sh...

226
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,960
She's wearing pants!

227
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,960
She's wearing, like, pants!

228
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,800
That's just wrong!

229
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,090
So, like, not fair...

230
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,430
What's wrong?

231
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:11,680
Those two should've joined us.

232
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,020
Why'd they just leave?

233
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,520
Because you're dressed like that.

234
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,110
More importantly, have you hung
out with Junichiro recently?

235
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,400
You haven't, have you?

236
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,410
We've barely hung out since we
started high school, actually.

237
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:35,870
He invites me out now and then,
but I get weirdly self-conscious.

238
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:39,000
You pick the most inconvenient
times to be all girly.

239
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,790
If you put him off too much,

240
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:44,420
he might find someone else
to spend his time with.

241
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,880
I don't want that!

242
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,640
Then you should be the one
to invite him out next time.

243
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:52,890
But not to the bowling alley or
batting center like you always do.

244
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,100
Wh-What's wrong with those?

245
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,310
Everything.

246
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:02,110
Why don't you act like students and go
shopping for clothes or do karaoke for once?

247
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,650
Me and... Jun?

248
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,160
That feels so unnatural.

249
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,120
Try inviting him yourself
over our next break.

250
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,790
You've kept him waiting
in place for so long,

251
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,420
I bet he'll come running
to you wagging his tail.

252
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,460
C'mon, he's not a dog.

253
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,340
Hey, Jun...

254
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:31,050
Over our next break...
if you're free, I mean...

255
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:34,390
Do you want to, um...
go hang out with me somewhere?

256
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,850
For real?!

257
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,100
Huh?

258
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,940
Oh, man, it's been forever!

259
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,560
Where? Where are we gonna go?!

260
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,610
Well, Tomo? Where are we gonna go?

261
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,610
H-He really is just a big dog!

262
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,280
You get it, right?

263
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,910
You can't think of it as just hanging out.

264
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,240
You're going on a date.

265
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:53,950
R-Right!

266
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,450
So...

267
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,910
Can I go, too?

268
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,420
Just kidding!

269
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,380
We'll go buy you some clothes after school.

270
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,340
You only own boys' clothes, right?

271
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,220
Huh? What I have should be fine.

272
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,680
Absolutely not.

273
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,510
Hey, Tomo-chan.

274
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:17,220
Saying you'll go on a date in
boys' clothes is a joke, right?

275
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,890
Fine. I'll go buy something.

276
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,950
What kind of outfit should we get?

277
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:34,490
Let's see... Maybe we should
start with something boyish?

278
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,580
Really? Not something girlish?

279
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,830
If we do that,

280
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,870
she'll be too uncomfortable
to think about the date.

281
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:45,540
Besides, he'd probably take off
running the moment he saw her.

282
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,260
So taking her from "a boy at first glance"

283
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:53,010
to "a girl with some boyish
features" is the way to go.

284
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,140
That sounds like a pain.

285
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,760
You got that right.

286
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,140
What kinds of shoes do you have, again?

287
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,170
Well, uh...

288
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,940
All I have are sneakers.

289
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,650
A red pair and a white pair...

290
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,650
I think white would be better.

291
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:08,860
I agree.

292
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:13,950
How about a simple, boyish outfit
that's sporty but a little girlish?

293
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,070
Let's go with that.

294
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,530
What do you think?

295
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:20,040
Huh?! Oh, uh, let's do that, then.

296
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:25,540
Oh! How about denim gaucho pants?

297
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,840
A white pullover would
probably go best with that.

298
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,810
I-Is fashion this hard to keep up with?

299
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,470
Thanks for helping me out, both of you.

300
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,680
I'll do something to thank you.

301
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,170
You don't need to worry about that.

302
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:42,640
I only did what I could as your best friend.

303
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,650
We're friends, aren't we?

304
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,020
You guys...

305
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:51,740
Just tell us every last detail of
everything that happens on your date,

306
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,150
and we'll call it even.

307
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,660
Looking forward to it!

308
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,370
R-Right...

309
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,910
I think they just formed a
powerful new tag team.

310
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:07,380
Sorry, Jun. Were you waiting long?

311
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,720
What's wrong?

312
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,340
Okay, well, shall we go?

313
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,510
Y-Yeah.

314
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,220
Batting Center

315
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,220
Man, it's been ages

316
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,430
since the last time I came here with you!

317
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,270
Shoot...

318
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,270
This is just turning out like the usual.

319
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:32,030
Wait, isn't this the spot where the
pitches can hit 160 kilometers per hour?

320
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:35,740
Yeah. That's about the speed
I've been hitting lately.

321
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:40,120
We were both hitting at 120 kilometers
per hour not long ago...

322
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,660
There's no way I can hit 160.

323
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,620
Try hitting one, Tomo.

324
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,960
Nice batting!

325
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,550
Tanaka Bowling

326
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:55,050
We haven't been here in ages, either.

327
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,970
We're just following the
same plan we used to!

328
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:58,510
Dude!

329
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,760
That one's 16 pounds!

330
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,270
Yeah. This is what I've been using lately.

331
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:07,100
He was using a lighter ball before.

332
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,730
I can't even lift one that heavy.

333
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,610
Wanna try this one out?

334
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,900
Strike!

335
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,940
No! I gotta change something up!

336
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,250
H-Hey, you wanna do karaoke
or something next?

337
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,290
Sure, why not?

338
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,920
I guess not, huh? But, y'know, every once in a—

339
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,040
Wait, what?!

340
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,880
Huh, so this is how it works?

341
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,130
I thought a place like this
would be... louder and busier.

342
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,550
This room is so small and dark.

343
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,010
Go on. Sit next to him.

344
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,890
Get all up against him!

345
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:46,890
What's wrong?

346
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,060
Aren't you gonna sing?

347
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,020
Sing?! No way in hell I'm gonna sing!

348
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,530
Why did we come here, then?

349
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,990
W-Well, why did you agree
to come here so quickly?

350
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,160
You never cared about karaoke before.

351
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,490
'Cause you said you wanted to go.

352
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,410
Huh?

353
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:10,960
Ever since we were kids, you only
ever wanted to do reckless stuff.

354
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:14,460
Frankly, I just let you coerce
me into going along at first,

355
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,960
but I was scared out of my mind.

356
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,380
You were?!

357
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:23,010
But when I just tried doing what
you asked, it was always fun.

358
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,850
That's why you're the best!

359
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:31,150
That's right... Jun just came
along today to have fun.

360
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,600
Yet I've been...

361
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,860
I can't keep going like this!

362
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,400
I gotta do something,

363
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,990
Oh, gonna sing something?

364
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,320
or this whole day will be ruined!

365
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,280
The Rolling Acorn

366
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,740
I can't sit around being embarrassed!

367
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:49,620
Roll, roll, roll, went the acorn...

368
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,830
Right into the pond! Oh, no!

369
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:58,130
Along came a loach, saying, "Hello there!"

370
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:02,220
"Come play with me, little one!"

371
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,090
Huh?

372
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,060
You're up next!

373
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,680
Don't laugh!

374
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:14,150
Sorry... That just wasn't
what I expected at all.

375
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,770
But seriously, a children's song?

376
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,070
You really are the best!

377
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,900
Sh-Shut up, you jerk!

378
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,620
So when Junichiro wasn't willing to sing,

379
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,290
you just sang children's songs
for three hours and went home?

380
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,330
I was so embarrassed, I thought I'd die!

381
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,750
He even shot a video of me!

382
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,710
It sounds like it went great, though.

383
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:42,760
I'm not so sure. Sounds like the
wrong way to have fun to me.

384
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,180
I guess I should delete the video.

385
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,850
Junichiro.

386
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:49,640
Huh?

387
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,180
Show us the video.

388
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:59,230
You guys!

389
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:05,360
"Come play with me, little one!"

390
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,200
That whole day, there was...

391
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:09,120
Hey! Why are you filming me?!

392
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,660
...something different about her.

393
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:53,020
My feelings drift through the starry sky,

394
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:56,090
so far away...

395
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,420
She's a natural...

396
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:01,470
They won't reach you, but...

397
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,570
You're so good, Misuzu-chan!

398
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,480
Bounce with me, bounce with me

399
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,240
All the sanity is sin, sin, sin here

400
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,360
She's so good at singing in English!

401
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,400
Bounce with me, bounce with me

402
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,990
I almost forgot she wasn't Japanese.

403
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,990
Move it down, up, down, up,
keepin' it up, boys...

404
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:14,230
Boom, boom! Boom, boom! Boom, boom!

405
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:16,760
Your turn, Tomo-chan.

406
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,060
Well, you're up, Queen of Children's Songs.

407
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,990
P-Please spare me!

408
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:26,710
The cat scratched me, the cat scratched me,

409
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,880
the cat was startled and scratched me!

410
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,540
I stepped on the cat, I stepped on the cat,

411
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,970
I stepped on the cat, and it scratched me!

412
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:36,340
The cat scratched me, the cat scratched me,

413
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,470
the cat was startled and scratched me!
