1
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:15,990
When I throw a jab or a straight, it always lands

2
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,120
But when I'm aiming for your heart, I miss every time

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,460
Parallel, zigzagging, awkward, incoherent

4
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,960
When you look my way and move closer to me

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,720
I know it doesn't mean the same thing for you

6
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,770
But I wish we could stay like this forever

7
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:47,900
My changing feelings are driving me crazy

8
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:53,190
The moment you turn to face me, take that! Telepathy

9
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,660
If only we could feel the same thing

10
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,540
I want to kick this pesky subtlety away

11
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:09,540
I want to know everything, I want to know everything

12
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,090
I can't fool you forever

13
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,720
I can't keep this hidden

14
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,470
I want to shout out my secret, AHHH

15
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,930
Take that! Telepathy

16
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,390
Te-te-te-telepathy

17
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,480
Telepathy

18
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,990
Goodbye, Best Friend

19
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,900
"Goodbye, Best Friend."

20
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,740
Cultural Festival

21
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,740
Uenomizu High School

22
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,240
Cultural Festival

23
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,500
I can't wait to see Tomo and
the other kids in the play.

24
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,830
Yes!

25
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:52,250
I'm so glad I got to meet Tomo-chan's
and Misuzu-chan's moms.

26
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,420
I don't think I'd be able to hold
myself back if I was alone.

27
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,470
I'll be counting on you both!

28
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,760
To do what, now?

29
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,560
Never thought I'd see you at
a cultural festival, though.

30
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,810
I guess even you love
your own daughter, huh?

31
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,020
She told me there wouldn't be
a cultural festival this year.

32
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,820
Huh? Why would she lie about that?

33
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,780
I guess she really didn't want me seeing her.

34
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,030
Which is why I came... to film it.

35
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,910
It's what she gets for lying to her mother.

36
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,540
She really can't just be honest and say she
wants to film her daughter's performance?

37
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,210
Once upon a time, in a land far away,
there lived a young girl.

38
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,460
Her name was Cinderella.

39
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,050
Her stepmother and stepsisters
were very mean to her.

40
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,180
They forced her to do housework
every single day without rest.

41
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,800
Poor, pitiful Cinderella!

42
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,930
Sob, sob. Sob, sob. Sob, sob.

43
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,850
I wouldn't call her "pitiful"...

44
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,600
She looks like she's out for blood.

45
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,530
Have you finished the cleaning, Cinderella?

46
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,530
Carol-chan!

47
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,990
This is what you wanted us for?!

48
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,280
Oh, I wish I could go to the ball, too.

49
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:11,000
I want to dance in a beautiful dress,
like Mother and my sisters!

50
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,460
Oh?

51
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,630
No one's realized that he's there.

52
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,970
He's completely concealed his presence
and melted into the scenery.

53
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,100
He is most definitely a tree!

54
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,890
Thank you, everyone,
for coming to see me today.

55
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,400
What a beautiful lady you are.

56
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,910
Would you dance with me?

57
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,830
I will.

58
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,500
Tomo...

59
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,790
You really are...

60
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,340
a prince to the core.

61
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,840
But I bet you wish you could be a
princess sometimes, too, right?

62
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,050
I swear...

63
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,640
Just try being the one who has
to deal with you all the time.

64
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,600
I was the one who instilled in you

65
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,390
the sort of values that made you
think you'd rather be a princess.

66
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,230
It's not how you really feel.

67
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,190
But all of it is who you are, including that.

68
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,450
I've finally found you,
owner of the glass slipper.

69
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,950
Will you marry me?

70
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,870
Congratulations, Cinderella!

71
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,750
I'm so upset, but congratulations!

72
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,000
Congratulations!

73
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,120
Huh?!

74
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,250
You're supposed to be furious about this.

75
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,090
Congrats, Cinderella! I wish you happiness!

76
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,300
Congratulations!

77
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,510
Congratulations!

78
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,800
What's going on?

79
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,510
I mean, I guess it's all good.

80
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,890
We've been through a lot,
but it was fun, huh?

81
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,350
That's true.

82
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,640
This wasn't such a bad punishment.

83
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,530
We Ain't Right

84
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,530
Yeah! We pulled it off!

85
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,860
You did great, Tomo.

86
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,660
Wanna walk around the festival with me?

87
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,660
Oh... Sure, but...

88
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,290
You can take that thing off now.

89
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,580
Maid Café

90
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,670
W-Welcome, master!

91
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,300
Th-This cake is our top recommendation.

92
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,340
Like, on the house!

93
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,840
Wow, really?

94
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,970
Way to go, Tomo.

95
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,760
Here.

96
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,640
The coffee you ordered.

97
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,100
Drink it and, like, get the hell outta here.

98
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,810
Huh?

99
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:38,150
Welcome Home, Master

100
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,400
Haunted House

101
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,990
Hey, relax! The ghost is gone!

102
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:56,660
Damn it!

103
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,250
How did I lose all three rounds?!

104
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:03,170
Heh! Try challenging me
again in about ten years!

105
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,420
We're going one more round
once we're done eating!

106
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,880
I won't lose this time!

107
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,300
Sounds fun! I accept!

108
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,060
Yeah, being with him is still a total blast!

109
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,100
But I'm thinking of ending what we have.

110
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,310
Is that really what I want?

111
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,440
Isn't this fun, Ko-chan?

112
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,070
Yeah...

113
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,530
Aizawa-san! Please dance with me!

114
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,780
And then me!

115
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,830
Me, too! Me, too!

116
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,580
Whoa, hang—

117
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,540
Tomo... You wanna dance with me?

118
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,670
Huh?! W-Well, sure, I guess...

119
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,840
Wh-What?! Stop clapping!

120
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:50,090
What am I expecting will happen
if I stand around here?

121
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,430
Hey, Misuzu-chan. Do you
wanna dance with me?

122
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,100
What? Didn't you hear me?

123
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,350
They both have someone to spend
the festival after-party with.

124
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,230
They don't have time to waste on m—

125
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,900
Sorry. Have you been waiting?

126
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,610
I suppose I should thank you.

127
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,070
So thanks.

128
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,450
Huh? For what?

129
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,410
Did I do something?

130
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,250
Don't play dumb with me.

131
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:22,790
You got me the Cinderella role so
I'd make up with Tomo, didn't you?

132
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,840
You were fighting?

133
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,340
Huh?

134
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,300
This is all I was after.

135
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,010
Give me that! I'm deleting it!

136
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,550
No!

137
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,600
Th-This is more embarrassing than I expected.

138
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,310
Yeah... it is.

139
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,730
Never thought you'd ask me to dance.

140
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:44,360
I know you were just asking as a friend,

141
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,320
but y'know, if you ask me like
that in front of people,

142
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,110
they might get the wrong idea.

143
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,950
It's not... wrong.

144
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,120
Huh?

145
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,160
They wouldn't be wrong.

146
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,710
Huh? Tomo-chan?

147
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,040
Tomo?

148
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:18,930
It's cold...

149
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,180
Morning, Jun!

150
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,060
Don't get all shriveled up just 'cause it's cold!

151
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,770
Get those spirits up and let's go!

152
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,230
Tomo's been like this ever since that day.

153
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,740
At a glance, she just seems
super energetic, but...

154
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,700
So then, y'know what Misuzu did?

155
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:38,370
Hey, Tomo, about the after-party...

156
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:42,750
O-Oh, yeah! I just remembered I need to
get to school early to do something!

157
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:50,800
Should I take this as a rejection?

158
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,010
Morning, Misuzu-chan!

159
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,050
Good morning.

160
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,220
Look at this, Tomo-chan! I'm hugging her,
and she's not getting mad!

161
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,180
It's a miracle!

162
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,650
Well, Misuzu really hates being cold.

163
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,940
You must be warming her up by hugging her.

164
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,280
I wish it'd stay winter forever!

165
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,740
Hey, where's Jun-kun?

166
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,500
He didn't come with you today?

167
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,460
Huh? O-Oh, yeah...

168
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,080
He came with me part of the
way, b-but stuff happened...

169
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,170
Hey, Tomo-chan, did something happen
between you two at the cultural festival?

170
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,510
Huh?! B-Between me and Jun?!

171
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:39,800
N-No, nothing at all! So much nothing
that it's killing me, actually!

172
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,100
Something did happen.

173
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,690
I knew it.

174
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,190
Junichiro probably said something that
amounted to confessing his feelings,

175
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,520
and she chose to run away from him.

176
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,990
Why, though? Their feelings
were finally mutual.

177
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,400
Why? I mean...

178
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,370
Morning, Jun-kun.

179
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,830
Oh, hey.

180
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,790
Is something wrong?

181
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,720
The thing is... there's someone I like.

182
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,640
Wait, are you saying it's...

183
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,430
It's Tomo.

184
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,100
What'd you do that for?

185
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,600
S-Sorry! I was just so happy,
I couldn't stop myself!

186
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,860
So... what do you think I should do?

187
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,530
Well...

188
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:39,150
If I told you there was a good way
to handle it, would you do it?

189
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:45,540
I think the best thing you can do is
tell her straight-up that you like her.

190
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,290
I think that's the thing that'll
work best for you two.

191
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,880
Wait, did I sound kinda patronizing there?

192
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,420
No.

193
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,720
Thank you for the advice.

194
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,090
No, it was nothing!

195
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:05,260
To be honest, I'm not really in any
position to give anyone love advice.

196
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,810
I'm only going out with Carol now
because someone set the stage for me.

197
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:14,060
I didn't do any of the work on my own.

198
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,280
So now that she's accepted me
even knowing that's how I am,

199
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:23,160
I want to get all the feelings across
to her that I never could before.

200
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,950
Telling someone you like
them isn't easy to do.

201
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,540
It's really scary, even.

202
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,410
So let's both give it our all.

203
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,170
Right.

204
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,420
I've decided what to do.

205
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,670
I'm going to tell her how I feel up-front.

206
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:44,430
But there are some steps I need to take first.

207
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:53,440
Got a minute to talk, Gundo?

208
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,650
Gundo...

209
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:04,450
Sorry. I'm in love with Tomo.

210
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,570
Huh?

211
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,700
What does that have to do with me?

212
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,410
Just... sorry.

213
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,080
What are you apologizing for?

214
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:15,830
I'm pretty sure, ever since
you and I went out...

215
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:18,750
No, even before that, I already loved her.

216
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:24,590
So I realize it's selfish of me
to tell you I love her now.

217
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:32,430
Wait... Are you saying that's why you
couldn't be more proactive with Tomo?

218
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,350
That's not all of it, but...

219
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:37,940
I can't believe he was
still worried about me.

220
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,110
I swear, he's such a...

221
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:43,740
Hey, you okay? Does your head hurt?

222
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,990
Don't get cocky!

223
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:49,450
Do you think our brief relationship
happened at your discretion?

224
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:53,080
I picked it up and I threw it away!

225
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,620
It was my mistake!

226
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,670
A huge mistake.

227
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:00,090
If you're being considerate of me,
forget about it right now.

228
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:00,880
Got it?

229
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,630
Y-Yeah...

230
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,590
Thanks.

231
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,470
Huh? I didn't do anything to be thanked for.

232
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,310
No, not just for today.

233
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,940
You've always been pretty good at
looking out for others, y'know?

234
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,060
It's just a feeling,

235
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:21,230
but I'm pretty sure I only made
it to this point because of you.

236
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:22,940
Am I wrong?

237
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:26,740
I swear. He and Tomo both...

238
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,200
I disagree.

239
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,830
Thanks for hearing me out.

240
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,410
Let's head back to class.

241
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,290
Wait.

242
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,710
Tell me one last thing.

243
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,210
Was I...

244
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,340
your first love?

245
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,340
F-First love?!

246
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,050
No... you weren't.

247
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,760
I see. So I wasn't your first, then.

248
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:53,390
Incidentally, I've never
been in love with anyone.

249
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,980
Oh, is that so?!

250
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,480
I really can't stand you!

251
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,280
What's this?

252
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,780
Letter of Challenge

253
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,790
A challenge letter?!

254
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,830
Yo! What idiot tried to
pick a fight with me?!

255
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,840
J-Jun?! You tricked me!

256
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,880
Yep.

257
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,300
I didn't think you'd actually
fall for it, though.

258
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,510
It's all over! I can't get away!

259
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:32,810
Tomo...

260
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:34,970
Please...

261
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,020
Please hit me!

262
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,850
Wha?!

263
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:41,610
And why do I have to hit you?

264
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,440
Because I deserve to be hit.

265
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,650
What the hell?!

266
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:48,740
I don't have any reason to...

267
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,660
Right after we started high school,

268
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,490
when we were standing
under those cherry trees,

269
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,410
you told me you loved me.

270
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,410
I love you, Jun!

271
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,960
Huh?

272
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:04,500
You didn't just mean "as a friend," did you?

273
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:10,930
You realized I was confessing to you?

274
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:11,840
Yeah.

275
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,390
You knew how I felt?

276
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,220
That's right.

277
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,890
And you knew...

278
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,900
that I was trying so hard to
be more girly just for you...

279
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,860
and you were just ignoring it?!

280
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,570
You were trying to be more girly... for me?

281
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:29,110
S-Sorry... I didn't know about tha—

282
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,370
Ow...

283
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,660
I hit him.

284
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,580
I don't even have any right to hit him.

285
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,750
I can understand wanting to
run away painfully well.

286
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,800
Jun must have been afraid, too.

287
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:53,550
But right now, he's looking right
at me and not running away.

288
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:57,100
I'm the one running away now!

289
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,730
Wait!

290
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:06,770
I know your feelings might
have changed by now.

291
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,280
But even if they have, I still...

292
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,450
love you!

293
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:14,450
Shut up, dumbass!

294
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,120
Dumbass?!

295
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,830
Dumbass...

296
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,830
I blew it!

297
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,840
So then you called him a
dumbass and ran away, huh?

298
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,340
I mean... I just freaked out!

299
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,970
"Dumbass" was just mean, though.

300
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,340
Quit rubbing salt in the wound!

301
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:39,140
You know you love each other now.
You should just go out.

302
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,520
What does "going out" even mean?

303
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,350
Huh?

304
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,810
What makes it different
from the way we are now?

305
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:47,520
How are Jun and I supposed to be?

306
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,610
Is everything just gonna work out,
even though I don't understand anything?

307
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,030
What if I screw it up?

308
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,410
Tomo...

309
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,580
You've always called me your best friend,

310
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,870
but this is the first time we've
really faced each other head-on.

311
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,920
Tomo...

312
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:11,760
I want you to listen carefully
to what I'm about to tell you.

313
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,590
Huh?

314
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:15,380
Because I'm pretty sure I'll
only be able to say it once.

315
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,140
I'm sorry.

316
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:30,270
What's going on between you and
Junichiro now is all my fault.

317
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:33,530
Huh? No way! I should be thanking you for—

318
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,610
You shouldn't.

319
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:38,160
There was never any need to force
yourself to be more girly.

320
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,410
You were just fine the way you were.

321
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:47,290
No one ever... wanted you to change.

322
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,960
M-Misu—

323
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,790
A-A-Are you... crying?!

324
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:51,880
I am not.

325
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,550
Sorry, Misuzu.

326
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,720
I guess I kinda backed you into a corner.

327
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,600
I put myself in a corner. That's all.

328
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,390
But more importantly...

329
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:08,980
Just go to him and settle all this.

330
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,360
Like you always do. Right?

331
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,070
Misuzu...

332
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,450
I'm so glad you're my best friend!

333
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,110
Yeah, yeah.

334
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,160
Love sure is nice.

335
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,790
With the one you love, you can
be stubborn, cry, throw a fit...

336
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,340
And they'll understand that
that's just the way it goes.

337
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,840
My feelings are so incomprehensible,
no one would ever understand them.

338
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:43,640
I don't think it matters whether
someone's a friend or a love interest.

339
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,850
It's okay to have lots of
different types of love.

340
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:51,190
You and I are just friends,

341
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,980
but I still want to kiss you.

342
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,520
Get off me.

343
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,740
Jun!

344
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,200
Tomo?

345
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:03,240
Sorry about before! I won't run away again!

346
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,500
So just give me one more... one more chance!

347
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:14,920
I just want to make sure I understood.

348
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:20,050
So you really... l-love me?

349
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,840
Yes, I do!

350
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,930
Really?!

351
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:23,850
Yes!

352
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,260
Really for real?!

353
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,470
Yes, for real!

354
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,600
Jun really, actually loves me!

355
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,270
As a man... and he loves me as a girl!

356
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:37,940
I never thought this day would come!
It feels like a dream!

357
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,280
But that also means...

358
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,700
You're really sure about that?

359
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,530
Huh?

360
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:49,250
After today, you and I might
not be best buds anymore.

361
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,040
You're okay with that?

362
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,130
Not best buds anymore? Why?

363
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,710
Are you saying you don't wanna...
g-go out with me?!

364
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,050
I'm not saying that!

365
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:01,380
So we can't stay best buds, then, can we?!

366
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,800
I don't wanna quit that, either!

367
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,470
How selfish can you be?!

368
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,970
What do you want us to be, then?!

369
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,270
Well, I mean...

370
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,810
For example...

371
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,230
Ready... go!

372
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:15,900
Huh?!

373
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,150
Hey! Wait up, damn it!

374
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,450
I still can't beat you, huh?

375
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,660
Wh-Why the hell did you suddenly take off?

376
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,250
This is what I want.

377
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,340
This is the relationship
I want to have with you.

378
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,090
Huh?

379
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:44,930
Even if you and I get together as a couple,

380
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,890
I still want us to compete with
each other, like we always have.

381
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:53,640
Well, sure, I have fun competing
with you, too, but...

382
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,900
Is that how it's supposed to be
when a guy and a girl go out?

383
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,190
Maybe it's not actually that simple.

384
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,110
But...

385
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:06,160
I still want to treasure all
the time we've spent together.

386
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:13,040
You're my childhood friend,
my best bud, my rival, and...

387
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,620
the girl I love.

388
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,590
Is that not good enough?

389
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:26,760
Your best bud, your rival, and
your girlfriend? What the heck?

390
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:31,350
But maybe... if it's okay to be that selfish...

391
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,180
Jun!

392
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,920
Jun, I...

393
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,030
love you, too!

394
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,960
Jun!

395
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,570
Hey!

396
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,820
Answer me! You alive?!

397
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,480
Yes!

398
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,960
What?!

399
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,960
Yes!

400
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,600
(This suspicious behavior is...)

401
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,900
Hey, you know, I'm all mixed up

402
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:23,360
It's too complicated, I'm freaking out

403
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,900
I want to look cute to you

404
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:29,240
(crazy, crazy, drive me crazy, and that's…)

405
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,530
So I'm plotting, bargaining,
sly, and stubborn

406
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:33,040
Dizzying love

407
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,620
Just tell him to look at you

408
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:43,590
And watch him stiffen up even more,
because you're both so awkward

409
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:47,470
What? Even if we're alike in that way

410
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:52,050
It doesn't make me happy, 'cause it
means our love is going nowhere

411
00:22:52,050 --> 00:23:00,940
Cloudy heart, swirling emotions—
I sense rain coming

412
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:10,030
So I partly open my umbrella,
then sneakily scoot closer to you

413
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:13,990
Please notice the curl of my
eyelashes as I keep blinking

414
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:18,910
And don't say I'm acting weird

415
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:22,880
All this plotting and bargaining
is my sly plan to look cute to you

416
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,920
Try to solve the riddle of
this soft, dizzying love

417
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:30,050
(Buzzing, fidgeting)

418
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:34,850
Listen, I might be a bit
tangled in my own web now

419
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:38,890
But once you unravel the mystery,
you'll see pure lo-love
