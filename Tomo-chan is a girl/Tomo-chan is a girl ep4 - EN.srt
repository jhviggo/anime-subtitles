1
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:15,990
When I throw a jab or a straight,
it always lands

2
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,120
But when I'm aiming for your heart,
I miss every time

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,460
Parallel, zigzagging, awkward, incoherent

4
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,960
When you look my way and move closer to me

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,720
I know it doesn't mean the same thing for you

6
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,770
But I wish we could stay like this forever

7
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:47,900
My changing feelings are driving me crazy

8
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:53,190
The moment you turn to face me,
take that! Telepathy

9
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,660
If only we could feel the same thing

10
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,540
I want to kick this pesky subtlety away

11
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:09,540
I want to know everything,
I want to know everything

12
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,090
I can't fool you forever

13
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,720
I can't keep this hidden

14
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,470
I want to shout out my secret, AHHH

15
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,930
Take that! Telepathy

16
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,390
Te-te-te-telepathy

17
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,480
Telepathy

18
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,990
The Reason for

19
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,990
Her Smile

20
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,860
"The Reason for Her Smile."

21
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,580
Morning, Misuzu-chan!
Nice morning, isn't it?

22
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,450
Good morning.

23
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,290
Yes! She didn't ignore me today!

24
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:46,410
And you...

25
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:48,870
are who, again?

26
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,420
I'm your classmate, Tanabe!

27
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,510
I really wanna see her smile.

28
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,220
Misuzu-chan never smiles at all, you know?

29
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:05,430
Nothing wrong with being expressionless,
but what would make her smile?

30
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,690
What are you talking about?
She smiles all the time.

31
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:09,900
Huh?! No way!

32
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,440
In fact, she's almost always
smiling when she talks to me.

33
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,860
She's so damn mean-spirited.

34
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,400
For real?!

35
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,110
Man, I'm so jealous!

36
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,200
Childhood friends have a
totally different experience!

37
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,870
m 115 282 l 116 334 296 334 295 281

38
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,870
Tanabe's Image

39
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,870
m 340 283 l 340 334 494 335 494 284

40
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,870
Reality

41
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,160
Hey, Gundo smiles a lot, right?

42
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,790
Does she? I haven't seen
her smile that much.

43
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,080
What's going on?

44
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,840
Why are you asking me?

45
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,630
Could it be because Misuzu likes Jun?

46
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,890
Tanabe-kun, mechanical pencils...

47
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,350
are pretty sharp, you know.

48
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,180
A wise decision.

49
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,520
Oh, yeah! So, Misuzu-chan,

50
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,690
I heard this funny story...

51
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,290
What the heck happened to you?

52
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,000
Misuzu-chan did it.

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,010
You said something weird
to her again, didn't you?

54
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,510
You never learn.

55
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,090
I didn't say anything.

56
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,970
Huh? Then why...

57
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,930
I tried to kiss her on the cheek.

58
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,730
Mwah!

59
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,350
You're lucky all she did
was put tape on you.

60
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,820
Misuzu-chan, what's it gonna
take to make you smile?

61
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,900
Oh, you were trying to make me smile?

62
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,160
Tanabe-kun, do you like me?

63
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,330
Yeah! A lot!

64
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,660
Then stop fooling around
and approach me seriously.

65
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,120
If you do that...

66
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,210
I'll shoot you down with a smile.

67
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,510
Man, she's so great!

68
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,970
So Jun said you smile
around him all the time.

69
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,770
Does that mean... you actually...

70
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,350
It does not.

71
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,900
Then again...

72
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,650
Depending on one's point of view,
it could be said that I like him.

73
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,070
Wha?!

74
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:25,240
Junichiro always has serious
thoughts on his mind.

75
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,830
Even when he's laughing and
goofing off around you,

76
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:33,830
I bet he's constantly thinking about
something completely different.

77
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,840
He's such a delightful guy.

78
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,800
Oh... There's a smile.

79
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,720
I Want to Be Playful Like a Girl

80
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,430
"I Want to Be Playful Like a Girl."

81
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,390
Morning!

82
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,390
C'mon, cut that out!

83
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,810
Sorry!

84
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,440
I wanna try glomping a girl like that, too.

85
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,940
Tomo, have you finally...

86
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,570
Huh?! "Finally" what?!

87
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,650
I just mean hugging and holding
hands and stuff with friends.

88
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:07,030
Y'know, girly stuff. I wanna try
interacting with a friend like that.

89
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,660
Oh?

90
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,040
You always act strangely familiar with girls,

91
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,120
so I thought you'd be a natural at that.

92
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,960
I have tried it before.

93
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,040
Like, when I got to be good
friends with someone,

94
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,880
I'd put my arm around her shoulder.

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,470
But every girl I do that with suddenly
starts acting all distant again.

96
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,220
Why is that?

97
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,680
I feel sorry for all of them, too.

98
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,600
Come to think of it, we've been friends
for over ten years, haven't we?

99
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,020
Yes, because our mothers
were childhood friends.

100
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,110
We've been close since we were born.

101
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,530
I don't remember that, though.

102
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:49,240
I think we've been friends long enough
to try doing stuff like that.

103
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,200
Long enough?

104
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,330
Just once! Let's try it just once!

105
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,830
I won't hurt you!

106
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,210
I was fine with it, but when you
put it that way, I don't want to.

107
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,210
Huh?!

108
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,550
Tomo-chan!

109
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,380
What?

110
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,050
You want to hug, right?

111
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,090
Huh?

112
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,550
Misuzu told her...

113
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,720
You're sure?

114
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,430
Sure!

115
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,140
O-Okay, then...

116
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,520
Wh-What is this?!

117
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,280
She's so thin...

118
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,990
and soft...

119
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,950
And she smells nice.

120
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:33,280
So this is... a girl.

121
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,130
Maybe I'm really not a girl after all.

122
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,960
Relax.

123
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,250
That one's made special.

124
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:51,510
If Carol is special, then what
are other girls like?

125
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:58,600
Hmm... You're pretty girly, too, Mifune.

126
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,850
Wh-Where the hell did that come from?!

127
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:02,860
What about you, Ogawa?

128
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,020
L-Like, what about me?!

129
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,490
Tomo-chan!

130
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,780
Tomo-chan, let's play together.

131
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,330
Morning, Tomo-chan!

132
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,750
H-Hey, morning.

133
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,960
Hey, Misuzu! Morning!

134
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,010
Good morning.

135
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,590
She seems pretty grumpy today.

136
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,020
I guess she's still mad.

137
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,270
She seems the same as always to me.

138
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:46,110
Nah. If you wanna be Misuzu's friend,
you should learn this.

139
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:50,320
First of all, when she's angry,
her facial expression changes a tiny bit.

140
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:51,400
Uh-huh.

141
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,910
And the way she acts is
slightly different, too.

142
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,330
Angry

143
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,330
Not Angry

144
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,280
Huh...

145
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,280
She just gives off a different aura.

146
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,330
Oh!

147
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,040
That's how she is.

148
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,580
I don't get it.

149
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,670
What is Misuzu-chan angry about?

150
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:12,420
She started acting like that after I said
I wanted more girly interaction yesterday...

151
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,390
But she's not the type to get
mad over something like that.

152
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:17,760
Oh.

153
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,470
Huh?

154
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,310
It might be my fault.

155
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,270
I'm sorry!

156
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,610
I always mess up when I'm happy.

157
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,110
You think I was bothering Tomo-chan, too?

158
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,860
So you are aware of it, at least.

159
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,530
But you don't need to
apologize for anything.

160
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,540
The one to blame is...

161
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,660
a certain someone who keeps pestering her

162
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,040
to get her attention.

163
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,250
Whoever it is, they sound like a child.

164
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,340
True.

165
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,010
I'm sorry I made you feel bad.

166
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:58,300
There was something going on
that I personally didn't like,

167
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,010
and I took it out on you.

168
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,310
Okay...

169
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:04,270
You're being unusually open right now.

170
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,190
Well, I'm not a child.

171
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,610
Did something happen?

172
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:14,070
The physical contact you were
talking about yesterday...

173
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,660
I wouldn't mind doing a little bit of that.

174
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,950
Really?!

175
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:24,960
Jeez, come on! If you were interested,
you should've said so from the start!

176
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,960
We're best friends, aren't we?

177
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,340
This annoys me more than I expected.

178
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,920
Want me to just strangle you now?

179
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,550
Come to think of it...

180
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:39,090
Why don't you ever try to hug Junichiro?

181
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,390
Huh?!

182
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:43,560
I mean, if that was something
I could do, I'd like to, but...

183
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,980
It's not that simple.

184
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,520
What are you talking about?

185
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:52,650
He doesn't even hesitate to get touchy
and clingy with you for no reason.

186
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,650
Why would it cause problems
if you were to hug him?

187
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:56,860
Oh!

188
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,320
Don't tell me...

189
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,780
You never realized that before now?

190
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,040
You're kidding me.

191
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,170
There's Jun!

192
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,050
All right!

193
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,720
Here I go!

194
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,010
Heya, Jun!

195
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,350
Let's walk home together!

196
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,360
H-Hey! Jun!

197
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,530
You're in high school now, y'know.
You can't do stuff like that.

198
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,490
Huh?!

199
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,280
What?!

200
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,370
But you do that to me all the time!

201
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,950
I do that?

202
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,790
You sure as hell do!

203
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,790
Okay, maybe I do, then.

204
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,840
It's fine when I do it, but you? Not okay.

205
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,670
Got it?

206
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,710
No, I don't!

207
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,720
Damn it! Damn it! Damn you!

208
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,220
I like Tomo-chan a lot, too,
but Jun-kun is really unfair.

209
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,060
What are you saying?

210
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,140
I'm saying...

211
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,270
I want to be your number one.

212
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,230
Huh?

213
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,360
Oh, I mean your number one friend.

214
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,740
I know that.

215
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:27,950
Heroes Fall a Lot

216
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,080
"Heroes Fall a Lot."

217
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,710
Hey, Tomo! Wake up!

218
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,130
Keep it down.

219
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,130
Finally awake?

220
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,090
Still not a morning person, are ya?

221
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,020
What the hell are you doing in my room?!

222
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:54,480
Your dad told me to come wake you up!

223
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,820
Whatever! Just get out!

224
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:01,200
C'mon, Tomo, why are you so angry?

225
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,700
Shut up, idiot!

226
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,740
Hey, you two.

227
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,950
What's all the ruckus so
early in the morning?

228
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,540
You even woke me up.

229
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,380
Sorry, Mom.

230
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,750
Morning, Mrs. Aizawa!

231
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,710
I think you mean "Akemi-san"!

232
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:22,260
Sorry... I thought by now I should...

233
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,680
What's that supposed to mean?

234
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,140
Did you make this?

235
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,560
Yeah! Looks tasty, huh?

236
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,350
Well, it looks... original, for sure.

237
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,860
You think so?!

238
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,650
These fish are kinda tough.

239
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:43,990
They're dried sardines!

240
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,570
They make your bones stronger,
so I put in a bunch of them!

241
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,950
Might be good for
strengthening your jaw, too.

242
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,290
Right?!

243
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,500
By the way, Tomo's dad
isn't gonna eat with us?

244
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,420
Oh, yeah, you know him.

245
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,170
He does everything in the dojo,
including eating and sleeping.

246
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,630
He almost never comes into the house.

247
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:06,680
We've basically been living
separately for ages now.

248
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,930
He stayed with me when
we first got together...

249
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,520
How is he still too shy to
even look me in the face?!

250
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,070
What, is he just a little
girl in that big bear body?!

251
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,730
Here we go again.

252
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,690
Aizawa Dojo

253
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,660
How dare you show up late for practice?!

254
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,280
You two had better be ready
to make up for that!

255
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,990
Sorry, Goro.

256
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,460
It's my fault. I held them up.

257
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,040
Ake—

258
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,420
Okay?

259
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,130
...mi!

260
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,220
It's been so long, he passed right out!

261
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:51,810
Dad's always been like that in front of Mom.

262
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,680
Talk about lame.

263
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,140
Seriously...

264
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,730
You really think so?

265
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:57,350
Huh?

266
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:01,900
You think a guy acting
lovesick for a girl is lame?

267
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,230
Well, yeah... I mean, isn't it?

268
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,360
You're right. I think so, too.

269
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:13,240
But when push comes to shove,
he always protects her.

270
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:17,710
Ever since they were in school,
whenever Mom was in trouble,

271
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,460
he'd be the first one running to her side.

272
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,760
I see.

273
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,680
Sorry, Tomo-chan.

274
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,300
I want to ask Misuzu-chan
for some love advice,

275
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,560
so I'm going to eat lunch
with just her today.

276
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,020
That's what's going on,
so you can eat with Junichiro.

277
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,310
Huh?! But why?!

278
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,820
I could eat with—

279
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,530
Huh?

280
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,610
'Kay?

281
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,280
That's what we mean.

282
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,820
What's what you mean?

283
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,200
They're eating alone today!

284
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,080
I thought they might be, but...

285
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,910
So they really are?

286
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,380
It's so much easier to relax
when it's just us two!

287
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,000
What's that thing on your head?

288
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,130
Who could relax right now?!

289
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,340
So, what did you want advice about?

290
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,430
Wait just a sec. He'll be here soon.

291
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,270
Sorry I'm late, Carol.

292
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,060
You asked him to come?

293
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,480
I did.

294
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,230
Huh?

295
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,650
Uh... who are you?

296
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:27,570
Gundo Misuzu. Nice to meet you.

297
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:30,200
N-Nice to meet you, too.

298
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,820
Carol-san and I are...

299
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,160
Well, long story short, I'm her friend.

300
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,290
Thank you! Take good care of Carol!

301
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,840
You're a pretty big deal to him, huh?

302
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,170
I guess so.

303
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,380
Time to eat.

304
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,970
Really? Right now?

305
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,180
Sorry. She just lives life at her own pace.

306
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,350
She's a little odd,
but she's a really nice girl,

307
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,890
so treat her well, okay?

308
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,060
Uh-huh...

309
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:07,070
Carol is very important to me.

310
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,690
We've been around each other
since we were little.

311
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,240
I guess you could say she's like...

312
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,740
a precious little sister to me.

313
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,740
That's the kind of stuff he says.

314
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,700
I see. This could be challenging.

315
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,120
Oh, you've gotta be more careful.

316
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,580
Look at all these crumbs.

317
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,050
I have to go now.

318
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:30,710
Don't cause any trouble for Gundo-san, okay?

319
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,420
'Kay. Got it.

320
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,300
See you later, Gundo-san.

321
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,050
Take care of Carol for me.

322
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,640
Sure...

323
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,970
That's how he is.

324
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,310
It's not quite the same as it is with Tomo,

325
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,190
but he basically doesn't
see you as a girl, either.

326
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,980
I know, right?

327
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,440
Here, to thank you.

328
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,070
Open wide.

329
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,820
Huh? Yeah, that's not happening.

330
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,530
Boo.

331
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,370
You're no fun.

332
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,580
Anyway, what do you think I should do?

333
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:03,580
Well, for starters...

334
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:06,130
Take life more seriously.

335
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,290
Okay!

336
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,960
Where the hell were you guys?!

337
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,630
Do you know how much
I just embarrassed myse—

338
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,860
It's back home.

339
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,230
Have you had enough?

340
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,860
Yes.

341
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,400
A-Aizawa!

342
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,740
You got a minute?

343
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:40,450
Some guy's hitting on Ogawa?

344
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,240
Yeah, apparently.

345
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,750
Well, you are cute. Isn't that a good thing?

346
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,380
I-It's, like, so not!

347
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,670
It's a guy she met at a mixer.

348
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:54,050
A mixer?! You guys go to mixers?!

349
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,050
W-Wow...

350
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,260
That's, like, not the point right now!

351
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,300
I only went so it'd be,
like, an even number!

352
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,020
I think we picked the wrong
person to ask for advice.

353
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,940
So, is there a problem?

354
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:10,860
Well, it turns out he's a
third-year at our school,

355
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:14,030
and he's sort of the leader
of this scary group of guys.

356
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:18,200
He's especially well-known
for being a philanderer.

357
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,450
He hits on all kinds of girls,

358
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,540
even though he has no intentions
of dating any of them.

359
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:28,040
Apparently, any girl who turns him
down gets bullied to hell and back.

360
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,380
He's a real scumbag, huh?

361
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,710
Leave this to me.

362
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,170
Leave, like, what to you?!

363
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:37,260
I just want you to, like, stand
behind me when I turn him down!

364
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,470
This really was a mistake.

365
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,390
What?

366
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,230
Ogawa says she's not interested.

367
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,600
Would you leave her alone now, please?

368
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,060
Huh? Who the hell are you?

369
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,350
Wait, you a girl?

370
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,360
So what if I am?

371
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,280
Damn, you're a giant!

372
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,160
Yeah, no way. I ain't
into you, so stay outta this.

373
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,370
How many should I break?

374
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,410
How many of, like, what?

375
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,250
P-Please, just resolve this peacefully!

376
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:12,710
Ogawa-chan, this friend you brought
to me seems pretty tough.

377
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,210
Don't you think this is all a bit much?

378
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,670
I think you might have the wrong idea here.

379
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:23,430
I just thought I'd play with you
a little 'cause you seemed easy.

380
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,220
I-I'm, like, sorry...

381
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:30,440
Well, anyway, just don't forget
that you humiliated me.

382
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,400
Hey, look over here, you scumbag.

383
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,860
Oh, you're still here? What?

384
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:40,360
I just didn't think it'd be
right to hit you from behind.

385
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,070
I'll go easy on you.

386
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,620
Huh? What are y—

387
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,080
Sorry, Ogawa. I couldn't control myself.

388
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,790
Isn't he gonna try to
get you back for that?!

389
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,880
Probably.

390
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,800
How are you, like, so calm?!

391
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,050
You should, like, apologize right now!

392
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,050
It's okay.

393
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:09,140
If he comes after any of us,
it'll probably be me.

394
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:13,770
And if he does try anything
with you two, I'll protect you.

395
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:14,730
Don't worry.

396
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,440
Seriously, what the hell is with that?!

397
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,190
She's so, like, manly!

398
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:28,990
Five guys against one girl? Are you serious?

399
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,580
You really are a total sleaze, man.

400
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,960
I kinda like that, though.

401
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,790
Shut up! Don't think of her as a girl!

402
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,420
She's as strong as a gorilla!

403
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,170
You're being dramatic, man.

404
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,930
I ain't gonna forget that
damned red-haired giant!

405
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:46,100
I think her name was... Aizawa.

406
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,810
All right, let's go, boys!

407
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,690
We're gonna teach that
gorilla chick a les—

408
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,570
Y-You okay, man?!

409
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:05,570
What the hell is your problem?!

410
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,660
And who are you, anyway?!

411
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,990
A first-year?

412
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:12,080
Kubota Junichiro, Class 1-A.

413
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,170
You don't need to remember that.

414
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,180
So you came.

415
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,860
Wanna fight me?

416
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,660
We're sorry!

417
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,180
Huh?

418
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,240
Huh?!

419
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,520
What the heck was their deal?

420
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:46,340
I don't think I went that far.

421
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,670
They were all beat up, too.

422
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:53,420
And what about you? How'd you get hurt?

423
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,620
I fell.

424
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,960
Oh, okay.

425
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:59,910
You know, you fall down a lot, huh?
You have ever since middle school.

426
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,870
Leave me alone.

427
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:06,730
I'll make you some more dried sardine
rice balls so you won't break any bones!

428
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:08,710
Sure.

429
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,560
(This suspicious behavior is...)

430
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,850
Hey, you know, I'm all mixed up

431
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:23,320
It's too complicated, I'm freaking out

432
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,860
I want to look cute to you

433
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:29,200
(crazy, crazy, drive me crazy, and that's…)

434
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,490
So I'm plotting, bargaining,
sly, and stubborn

435
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,990
Dizzying love

436
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,580
Just tell him to look at you

437
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:43,550
And watch him stiffen up even more,
because you're both so awkward

438
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:47,420
What? Even if we're alike in that way

439
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:52,010
It doesn't make me happy, 'cause it
means our love is going nowhere

440
00:22:52,010 --> 00:23:00,900
Cloudy heart, swirling emotions—
I sense rain coming

441
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:09,990
So I partly open my umbrella,
then sneakily scoot closer to you

442
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:13,950
Please notice the curl of my
eyelashes as I keep blinking

443
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:18,870
And don't say I'm acting weird

444
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:22,840
All this plotting and bargaining
is my sly plan to look cute to you

445
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,880
Try to solve the riddle of
this soft, dizzying love

446
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:30,010
(Buzzing, fidgeting)

447
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:34,810
Listen, I might be a bit
tangled in my own web now

448
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:38,850
But once you unravel the mystery,
you'll see pure lo-love
