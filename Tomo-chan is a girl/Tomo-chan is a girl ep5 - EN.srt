1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,360
What time are you coming
over on our next day off?

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,030
Misuzu? When did you make plans to do that?

3
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:10,640
I didn't. I thought she meant you.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,860
'Cause that's the first
time I've mentioned it.

5
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,010
When I throw a jab or a straight,
it always lands

6
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:39,140
But when I'm aiming for your heart,
I miss every time

7
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:44,480
Parallel, zigzagging, awkward, incoherent

8
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,980
When you look my way and move closer to me

9
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:54,740
I know it doesn't mean the same thing for you

10
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:59,780
But I wish we could stay like this forever

11
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:05,910
My changing feelings are driving me crazy

12
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:11,210
The moment you turn to face me,
take that! Telepathy

13
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:16,680
If only we could feel the same thing

14
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,560
I want to kick this pesky subtlety away

15
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:27,560
I want to know everything,
I want to know everything

16
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,110
I can't fool you forever

17
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,730
I can't keep this hidden

18
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:37,490
I want to shout out my secret, AHHH

19
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:41,950
Take that! Telepathy

20
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,410
Te-te-te-telepathy

21
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,500
Telepathy

22
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,960
The Girls of the Olston Family

23
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,170
"The Girls of the Olston Family."

24
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:59,930
Carol's House

25
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:59,930
Forest

26
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:59,930
Convenience Store

27
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:59,930
Right Here

28
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:59,930
Big Building

29
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:59,930
Building

30
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:59,930
Station

31
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,340
Carol really didn't put much thought
into this map she gave us.

32
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,930
I'm not sure if I'd even call it a map.

33
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,100
It should be around here,

34
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,720
but there's nothing but a
fence with no end in sight.

35
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,520
I wonder if it's some sort of facility.

36
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,480
It's... not here, right?

37
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,280
I really want to hope it isn't.

38
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,200
Oh! You two!

39
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:25,330
What are you doing just standing
in front of my house?

40
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,120
Are you bad people?

41
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,040
No mistaking it.

42
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,500
They're definitely related.

43
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,500
You're Carol-chan's friends?

44
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,630
Is that true?

45
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,590
Especially you, the tall one!

46
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,050
You don't have any perverted intentions?

47
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,100
Huh?!

48
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,480
I know that all boys are...

49
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,480
Oh. Breasts.

50
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,480
Um... For what it's worth,
I'm actually a girl.

51
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,610
Oh, okay! Come on in!

52
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,950
I want to go home.

53
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,370
Don't leave! I can't handle this on my own!

54
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,790
The path to our house is like a maze,

55
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,040
so make sure you follow me closely.

56
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,040
Even I get lost sometimes, but still...

57
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,670
Huh?!

58
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,920
I'm sure it will be just fine today!

59
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:22,930
At least, I sure hope it will be!

60
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,050
I'm having all of the bad feelings...

61
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,140
Maybe I really should go home...

62
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,810
Welcome back, Mummy!

63
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,270
I'm home, Carol-chan!

64
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,110
I miss you so much! I love you so much!

65
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,150
Oh!

66
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,910
Yay! Tomo-chan's here!

67
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,660
Hey...

68
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,530
Thank you for coming! You too, Misuzu-chan!

69
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,830
Thank—

70
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,210
Harsh.

71
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:53,120
Oh!

72
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,460
Look! We have matching braids!

73
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,350
Meanie.

74
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,730
Wh-What is this place?!

75
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,770
It's my room.

76
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,190
What are you? A princess?!

77
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,030
Are you a princess?!

78
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,780
Huh? Yeah.

79
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,200
No way!

80
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,860
Would you calm down?

81
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,530
She's just really rich.

82
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,490
This is me when I was little.

83
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,290
Wow...

84
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,790
You've always worn ribbons
in your hair, huh?

85
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,710
Yep. Mummy used to say

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
that I'm pudding.

87
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,750
Say what?

88
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,170
Pudding.

89
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,970
That's why I always wear soft, cute clothes.

90
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:49,100
The ribbon is the cherry,
and you can't forget the cherry!

91
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,470
But the most important thing is...

92
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,140
Not letting anyone eat you?

93
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,310
Huh?

94
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,690
How'd you know? Amazing!

95
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,820
I'm going to use your bathroom.

96
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,030
Sure. It's...

97
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,610
I saw it on the way in. I can find it.

98
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,630
Um...

99
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,220
Is there something you want from me?

100
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,090
You were mean to Carol-chan earlier.

101
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,560
Are you actually a bad girl?

102
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,480
That's what this is about?

103
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,940
If I said I'm friends with
her for her money...

104
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,070
What would you do?

105
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,290
I'm sorry. You're a very cute girl!

106
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,450
Uh, thanks...

107
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,210
Why do I feel like I just lost?

108
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,130
Tomo-chan, let's play Othello.

109
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,710
Sure! I won't go easy on you!

110
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,800
Okay, I'll be white.

111
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,760
m 202 266 l 203 335 437 336 437 265

112
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,760
5 Minutes Later

113
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,470
Oh, Othello?

114
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,900
My Misuzu here is really
good at this kind of game!

115
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,900
You'd better be ready!

116
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,480
Well, it's true that I don't often lose.

117
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,530
Okay, I'll be white.

118
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,410
m 202 266 l 203 335 437 336 437 265

119
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,410
10 Minutes Later

120
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,160
What kind of mother and daughter are you?

121
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,330
Huh? What do you mean?

122
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,290
Bye, Carol.

123
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,000
See you at school.

124
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,500
Thank you for having us.

125
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,460
Please come visit again sometime!

126
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,380
And you, too.

127
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,890
Come by again!

128
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:52,800
I don't know...

129
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,010
And last is...

130
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,970
Carol-chan!

131
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,390
Mummy!

132
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,060
Let's go.

133
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,190
Yeah.

134
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:14,160
A Feeling I Won't Give Up

135
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,570
"A Feeling I Won't Give Up."

136
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,950
Hey, Misuzu, did you hear?

137
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,040
We have midterms tomorrow!

138
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,880
I'm more shocked that
you asked me if I knew.

139
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,670
I completely forgot! I'm in so much trouble!

140
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,050
In that case, let's have
a study group today.

141
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,010
Really? Don't you have to study, too?

142
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,180
I don't mind. We can do it at my house.

143
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,970
Can I come, too?

144
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,270
Sure, I guess...

145
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,850
Thank you.

146
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,020
Stop talking like that.

147
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,230
Tomo!

148
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,820
Let's study together after school.

149
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,360
I'll be your tutor.

150
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,490
Huh?!

151
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:56,080
You'll tutor Tomo, you say?

152
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,530
Don't be so full of yourself.

153
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,330
What?

154
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:02,250
What was your ranking in our
last middle school exam?

155
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,290
Huh? I think I ranked around 30.

156
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,130
So what?

157
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:11,090
I ranked... number one.

158
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,260
Damn it!

159
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,850
I'm kinda surprised, though.

160
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,350
About what?

161
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:26,650
Well, you usually try to get
me and Jun together, right?

162
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,360
So why this ti—

163
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,320
I'm allowed every now
and then, too, aren't I?

164
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,320
Do that to me, too.

165
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,410
No.

166
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,500
I haven't been here in a while.

167
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,790
It looks pretty different in here now.

168
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:46,080
You haven't been here very much, either?

169
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,420
When we were kids, she told
me not to come to her house.

170
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,510
I don't remember why, though.

171
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,010
You don't remember?

172
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,680
It's because you kept breaking
everything in my house.

173
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,390
Oh... Th-That's right.

174
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,600
You just weren't the kind of child
that could play sitting down.

175
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,770
Even today, I'm actually super worried.

176
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,810
C'mon, that's not gonna
be a problem anymore!

177
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,400
I'm home.

178
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,610
Don't tell me...

179
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,950
Misuzu has a boyfriend?!

180
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,620
Mom.

181
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,990
Welcome home.

182
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,120
Hey, I'm here to visit!

183
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,200
Akemi?!

184
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,830
Uh, no, I'm her daughter...

185
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,960
Tomo-chan?

186
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,840
You do look just like her.

187
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,050
But don't grow up to be like her.

188
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,170
Uh-huh...

189
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,470
Nice to meet you. My name is Carol.

190
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,680
Most people don't get this close
when meeting for the first time.

191
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,390
You look just as cute as Misuzu-chan!

192
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,390
I'm not sold on this one.

193
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,440
Aw...

194
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,350
I'm not, either.

195
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,020
Aw...

196
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,570
I don't get this at all.

197
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,950
It's just a long equation. It's not hard.

198
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,620
Let's walk through it a step at a time.

199
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,950
It's √10/2-√2, right?

200
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,040
Huh?

201
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,750
She's right.

202
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,000
For real?!

203
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,670
It's an easy problem, but not one you
should be able to do in your head...

204
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,750
I could.

205
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,460
Are you some kinda genius?!

206
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,920
How'd you do that?!

207
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,300
Well, these ones here are friends,

208
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,850
so if you whip this around here
and smoosh it onto here...

209
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,680
If math could be solved
that way, anyone could...

210
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,100
Whoa, that's amazing! It worked!

211
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,730
See?

212
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,020
Oh, man! I might be a genius!

213
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,650
Tomo-chan the genius!

214
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,230
I don't know what you did,

215
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,610
but in math, the process is
as important as the solution.

216
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:41,120
You won't get credit if you
can't show your work.

217
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,410
What a pain.

218
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:45,370
You said it! That's so inefficient!

219
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:51,290
Okay! Now I'm ready to get serious!

220
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,840
Me, too!

221
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:57,420
There's a lot going on here,
so you can express all this as x.

222
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,300
Oh, you're right! That's much better!

223
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,760
You're a good teacher, Misuzu-chan.

224
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,100
You really are. You've got a knack for this.

225
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,850
I'd say this much is just normal.

226
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,640
Don't be so modest!

227
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,270
I mean, you're good enough
to make me understand!

228
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,650
If I can keep this up,

229
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,980
I might actually be able to go
to the same university as you!

230
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,240
You want to do that?

231
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,450
Of course I do!

232
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,910
I was barely able to follow
you into this high school,

233
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,700
so it might not be easy,

234
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,290
but you're my best friend, after all!

235
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,420
I see...

236
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,260
Okay, okay. You can follow me, too.

237
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,560
Heck yeah!

238
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,520
70 • Aizawa Tomo

239
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,020
I'm number 70!

240
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,520
That's the first time I've
ever ranked in the top half!

241
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,350
Looks like you were in good shape this time.

242
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,480
Yeah! What was your rank?

243
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,860
I got 54!

244
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,190
Not bad, not great.

245
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,860
You're so boring.

246
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,030
Most people don't do stuff like this.

247
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,910
Well, he does.

248
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,210
What was your rank, Misuzu?

249
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,120
Second.

250
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,250
Wow, I should've expected as much!

251
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,130
Who was number one?

252
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,090
1 • Carol Olston

253
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:27,930
Heart-Pounding!

254
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:27,930
A Gaming Overnighter

255
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,100
"Heart-Pounding! A Gaming Overnighter."

256
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,890
I bought that game you said
you were interested in.

257
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,140
Winners Eleven.

258
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,600
Oh, nice!

259
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,770
My parents almost never buy me video games.

260
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:43,320
Come to think of it, when we first met,
you were a gamer kid, huh?

261
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,620
Hey, gamer kid!

262
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,370
That takes me back!

263
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,710
Hey, cut it out!

264
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,670
Never call me that again.

265
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,920
Wh-What's with you?

266
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,180
Wanna come over today?

267
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,730
We'll do some gaming together,
like we used to.

268
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,940
Really?! I can?!

269
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,770
Of course you can.

270
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,770
There's no school tomorrow,
so you can even stay over.

271
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,030
We can play games until super late!

272
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,240
A gaming overnighter, huh?

273
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,070
I can't wait!

274
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,950
I was so distracted by gaming,
I didn't realize!

275
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,660
I'm spending the night at Jun's house!

276
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,120
There's all sorts of gaming going on here.

277
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,500
So... can I come, too?

278
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,050
You'll go with me, Carol?!

279
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,010
This is a thing I shouldn't go to, isn't it?

280
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:48,590
If you know that, don't complicate things.

281
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,350
No! I shouldn't do this!

282
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,850
I'm gonna tell him no!

283
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,640
Wait, Tomo-chan.

284
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,230
Sit down.

285
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,600
Why?

286
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,350
Don't ask why. Just sit down.

287
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,650
Just sit, okay?

288
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,230
You telling him no...

289
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,570
...is not an option.

290
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,990
It's only at times like this
that they get along.

291
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,910
Tomo! Walk home with me!

292
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,370
Jun!

293
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,420
I'm, uh... walking with
Misuzu and Carol today.

294
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,460
Oh, okay. I'll wait for you at home, then.

295
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,170
S-Sure.

296
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,930
Fighting it is useless.
You're seeing him later anyway.

297
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,600
Yeah, at his house.

298
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:39,060
Going home separately actually seems
like a tease. Almost as if...

299
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,020
As if?

300
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,860
Oh, just shut up, damn it!

301
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,320
I'm gonna stay over at Jun's house tonight.

302
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,650
Huh?

303
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,030
Wh-What?

304
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:53,950
I see. I thought we still
had a lot more time...

305
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,500
But maybe it's time to start considering it.

306
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,160
Huh?

307
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,330
My grandchild's name.

308
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,500
You're jumping way ahead here!

309
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,420
Dad! I'm staying over at Jun's tonight!

310
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:11,340
Okay. Don't make too much trouble for them.

311
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:12,850
Huh?

312
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,350
What's the problem? You can go on over.

313
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,770
It's actually kinda unsettling that
they're not concerned at all.

314
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,230
I've been waiting for you, Tomo!

315
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,820
Mom told me to bring you this.

316
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,280
Cool, thanks! I'll let my mom know tomorrow.

317
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,120
Tomorrow?

318
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,910
Yeah. She's not home today.

319
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,750
Went on a trip, apparently.

320
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,580
Why didn't you tell me that sooner?!

321
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,460
Huh? Did you need to talk
to my mom or something?

322
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,920
That's not the issue here!

323
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,800
You make such awesome curry, Jun.

324
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,930
I'll make some for you sometime.

325
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,470
Oh, yeah...

326
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:59,220
Every now and then... I do
want to try your cooking.

327
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,810
Really? Well, whenever you
want some, just ask!

328
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:03,520
Sure.

329
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,360
Anyway, what do you wanna
do about your bath?

330
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,030
Hmm... I usually take mine at night, so...

331
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,530
I was planning to bathe here.

332
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:15,450
Go ahead and take yours after
we're done eating, then.

333
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,410
I wanna keep gaming right up until bedtime.

334
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,000
O-Okay... I will.

335
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,750
I just had mine, so you can just
reheat the water and get right in.

336
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,630
I'll just take a shower!

337
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:33,630
Why? A good, long soak will warm you—

338
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,760
Just a shower!

339
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,480
I'll leave a towel right—

340
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,440
What?! Did something happen?!

341
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,700
N-No, nothing!

342
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,750
Sorry to make you wait so long.

343
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,000
What happened to your cheeks?

344
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,550
They're all red.

345
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,550
Huh?

346
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,510
Why?

347
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:20,260
The mood's so awkward for some reason.

348
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:24,060
Is Jun actually conscious of me, too?

349
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:35,820
What can I do? Should I try
saying something to him first?

350
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,950
Okay, Tomo!

351
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,660
Let's play that game!

352
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,120
Wait, what?!

353
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:45,370
FC VASIMR

354
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:45,370
Hill Villagers

355
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,370
It's been a long time.
Want me to go easy on you?

356
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,420
Get over yourself!

357
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,790
There! Go! That's it!

358
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,590
My pass was good! You're wide open!

359
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,760
Oh, yeah! And shoot!

360
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,010
Score!

361
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,770
You're not half bad.

362
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,230
You'll never beat me at video games, either!

363
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,190
Aw, damn it!

364
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,400
I lost again!

365
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,280
Because you just keep
attacking and never defend.

366
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,400
You need to think about how the game—

367
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,240
Shut up, gamer kid!

368
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,620
I told you not to call me that!

369
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,580
Okay, I'm sorry!

370
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,840
Wanna play another match?

371
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,470
Yeah, sure.

372
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,760
It's 9:00 already?

373
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,850
What do you wanna do? Stay up late?

374
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,350
Can you even stay up late?

375
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:49,850
Don't underestimate me!
I once stayed up until 11:30!

376
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:52,860
That's all? I've...

377
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,610
stayed up until midnight before.

378
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,320
M-Midnight?!

379
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,950
That's the next day!

380
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,160
It's not that big a deal.

381
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,870
Maybe...

382
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,540
we really can't stay up late.

383
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,870
Yeah, maybe.

384
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,460
Goodnight.

385
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,050
Yeah, goodnight.

386
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,800
It smells like Jun.

387
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,890
We're really just gonna go to sleep now?

388
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,890
It seems like such a waste.

389
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:33,150
Wait, a waste of what?!

390
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:34,650
Tomo?

391
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,570
You awake?

392
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,320
What's up?

393
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,860
Today was fun, huh?

394
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,540
Do you think we're gonna...

395
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,500
always be like...

396
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,540
Jun, I...

397
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,510
That jerk!

398
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:05,640
That's what his face looks like?

399
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,640
I'm always so close to him,

400
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,520
but I don't get many chances
to just look at his face.

401
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,440
Especially the little
details like his ears.

402
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:20,400
Oh, so this is what they look like?

403
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,900
What about his nose?

404
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,480
Oh, crap. This is kinda fun.

405
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,050
Wh-What is this?!

406
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,380
What is going on?!

407
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,550
Jun?!

408
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:13,580
Jun, you sleep in the weirdest positions.

409
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,500
Well, I'm off. See you at the dojo later.

410
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,420
Yeah.

411
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:23,550
In spite of everything, that was really fun.

412
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,050
I'm glad I came.

413
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:29,010
But I feel like I'm forgetting something...

414
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:31,110
Last night, I got to Jun's house,

415
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,460
ate curry,

416
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,900
took a shower,

417
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,230
played games,

418
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,590
went to sleep in the bed...

419
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,330
and woke up in the futon?!

420
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,000
After that, things between us...

421
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,760
What?

422
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,220
Nothing.

423
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,900
Okay, then.

424
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:08,090
...were like this for about a week.

425
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,560
(This suspicious behavior is...)

426
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,850
Hey, you know, I'm all mixed up

427
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:23,320
It's too complicated, I'm freaking out

428
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,860
I want to look cute to you

429
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:29,200
(crazy, crazy, drive me crazy, and that's…)

430
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,490
So I'm plotting, bargaining,
sly, and stubborn

431
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,990
Dizzying love

432
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,580
Just tell him to look at you

433
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:43,550
And watch him stiffen up even more,
because you're both so awkward

434
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:47,420
What? Even if we're alike in that way

435
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:52,010
It doesn't make me happy, 'cause it
means our love is going nowhere

436
00:22:52,010 --> 00:23:00,900
Cloudy heart, swirling emotions—
I sense rain coming

437
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:09,990
So I partly open my umbrella,
then sneakily scoot closer to you

438
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:13,950
Please notice the curl of my
eyelashes as I keep blinking

439
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:18,870
And don't say I'm acting weird

440
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:22,840
All this plotting and bargaining
is my sly plan to look cute to you

441
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,880
Try to solve the riddle of
this soft, dizzying love

442
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:30,010
(Buzzing, fidgeting)

443
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:34,810
Listen, I might be a bit
tangled in my own web now

444
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:38,850
But once you unravel the mystery,
you'll see pure lo-love
