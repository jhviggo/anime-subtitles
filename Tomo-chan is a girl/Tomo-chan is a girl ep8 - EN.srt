1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,020
Let's play the king game!

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,060
Near the end of summer break,

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,650
Misuzu and Carol came to spend the night.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,110
I'm the king.

5
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,070
Huh?

6
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,660
And what's your order?

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,490
Tomo-chan has to do an
impersonation of Misuzu-chan.

8
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,330
What?! I can't impersonate Misuzu!

9
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,700
Okay, then I will.

10
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,410
Wait, why?!

11
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,420
I'll slaughter you socially.

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,130
I'm the king.

13
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,720
Yikes! Misuzu?!

14
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,300
I'm scared.

15
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,680
Okay, Tomo... You will go to the
fireworks show with Junichiro.

16
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,350
Huh?

17
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:46,020
King

18
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,350
Just the two of you this time.

19
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:02,040
When I throw a jab or a straight,
it always lands

20
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,170
But when I'm aiming for your heart,
I miss every time

21
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,500
Parallel, zigzagging, awkward, incoherent

22
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:17,010
When you look my way and move closer to me

23
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:22,770
I know it doesn't mean the same thing for you

24
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,810
But I wish we could stay like this forever

25
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,940
My changing feelings are driving me crazy

26
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:39,240
The moment you turn to face me,
take that! Telepathy

27
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,700
If only we could feel the same thing

28
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,580
I want to kick this pesky subtlety away

29
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:55,590
I want to know everything,
I want to know everything

30
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,130
I can't fool you forever

31
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,760
I can't keep this hidden

32
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:05,520
I want to shout out my secret, AHHH

33
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,980
Take that! Telepathy

34
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,440
Te-te-te-telepathy

35
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,530
Telepathy

36
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,990
The Night of the Summer Festival

37
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,660
"The Night of the Summer Festival."

38
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,450
D-Do you want to go see
the fireworks with me?

39
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,000
The fireworks?

40
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,870
Are those two gonna be with us again?

41
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,960
N-No! This time... just us two!

42
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,670
It'll be just us two.

43
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,340
Just us, huh?

44
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,140
Okay. Let's go.

45
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,100
Huh? He doesn't seem that excited.

46
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,390
Normally, he's like...

47
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,850
Man, I can't wait for the fireworks!

48
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,570
Should we really just let
things go on like this?

49
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,650
Like what?

50
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,240
The way Jun-kun and Tomo-chan are going,

51
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,240
they could end up getting together
like a normal guy and girl.

52
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,830
I was just wondering, would that
really be a good thing?

53
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,540
Shut up.

54
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,710
Just me and Tomo seeing the fireworks, huh?

55
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,840
I'm so happy. Like, more than I should be.

56
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,760
I love you, Jun!

57
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,350
Nah... She didn't mean
it that way... I'm sure.

58
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,270
Probably.

59
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,820
I feel like Jun's been acting weird lately.

60
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,410
When we went to the beach,
he didn't seem all that into it.

61
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,620
And just today... Could it be...

62
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,160
Summer exhaustion?

63
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,330
It's not.

64
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,040
When Tomo came to me to
tell me she loved Junichiro,

65
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,670
I gave her a hackneyed response
without even thinking about it.

66
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,010
Then why don't you try being more feminine?

67
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:09,180
And then Tomo dedicated herself to
the idea way more than I expected.

68
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,640
She even started showing interest
in more girlish leisure activities.

69
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,860
Maybe I really was wrong, like Carol said...

70
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:25,280
About what I should have said to
her back then as her best friend.

71
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:31,000
But I have no intention of going back now.

72
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:38,710
If I use him, Tomo and
I can do more... more...

73
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:46,840
Huh?

74
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,810
The Day of the Fireworks Show

75
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,810
Jun, you're going to see the
fireworks with Tomo-chan?

76
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:53,890
Yeah.

77
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,060
Good luck!

78
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:56,900
Thanks.

79
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,860
I'm hyped, but also not.

80
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,900
I'm happy, but also anxious.

81
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,490
I'm gonna go figure out what
this annoying feeling is.

82
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:14,160
Misuzu-chan, let's go watch the fireworks.

83
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,370
No.

84
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,920
Aw, c'mon. Ko-chan's coming, too.

85
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,460
Senpai's going? Then wouldn't
I be a third wheel?

86
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,720
If it means you end up alone, I'm not going.

87
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,430
Hmph.

88
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,180
What's your deal?

89
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,560
Sorry, Jun! Were you waiting long?

90
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:44,440
Mom told me I should wear this...

91
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,700
and it took a while to put it on.

92
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,870
What's wrong? You okay?

93
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,830
Sorry, I'm fi—

94
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,420
Actually... maybe not quite.

95
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,210
Are you feeling sick?

96
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,800
Goldfish Scooping

97
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,180
I'm back again this year, old fart.

98
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:15,180
Hey, Jun-bo. Tomo-chan's
not with you this year?

99
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,390
Did you forget what I look like?

100
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,440
What?! You're Tomo-chan?!

101
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,230
Something wrong with that?

102
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,450
I can't believe the stall-destroying
demon of the summer festival

103
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,120
grew up to be such a beauty.

104
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,830
Gotta save this moment.

105
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:39,750
Oh? Is that what you guys have
been calling me behind my back?

106
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,250
Calling all vendors! They're back!

107
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,050
Tomo-chan and Jun-bo?!

108
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,470
Try not to die of shock when you see this!

109
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,220
On my way with provisions

110
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,300
Wh-What?!

111
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,020
Th-This is that out-of-control tomboy?!

112
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,980
She looks like a gravure idol in a yukata!

113
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,520
I'll take one dish of ammo.

114
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,230
Yeah, but...

115
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,150
1st Prize

116
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,610
She's still the same on the inside!

117
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,910
I wish you'd said that sooner.

118
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,790
That's my secret technique, the Triple Shot!

119
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,250
You're holding hands so naturally.

120
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,420
Yeah. If I let go of her hand...

121
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,460
See?

122
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,550
I can get her back pretty quickly, though.

123
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,970
You've got it rough, huh?

124
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,760
That looks like you, Ko-chan.

125
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,100
What does?

126
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,560
This is Ko-chan.

127
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,020
Uh... it is?

128
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,020
This is Tomo-chan.

129
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,440
She'll get mad at you.

130
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,190
Misuzu-chan.

131
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,610
I'll get mad at you.

132
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,650
Take whichever one you want.

133
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,450
Hey, check it out, Jun!
These handcrafted candies are incredible!

134
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:00,700
Huh?

135
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,920
Who's Jun? Your boyfriend?

136
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,460
I-I don't have a boyfriend!

137
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,880
Oh, so you're free, huh?

138
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,380
Come hang out with us, then.

139
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,430
What the hell?

140
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,560
She does have a boyfriend.

141
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,770
Uh... Jun...

142
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,150
Thanks for helping me—

143
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,230
Sorry.

144
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,240
Huh?

145
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,160
I'm sure you could've
handled that by yourself.

146
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,870
Jun...

147
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:40,080
I butted in again.

148
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,540
Would it...

149
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:45,250
Would it kill you to let me thank you?!

150
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,840
What the hell do you mean,
I could've handled it myself?!

151
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:52,550
I might be strong in a fight, but there
are some things I just can't do!

152
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,300
S-Sorry...

153
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,100
Yeah, so... I'm gonna thank you now!

154
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,050
Listen good!

155
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,720
S-Sure.

156
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,060
Thank you.

157
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,320
I'm really glad you were there for me.

158
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,150
Thanks.

159
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,120
I think the fireworks are about to start.

160
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,790
I know a great spot to watch from.

161
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,050
O-Okay...

162
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:34,800
What... was that?

163
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,560
Something's definitely off about him today.

164
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,190
Is he... actually starting to notice me now?

165
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,190
If he is...

166
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,400
Maybe this time, I can get
my feelings across for real.

167
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,330
Welp, I bought it.

168
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,870
Do I look cute?

169
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,830
I'm even more of a
third wheel than I thought.

170
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,790
Is that...

171
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,550
I'm not letting you go anywhere.

172
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
Let's go.

173
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,930
That's why she invited me along?

174
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,800
This squishy bitch...

175
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,560
If I'm gonna tell him, I should
do it before the fireworks start.

176
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,440
Now's my only chance.

177
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,190
Jun!

178
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,730
L-Listen...

179
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:34,020
What?

180
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,910
I feel like I can make him
understand this time.

181
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:43,330
And if that happens,
what we have now will end.

182
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:47,290
Our "now" will end,
and "something" will begin.

183
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,420
What is it?

184
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,670
But what is "something"?

185
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:56,420
It's not like there's even anything I want.

186
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:03,010
I just wanted to make Jun my own.

187
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,810
Now isn't the time.

188
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,940
There's no chance for us right now.

189
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,280
They're pretty, huh?

190
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:21,610
Yeah.

191
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,540
That was a lot of fun!

192
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,460
Yeah.

193
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:38,010
I still haven't figured out what
this feeling I have for Tomo is.

194
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,550
Hey, Jun!

195
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,890
Let's do this again!

196
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,720
But I did figure out one thing.

197
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,980
I can't...

198
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,400
have a real punching match
with Tomo ever again.

199
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:00,990
The Distance

200
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:00,990
Between Them

201
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,610
"The Distance Between Them."

202
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,780
What's wrong, Tomo-chan?

203
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,160
You're starting the new term
in unusually low spirits.

204
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,790
Junichiro again?

205
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,120
Yeah.

206
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:17,040
I'm pretty sure Jun's starting
to be careful around me.

207
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,460
Isn't that good?

208
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,920
No, the way he's doing it is just...

209
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,220
Hey, Tomo. Mornin'.

210
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,310
His pinky?!

211
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,270
Let's go to school.

212
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,440
Frankly, it's creepy!

213
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,230
That's frank, all right.

214
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,490
Is that how it's always
gonna be from now on?

215
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,740
What am I gonna do?

216
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,450
Things with Tomo-chan and
Jun-kun are starting to change.

217
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,120
Just like you planned it, Misuzu-chan! Right?

218
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:56,000
You don't seem very happy, though.

219
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,420
Just shut up.

220
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:03,720
What is that squishy bitch trying to do?

221
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:06,720
She doesn't seem like she wants
to get in the way, but...

222
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,350
And Tomo...

223
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,930
She's gonna have to grow
up one of these days.

224
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,890
Same goes for Junichiro.

225
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,980
So what's wrong with things changing now?

226
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,530
To go from best friends with no
reservations around each other to lovers...

227
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,610
If that happens to those two...

228
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:27,660
I'll...

229
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:32,450
Man, shit's been so dull for us lately.

230
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,040
It's all because of that giant woman!

231
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,460
We gotta get back at her somehow!

232
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,790
That's...

233
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,300
Not you!

234
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:51,720
Yo.

235
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,310
Got a sec?

236
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,020
Don't touch me.

237
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:59,440
What the hell is this weird intensity?!

238
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,650
Hey!

239
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,610
I know all of your faces now.

240
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,370
Misuzu-chan, what're you doing?

241
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,990
Is she another one of Aizawa's buddies?

242
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,120
She has nothing to do with me or Tomo.

243
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,750
She's just a classmate.

244
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,460
Fine, then. Let's go.

245
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,420
Wait!

246
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,260
What? You want us to play with you, t—

247
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,930
You okay?! Hang in there, man!

248
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:36,680
Move, now!

249
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,150
What are you doing?

250
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,150
Where the hell did they go?!

251
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,740
Over there!

252
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,500
Well, what to do now?

253
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,380
Yeah?

254
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,760
It's me.

255
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,180
Gundo?

256
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,140
I don't remember giving you my number.

257
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,640
I'm in kind of a tight spot right now.

258
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,930
Come help me.

259
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:22,060
I'm at the abandoned
factory near the school.

260
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,020
Carol's here, too.

261
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,940
And don't tell Tomo.

262
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,490
I won't.

263
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,320
Hey, Jun!

264
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,990
I'm gonna go ahead and leave.
I've got stuff to do.

265
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:33,950
What stuff?

266
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,990
Hang on.

267
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:40,080
Where are you going with that
bloodthirsty look on your face?

268
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,710
Damn it.

269
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,130
Misuzu and Carol?!

270
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,670
That's really bad!

271
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:50,340
Yeah, but I can take care of it by myself.

272
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,090
Screw that! I'm going, too!

273
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,600
You think I'm that useless?

274
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,810
You idiot! It's not because
I don't have faith in you!

275
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,480
Those two are my friends!

276
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,440
I can't just let someone else go help
them while I wait around in safety!

277
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:11,990
Oh, yeah. That's the kind of
person my best friend is.

278
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,490
Carol?

279
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,870
Are you angry?

280
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:24,540
Just so you know, it's not my
fault you fell on your face.

281
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,670
Hmph.

282
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,920
I don't talk to people
I have nothing to do with.

283
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,630
Oh, that's why.

284
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,050
I just said that

285
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,890
because I thought things would be
even worse if you got involved, too.

286
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:40,600
I mean, I do think of you as...

287
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,810
something like a friend, after all.

288
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,150
Misuzu-chan!

289
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,570
I thought I might be able
to pull it off that time.

290
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,490
It's not gonna be that easy.

291
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:52,650
Also, you're filthy.

292
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:55,110
Found you.

293
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,080
I've been dying to see you.

294
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,210
Heya, Senpai.

295
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,670
I've been dying to see you.

296
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,880
Why don't we go somewhere
else and have some fun?

297
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:17,220
I guess Tomo-chan showed up after all.

298
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,890
That's just who she is.
I had a feeling she'd come.

299
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,600
I love Tomo-chan for being like that.

300
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,890
You don't, Misuzu-chan?

301
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,530
Damn it, Jun!

302
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,700
I told you, this is my fight!

303
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,250
Yeah, yeah.

304
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,460
I'll leave this two the two of them

305
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,090
and look for Carol and Gundo-san.

306
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,970
Come on, take those dirty
clothes off already.

307
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,340
But it's cold.

308
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,430
There you are!

309
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:59,600
Caro—

310
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,310
Misaki-senpai?

311
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,100
Oh, it really is Ko-chan!

312
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,560
You're the only one left.

313
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,280
It's about time you learned your lesson.

314
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,400
Damn it!

315
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,700
Hey, you punks.

316
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,530
What did you do to Carol?!

317
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,620
Was it you?

318
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,870
Are you the one who did
indecent things to Carol?

319
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,380
Misaki-senpai? What's wrong?

320
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,090
Wh-What are you talking about?!

321
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,800
Don't you play dumb with me!

322
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:38,800
She's such a sweet, pure girl, and you...

323
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,550
And you...!

324
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,220
Ko-chan got angry for my sake!

325
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,810
Just correct the misunderstanding
before someone dies.

326
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,980
You were just changing clothes?

327
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,570
Yep, that's right.

328
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:57,740
How could I make such a stupid mistake?

329
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,450
That made me happy, though. Thank you.

330
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,160
Tomo, you can go on home.

331
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,210
What are you gonna do?

332
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,580
There's something I need
to talk to him about.

333
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:15,000
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

334
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,050
Yeah? Okay, then.

335
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,510
You sure about this?

336
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:21,300
If Misuzu says she'll be fine, she'll be fine.

337
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,340
Let's go.

338
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,100
What do you wanna talk about?

339
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,190
Want me to play with you?

340
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,690
Look at you, acting tough the moment
Tomo and Junichiro are gone.

341
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:36,110
It's almost refreshing how weak you are.

342
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:36,980
What?!

343
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,320
But weak or not,

344
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,280
even a petty thug like you must
know about the Aizawa Dojo, right?

345
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:47,120
All the bad guys around
here know about that!

346
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,250
The legendary delinquent leader, Aizawa Goro,

347
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,540
and his band of wack jobs who
want to change the world!

348
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,840
Well, Tomo is his only daughter.

349
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,340
P-Please forgive me! I had no idea!

350
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,090
I heard you're gathering all the punks
in this area to start up a team.

351
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:08,640
If any of your buddies or wannabe
gangsters mess with my friends again,

352
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,730
I'll make sure you're the
one who pays for it.

353
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,810
It's not like I can control them all!

354
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,480
Do you know how many there are?!

355
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,280
Whether you can or not, you'd better.

356
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,320
Devote your entire body and
soul to protecting them.

357
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,620
P-Protecting... who?

358
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:28,580
My friends and me... and yourself.

359
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:39,090
You're as ruthless as ever, I see.

360
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,380
Oh, Junichiro. You're still here?

361
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,680
You should've threatened them
before they came after you.

362
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,220
It didn't occur to me.

363
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,100
Liar.

364
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:51,270
You ran to this particular
place on purpose, didn't you?

365
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:56,480
He tried to mess with me and my friend.

366
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,900
I wasn't going to let him
walk away unscathed.

367
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,610
You...

368
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,860
are not gonna die a pleasant death.

369
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:08,330
I never expected a pleasant
death in the first place.

370
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,710
Why did you bother waiting for me?

371
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,420
Well, you are still a girl, you know.

372
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,420
So is Tomo.

373
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,880
Yeah, but...

374
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,180
With her, it's not about
being a guy or a girl.

375
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,170
I don't want to hear it.

376
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:34,280
Not from you or that squishy bitch.

377
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,400
Squishy?

378
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,810
Aizawa

379
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,400
I'm heading out.

380
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,200
I really blew it yesterday.

381
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,660
I lost my cool and acted
like a savage again.

382
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,950
And just when he was starting
to notice me lately.

383
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,650
Morning, Tomo.

384
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,100
Jun...

385
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,450
What's wrong? Let's go to school.

386
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:00,590
That's it, Jun! That's perfect!

387
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:03,510
That's perfect!

388
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,000
What are you talking about?

389
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,440
That's perfect!

390
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:14,640
(This suspicious behavior is...)

391
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,940
Hey, you know, I'm all mixed up

392
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:23,400
It's too complicated, I'm freaking out

393
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,940
I want to look cute to you

394
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:29,280
(crazy, crazy, drive me crazy, and that's…)

395
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,570
So I'm plotting, bargaining,
sly, and stubborn

396
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,080
Dizzying love

397
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,670
Just tell him to look at you

398
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:43,630
And watch him stiffen up even more,
because you're both so awkward

399
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:47,510
What? Even if we're alike in that way

400
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:52,100
It doesn't make me happy, 'cause it
means our love is going nowhere

401
00:22:52,100 --> 00:23:00,980
Cloudy heart, swirling emotions—
I sense rain coming

402
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:10,070
So I partly open my umbrella,
then sneakily scoot closer to you

403
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:14,030
Please notice the curl of my
eyelashes as I keep blinking

404
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:18,960
And don't say I'm acting weird

405
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,920
All this plotting and bargaining
is my sly plan to look cute to you

406
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:27,970
Try to solve the riddle of
this soft, dizzying love

407
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,090
(Buzzing, fidgeting)

408
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:34,890
Listen, I might be a bit
tangled in my own web now

409
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:38,930
But once you unravel the mystery,
you'll see pure lo-love
