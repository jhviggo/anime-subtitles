1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:02,270
How're you feeling, Tomo?

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:04,560
Top of my game, obviously!

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,730
I've been through all the
training for this marathon!

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:10,900
Me, too.

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,820
I'm gonna win this one.

6
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,990
Oh, yeah? That's some big talk!

7
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,160
How about the loser has to pay
for a week's worth of drinks?

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,740
Sounds good! I hope you
don't regret that later!

9
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,620
The girls and boys aren't
even running the same route.

10
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,170
Just leave them be.

11
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,460
Hey, he's been trying to send us
some kind of signal this whole time.

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,380
Watch me, Misuzu-chan!

13
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,750
I'll finish this marathon for you!

14
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,390
Just leave him be.

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,100
Everyone, on your marks!

16
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,070
Great. They're all full of energy for...

17
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:02,750
At least run at the very beginning!

18
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,120
You heard her.

19
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,790
Oh, fine.

20
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,970
How the Contest Ends

21
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,510
"How the Contest Ends."

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,310
You haven't been enjoying karate
with me lately, have you?

23
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,110
No, that's not...

24
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,980
It's okay. I get it.

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,860
But today, you're putting all your
strength into keeping up with me.

26
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,320
Tomo...

27
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,290
But no matter how hard you run,
I'm gonna leave you behind in the end!

28
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,240
Don't cry, okay?

29
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,080
Bring it on! You're the
one who better not cry!

30
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,710
Marathons are a total drag.

31
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,590
I'm, like, so wiped!

32
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,630
Keep it up, everyone!

33
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,260
Hanao-chan's cheating!

34
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,810
Like, so not fair!

35
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,260
It's perfectly fair.

36
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,400
Wow, they've already made it this far?

37
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,070
Impressive!

38
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,400
I'm not letting...

39
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,240
...anyone...

40
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,360
...run in front of me!

41
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,530
Why, though?! Why?!

42
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,870
Why?!

43
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,500
This really is fun!

44
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,340
I still feel the best when
I'm competing with her!

45
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,390
Girls' Turning Point

46
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,930
Oh, yeah... I got so
excited, I didn't notice.

47
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,730
We weren't competing on equal
footing to begin with...

48
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,020
Huh?!

49
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,940
Hey, hang on, Tomo! You passed it!
You just passed it!

50
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,240
Huh? Passed what?

51
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,280
The girls' turning point!

52
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,700
Hah! That don't mean squat!

53
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:03,660
Huh?

54
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,370
You wanna compete with me, don't you?!

55
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:07,750
Yeah...

56
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,750
Yeah!

57
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,460
I'm impressed, Kosuke.

58
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,500
We're distance runners in the
track club, and look at you.

59
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,550
I'm feeling good today for some reason.

60
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,510
I've gotten stronger! It's clear now!

61
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,970
Those two made the turn already?

62
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,980
Damn, that's fast! Are they human?!

63
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,560
I've got a long way to go.

64
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,650
Damn it! I still can't catch up to Tomo?

65
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,330
Tomo?!

66
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,670
You're burning up!

67
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,050
How could you get knocked flat by a fever?

68
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,010
Did you do something weird yesterday?!

69
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,220
Yesterday? Yesterday...

70
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:13,390
I went out to run right
after I finished dinner...

71
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:17,110
and I think I got back around 10 PM.

72
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,110
How many hours did you run?!

73
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:23,030
After that... I took a bath and went to bed...

74
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,780
but when I woke up,
for some reason, I was naked.

75
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,990
I didn't do anything weird.

76
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,910
Like hell you didn't!
No wonder you have a fever!

77
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,830
Hey, Tomo!

78
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,380
Damn it!

79
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,250
What now? I don't have my phone,

80
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,760
and the teacher's with the
group a few kilometers back.

81
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,760
No sign of any cars coming, either.

82
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,800
What am I, dumb?!

83
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
What's there to even think about?!

84
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,970
I've got...

85
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,180
this body...

86
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,770
that I've been building up!

87
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,320
T-Tomo...

88
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,950
Keep calm and listen to me.

89
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,200
Y-You have a cold.

90
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,540
Okay. I think you need to calm down first.

91
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:20,040
I see. So Jun carried me back, huh?

92
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,960
That's what I heard.

93
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,130
I put him through a lot of trouble.

94
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,630
And we were looking forward
to this marathon...

95
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,050
But he finished first, apparently.

96
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,260
Huh?! But wasn't he carrying me?

97
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,430
That's probably why.

98
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,110
Tomo, should you be awake already?

99
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,070
Jun?!

100
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,940
I'll be going now.

101
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,700
You almost never get sick,
so take advantage of this.

102
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,530
Advantage?

103
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:52,450
Since you're always so strong,
showing weakness will be effective.

104
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,540
Depend on him for everything.

105
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,670
Would you wake up already?

106
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,920
Here's some water.

107
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,540
Oh... Thanks.

108
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:08,760
You and Misuzu are being nicer
to me than usual today.

109
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,090
It's throwing me off.

110
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,930
You wouldn't know since you've
never been badly hurt or sick,

111
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:18,060
but that's what happens when
you're too weak to even move.

112
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,900
That's how it is, huh?

113
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,690
Akemi-san's coming to pick you up.

114
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,320
Can you walk, Tomo?

115
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,280
Yeah...

116
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,990
Actually, no.

117
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,490
C-Carry me!

118
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:29,950
Huh?!

119
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:33,370
You carried me here on your back, right?

120
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,370
I don't remember any of it, so do it again!

121
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,210
That doesn't even make sense!

122
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,960
C-Carry me, damn it! I'm sick here!

123
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,960
You seem healthy to me.

124
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,460
Okay, fine.

125
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,760
Oh, so this is what it feels like.

126
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,350
You've gotten a lot bigger.

127
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,560
So have you...

128
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,770
Me? I've what?

129
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,600
Uh, sorry. Forget I said anything.

130
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,860
Sorry for everything that happened today.

131
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,410
I even ruined our contest.

132
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,490
Don't worry about it.

133
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:16,950
Whenever you're having trouble,
of course I'm gonna help you.

134
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,080
If you're having trouble with something,
of course I'm gonna help you.

135
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,620
Jun...

136
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:35,720
Tomo!

137
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,060
Her dad?!

138
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,890
Where is Tomo?!

139
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,770
In the car, heading for the hospital...

140
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,030
Wait for me, Tomo!

141
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,400
Green onions?

142
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,860
Hey, Jun! Thanks for coming!

143
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,700
I came to check in on you, but...
I guess I shouldn't be surprised.

144
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,500
I'm totally fine now!

145
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,960
But Mom refuses to let me go outside.

146
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,080
Obviously.

147
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,830
I forgot to say it with
everything going on, but...

148
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,920
I guess... Thanks for yesterday.

149
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,170
S-Sure... But don't be so reckle—

150
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,050
Oh, yeah!

151
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,590
Here. I'm returning this.

152
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,470
This...

153
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,060
How long can I borrow it?

154
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,480
Until I'm a stronger man than you.

155
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,730
When that time comes...

156
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,860
I'll take it back!

157
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,570
You said you'd take it back when you
were a stronger man than me, right?

158
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,830
You'd better not have it in your head
that you can beat me in everything now.

159
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,660
I won't lose to anyone on my own turf!

160
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,540
But that goes for both of us.

161
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,210
Right?

162
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,460
You have a problem being
on even footing with me?

163
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,760
Nah.

164
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,010
It's the best way to be.

165
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,980
To Stay Best Friends...

166
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,600
"To Stay Best Friends..."

167
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:10,940
Aizawa Dojo

168
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,400
Right before we started middle school,

169
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,860
I managed...

170
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,400
to land a hit on Tomo for the first time.

171
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,780
Ow...

172
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,110
I did it!

173
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,700
I landed a hit on you! On Tomo!

174
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,120
Huh... I guess you finally caught up to me.

175
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,660
It's kinda sad.

176
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,250
Sad? Not frustrating?

177
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,630
That happened sooner than I expected.

178
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,500
Huh?

179
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,760
Akemi's been going on
about it for a long time.

180
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,470
She always says Tomo's got natural talent,

181
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,060
that no matter what sport Tomo plays,
no one else will stand a chance.

182
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,180
But walking the path I walk,

183
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,600
the path where one can't
choose one's own opponent,

184
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,270
won't do our child any good.

185
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,020
What does that mean?

186
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,360
Entrance Ceremony

187
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,280
I finally get to go to
the same school as Tomo!

188
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,950
I bet he'll look awesome
in the school uniform!

189
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,660
Hey, Jun!

190
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,830
We can finally go to school together!

191
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,790
You're getting a little too
crazy with that skirt!

192
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,670
What kind of new start are you making?

193
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,210
Huh?!

194
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,300
Huh?

195
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:17,630
What? Junichiro thought you were a boy?

196
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,720
Yes, he did!

197
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:23,430
I knew he was an idiot,
but I had no idea it went that far.

198
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,810
So what are you going to do?

199
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:29,440
You can't just act the same around
him as you always have, can you?

200
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,520
Nah, I think it'll be fine!

201
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,400
Neither of us cares about stuff
like who's a boy or a girl!

202
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,740
I really don't think it'll be that simple.

203
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,620
Tomo's a girl.

204
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,040
Now that I think about it...

205
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,670
Who wouldn't have noticed?!

206
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:54,420
Did I just not want to notice?

207
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,710
I can't even laugh at this.

208
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,130
Hey,

209
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,800
Kubota-kun.

210
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,590
You seem to be pretty close
to Aizawa-san in Class C.

211
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,510
You going out?

212
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,230
Right... Of course people would think that!

213
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,280
I feel so awkward trying
to get Tomo's attention.

214
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,450
Hey, Aizawa-san, are you going out
with Kubota-kun from Class A?

215
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,820
No way!

216
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,780
Oh, you're not?

217
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,370
Really?

218
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,870
Yeah, he doesn't even see me as a girl.

219
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,630
And then this dude...

220
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,630
Don't talk about that!

221
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,720
So then what happened?

222
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,090
Hey, it's Jun!

223
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,140
Who?

224
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,430
Is he your friend?

225
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,060
Since we were kids.

226
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,390
Right, Jun?

227
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,480
Was that bloodlust emanating from him?

228
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,360
Scary...

229
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:03,610
What the heck am I doing?!

230
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,740
A whole year went by,
and I never apologized to Tomo.

231
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,830
We basically ended up on
the level of acquaintances

232
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,620
who only talked to each other
when it was necessary.

233
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,840
I really wanna just make
up with her already.

234
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,300
But if her friends get the wrong idea again,

235
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,760
it'll just make her feel bad.

236
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,760
Tomo again?!

237
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,640
I thought that after we
started middle school,

238
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,100
Yeah!

239
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,930
Tomo would start to calm down a little...

240
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:35,100
but she still shows no
signs of slowing down.

241
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:38,610
I can't play the games Tomo plays anymore.

242
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,240
She just keeps getting stronger,

243
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,820
and I don't want to just run around outside.

244
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,570
What can I do to be friends with her again?

245
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,160
Of course! I just need a girlfriend and—

246
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,830
Nah, that wouldn't be fair to the girl.

247
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:58,540
And it's not that easy to
get a girlfriend, anyway.

248
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,340
If only there was someone else between us...

249
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,970
Someone who could slow Tomo down a little,

250
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,340
who's cautious and has common sense.

251
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,890
On top of that, it'd have to
be a girl who could hang out

252
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:13,140
with me and Tomo while fully
understanding my situation.

253
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,660
Does lunch taste good when you eat alone?

254
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:30,030
Yeah. It just went from good to gross.

255
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,000
You always seem to be alone.

256
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,080
Why don't you try to make friends?

257
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,290
I'm alone because I can't make
friends even when I try.

258
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,340
That's a lie. You just don't want...

259
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:44,050
to replace Tomo.

260
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:47,010
If someone took her place,

261
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:51,140
you might never get back the relationship
you used to have with her.

262
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,390
That's your reasoning, isn't it?

263
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,440
I'm pretty tired of seeing
your sulky face by now.

264
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,400
Quit wallowing in self-pity,

265
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,520
and just make up with Tomo already.

266
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,360
I'm pretty sure she needs you, after all.

267
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,070
Gundo!

268
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:15,450
Gundo, would you...
maybe try going out with me?

269
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:23,130
That sounds like fun.

270
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:27,590
Hey... why did you agree to go out with me?

271
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,890
Because I figured it couldn't hurt.

272
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,640
Do you like me?

273
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,020
As if.

274
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,850
And I know it's not like
you love me, either.

275
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,310
Well, no...

276
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,150
I know I'm the one who asked,

277
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,070
but is this how "going out"
is supposed to work?

278
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,610
It's not a problem.

279
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:50,780
In the end, what matters most if you
want to keep up a good relationship

280
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,080
is whether or not it's in the
interest of both parties.

281
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,500
Huh? Your... Your hand?!

282
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,920
It's so soft!

283
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,090
I changed my mind. Can we stop now?

284
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,100
Your hand is all sweaty and gross.

285
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,770
Well, I'm this way, so see ya.

286
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,060
Hold it, Junichiro.

287
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,570
Something else you want?

288
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:29,740
Yes. I want you to call me by
my given name from now on.

289
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,950
Your given name?!

290
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:37,330
If I'm using your given name,
but you're not using mine,

291
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,290
will people believe we're going out?

292
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,410
Wouldn't they?

293
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,920
It'll just look like I have
a one-sided crush on you.

294
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,420
I can't deal with that.

295
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:52,010
I never thought Gundo would
actually become my girlfriend.

296
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,220
My girlfriend?

297
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:57,140
That's right... I have a girlfriend now.

298
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,890
And it's Gundo, the girl who argues
with me every time I see her.

299
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,360
She's... my girlfriend?

300
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:12,990
Sheesh... This sure has taken a weird turn.

301
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,780
I know this is a relationship

302
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:19,830
far removed from love and romance,
with no future at all...

303
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,710
But I still feel just a bit...

304
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,840
The good feelings ended there, though.

305
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,050
Our first date was a bike
ride up a mountain.

306
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:32,510
Well?! Awesome view, right?!

307
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,140
View?

308
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,550
Are you a total moron?

309
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:40,390
The second day, we went
fishing at the river.

310
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,310
Put this on your hook.

311
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,600
Ew! Keep that away from me!

312
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,860
Ew! It's alive!

313
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,320
Hey, Misuzu...

314
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,070
Was today not much fun for you?

315
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,070
Bingo.

316
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,780
I see...

317
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,870
If I tried to spend time
with Tomo right now,

318
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:02,750
I'd get exactly what I got from
these two days with Junichiro.

319
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:06,170
There's just no hope for me.

320
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,170
Hey, what's wrong with you?

321
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,800
I thought you might be able
to do something about this...

322
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,890
But the way you are now, you're just
kicking her into higher gear.

323
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,560
Hey, what's wrong, Misuzu?

324
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,310
You seem really down.

325
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,100
Did something happen?

326
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,060
Yes. A lot happened.

327
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:30,270
I'm sorry. I...

328
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,990
might not be able to keep being your friend.

329
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:35,700
Come on.

330
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,990
Ow! Hey!

331
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:41,700
Where are we going?
First period's about to start!

332
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,620
I don't care. Come with me.

333
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,420
What are you sulking about?

334
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,670
What do you mean, you can't
keep being my friend?

335
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,790
I'll knock you out!

336
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,210
That's extortion.

337
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,300
I mean, I have no physical strength at all,

338
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,260
so I can't play sports with you or anything.

339
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,680
What does that matter?!

340
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:01,890
It's not like I'm running
around every single day!

341
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,850
Goofing around with the guys is fun,

342
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:09,480
but the time I spend just being next
to you is way more precious to me.

343
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,860
Are you saying you don't feel the same?

344
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,570
Where do you learn things like that?

345
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,320
What? Did I say something weird?

346
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:21,490
Why would it matter that much
whether you're athletic or not?

347
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,160
I mean, like...

348
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,830
Oh, yeah!

349
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:29,210
Wouldn't it be cool for an athlete and
some kind of doctor to be friends?

350
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,210
What's "some kind of doctor"
supposed to mean?

351
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:35,960
Don't laugh!

352
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:40,720
All the things I was thinking
seem so silly now.

353
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,520
I guess going out with you
wasn't a total waste of time.

354
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,310
So I'll at least...

355
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,230
dump you soundly and completely.

356
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,110
Sorry, Misuzu.

357
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:53,610
Huh?

358
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,240
I know this sounds weird when I'm
the one who asked you out, but...

359
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,620
I feel like maybe we're not
a good match after all.

360
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:05,410
So let's just give up on going out, okay?

361
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,420
He... beat me to it!

362
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,840
Did you hear me? Hey, Misu—

363
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,840
Never... call me "Misuzu" again.

364
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,670
O-Okay.

365
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,640
I guess I'll have to handle this on my own.

366
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:28,060
I'm scared to find out how she'll react
when I talk to her after all this time,

367
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,770
but I'm prepared.

368
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,230
H-Hey, Tomo.

369
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,820
I wanted to talk to you about something.

370
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,580
I know I should be the one to talk first.

371
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,790
But what do I...

372
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:50,000
Hey. Hey, Jun.

373
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,080
Can I just tell her how I really feel?

374
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,880
But if I tell her that...

375
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,300
I just said your name.

376
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,340
Answer me, damn it!

377
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,680
Where did that come f—

378
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:10,140
Why did you just come up and
talk to me out of the blue?

379
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,520
After you avoided me all this time...

380
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,940
For a whole year...

381
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,730
I-I'm sorry!

382
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,450
It was my fault! Please don't cry!

383
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:21,860
Huh?

384
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:26,240
I'm not crying, you dumbass!

385
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,960
Why the hell were you avoiding
me all this time? Huh?!

386
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,210
When the school year first started,

387
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:40,420
people thought you and
I were... well... going out.

388
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,680
So I thought being around me would
just make things harder for you.

389
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,430
You were worried about
something that stupid?!

390
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,060
Huh?

391
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,430
If you and I both wanna be
together like we've always been,

392
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:55,150
who the hell cares what anyone else thinks?!

393
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,940
Well? What do you wanna do?

394
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:00,990
I want...

395
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,610
to be with you. Just like we always have...

396
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,080
I wanna be like that forever!

397
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,670
S-So just be with me, then!

398
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,500
As f-friends!

399
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,880
Yeah! You and I are best buds forever!

400
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,550
So let's have a lot more
good times together,

401
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,590
Tomo!

402
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,750
I thought we'd never change.

403
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,530
I thought it'd be best if we never changed.

404
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,730
But then I changed.

405
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,450
I think she has, too.

406
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:46,650
So I have to think of a way
I can still be with her forever.

407
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,200
First of all, I have to face her head-on.

408
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,870
What's the hold-up, Jun?

409
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,070
C'mon, we gotta get to school!

410
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:58,290
Face who Tomo is now head-on...

411
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,420
Head-on...

412
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,450
I had a vague hunch it might be true,

413
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,880
but isn't she actually...

414
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,160
really cute?!

415
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,680
(This behavior is suspicious)

416
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,850
Hey, you know, I'm all mixed up

417
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:23,170
It's too complicated, I'm freaking out

418
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:26,070
I can't figure out how to
say it, or how to read you

419
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:29,440
(crazy, crazy, drive me crazy, and that's...)

420
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:28,780
All this vagueness is just
pathetic and depressing

421
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,200
Antsy...

422
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,610
Antsy...

423
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,140
Impatient love

424
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:30,030
Antsy...

425
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:30,450
Antsy...

426
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:30,870
Antsy...

427
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:31,280
Antsy...

428
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:31,700
Antsy...

429
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,120
Antsy...

430
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:32,530
Antsy...

431
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:32,950
Antsy...

432
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:33,370
Antsy...

433
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:33,790
Antsy...

434
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,200
Antsy...

435
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,240
Antsy...

436
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,680
The truth is I love you,
but I keep beating around the bush

437
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:43,580
We're both the awkward type that'll try to
brush it off as a joke (so much pressure)

438
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:47,350
Sigh... Getting this exhausted
over nothing is so stupid

439
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:52,090
We'll never move forward or get
any answers that way, right?

440
00:22:52,090 --> 00:23:00,940
Now you're suddenly grumpy, why all the
swirling emotions? I sense rain coming

441
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,010
Smoosh

442
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:10,150
You can have my umbrella,
just don't cry or get all mad and soaked

443
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:14,260
Ah, my broken heart and
broken body are at odds

444
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:18,940
I guess I can't deal with this
unless I put armor on, can I?

445
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:22,890
Constantly losing and being bewitched,
all at your mercy, is just frustrating

446
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:28,520
I'm gonna solve the riddle of
this impatient, shattering love

447
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:30,300
(Grinding, throbbing)

448
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:34,960
Ugh, I might be a bit
tangled in my own web now

449
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,940
But once I find my courage,
you'll see pure lo-love
