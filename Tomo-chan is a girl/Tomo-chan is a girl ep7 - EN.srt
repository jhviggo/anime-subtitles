1
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:15,990
When I throw a jab or a straight,
it always lands

2
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,120
But when I'm aiming for your heart,
I miss every time

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,460
Parallel, zigzagging, awkward, incoherent

4
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,960
When you look my way and move closer to me

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,720
I know it doesn't mean the same thing for you

6
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,770
But I wish we could stay like this forever

7
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:47,900
My changing feelings are driving me crazy

8
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:53,190
The moment you turn to face me,
take that! Telepathy

9
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,660
If only we could feel the same thing

10
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,540
I want to kick this pesky subtlety away

11
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:09,540
I want to know everything,
I want to know everything

12
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,090
I can't fool you forever

13
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,720
I can't keep this hidden

14
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,470
I want to shout out my secret, AHHH

15
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,930
Take that! Telepathy

16
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,390
Te-te-te-telepathy

17
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,480
Telepathy

18
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,990
Junichiro's Promise

19
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,730
"Junichiro's Promise."

20
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,510
What was your reason for getting so strong?

21
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:01,550
I just wanted to catch up to the
big back I saw in front of me.

22
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,020
I first met her ten years ago,

23
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:14,150
the day after I moved here from Tokyo.

24
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,830
A-hup!

25
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,960
You just moved in yesterday, right?

26
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,420
Where'd you come from?

27
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,340
Tokyo.

28
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,670
Tokyo?!

29
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,550
Isn't Tokyo the place with
all the big, tall buildings,

30
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,720
where everybody lives way up high?

31
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,930
Did you, too?

32
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,390
Yeah.

33
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,350
That's so cool!

34
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,060
Oh, and all the cars float in the air,

35
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,390
and there are giant robots
walking around, right?

36
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,150
Yeah, sure.

37
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,310
That's awesome!

38
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,940
So, is that fun?

39
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,780
Lemme see it for a sec!

40
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,490
Hey, stop—

41
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,790
Don't break it! Don't you dare break it!

42
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,750
Don't worry!

43
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,210
2 Minutes Later

44
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,210
How does that even happen?!

45
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,760
I guess I had a kinda hard grip on it—

46
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,850
Wh-What did I just do?

47
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,560
That's not enough.

48
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,230
Huh?

49
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,320
I broke something that was important to you.

50
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,110
Hit me a hundred more times!

51
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,860
I won't feel better until you do!

52
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,030
I-It's fine...

53
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,160
You're sure just one hit is enough?

54
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,490
I'm sure!

55
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,250
Well, now I owe ya one!

56
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,170
I'm Tomo. What's your name?

57
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,040
It's... Junichiro...

58
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,540
Oh, yeah?

59
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,760
Nice name!

60
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,760
Greetings!

61
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,510
You must be Junichiro.

62
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,140
Y-Yes, sir!

63
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,890
I am terribly sorry!

64
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,650
Huh?!

65
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,360
My Tomo caused unspeakable trouble for you.

66
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,780
The kid actually went and
told him what happened?

67
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,740
A big, scary dad like him?

68
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,620
As Tomo's father, I will naturally
pay for all damages caused,

69
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,780
but is there anything else I can do?

70
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,160
No, really, everything's fine now.

71
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,120
That does not placate me!

72
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,580
They're definitely related!

73
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,340
Hey, Goro! What are you doing?!

74
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,750
Akemi!

75
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,300
Don't terrorize the new neighbors!
They just moved in!

76
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:46,760
Um...

77
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,140
Why are they behind me?

78
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,970
I'm sorry about that.

79
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:53,640
These idiots of mine are
bothering you, aren't they?

80
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,400
I-It's okay...

81
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,810
All right, come with me!

82
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,280
I'll settle this with his
parents myself later.

83
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,570
Be sure to make up with him, okay?

84
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,660
Okay.

85
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:12,950
I'm really sorry I broke your game.

86
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,000
We're the same age, and we live next door,

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,380
so I'd really like to be your friend.

88
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,590
Can I?

89
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,300
That's... fine with me.

90
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:37,230
From then on, Tomo and I played
together almost every day.

91
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:48,610
You've gotta be crazy!

92
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:53,450
Hey, gamer kid! Aren't you
gonna come outside today?

93
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,290
Do I look like I can go outside?

94
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,290
And stop calling me a gamer kid.

95
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:01,250
Well, you never call me by my name, either!

96
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,630
It's always "Hey, you," or "monkey,"
or "idiot," or something!

97
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,050
Sorry.

98
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,010
Okay, then... Tomo.

99
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,600
Say it one more time!

100
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,100
Huh? T-Tomo...

101
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,400
For some reason, it makes me really
happy when you call me by my name!

102
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,480
Why is that?!

103
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:27,650
This can't be right... This can't be right!

104
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,660
Hey, Jun!

105
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,830
Mind if she plays with us today?

106
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,120
This is Misuzu. We've been friends forever.

107
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,710
Be her friend too, okay?

108
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,630
She looks like a doll.

109
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,460
So you're Junichiro?

110
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,050
I hear you came here from Tokyo.

111
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,840
Th-That's right.

112
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,010
You have the face of a bumpkin, though.

113
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,560
Isn't she hilarious?

114
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,890
She'll pick a fight with anyone!

115
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,020
That's not hilarious!

116
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,440
I've never gone out to catch bugs before.

117
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,740
What kinds of bugs can we catch?

118
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,570
We have stag beetles and rhinoceros beetles.

119
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,910
Really?!

120
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,660
I don't wanna go to any
more weird places, though!

121
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,160
No climbing cliffs or crossing rivers!

122
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,460
Don't worry!

123
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,920
We'll catch our bugs at the
top of these stairs today.

124
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,090
It's only about two hundred steps.

125
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,900
Is this kid some kind of monster?

126
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,700
Wow, he's sure fired up!

127
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,830
What a child.

128
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,870
T-Take that!

129
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,630
I got here first!

130
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,840
That was awesome!

131
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,010
You look pathetic.

132
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,760
In the end, the one still
standing is the winner.

133
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,140
I'm gonna make you cry like a baby later!

134
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,850
You guys are such good friends already!

135
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,110
Look, Jun!

136
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,700
I found a big one!

137
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,200
Wow, a giant stag beetle!

138
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,450
That's just a giant cockroach.

139
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,580
Gross.

140
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,830
Awesome! I've never seen
one like this before!

141
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,040
These sell for thousands in stor—

142
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,630
Beautiful!

143
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,050
Hey, you finally get it now, too?

144
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,090
What's with this girl?!

145
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,760
Look, Tomo!

146
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,640
I got one, too!

147
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,480
Hey, nice!

148
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,020
It looks so cool!

149
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:11,570
Hey, so you can smile!

150
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:14,070
Huh? What do you mean by that?

151
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:17,660
Well, you're always making
those sulky faces.

152
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,950
See? Playing outside every now
and then isn't so bad, right?

153
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,540
Well, every now and then...

154
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,960
Come on, hurry up!

155
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,180
You've gotten pretty good at climbing trees!

156
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,220
A little climb like this is nothing.

157
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,310
I can't call you a gamer kid anymore!

158
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:46,390
That's right! Never call me that again!

159
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:51,150
I was finally able to keep
up with Tomo's crazy games.

160
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,780
Somehow, just being with Tomo

161
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:58,110
made me feel like I had gotten stronger.

162
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,950
But that was just...

163
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:05,830
Hey!

164
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,290
That's a pretty cool thing you've got there.

165
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,130
...a big misunderstanding.

166
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,510
Hey...

167
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,760
What happened to your cheek?

168
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,060
Huh? Oh... I just fell.

169
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,140
You're a real klutz, aren't you?

170
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,610
Yeah, I sure am! I gotta be more careful!

171
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,570
What are you laughing about?

172
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,150
You're so confusing.

173
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,450
Here ya go.

174
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,000
Why did you have this?

175
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,250
Oh, well...

176
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,790
I found it lying on the ground!

177
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,130
What?!

178
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,050
What were you thinking?!
You got it back alone?!

179
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,680
Hey, hang on...

180
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,550
Why would you take a risk like that?!

181
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,680
What do you think you're doing?

182
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,520
Why do you do things like this?

183
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,360
Huh?

184
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,860
I never asked you to get it back for me!

185
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,400
I dunno what you're talking about,

186
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,330
but if you're having trouble with something,
of course I'm gonna help you.

187
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,200
We're friends, aren't we?

188
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:29,790
Don't make it sound so simple!

189
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:37,000
I can't do anything like that for you!

190
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:43,970
Here.

191
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,100
You can borrow it.

192
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,270
Really? You're sure?

193
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,100
Yeah.

194
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,520
Thanks!

195
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,480
How long can I borrow it?

196
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,940
Until...

197
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,730
Until I'm a stronger man than you.

198
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,240
When that time comes...

199
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,240
I'll take it back!

200
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,490
Aizawa Dojo

201
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:09,790
How much stronger you get
from now on is up to you.

202
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,460
I won't go easy on you.

203
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,250
Yes, sir!

204
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,620
Please teach me!

205
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,460
You will respond with "Osu"!

206
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,960
O-Osu!

207
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,850
It's really been ten years?

208
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,900
And I still...

209
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,990
Yes! I beat the game!

210
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:46,620
How many dozens of times does that make now?

211
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,330
When's he gonna come to take this thing back?

212
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:54,080
He's already way stronger than me.

213
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:00,920
When Tomo Puts On

214
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:00,920
a Swimsuit...

215
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,090
"When Tomo Puts On a Swimsuit..."

216
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,130
We're here.

217
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,510
Heya!

218
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,640
Hey!

219
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:11,430
We all decided to go to the beach
together over summer break.

220
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,390
Hey, you're supposed to inflate
the swim ring after we get there!

221
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,440
So you really came? I thought you
had no interest in the beach.

222
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,110
I wasn't intending to come...

223
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:21,730
Well, you got a new swimsuit.

224
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:25,070
Now you don't have to be shy about
going to the beach with Junichiro.

225
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:30,370
Yeah, but I don't know if I have the guts
to play around with him in this swimsuit.

226
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,200
Want me to go with you?

227
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,540
You'll come with us?

228
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,870
Carol, please.

229
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,380
I bet Jun-kun's face when he sees Tomo-chan
in a swimsuit will be amazing.

230
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:45,590
...but I'm looking forward to this, Junichiro.

231
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,050
To what?

232
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,090
This is for you, Jun-kun.

233
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,470
Hey, cut it out!

234
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,220
Carry the parasol, too.

235
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,890
Why do I have to—

236
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,350
And wear these.

237
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,690
H-Hey, you guys...

238
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,810
He looks like that one guy in the group
who's fired up when no one else is.

239
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:03,150
You're a bit too excited, Junichiro.

240
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,700
Calm down, Jun! There, there!

241
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,460
It's...

242
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,420
...the...

243
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,710
...beach!

244
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,260
Woo-hoo.

245
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,720
Yeah!

246
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,360
Thanks for waiting, Jun-kun.

247
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,820
Where's Tomo?

248
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,820
Why are you looking up?

249
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:56,040
Shower Room

250
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:56,040
Changing Room

251
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:56,040
Entrance

252
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:56,040
Woman

253
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,660
Tomo's hiding over there.

254
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,620
What're you hiding for?

255
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,500
Jun!

256
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,710
You're not supposed to be wearing a hoodie.

257
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,960
Take that off and let's go swim—

258
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,890
C-Can't breathe...

259
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,980
Yay!

260
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,070
This is the best!

261
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,240
Feels so nice.

262
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:32,740
It's unusual for you to
come over to me by choice.

263
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,790
Shut up. There's just nowhere else I can sit.

264
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:39,370
So Carol and Tomo are too
much of a temptation,

265
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,750
but being around me doesn't
bother you at all?

266
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,380
Let me hit you just once.

267
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,760
I didn't even say anything.

268
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,220
Hey, Jun!

269
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,680
Why are you sitting down?

270
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,140
T-Tomo?!

271
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,970
Let's hit the water!

272
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,560
Come on, hurry up!

273
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,480
W-Wait, you idiot! Don't cling to my arm!

274
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,940
Why not?

275
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,480
Stop! Get away!

276
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,110
She's enjoying the beach so much,
she forgot about the swimsuit.

277
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,730
Come on!

278
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,440
Tomo! Please!

279
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:12,400
Tomo, you probably haven't noticed...

280
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,540
But you're being just the right
kind of aggressive right now.

281
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,250
Gah!

282
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,920
What's wrong?

283
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,800
Like, Aizawa Tomo and the
blonde boob chick are here!

284
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,300
F-For real?!

285
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,300
Take that!

286
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,180
Whoa... She's pretty
impressive without clothes.

287
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,350
I, like, wouldn't ever
want to stand beside her.

288
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,850
You said it.

289
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,230
Like, who are you?

290
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,480
Jun-kun! Jun-kun!

291
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,900
Don't get close to me!

292
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,250
Was splashing around always that painful?

293
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,670
Anything is a weapon in her hands.

294
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:14,340
Anyway, why does Jun-kun keep running
away from Tomo-chan and me?

295
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,220
He's fine around you.

296
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,140
You don't actually know what
you just said, do you?

297
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,180
It's this.

298
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:25,020
Do you mean Jun-kun doesn't like boobs?

299
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,650
No. The opposite.

300
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,110
He's a pervert who loves big boobs.

301
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,030
I don't get it.

302
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,830
Man, the beach really is fun!

303
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,200
Hey, you there!

304
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,960
You're a cutie!

305
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,880
A-Are you talking about me?

306
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,670
Yeah, you! I'm talking about you!

307
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:55,510
That's the first time a guy
I don't know ever said that to me!

308
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,430
Huh?

309
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,550
What did you see on me that made
you think that? Tell me in detail!

310
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:02,470
Okay, okay!

311
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,020
I'll tell you everything.

312
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,400
Around those big rocks over there...

313
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,360
Where we can take our time.

314
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,730
Wait, I'm kinda... scared.

315
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,200
C'mon, let's get moving.

316
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,570
H-Hang on!

317
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,990
Wow, you're strong!

318
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,990
I wanna slug him into orbit right now!

319
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,410
Hey, chill out.

320
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,080
But I can't!

321
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,330
I don't think I could hold back!

322
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,120
Are you being shy?

323
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,920
That's part of what makes you cu—

324
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,210
Huh?

325
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,880
Wh-Where did you come from?!
You her boyfriend?!

326
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,970
Huh? No way.

327
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,430
Then why'd you get between us?!

328
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:46,310
I don't really know why,
but you're just wrong.

329
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,390
Don't touch Tomo with your filthy hands.

330
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,320
I wish he'd say that one more time...

331
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,200
One more time... One more time...

332
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,990
Sorry. I shouldn't have butted in.

333
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,110
Huh?

334
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:04,030
You wouldn't want people thinking
I'm your boyfriend, right?

335
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,250
I wouldn't?!

336
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,790
What's wrong with this idiot?!

337
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,500
Does it bug him that much to have
people think we're a couple?!

338
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:12,500
Wouldn't

339
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,500
Want

340
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,170
Jun-kun! Help!

341
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,680
Jun?

342
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,100
What are you doing? Let's go.

343
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,260
Thanks!

344
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,810
Who the hell are you? Her boyfriend?

345
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,520
My boyfriend, he said!

346
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,020
Go ahead and think that if you want.
I can't be bothered with you.

347
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,860
Wh-What?!

348
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,150
He wouldn't want people thinking
he and I are a couple?

349
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,110
But she's fine?!

350
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,580
Isn't that a good thing?

351
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,490
Like hell it is!

352
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,410
If you really want to change
the way things are,

353
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,080
today's your best chance to do it.

354
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,250
It is?! Wh-What should I do?!

355
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,630
Get as close to Junichiro as you can,

356
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,220
and always stay within his line of sight.

357
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,680
That's it?

358
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,090
That's it.

359
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,600
Soft Serve

360
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,020
Jun! I bought us soft serve!

361
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,140
Really?

362
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,350
Yep! It's on me. Eat up!

363
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,860
Thanks.

364
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:20,280
Is this getting close enough?

365
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,320
Closer, maybe?

366
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,950
Is this really all I need to do?

367
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,740
He's not reacting at all.

368
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,630
Tomo... What's gotten into you?

369
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,800
Whoa! That's cold!

370
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,510
Oh, sorry.

371
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,140
It's fine. I'm getting back
in the water later, anyway.

372
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,230
Huh? Something wrong?

373
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,320
Uh... Nah, nothing.

374
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,780
Let's get in the water again!

375
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,820
S-Sure...

376
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:11,200
Something's been a little
off with me lately.

377
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:16,670
There were all kinds of things
I wanted to do with Tomo today,

378
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,130
but every time she touches me...

379
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,670
Every time she smiles at me...

380
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,430
I suddenly can't move.

381
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,440
Why do you look so smug?

382
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:46,580
You didn't seem like you were having
much fun at the beach today.

383
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,320
Did something happen?

384
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,260
Huh? No, not really...

385
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,280
Actually, maybe something did happen.

386
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,310
I knew it. I'm still not sure
what it is he wants to do,

387
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:07,010
but he doesn't see Tomo as
anything but a girl anymore.

388
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,560
(This suspicious behavior is...)

389
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,850
Hey, you know, I'm all mixed up

390
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:23,320
It's too complicated, I'm freaking out

391
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,860
I want to look cute to you

392
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:29,200
(crazy, crazy, drive me crazy, and that's…)

393
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,490
So I'm plotting, bargaining,
sly, and stubborn

394
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,990
Dizzying love

395
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,580
Just tell him to look at you

396
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:43,550
And watch him stiffen up even more,
because you're both so awkward

397
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:47,420
What? Even if we're alike in that way

398
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:52,010
It doesn't make me happy, 'cause it
means our love is going nowhere

399
00:22:52,010 --> 00:23:00,900
Cloudy heart, swirling emotions—
I sense rain coming

400
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:09,990
So I partly open my umbrella,
then sneakily scoot closer to you

401
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:13,950
Please notice the curl of my
eyelashes as I keep blinking

402
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:18,870
And don't say I'm acting weird

403
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:22,840
All this plotting and bargaining
is my sly plan to look cute to you

404
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,880
Try to solve the riddle of
this soft, dizzying love

405
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:30,010
(Buzzing, fidgeting)

406
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:34,810
Listen, I might be a bit
tangled in my own web now

407
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:38,850
But once you unravel the mystery,
you'll see pure lo-love
