1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,310
Seat's all mine!

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,650
You jerk!

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,060
There's room next to me.

4
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:08,980
Wanna sit?

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,000
Actually, I'll stand.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,080
Yeah? Okay.

7
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,090
He seriously doesn't have a clue!

8
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,880
He doesn't treat me anything like a girl,

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,590
and I'm always the only one
who's all hyper-aware.

10
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,810
Even though my heart's pounding so hard...

11
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,310
I feel so stupid!

12
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,990
Tomo's

13
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,990
Skirt

14
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,570
"Tomo's Skirt."

15
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,040
It's getting pretty crowded.

16
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:38,090
Wh-What?! Is this what they call a groper?!

17
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,880
Wait, that couldn't happen
to me of all people...

18
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,050
He just groped me?!

19
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,680
I just wanna slug him right now!

20
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,560
But...

21
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,980
I'm not sure why, but I don't
want Jun to know about this.

22
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,570
This is so gross.

23
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,150
I feel like I have to just put
up with it, or I'll start crying.

24
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:06,040
What the hell do you think you're doing?

25
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,040
Jun took care of everything,
from reporting the guy

26
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,170
to handing him over to the authorities.

27
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,460
Lock him up for life, please.

28
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,090
Tomo, you okay?

29
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,970
Oh... Yeah...

30
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,680
Be sure to go talk to the police later.

31
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,680
I've never seen Jun like this before.

32
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,560
Gonna be a pain in the ass, but...

33
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,270
I feel like he's actually treating
me like a girl right now.

34
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,850
Also, you know...

35
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,360
Hey! Are you listening?

36
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,280
Huh? Wh-What's up?

37
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,740
I was saying...

38
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,910
Maybe you should stop wearing skirts.

39
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:47,830
Huh?

40
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,710
What did you just say?

41
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:55,210
When I got groped on the
bus yesterday, Jun said—

42
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,380
What's this about groping?

43
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,510
What did he do to you? Are you okay?

44
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,970
Oh... Yeah...

45
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,090
He just touched my butt a little.

46
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,970
Did you take him to the police?

47
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,100
You didn't let him go, did you?

48
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,980
Jun took care of all that.

49
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,770
I see.

50
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,150
Uh... Misuzu?

51
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,570
Anyway, what were you saying about him?

52
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,280
Huh? Oh...

53
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,570
Well, he said...

54
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,160
What the hell are you saying?

55
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,370
Our school allows girls to wear slacks, too.
Why not wear those?

56
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,210
But why are you suddenly
bringing this up now?

57
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,920
Why? Because...

58
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,130
It...

59
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,380
It looks wrong on you!

60
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,090
And I can't relax when you're wearing it.

61
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,720
I know damn well it looks wrong on me!

62
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,180
Jun, you asshole!

63
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,310
Just when I thought he was finally
treating me like a girl!

64
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,860
That jerk!

65
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,900
I see.

66
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,320
But if you think about the circumstances,

67
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,530
he may have said it because he doesn't
want you getting groped again.

68
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,570
Huh?

69
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,490
You mean he was thinking about me that way?

70
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,370
Jun was?

71
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,170
I'm sorry. That was an
irresponsible thing to say.

72
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:21,000
No?! So there's no chance of that at all?!

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,760
Anyway, I noticed a while ago,
but hadn't said anything...

74
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,140
Your skirt is pretty short.

75
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:33,310
I didn't think you were the type
to enjoy showing that much leg.

76
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,140
Why do you wear it so short?

77
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,940
Well, 'cause it's easier to move around in.

78
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,940
What other reason would there be?

79
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,940
Yeah, skirts really aren't meant for you.

80
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,320
For starters...

81
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,200
Try taking off the shorts for a while.

82
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,620
What?! No way!

83
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,330
What are you getting all pervy for?!

84
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,540
I'm not.

85
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,200
Look, Tomo...

86
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,750
The normal way to wear a skirt is with
nothing but your panties underneath.

87
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,880
You liar!

88
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,460
If your skirt flipped up,
people would see everything!

89
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,460
That's what skirts are.

90
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,880
Even I...

91
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,380
only have panties on under mine today.

92
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,840
Huh?!

93
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,640
That's the kind of girl you are?

94
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,220
I haven't done anything to
deserve that creeped-out look.

95
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,650
Junichiro.

96
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,980
Huh?

97
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,110
I heard what happened.

98
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,570
You had a fight with Tomo, huh?

99
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,950
Lay off.

100
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,780
Tomo says she wants to walk home with you.

101
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,200
She's waiting downstairs.
You'd better go now.

102
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,210
For real?! She's not mad anymore?!

103
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,000
That's right.

104
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,040
Sweet!

105
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,180
Hey, Jun.

106
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,060
Let's walk home together.

107
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:01,560
Jun?!

108
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,900
Let's go.

109
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,820
Y-Yeah...

110
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,570
Just try going without the shorts for now.

111
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:15,160
I bet that'll get a different
reaction out of Junichiro.

112
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,700
I ended up taking them off like Misuzu said.

113
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,290
Hey, Jun...

114
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,090
Sorry I hit you so hard yesterday.

115
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,000
Okay?

116
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,760
She's right. Jun's reacting totally
differently than he has before.

117
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,050
Huh?

118
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,800
Jun?!

119
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,770
In fact, he's being just plain weird!

120
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,560
Standing room only again?

121
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,440
This bus is always packed lately.

122
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:52,400
m 195 284 l 195 324 444 324 444 284

123
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:52,400
Junichiro Vision

124
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,040
Jun's walking faster than usual today.

125
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,710
Hey, Jun!

126
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,880
What's his problem?

127
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,550
It's almost like he's
running away from me.

128
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,820
Wait up, would you?!

129
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,480
Jun?!

130
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,780
Sorry.

131
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,740
Huh?

132
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,200
Something was wrong with me yesterday.

133
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,230
I know just being best buds doesn't give me
the right to tell you to dress differently.

134
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,410
But...

135
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,840
I don't think it's right to wear
stuff that you feel embarrassed in.

136
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,090
It messes things up for me, too.

137
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,260
Jun's making such an interesting face!

138
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,590
Are you even listening to me?

139
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,350
How'd it go after you took
off the shorts yesterday?

140
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,900
It went horribly! That's how!

141
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,730
I'm never dressing like that again!

142
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,110
Did he see your panties?

143
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,570
Bull's-eye.

144
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,910
Okay, and how did Junichiro react?

145
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:22,790
Actually, I don't really know why, but...

146
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,160
He dropped like a rock.

147
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,010
I hear you haven't said
a word to Tomo all day.

148
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,920
She seemed pretty sad.

149
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,590
Shut up.

150
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:40,850
It's unusual for you to
avoid Tomo for half a day.

151
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,810
I guess it'll take a while for
you to reset this time, huh?

152
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:47,480
Go on, try—

153
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,120
Heya, Tomo! Let's eat lunch together!

154
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,830
Jun!

155
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,040
I keep telling you not to pop
up outta nowhere like that!

156
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,580
Aw, don't be mean!

157
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,170
I'm not!

158
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,540
I'm just acting like I always do!

159
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:14,550
It'll be interesting to see
how long this keeps up.

160
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,920
See? See? See? See?

161
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,750
You little—

162
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:22,010
The School Idol

163
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,720
"The School Idol."

164
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,010
Good morning, Carol-chan!

165
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,270
Morning.

166
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,140
You look as cute as ever!

167
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,440
Can I carry your bag for you?

168
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,230
No, thanks.

169
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,700
There she is. Carol Olston.

170
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,410
Surrounded from the moment she
shows up, just like every day.

171
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,370
If she's the most popular with the guys,

172
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,660
does that mean she's the girliest?

173
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,500
It's hard to say.

174
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,500
Must be nice... How do
you even get that way?

175
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,510
For starters...

176
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,720
Put down the dumbbell.

177
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,600
She's not just popular for her looks.

178
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,890
She's also the only English student in the
school, so she has a certain premium feel.

179
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,440
Also...

180
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,980
What?

181
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,440
Her personality.

182
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,320
That soft, defenseless feel she has
hits the guys right in their instincts.

183
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,780
What, so being defenseless is good?

184
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,370
Someone like that would get
knocked out in no time!

185
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:30,370
You should really stop thinking
in terms of knocking people out.

186
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:38,260
How can being defenseless
actually be better?

187
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,760
If I make friends with
that cotton candy chick,

188
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,260
will I find out?

189
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,180
Aizawa-san!

190
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,020
What's wrong? You look lost in thought.

191
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,850
Misaki-senpai...

192
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,940
Whoa! Cotton Candy!

193
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,320
Cotton Candy?

194
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,070
What are you two doing together?

195
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:02,240
She's a distant relative of mine.

196
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,700
You could say we've been friends
since we were little... or...

197
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,570
We're engaged.

198
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,660
Engaged?!

199
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,790
Are you... serious?

200
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,660
You two are getting married someday?

201
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,670
It has been discussed, I guess...

202
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,750
We've already gotten married.

203
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,130
Three times.

204
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,050
She's talking about when we were kids,
pretending to get married!

205
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:27,140
Anyway, are you a friend of Carol's?

206
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:30,350
No, we haven't really talked much,

207
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,060
but we're in the same class.

208
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,310
Right?

209
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,190
You don't remember?

210
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,650
Dunno.

211
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,990
I'm not interested in the boys in our class.

212
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:44,150
I'm a girl! Do you not see the skirt?!

213
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,530
S-Sorry! I'm so sorry!

214
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,830
She's a little strange,

215
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:51,120
but she doesn't mean any harm,
so let it slide, okay?

216
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,420
Well, if you say so, Senpai.

217
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:58,380
Thanks, Aizawa-san.
You're a really nice person.

218
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,210
Huh? Not really...

219
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,220
A girl...

220
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,890
Poke!

221
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,810
She doesn't... mean any harm, right?

222
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,980
Hey... Come on, Carol!

223
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,150
Dummy.

224
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,610
Dummy.

225
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,030
Dummy.

226
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,570
So... what's that all about?

227
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,330
That's what I wanna know.

228
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,700
I only talked to her for
the first time today,

229
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,330
but she's apparently
Misaki-senpai's fiancée.

230
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,620
Ah, I get it.

231
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:41,630
And Senpai was with you when
you talked to her, wasn't he?

232
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,090
Yeah, he was.

233
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:48,390
And you have no idea why she picked
a fight with you in that situation?

234
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,600
Right. I don't remember doing anything.

235
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,060
Dummy.

236
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,980
Why are you doing that now, too?!

237
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,980
Misuzu-chan, Misuzu-chan.

238
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,440
There's something I want
to talk to you about.

239
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,400
Fine...

240
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,780
But first, get off my desk.

241
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,740
Okay.

242
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,530
Let's get this out of the way first.

243
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,950
I'm not fond of people like you.

244
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,790
Okay, got it.

245
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,580
I want to ask you some
questions about Tomo-chan.

246
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,000
You're tough.

247
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,460
You seem to see Tomo as your enemy,

248
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,550
but no matter what you might think,
I consider myself her best friend.

249
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,930
If you're trying to dig up dirt,
ask someone else.

250
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:31,140
Even if I'd treat you to cake? It's tasty...

251
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,810
I'll hear you out, at least.

252
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,180
Okay, so...

253
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,350
How do you think I can defeat Tomo-chan?

254
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,770
At least try to cover up
your malice a little bit.

255
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,070
Now, I wonder how I can use this girl.

256
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,190
If that's what you want to know...

257
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,990
There's someone else who
can help you more than me.

258
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:54,080
Hey, who's your favorite girl in first year?

259
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,000
Carol-chan, obviously!

260
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,410
She's as cute as a doll!

261
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:02,500
Mine's Misuzu-chan! I love those icy eyes!

262
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,040
Hi.

263
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,340
Are you Kubota Junichiro?

264
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,090
Yeah, that's me.

265
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,550
There's something I want
to talk to you about.

266
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,680
Boys' Locker Room

267
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,680
First of all...

268
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,100
Get out of my locker.

269
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,520
I said there was someone I want to defeat,

270
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,690
and I was referred to you.

271
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,020
So Gundo sent you, huh?

272
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,110
I don't really like that, but...

273
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:30,990
I'm surprised there's someone besides
her who'd want to beat someone up.

274
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:36,120
I was just looking for a way to kill
time while my buddy's doing club stuff.

275
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,910
I'll help pump you up if you
can meet me after school.

276
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,210
Pump me up?

277
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,250
First, let's see you hit
me as hard as you can.

278
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,250
Like this?

279
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,550
I was hoping you'd hit my hand, actually...

280
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,880
Anyway, you're pretty damn weak, aren't you?

281
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,340
A kitten could beat you up.

282
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,810
Are you going to make me stronger?

283
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:01,060
Well, it depends on how far you're
willing to go, but give me a month.

284
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,020
I'll get you to bear cub level, at least.

285
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,020
Are those strong?

286
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,530
Yo, let's go, Blondie.

287
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,570
My name isn't Blondie.

288
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,450
It's Carol.

289
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,530
Whatever. Just come on.

290
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,660
'Kay!

291
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,500
Yes, I know.

292
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,540
Did you see that?! What was that about?!

293
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,050
Why is Jun acting like that with her?!

294
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,960
I don't know, but...

295
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,800
It's obvious that something happened.

296
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,470
For Junichiro to be like that
with a girl who isn't you...

297
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,810
Maybe they're actually...

298
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,230
No! No way!

299
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,400
I mean, she has a fiancé!

300
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,230
Wait, but... maybe...

301
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,360
That's right, Tomo.

302
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:54,150
That's the sense of urgency
that you need more of.

303
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,910
Okay, we're gonna start by running.

304
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,490
'Kay!

305
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,830
What's wrong?

306
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,090
I can't run any more.

307
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,670
Are you kidding me?

308
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,130
I wonder...

309
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:15,930
what Jun and that girl
are up to right now...

310
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,140
Jun...

311
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,020
A-Aizawa-san...

312
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,150
Captain!

313
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,570
Next is strength training.

314
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,900
'Kay!

315
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,860
One...

316
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,240
I can't.

317
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,320
One...

318
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,950
I can't.

319
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:44,410
Look... What can you do?

320
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,540
I can jump rope.

321
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,500
'Cause I like bunnies.

322
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,050
Okay, I don't know what
that means, but go for it.

323
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,310
Why are you looking up?

324
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,890
Neck exercise!

325
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,020
Jun! This is where you've...

326
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,650
been...

327
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:11,480
Okay, when your enemy comes
up on you like this...

328
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,730
Hey, there's my enemy!

329
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,740
You were talking about Tomo?!

330
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,490
She's really strong, though!

331
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:18,940
Wha...

332
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,740
What the hell are you guys doing?!

333
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,950
I asked you what you're doing, damn it!

334
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:28,420
H-Hey... What are you so mad about?

335
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,380
I'm not mad! I'm just asking!

336
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:35,260
Just stick close to him,
and you'll find out in no time.

337
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,090
Assuming you're not a total idiot, that is.

338
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,010
I lose.

339
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,850
Tomo-chan, Tomo-chan.

340
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,560
I'm done being your enemy now, okay?

341
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,310
Huh?

342
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,270
I'm done with this training, too.

343
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,810
Bye-bye!

344
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,740
I came along because you promised
to treat me to cake...

345
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,160
But why are we in this
unnecessarily long car?

346
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,990
And who is that guy in the black suit?

347
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,910
I dunno.

348
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,620
You're the one who called him.

349
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,790
There are lots of guys in black suits
at my house whose names I don't know.

350
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,000
Don't you have any at your house?

351
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,130
I'm pretty sure most people don't.

352
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,590
Hey, so, Misuzu-chan...

353
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,680
Since we're eating cake together,

354
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,390
does that mean we're friends now?

355
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,720
I'm not sure.

356
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,310
Do you want friends?

357
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,230
Yeah!

358
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:32,270
I don't have even a single friend.

359
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,270
Dunno why.

360
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:36,360
Indeed, I wonder why.

361
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:40,200
If you want friends,
you should talk to Tomo.

362
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,780
I'm sure she'd be your friend.

363
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,740
And it would be a great
motivator for Tomo, too.

364
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,830
Hmm... I did a lot of mean
things to her, though.

365
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,960
So you do feel bad about it, then?

366
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,040
That doesn't matter, though.

367
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,630
She's nice to a fault toward
anyone who approaches her.

368
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,640
She calls a girl like me
her best friend, after all.

369
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,310
I see...

370
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,770
Even despite your bad personality, huh?

371
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,230
That's exactly your problem.

372
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,310
Hey, Tomo-chan!

373
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:17,270
Oh, it's you. What is it now?

374
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:18,860
Well...

375
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,900
Fwiend!

376
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,070
Ew, no way.

377
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,070
Friends?

378
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,830
Uh, I dunno...

379
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,040
Let's not...

380
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:36,000
Um... It's kind of hard to say, but...

381
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,960
Th-There's something that's
hard for her to say?

382
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,380
What kind of crazy thing
is she about to say?!

383
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,300
I want you to be my friend!

384
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,260
Huh?

385
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,390
Oh, sure, that's fine.

386
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:50,890
Huh?

387
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,190
Jeez, that's what you wanted?

388
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:56,270
I didn't know what I was gonna do
if you called me your enemy again.

389
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,360
Okay, well... nice to know ya!

390
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,830
Tomo-chan, you're...

391
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,580
just like an angel!

392
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,290
Huh? An a-angel?!

393
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,420
Misuzu-chan, will you be my friend, too?

394
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,510
Fine with me.

395
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:26,130
You seem to be pretty rich, after all.

396
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,010
Yay!

397
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,260
I'm so glad I'm rich!

398
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:35,810
I never thought I'd end up
being friends with her.

399
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,770
She's pretty nice once you
talk to her a little.

400
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,270
Huh...

401
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:44,110
That blonde and Gundo are apparently
pretty popular with the guys.

402
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:48,370
Well, they're both cute and girly, I guess.

403
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,830
Are they?

404
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:55,540
Well, not that I'm in any place
to say much about Gundo...

405
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,540
Huh?!

406
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,460
Wait, are you saying you
have a thing for Misuzu?!

407
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,000
Hell no.

408
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,050
You know we went out for a
while in middle school, right?

409
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,550
Huh?
