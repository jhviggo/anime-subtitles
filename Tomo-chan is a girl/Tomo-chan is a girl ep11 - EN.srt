1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,350
You? Working?

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:09,310
Yeah. Jun's birthday's coming up, you know?

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,960
I want to give him a present,
but I don't have any money.

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,210
Do you know what kinds of jobs high
school kids are allowed to do?

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,800
O-Of course I do!

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,960
The ones where you say, like,
"Welcome!" and stuff...

7
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,540
They call it the service industry, right?

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,120
Even if you don't like how your boss or
the customers look, you can't punch them.

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,360
How about I punch you first?

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,390
I guess I have no choice.

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,550
Huh?

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,930
The idea of sending you off
to work alone worries me,

13
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,640
so I'll work with you.

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,980
Really?!

15
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,820
Thanks! That makes me feel a lot better!

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,400
Let me in on it, too.

17
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,720
Oh, you wanna work part-time, too?

18
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,690
I do!

19
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,150
Wait, what? You wanna work part-time?

20
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,190
Then why don't all of you...

21
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,490
work at my place?

22
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:17,970
When I throw a jab or a straight,
it always lands

23
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:23,100
But when I'm aiming for your heart,
I miss every time

24
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,440
Parallel, zigzagging, awkward, incoherent

25
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,940
When you look my way and move closer to me

26
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:38,700
I know it doesn't mean the same thing for you

27
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,740
But I wish we could stay like this forever

28
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:49,880
My changing feelings are driving me crazy

29
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,170
The moment you turn to face me,
take that! Telepathy

30
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,640
If only we could feel the same thing

31
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,520
I want to kick this pesky subtlety away

32
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,520
I want to know everything,
I want to know everything

33
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,070
I can't fool you forever

34
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,690
I can't keep this hidden

35
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:21,450
I want to shout out my secret, AHHH

36
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,910
Take that! Telepathy

37
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,370
Te-te-te-telepathy

38
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,460
Telepathy

39
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,010
My First Part-Time Job

40
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,550
"My First Part-Time Job."

41
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,430
God Ramen Tatsumi

42
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,430
Welcome, welcome! This is
my family's restaurant!

43
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,470
Tatsumi's told me about you three.

44
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,890
God Ramen Tatsumi

45
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,890
I'm his dad, Tatsuro.

46
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,720
Glad to have you on board.

47
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,230
H-Hello!

48
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,600
Thank you for letting us work here.

49
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,560
Thanks!

50
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,730
Boy, you have no idea how much
I appreciate you doing this.

51
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,480
My wife and I were running
this restaurant on our own,

52
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,450
but just recently, she...

53
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,330
went home to visit her family!

54
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,710
Come back to me, Kiyomi!

55
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,750
Don't mind him. This happens all the time.

56
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,590
Hey...

57
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,840
Do I really have to work in this?

58
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,050
Yay! It's cute!

59
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:26,180
I'm so glad I got those in case
we ever got any female help!

60
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,770
This was your idea?!

61
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:30,430
These don't look much like
ramen shop uniforms!

62
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,400
In that case, I'm okay with not
being a ramen shop anymore.

63
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,610
Come on, boss!

64
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,360
That's the uniform.
What other choice is there?

65
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,440
God Ramen Tatsumi

66
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,820
Just shut up and wear it.

67
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,780
So why aren't you wearing it?!

68
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,700
God Ramen Tatsumi

69
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,580
Okay, we're open!

70
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,750
We got a customer! Welcome!

71
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,290
Uh... Wel...co...

72
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,210
Welcome.

73
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,840
Will this seat at the counter be all right?

74
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,130
Uh, sure.

75
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,260
Hi there. Whatcha wanna eat?

76
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,390
Huh? Uh...

77
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,810
What would you recommend?

78
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,810
Recommend?

79
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,850
Yeah. What do you think tastes the best?

80
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,560
Oh! Well, I like cake.

81
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,400
Huh? You have that here?

82
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,230
I'm afraid not.

83
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,860
God Ramen Tatsumi
5 Toppings FREE

84
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,900
You're clearly useless at
dealing with customers,

God Ramen Tatsumi
5 Toppings FREE

86
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,030
so at least be a panda.

87
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,240
Okay.

88
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,160
Hey, Tomo-chan...

89
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,200
What noise do pandas make?

90
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,580
Huh? They're like bears,
so... I guess they roar?

91
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,380
Roar!

92
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,970
Thank you for your patronage.

93
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,180
Come again!

94
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,640
When we're working side by side like this,

95
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,640
it almost feels like you
married into my family!

96
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:56,900
I'm sorry. I didn't quite catch that.
Could you say it again?

97
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,610
I said it feels like you
married into my family.

98
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,860
One more time.

99
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,360
It... It feels like you...

100
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,780
Can you still say that?

101
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,450
S-Sorry.

102
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,750
Miso ramen with a side of gyoza, please.

103
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,620
You got it!

104
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:18,830
Welco—

105
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,920
Tomo?!

106
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,760
Hey, Kubojun! Good to see you again!

107
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,300
Hey, Tanabe... What's going on here?

108
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,390
There was one outside, too.

109
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,220
Well, actually...

110
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,560
Welcome.

111
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,400
Allow me to show you to your seat.

112
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,400
You're... Gundo, right?

113
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,440
You would forget the face
of a childhood friend?

114
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,570
Forgive my rudeness, sir,
but are you a chicken or something?

115
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,200
Right this way. Your seat is over here.

116
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,030
Yep, that's Gundo.

117
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,000
Hey, Tanabe! What did you mean by "again"?

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,790
Does he come here that often?!

119
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,420
Y-Yeah, once a week or so.

120
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:04,050
Why didn't you tell me sooner?!
I'll throttle you!

121
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,760
Uh, sorry...

122
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,720
Well? What do you think of
Tomo in her waitress uniform?

123
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,470
I was surprised, but...
I mean... I guess it's nice.

124
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,560
"I guess it's nice"?
What do you think that means?

125
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,440
I think that means it's fine.

126
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,940
Here's your char siu ramen.

127
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,440
Thanks...

128
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,990
Go on and laugh if you want.

129
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:27,860
Huh?

130
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,820
I mean, I look ridiculous in this, don't I?

131
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,660
No, I... don't think it looks bad at all.

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,630
"Not bad"? What do you think that means?

133
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,590
I think that means it's fine.

134
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,800
Great meal.

135
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,260
Th-Thank you very much. Please come again.

136
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,180
This feels kinda weird, huh?

137
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,350
How long are you gonna keep working here?

138
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,220
Huh? Just until the end of the long weekend.

139
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,350
Okay, I'll come back tomorrow,
then. Keep it up.

140
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,950
I brought some customers.

141
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,910
Thank you for waiting.

142
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,200
No problem!

143
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:25,040
God Ramen Tatsumi

144
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,040
3 Days Later

145
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,920
Great work, all of you.

146
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,260
These have been a fun few days.

147
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,680
And here's your pay.

148
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,140
Boss... Thanks for everything!

149
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,310
Yay! Money!

150
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,980
Isn't this more than you promised us?

151
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,310
Since you all worked so hard,
I added a bit extra.

152
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,900
I think that was to be expected,
given that we produced results.

153
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,520
R-Right...

154
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,900
Did she squeeze it out of him?

155
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,860
Will the shop be okay without us?

156
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:57,200
Don't worry! It's about time for Mom to
make her periodic trip back here, anyway.

157
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:01,000
If I'm being honest, I'd love to
have you keep working here...

158
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,080
We'd be glad to come back and
help you out occasionally.

159
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,670
What? Really?!

160
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,380
There aren't many employers that
give workers so much freedom.

161
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,880
I wanna come back again, too!

162
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,140
I feel like I'm making a
deal with the devil.

163
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
Jun?

164
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,180
Hey.

165
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,560
You waited to meet me
after work again today?

166
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,060
Well, Tomo, see you at school.

167
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,650
Yep!

168
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,570
I'll walk home with Misuzu-chan.

169
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:31,360
Not so close.

170
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:37,280
You actually came to the restaurant
every day of our break.

171
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:38,700
You that bored?

172
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,250
I went because you were there.

173
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,500
I figured if you went on some wild rampage,

174
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,210
they'd need someone around
who could stop you.

175
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,760
Huh?! What do you think I am, exactly?!

176
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,720
Besides...

177
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,720
I've eaten their ramen tons of times,

178
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,680
but for some reason, it seemed to taste
better when you brought it to me.

179
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,520
So... you know...

180
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,140
Good job.

181
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,650
Th-Thanks.

182
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,950
I can really have this?!

183
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,490
Yep. It's your birthday present.

184
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,290
It's just a cheap one, though.

185
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,620
That's totally fine! It's great!

186
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,170
Incidentally, I wear the same one.

187
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,710
That doesn't bother you, does it?

188
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,630
Of course it doesn't bother me!

189
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,960
As long as it's you, I wouldn't
mind matching from head to toe!

190
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,670
H-Head to toe?!

191
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,380
I mean, that'd be cool, right?
Like we're a team!

192
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,350
Oh... Right, a team.

193
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,890
It hasn't been like this in so long.

194
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:47,850
I thought he'd changed recently,
but I guess Jun is still Jun.

195
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,770
I bought cake, too.

196
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,400
Wanna have a birthday party at your place?

197
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,660
My mom's... gonna be home late tonight.

198
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,700
Huh? Oh...

199
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,160
S-So if we're having a party,
can it be at your place?

200
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,120
I'm sure Akemi-san will be there.

201
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,620
Y-Yeah, that makes sense.

202
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,920
Maybe something really is different!

203
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:17,010
The Abandoned Cinderella

204
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,920
"The Abandoned Cinderella."

205
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,550
Misuzu...

206
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:24,100
What can I do to make Jun see me as a girl?

207
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,060
Haven't heard that in a while.

208
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,230
Things have been going
great lately, thanks to you!

209
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,940
I figure if I'm gonna push, now's the time!

210
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,770
Got any ideas that'll work quick?

211
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,730
Let him touch your chest?

212
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:35,480
Huh?

213
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,070
Wh-What the hell are you saying?!

214
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,950
The chest would be too much,

215
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:43,200
but sharing bodily contact is the
quickest way to move forward.

216
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,540
Sharing contact? But it's
not that easy to just...

217
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:49,830
Don't worry. I have a plan.

218
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,170
You do?

219
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:55,170
Yes. All you have to do is stand facing him.

220
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,260
Then I'll...

221
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,050
push him into you from behind.

222
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,720
What's with you today?

223
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,680
A regular push probably won't
be enough to even budge him,

224
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,310
so I'll push him down from here.

225
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,730
That's dangerous!

226
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,770
It's fine as long as you catch him.

227
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,060
That's not the issue here!

228
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,650
Ah, I get it.

229
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,030
You don't feel confident
that you could catch him.

230
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,110
Huh?

231
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,030
Who do you think I am?

232
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:27,330
I can catch a Jun or two, no problem!

233
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:31,040
Perfect. I changed the subject to muscles.

234
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,040
What're you doing here?

235
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:38,050
Hey, Tomo. What are you doing down there?

236
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,090
I'm ready anytime.

237
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,880
Bring it on!

238
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,350
Huh? Bring what on? What are you—

239
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,600
Is this girl...

240
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,390
trying to flat-out kill me now?!

241
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,770
Now, go. And put on a pathetic
display of confusion.

242
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,650
Just like before.

243
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,730
Hell yeah!

244
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,990
Bring it!

245
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,450
Huh?! He dodged me?!

246
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,200
Oh, it's Jun-kun.

247
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:18,130
Ooh. Bad Jun-kun.

248
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,550
Sorry! It wasn't on purpose!

249
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:25,090
Let me make it up to you!
If there's anything I can do, name it!

250
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,600
Aw, that's okay, really.

251
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,060
It is not okay! Treat yourself better!
In various ways!

252
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,100
Then...

253
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,190
Tomo, do it! Don't hold back!

254
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,240
Are you sure? None of this was your fault.

255
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,200
I'm sure! Do it!

256
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,660
More!

257
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,620
More!

258
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,080
What I did today was way
over the line, even for me.

259
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,750
What in the world am I...

260
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,670
Misuzu-cha—

261
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,430
Is this divine retribution?

262
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,220
Ow...

263
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,310
You okay, Misuzu-chan?

264
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,100
Must be my lucky day, to have
Misuzu-chan fall on me...

265
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,610
I'm sorry, Tanabe-kun.
You're not hurt, are you?

266
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,570
Huh?

267
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,650
Wh-Wh-What's wrong with you, Misuzu-chan?!

268
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,780
Not only did you apologize,
but you're showing concern for me?!

269
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,950
Oh, no! Did you hit your head?!

270
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,120
I'm fine.

271
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:33,250
You saved me by cushioning my fall.

272
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,620
Should I do something to thank you?

273
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,960
That's not necessary!

274
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,920
You don't need to hold back.

275
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,920
Right now... I just feel
a pressing need to atone.

276
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,470
I don't quite get it, but...

277
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,970
A chance like this doesn't come every day!

278
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,050
What should I ask her to do, though?

279
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:53,930
How far can I go? Should I just
push as far as I dare? Or...

280
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,060
Oh, crap!

281
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:58,230
I thought about it too long!
She's almost back to her usual self!

282
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:03,980
I-I'd really like to... swap contact info!

283
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,490
Okay, then. I got off a lot
easier than I expected.

284
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:10,120
Damn it! I could've gotten more?!

285
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,790
Hey, Misuzu-chan.

286
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,620
What was that all about earlier?

287
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,250
I finally realized something.

288
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,590
It seems I don't want Tomo and
Junichiro to get together.

289
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,380
Huh?

290
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,550
All this time, all I've
done is get in their way.

291
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,840
Are you sure about that?

292
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:34,180
I don't think you're as
bad as you think you are.

293
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,310
Carol...

294
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,600
Misuzu-chan...

295
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,690
Get off me.

296
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:41,440
Even now, I still can't get away with it?

297
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,990
Misuzu's pretty late.

298
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,280
Did she oversleep?

299
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,910
She said she was staying home sick today.

300
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,950
I didn't know about that.

301
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,710
How did you find out?

302
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:01,170
I got a message from her.

303
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,130
Why'd she only tell you?

304
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,510
Don't get all smug!

305
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,050
We'll start homeroom now.

306
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,560
Today, we'll assign parts for our production
of Cinderella at the cultural festival.

307
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,140
Cultural Festival
"Cinderella"

308
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,690
Who should play the part of Cinderella?

309
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,560
3 Days Later

310
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,320
I've never taken this many days off before.

311
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,900
I just can't bring myself to face Tomo.

312
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,830
There are many things I want to say,

313
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,710
but first, why did you come to the window?

314
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:48,510
I would've felt bad making you
go downstairs when you're sick.

315
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,340
That's a favor I never asked for.

316
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,930
C'mon, don't play tough.

317
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,720
I bought all kinds of sweet
stuff for ya! Want 'em?

318
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,060
I do not.

319
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,680
I've got those things that
cool your forehead down, too!

320
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,890
No, thanks.

321
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,810
Okay.

322
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:04,690
What is all this?
You're not acting like yourself.

323
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,690
Well, lately it seems like she's the
only one you wanna be friends with.

324
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,070
It's great that you're getting
along so well with Carol...

325
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,870
but you've been avoiding me, haven't you?

326
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,460
I think my cold just came back.
I'm going to sleep.

327
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,330
Hey! No fair!

328
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,840
Jeez...

329
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:31,590
"Cinderella"

330
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:30,840
Here. It's the script for
our cultural festival play.

331
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,590
Read up.

332
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:37,430
If you don't like me anymore,
I can't help that.

333
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,560
But if that's not the case,

334
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,810
you're probably just overthinking things.

335
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,150
Overthinking... Yeah, maybe to her.

336
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,740
No matter how horrible
I made myself out to be,

337
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,740
I'm sure she'd just smile and
forgive me like it was nothing.

338
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,160
But that's exactly why I...

339
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,300
What the hell is this about
me being Cinderella?!

340
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,380
C-Calm down, Misuzu!

341
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,220
I'm a girl, and they're
making me play the prince!

342
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,590
The whole class decided together.

343
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,600
Who gave my name first?!

344
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:20,760
Oh...

345
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:22,350
I know!

346
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:25,020
Misuzu-chan should be Cinderella!

347
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,730
That was me.

348
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:30,270
You're gonna rip her cheeks off!

349
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,190
Hey.

350
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,030
So you finally showed up, Cinderella.

351
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,240
What?

352
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:39,160
You think you're in any
place to make fun of me?!

353
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,490
You're playing a tree!

354
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,950
Yeah, yeah! You're a tree!

355
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,000
Quit making things even more
complicated when you're a tree!

356
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,250
Cinderella
Act 1
"Cinderella's House"

357
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,630
We'll begin the play practice now.

358
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,920
Everyone with a part, come up front.

359
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,630
"Cinderella"
Act 1
"Cinderella's House"

360
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,630
Cinderella, hurry up and prepare our dinner!

361
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:59,850
Hey, Cinderella! You'd better have
finished the laundry I told you to do!

362
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:03,810
Cinderella, have you
finished cleaning my room?

363
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:06,270
Clean your own damn room.

364
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,020
Sh-She's scary!

365
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,440
Mother!

366
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,400
Don't worry. It's all right.

367
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,150
Hey, calm down! It's just play practice!

368
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,360
Why is she playing the stepmother?

369
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,740
I can't concentrate in here.

370
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,370
Let's practice our lines somewhere else.

371
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,080
Uh, sure.

372
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,700
Greetings, my prince.

373
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,790
Wh-What a beautiful l-lady you are!

374
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,090
W-Would you d-dance with—

375
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,050
Literally no one is this awkward.

376
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:36,010
Well, I mean, I've never acted before!

377
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,340
How do I even do it?

378
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:41,180
In your case, you could probably
just talk the way you normally do.

379
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,560
What a beautiful lady you are.

380
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,270
Would you dance with me?

381
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,150
See? That's no good at all!

382
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,730
It's perfect, you lady-killer.

383
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:59,200
You're so lucky. You and
Carol make great princesses.

384
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,910
Hardly. This isn't my kind of thing, either.

385
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:06,040
I wouldn't say I wish I could
be a princess or anything,

386
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:11,080
but if I'm the type to play a prince,
no one's ever gonna see me as a girl.

387
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,460
I don't see why there couldn't
be princesses like you.

388
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,260
Huh?

389
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:21,260
Having you play Cinderella might
be a bit too much to ask, but...

390
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,260
You could be a bandit princess.

391
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,180
How about I rob you blind?

392
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:29,180
Well, we should be heading back.

393
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,020
Right.

394
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,440
Tomo says she wants to
go out with Junichiro,

395
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,940
but she's convinced herself that
she's not worthy of that right now.

396
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:40,700
And it's all because...

397
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,660
Then why not act more like a girl?

398
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:47,080
I put that curse on Tomo.

399
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,500
Now I have to undo it.

400
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,250
There's no one else who can.

401
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:02,050
Tomo-chan, you look so handsome!

402
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:05,010
Really? This is kinda embarrassing...

403
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,350
Th-The binder busted loose!

404
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,190
We need to wrap her tighter!

405
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,400
Wow...

406
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,860
She's a princess...

407
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,360
Aizawa-san, you've got a knack for this!

408
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,820
R-Really?

409
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,280
That dress looks great on you, Olston-san.

410
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,620
Thanks!

411
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,040
Hey, can I call you "Carol-chan"?

412
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,160
Sure!

413
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,080
Oh! Then I will, too!

414
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,500
Everyone else is moving forward,

415
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,420
yet only I'm still...

416
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,550
Something bothering you?

417
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:45,680
Since it's you, I'm guessing it's about Tomo?

418
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,180
Mind your own business.

419
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:50,980
I bet you're only thinking of roundabout
ways to deal with it, right?

420
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:54,230
Why don't you try facing
her head-on for once?

421
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,770
Damn it! I can't get up!

422
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,610
You're the last person
I want to hear that from.

423
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:07,620
All the prep's on track. Now we just
wait for the festival to start.

424
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,580
You're so laid-back about this.

425
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,870
I've got nothing but stress.

426
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,870
If you've got nothing to do,
help me practice my lines.

427
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:19,840
No way. Cinderella's basically
the only character you talk to.

428
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:23,220
Jun as... Cinderella?

429
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,640
Wh-What's wrong with that?

430
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,060
Just do it! It doesn't bother me!

431
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:33,180
Yeah, it might not bother you, but...

432
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:36,240
Wait! Please, wait!

433
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,810
I want to know more about you!

434
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:42,430
I-I'm very sorry, Your Highness.

435
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:45,830
I have to g-g-go now.

436
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:48,010
F-Farewell.

437
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,330
Please don't go!

438
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,710
Look, can we please stop now?

439
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,680
This is kinda fun!

440
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,700
Help me out a little more!

441
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,580
Huh?!

442
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,370
Please don't go, Cinderella!

443
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,510
I-I can't stay!

444
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:09,130
Please remove your hand, Your Highness!

445
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:14,640
(This suspicious behavior is...)

446
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,940
Hey, you know, I'm all mixed up

447
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:23,400
It's too complicated, I'm freaking out

448
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,940
I want to look cute to you

449
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:29,280
(crazy, crazy, drive me crazy, and that's…)

450
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,570
So I'm plotting, bargaining,
sly, and stubborn

451
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,080
Dizzying love

452
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,670
Just tell him to look at you

453
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:43,630
And watch him stiffen up even more,
because you're both so awkward

454
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:47,510
What? Even if we're alike in that way

455
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:52,100
It doesn't make me happy, 'cause it
means our love is going nowhere

456
00:22:52,100 --> 00:23:00,980
Cloudy heart, swirling emotions—
I sense rain coming

457
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:10,070
So I partly open my umbrella,
then sneakily scoot closer to you

458
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:14,030
Please notice the curl of my
eyelashes as I keep blinking

459
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:18,960
And don't say I'm acting weird

460
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,920
All this plotting and bargaining
is my sly plan to look cute to you

461
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:27,970
Try to solve the riddle of
this soft, dizzying love

462
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,090
(Buzzing, fidgeting)

463
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:34,890
Listen, I might be a bit
tangled in my own web now

464
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:38,930
But once you unravel the mystery,
you'll see pure lo-love
