1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,220
Sorry, Jun.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,930
I promised Misuzu and Carol
I'd walk home with them today.

3
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,140
It's cool. Don't worry about it.

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,060
You're taking this awfully well, Jun-kun.

5
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,780
Not going to get all dejected this time?

6
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,410
I'll never get dejected over not
going home together anymore.

7
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,820
I don't want to be the kind
of guy who ties Tomo down.

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,810
Jun...

9
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,100
What the... S-Stop!

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,880
Lately... Actually, for a while now...

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,630
I think it started when he started
to see me as a girl, to be honest...

12
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,890
But Jun's been so relaxed,
it's actually kinda pissing me off.

13
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:37,680
I get it.

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,640
I get it, too.

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,600
It's like I'm the only one freaking out,

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,560
and it makes me feel like I've lost.

17
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,440
I don't think it's an issue
of winning or losing,

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,650
but I get that you want to
see him acting flustered.

19
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,440
Then... why not kiss him?

20
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,110
Huh?! K-Kiss him?! Are you...

21
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,890
If it was that easy, I wouldn't
be suffering like this!

22
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,280
You could try watching
a kissing scene together.

23
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,750
I bet that would make him think about it.

24
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,330
D-Does it really work like that?

25
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,920
It'll be Christmas soon.

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,960
Why don't you go see this together?

27
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,980
When I throw a jab or a straight,
it always lands

28
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:34,110
But when I'm aiming for your heart,
I miss every time

29
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:39,450
Parallel, zigzagging, awkward, incoherent

30
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,950
When you look my way and move closer to me

31
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:49,710
I know it doesn't mean the same thing for you

32
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,760
But I wish we could stay like this forever

33
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:00,890
My changing feelings are driving me crazy

34
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:06,180
The moment you turn to face me,
take that! Telepathy

35
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,650
If only we could feel the same thing

36
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:16,530
I want to kick this pesky subtlety away

37
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:22,530
I want to know everything,
I want to know everything

38
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,080
I can't fool you forever

39
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,710
I can't keep this hidden

40
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:32,460
I want to shout out my secret, AHHH

41
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,920
Take that! Telepathy

42
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,380
Te-te-te-telepathy

43
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,470
Telepathy

44
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,020
To Stay by Your Side...

45
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,640
"To Stay by Your Side..."

46
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,360
Jun!

47
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,320
Did you wait long?

48
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,040
You look kinda grown-up today.

49
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,500
You think so?

50
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,830
What about me? Well? Well?

51
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:14,130
Hey, c'mon! Look at me!

52
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,380
Tomo...

53
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,670
You look... cute today. Pretty, in fact.

54
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,760
There's just something special
about this look. I really like it.

55
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:31,020
Sorry... I'm not used to this kind
of thing, so I can't say it well...

56
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,190
Y-Yeah...

57
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,520
Damn him!

58
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,610
We're gonna see this today!

59
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,530
What?!

60
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,780
This Love Is the Real Deal!! A Story of Pure Love

61
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,660
Are you actually serious?

62
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:48,410
This Love Is the Real Deal!! A Story of Pure Love

63
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,410
C'mon, Jun. We're not little kids anymore.

64
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,870
You can't panic over a little kiss.

65
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,000
Wh-When did you turn into
that kind of adult?!

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,710
Heh!

67
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,550
This Love Is the Real Deal!! A Story of Pure Love

68
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,550
Staring at this thing for
a whole week paid off!

69
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,010
Wait, Haruko!

70
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,600
We should stop seeing each other.

71
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,720
But why?!

72
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,980
You're someone I must never love!

73
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,310
Forgive me, Keita-kun.

74
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,610
When it gets to the kissing scene,
put your hand on top of his.

75
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,280
The effect will be immediate.

76
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,160
All right! Bring it on, kissing scene!

77
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,620
Wait, what?!

78
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,200
We can't! Not here!

79
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,460
I can't hold back anymore!

80
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,330
I love you, Haruko.

81
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,800
Okay. Come to me, Keita-kun.

82
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,420
Haruko... Haruko!

83
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:45,380
Did Misuzu go see this movie by herself?!

84
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,590
This is way beyond just a kiss!

85
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:51,600
If I put my hand on his now,
it'll look like I'm asking for this!

86
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,600
Damn! He's really taking this in!

87
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,350
Keita-kun...

88
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,230
Haruko...

89
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,150
The movie was... p-pretty interesting, huh?

90
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,780
Yeah. I guess it pays to go
into things with an open mind.

91
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,280
You were looking really focused.
Are you into that kinda thing?

92
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,660
Does he like pervy stuff that much?!

93
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,670
I actually couldn't get into love
and romance stories before.

94
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:20,670
I always thought I was the kind of
guy who couldn't relate to all that.

95
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,050
But now... I don't know why...

96
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,840
Because I fell in love with you, maybe?

97
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,800
I'm total scum!

98
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,890
Oh, yeah.

99
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,560
Here. It's your Christmas present.

100
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,440
Thanks...

101
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,180
Go on. Open it.

102
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,740
Wh-What do you think?

103
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,240
This kind of thing really
doesn't suit me, huh?

104
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,290
I'm so glad I bought those.

105
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,330
Say something!

106
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,670
Actually, I have something for you, too.

107
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,670
Here you go.

108
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:06,310
No way... Is this a handmade muffler?!

109
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:09,720
I heard it was a classic gift choice,
so I gave it a shot,

110
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,550
but it didn't come out well
enough to actually wear around.

111
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,760
I bet you feel pretty
awkward just accepting it.

112
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,390
Don't just put it on right away!

113
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:25,230
The truth is, I don't have any
complaints about the way Jun is now.

114
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,700
I know he's acting calmer
because I'm important to him.

115
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:34,910
It's just... Somehow, I've gotten greedy.

116
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,500
I want to shock him more!

117
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,830
I want to make him like me more!

118
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,880
It's getting dark. Ready to head home?

119
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,510
I'll go... to your house.

120
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,550
Huh?!

121
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,930
But it's already night—

122
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,440
So your mom's out again today, huh?

123
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,100
I think she'll be back by nightfall, though.

124
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,280
Oh.

125
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,910
I know!

126
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,450
Wanna play some games?

127
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,160
No, I'm good.

128
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,170
Okay.

129
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,850
Chill out, me!

130
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,810
I've been alone with Tomo in my
own room tons of times before!

131
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:39,680
Hey...

132
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,350
Can I...

133
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,650
sit next to you?

134
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,750
I knew I wasn't cut out for bargaining!

135
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:11,010
I came here today... to kiss you!

136
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,120
Kiss me?!

137
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,800
T-To kiss me?! Where did that even...

138
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,850
You don't want to?

139
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,430
No, it's not that I don't want to...

140
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,060
I guess...

141
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,270
I don't have any feminine
appeal after all, huh?

142
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,120
Tomo!

143
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,280
Huh?! Jun?!

144
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,910
Is it gonna happen?!

145
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:35,990
Are we...

146
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,070
Are we about to do that?!

147
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,120
He's making a fist?!

148
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,400
Is that a thing, too?!

149
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,210
What?!

150
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,790
What the hell are you doing?! Are you okay?!

151
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,840
Tomo...

152
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,010
You have so much appeal!

153
00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:00,810
The desire to kiss you... a-and touch you...
is constantly on my mind!

154
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,970
Huh?!

155
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:05,640
But I don't think it's right to just
do those things without any thought!

156
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,770
I want them to be special.

157
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,610
Jun...

158
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,570
So I can't do that now.

159
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,240
I haven't even asked you
to be my girlfriend yet.

160
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,120
You're right. We're not even going out yet.

161
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,870
Wait, we weren't even going out yet?!

162
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,130
Actually, after I told you
how I felt about you,

163
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:34,300
I went to talk to your parents.

164
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,630
Akemi-san gave our
relationship her blessing,

165
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,430
but your dad...

166
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,220
If you want to date Tomo,

167
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,850
you have to defeat me first!

168
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,350
That's what he said.

169
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:51,150
Dad, you stupid piece of shit!

170
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:57,400
How could you tell him he can't date
Tomo unless he beats you? Poor Jun-bo.

171
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,450
Yeah.

172
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:02,030
So? Why are you all depressed now?

173
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,500
Tomo is...

174
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,960
She's really my daughter, huh?

175
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,340
You're asking that after all this time?

176
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,010
You won't find a cuter
daughter than her anywhere.

177
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,720
Damn you, old man!

178
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,810
Tomo?

179
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,390
You know what this is about, don't you?

180
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,140
Mm...

181
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,060
Why'd you tell him he can't
date me unless he defeats you?

182
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,190
What were you thinking when
you said that to Jun?!

183
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,610
M-Mm...

184
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,820
Quit your stupid grunting
and answer me, asshole!

185
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,450
M-Mm...

186
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:44,910
Damn it! You're gonna keep
me in the dark, then?

187
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,500
Forget it!

188
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,290
Tomo?

189
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,750
Dad...

190
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,500
I hate you!

191
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,630
She hates me?!

192
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:10,100
Happy New Year, Misuzu-chan.

193
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,690
Happy New Year.

194
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,900
You still can't get in touch with Tomo-chan?

195
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,070
No.

196
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,820
She won't answer her phone,

197
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,990
and my messages aren't even
being marked as read.

198
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,950
I wanted to do our first shrine
visit of the year with her.

199
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,240
You haven't heard anything from
her since Christmas, right?

200
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,410
That's right.

201
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,580
It's Jun-kun, isn't it?

202
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,460
Yes. It has to be him.

203
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,870
Sorry to tell you after you
took the time to come over,

204
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,550
Aizawa

205
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,840
but she's still saying she
doesn't want to see anyone.

206
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,840
I see.

207
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:49,390
H-Hey, I know! Why don't you
try fighting Goro right now?

208
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,020
He's been off his game.

209
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,940
He might be easier to beat than you think.

210
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:59,320
No, I'm not in the mood to
fight right now, either.

211
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,030
N-No, huh?

212
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:05,370
Back at School

213
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,580
Just wait a minute!

214
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,540
Shut up!

215
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,040
I said wait, Tomo!

216
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:19,200
Do you know why I'm pissed off?

217
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,920
Because I didn't tell
you what your dad said?

218
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,720
Bingo. Why didn't you tell me?

219
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,890
Because...

220
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,850
You could have just told me

221
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,560
that you'd go kick my dad's ass,
so I could just take it easy and wait!

222
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,020
Then I would've...

223
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,980
I can't just ask you to wait for me!

224
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,240
I don't... have to wait?

225
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,950
Yeah. Since it's come to this,
I intend to face it with all I've got.

226
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:51,950
But I know it's not gonna be
that easy to beat your dad.

227
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,880
Defeating him was already my life's goal.

228
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,800
So if I go through my whole
life never able to beat him,

229
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,130
I'll just...

230
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,930
Get...

231
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:09,300
Get real!

232
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:15,230
As long as Jun's like that, he'll never win,
no matter how capable he is!

233
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,520
Long time no see.

234
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,320
How have you been, Tomo-chan?

235
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,570
You completely ignored us
all through winter break,

236
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,200
so I guess it's been two weeks?

237
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,910
Do you remember when we said
we'd all go skiing together?

238
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:33,450
Um... I'm... really sorry...

239
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,790
So that's what happened.

240
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,460
Well? Do you think he can win?

241
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,130
H-He can!

242
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,510
Maybe not right away, but...

243
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:47,260
If he takes his training seriously,
maybe in a few months...

244
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,300
No, maybe a few years...

245
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,510
That's too long.

246
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:53,390
So what are you going to do?

247
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:58,180
What do you want me to say?
There's nothing I can do.

248
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,940
And that's okay with you?

249
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,110
If you want to take the heroine's
stance of silently observing

250
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,610
a battle between two men, that's fine.

251
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,780
But is that what you want?

252
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,500
Tomo!

253
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,840
Wh-What?!

254
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,290
I'm gonna challenge your dad today.

255
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:28,970
Kashima Daimyojin

256
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,180
Kashima Daimyojin

257
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:37,980
Damn.

258
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,520
Jun-bo! What the hell are you thinking?!

259
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,970
You said you'd accept my challenge
at any time, didn't you?

260
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,030
So you will accept it, right?

261
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,700
Very well, then.

262
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,450
I thought if I said that, you'd
give up on Tomo and run away.

263
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,290
I realize I'm at a huge disadvantage.

264
00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:00,670
So I'll do whatever I have to do to defeat you.

265
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,080
And on that note...

266
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,510
I've called in some support.

267
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,210
H-How dare you?!

268
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:09,470
Br-Br-Bringing Akemi here is playing dirty!

269
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,090
Jun's challenging my dad right now.

270
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:15,430
Should I really just stay here?

271
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:20,640
Aizawa-san... If something's bothering you,
you can talk to me...

272
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,400
Huh?

273
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:27,070
I see. So he really went to
challenge Goro-san, huh?

274
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,360
Jun-kun's amazing.

275
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,780
You said it.

276
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:35,740
Wait, Senpai, you knew Jun was
going to challenge my dad?

277
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:40,460
Yeah, actually, he seemed stressed
about something over winter break,

278
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,000
so I asked what was up, and...

279
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,040
I know I don't have much chance of winning,

280
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,170
but I'm pretty sure this is
a battle I have to fight.

281
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:52,970
So as long as Tomo doesn't abandon me, I...

282
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,060
"I can't give up," he said.

283
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,600
Since he's such a sincere guy, I figured he
was fighting 'cause he thought he had to...

284
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,850
I think you should cheer Jun-kun on.

285
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:05,060
I'm sure you know better than anyone...

286
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,690
what would help him the most.

287
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,110
Sorry, Senpai!

288
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,330
I gotta leave early today!

289
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,250
Was that...

290
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,920
Yeah, that wind pressure
was definitely Tomo.

291
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,140
Looks like she's over it. That's great.

292
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,680
You're right. She must have had an epiphany.

293
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,860
Why don't you just give up already?

294
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,440
You can't defeat me as you are now.

295
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,990
Not... Not yet!

296
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,290
Hey, you okay? You're really wrecked.

297
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,210
This is nothi—

298
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:06,710
Wait, Tomo?!

299
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,420
Wh-Why are you here?!

300
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,960
Well, I was thinking about it.

301
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,050
You wanna go out with me, right?

302
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:13,670
Huh?

303
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,760
I wanna go out with you, too!

304
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,010
And the only one in the way of that...

305
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,970
is my old man!

306
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,600
So it's fine if I defeat you instead, right?

307
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,190
What kind of logic is that?!

308
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,480
This is between me and your dad!

309
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,480
I know, I know!

310
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,280
I'm not trying to show up in the
middle of your fight and butt in.

311
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:36,660
But if you go down and can't get
back up, then it's my turn.

312
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,990
And I'll beat him, so you can lose
without worrying about anything.

313
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,870
Those eyes... She's serious.

314
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,420
Oh, really?

315
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,330
Well, now you've done it.

316
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,880
That's a hell of a lot of pressure!

317
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,470
Yo, Jun. I was watching for
a bit, and I think Dad...

318
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,340
Yeah, I know.

319
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,600
I'd like one more round, please.

320
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,060
Hmph. You never learn.

321
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:07,440
Something's different about him today.

322
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:10,610
He's taking some wide swings
that leave him open.

323
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,070
If he's doing that on purpose,
then what he's testing is...

324
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,160
There it is! A wide right!

325
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,990
As often as he's doing it,
it's gotta be intentional.

326
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,290
And if there's an opening,
I just have to take it!

327
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,290
It's as simple as that...

328
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,250
to say, at least!

329
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,750
Kashima Daimyojin

330
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,420
I can't beat him with hit-and-away
strikes that have no momentum.

331
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,260
I have to step right into his reach,
without thinking about consequences,

332
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,730
and deal a counter that uses
his own strength against him.

333
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:46,310
That's probably what it's
gonna take to beat him.

334
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,230
That's a real challenge for me.

335
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:54,400
But it's a hurdle Tomo
could overcome easily.

336
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
That's probably the point of this test.

337
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:01,320
Every day, somewhere in this world,
someone is unfairly getting hurt.

338
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,200
What if that happened
to someone close to me?

339
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,750
Tomo would act faster than anyone.

340
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,920
If I hesitate for a second,
she'll be beyond my reach,

341
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,840
and I'll end up leaving her alone.

342
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,670
I get it, old man.

343
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,680
That's why you're so worried
about her, isn't it?

344
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:25,420
I'm sorry the man next to
her is someone like me.

345
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,480
Here I come!

346
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,520
Come.

347
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,860
I'm not like Tomo.

348
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:37,400
I can't put my life on the
line for a total stranger.

349
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,780
The only one I could hope to do that for...

350
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,240
is the girl I love!

351
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,290
Go, Jun!

352
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,810
Jun... wo—

353
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,060
Not enough!

354
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,560
What?!

355
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,770
Oh, enough already!

356
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,570
Huh?

357
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,740
It's true.

358
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:26,780
For just a moment, my fingers
did touch the floor.

359
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:30,370
You win, Junichiro.

360
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,500
I... I actually beat—

361
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,130
Yes!

362
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,590
You won! You beat him!

363
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,130
C'mon, Tomo, that hurts!

364
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,340
Well done.

365
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:46,220
You actually did it!

366
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,210
I give! I give!

367
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,350
So you beat Dad, right?

368
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:54,810
Yeah.

369
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:58,520
Which means... it's okay now, right?

370
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,690
Y'know, to go out with m—

371
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:01,940
Wait!

372
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,910
I love you, Tomo! Please go out with me!

373
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:06,740
Huh?

374
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,370
What?!

375
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:12,450
I was about to say that!
Why'd you interrupt?!

376
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:13,790
Why'd you have to say it?!

377
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:16,040
It's the guy's job to say that, isn't it?

378
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,960
There's no law saying it has to be!

379
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,090
If you're gonna do that, then I'm gonna...

380
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:34,060
Wh-What did you just...

381
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,660
You were amazing.

382
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,760
Huh?

383
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:41,240
When you beat my dad, you looked amazing.

384
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,170
Watching you made my heart race.

385
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,870
But...

386
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,540
You'd better be ready!

387
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:53,090
From now on, I'm gonna be making
your heart race a lot more!

388
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,040
I guess it's on, then.

389
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,150
Yeah!

390
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,930
You'll never beat me!

391
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,560
(This suspicious behavior is...)

392
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,850
Hey, you know, I'm all mixed up

393
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:23,320
It's too complicated, I'm freaking out

394
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,860
I want to look cute to you

395
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:29,200
(crazy, crazy, drive me crazy, and that's…)

396
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,490
So I'm plotting, bargaining,
sly, and stubborn

397
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,990
Dizzying love

398
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,580
Just tell him to look at you

399
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:43,550
And watch him stiffen up even more,
because you're both so awkward

400
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:47,420
What? Even if we're alike in that way

401
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:52,010
It doesn't make me happy, 'cause it
means our love is going nowhere

402
00:22:52,010 --> 00:23:00,900
Cloudy heart, swirling emotions—
I sense rain coming

403
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:09,990
So I partly open my umbrella,
then sneakily scoot closer to you

404
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:13,950
Please notice the curl of my
eyelashes as I keep blinking

405
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:18,870
And don't say I'm acting weird

406
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:20,950
One year ago, in spring, I confessed my love.

407
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:22,840
All this plotting and bargaining
is my sly plan to look cute to you

408
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:26,380
Without the support of everyone around me,
this love wouldn't have come to be.

409
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,880
Try to solve the riddle of
this soft, dizzying love

410
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:30,010
(Buzzing, fidgeting)

411
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:32,090
I, Aizawa Tomo, am now...

412
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:34,810
Listen, I might be a bit
tangled in my own web now

413
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:37,250
the happiest I could possibly be!

414
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:38,850
But once you unravel the mystery,
you'll see pure lo-love
