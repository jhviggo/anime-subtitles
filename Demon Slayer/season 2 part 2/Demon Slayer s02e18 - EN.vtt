Kamado!

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:56.264
--Kamado! Get up! It's not over yet!

00:00:56.264 --> 00:00:58.183
--What?
--Kamado! Get up! It's not over yet!

00:00:58.183 --> 00:01:00.059
He's saying something.

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.188
His head...

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:05.899
Did I fail to cut it off after all?

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.526
--Run! This isn't over yet!
--Uzui is...

00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:11.404
...saying something.

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:14.824
Run!

NO MATTER HOW MANY LIVES"

00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:07.168
Nezuko...

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:27.897
So awful.

00:02:27.897 --> 00:02:29.732
The whole place is wrecked.

00:02:32.735 --> 00:02:35.405
You were the one who saved me, Nezuko?

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:36.781
Thanks!

00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:39.576
Wait!

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:41.035
What about the others?

00:02:44.455 --> 00:02:46.082
I can't...

00:02:46.082 --> 00:02:47.625
...move my body!

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.130
No. Why am I able to move at all?

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.048
Why am I alive?

00:02:54.048 --> 00:02:55.842
After being poisoned!

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:59.888
Tanjiro!

00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:00.722
That sounds like Zenitsu!

00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:03.683
Tanjiro!

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:06.352
Help me!

00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:12.775
Tanjiro!

00:03:12.775 --> 00:03:15.653
I woke up, and my body hurts all over!

00:03:15.653 --> 00:03:17.739
Both my legs! Are they broken?

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.409
What's going on?
Who did this to me, huh?

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.871
It really hurts!
I'm too scared to look!

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:26.497
You're okay, then? Thank goodness!

00:03:26.497 --> 00:03:28.625
I am anything but okay!

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:33.296
Not that I don't deserve pity, too,
but Inosuke's in bad shape!

00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:37.300
The sound of his heartbeat
is getting fainter and fainter!

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.344
Inosuke! Where is he?

00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:42.764
Over there! He's over there!

00:03:47.101 --> 00:03:48.895
Inosuke!

00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:51.814
Inosuke! Inosuke, stay with me!

00:03:51.814 --> 00:03:53.107
Inosuke!

00:03:57.528 --> 00:04:00.740
I can hear his heart growing weaker!

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.867
I have to neutralize the poison!

00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:05.536
I know! What about sunlight?

00:04:06.537 --> 00:04:08.790
Daybreak's still a ways off.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.917
What should I do? What should I do?

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:14.587
Send a crow to Lady Shinobu?
No, there's not enough time!

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:17.924
If I don't do something right now,
Inosuke's going to die!

00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:21.469
Why was my life spared?

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:23.304
Why was I the only one?

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:33.398
His skin, inflamed by the poison...

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:35.024
It's starting to heal!

00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:41.906
I'm starving! Gimme something to eat!

00:04:41.906 --> 00:04:43.866
Inosuke!

00:04:45.284 --> 00:04:47.578
--Thank goodness! Thank goodness!

00:04:47.578 --> 00:04:50.957
--Knock it off! You're creeping me out!
--Thank goodness! Thank goodness!

00:04:53.584 --> 00:04:56.295
Nooooo!

00:04:56.295 --> 00:05:01.551
Please don't die!
Please don't die on us, Lord Tengen!

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:04.012
Not after you managed to survive!

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:08.558
Not after you won!
I can't take it! I can't take it!

00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:11.310
How are we supposed
to deal with demon poison?

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.022
The antidote's not working!

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:15.857
The gods are so cruel!

00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:18.276
So cruel!

00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:25.450
I have some last words to leave you.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.827
My life until now--

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:32.540
If you let Lord Tengen die,
I'm never going to pray to you again!

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.710
No way will I ever forgive you,
you hear me?

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.503
Come on, shut the hell up!

00:05:37.503 --> 00:05:40.423
Can't you hear Lord Tengen talking?

00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:43.092
I'm so going to stuff your mouth
with rocks, you moron!

00:05:43.092 --> 00:05:45.344
Both of you, quiet down!

00:05:47.221 --> 00:05:50.266
Makio's tormenting me!

00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:52.185
--Shut up, dumbass!
--You're kidding me, right?

00:05:53.144 --> 00:05:53.811
--Am I going to die
without getting to say my last words?

00:05:53.811 --> 00:05:55.938
--You really put them in my mouth!
--Am I going to die
without getting to say my last words?

00:05:55.938 --> 00:05:57.190
Listen, cut it out, I said!

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.817
The poison's making my tongue stiff.

00:05:59.817 --> 00:06:00.777
Cut it out!

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:02.195
What am I supposed to do?

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:03.279
Don't spit them out!

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:06.240
I still could've left
those last words, but...

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.826
Seriously?

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.163
What?

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.879
Hey!

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:22.799
What do you think you're doing?
Who are you, anyway?

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:25.635
It's way too soon
to be cremating him!

00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:28.846
How can you burn him already
when he's not even dead yet?

00:06:28.846 --> 00:06:32.016
I'm going to spank you!
I'm very angry with you, young lady!

00:06:32.016 --> 00:06:33.434
Hold up a second!

00:06:33.434 --> 00:06:34.602
Huh?

00:06:34.602 --> 00:06:36.979
How do you explain this?

00:06:38.606 --> 00:06:40.858
The poison's left my body!

00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:45.196
Lord Tengen!

00:06:48.032 --> 00:06:51.202
I'm so relieved! Truly!

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:58.084
You three...

00:06:58.084 --> 00:07:00.044
Sorry to make you worry.

00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:06.092
I think that Nezuko's Blood Demon Art
ignited the poison, burning it away.

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:08.678
Not that I'm really sure how it works.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:13.432
But please stay still,
or your wounds won't heal.

00:07:13.432 --> 00:07:15.601
I'm so glad that you survived.

00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:17.895
How can this even be possible?

00:07:17.895 --> 00:07:20.022
--It's all so confusing.
--Thank you!

00:07:20.022 --> 00:07:22.525
Hey, you better not move either,
or you'll die!

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:23.901
Thank you!

00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:26.445
I'm going to go search
for the demons' heads.

00:07:26.445 --> 00:07:29.782
I can't rest easy until I find them.

00:07:35.329 --> 00:07:39.000
Nezuko! That way!
I can smell demon blood!

00:07:43.212 --> 00:07:45.882
Is that a pool of blood?

00:07:45.882 --> 00:07:47.216
Demon blood?

00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:56.726
All right! It won't be attacking anymore.

00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:05.776
I was able to collect
the blood of an Upper Rank demon!

00:08:10.489 --> 00:08:12.283
Take this to Miss Tamayo.

00:08:17.038 --> 00:08:18.414
I'm counting on you!

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:26.964
There's no one in sight.

00:08:26.964 --> 00:08:30.218
So Makio and the others
managed to evacuate everyone.

00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:31.636
That's a relief!

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:36.766
Nezuko! This way!

00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:38.392
I want you to head this way!

00:08:39.435 --> 00:08:41.979
The demon scent is getting stronger.

00:08:43.522 --> 00:08:47.235
Who the hell gets beheaded
by those two bottom-feeders?

00:08:47.235 --> 00:08:49.487
So you were watching after all!

00:08:49.487 --> 00:08:51.739
Why didn't you save me, then?

00:08:52.657 --> 00:08:55.159
I was battling a Hashira, you know!

00:08:55.159 --> 00:08:59.038
So what if you were?
Why didn't you finish him off?

00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:01.165
You could've just
split his head into two!

00:09:01.165 --> 00:09:02.500
I was about to do that!

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.334
Huh?

00:09:03.334 --> 00:09:06.003
But that kid with the earrings
was still alive,

00:09:06.003 --> 00:09:08.714
so I was going to kill him off first!

00:09:08.714 --> 00:09:11.717
Since you didn't do
a damn thing yourself,

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:14.220
you could've at least
finished off the Hashira!

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.932
"UPPER SIX"
Then you should've controlled me
so that I could do that!

00:09:17.932 --> 00:09:21.477
"UPPER SIX"
But you did nothing!
You let your guard down!

00:09:21.477 --> 00:09:22.478
You shut up!

00:09:22.478 --> 00:09:23.521
They're still alive.

00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:24.313
--Look, if you're going to
call yourself an Upper Rank,

00:09:24.313 --> 00:09:26.565
--Not only that, but they're arguing!
--Look, if you're going to
call yourself an Upper Rank,

00:09:26.565 --> 00:09:27.024
--then you should at least
be able to take down

00:09:27.024 --> 00:09:28.401
--But it looks like their bodies
are starting to disintegrate.
--then you should at least
be able to take down

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:30.861
--But it looks like their bodies
are starting to disintegrate.
--two wounded low-level
scrubs yourself, idiot!

00:09:30.861 --> 00:09:32.113
Hey, you're the idiot!

00:09:32.113 --> 00:09:33.531
What did you say?

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:43.249
No one as ugly as you...

00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:45.710
...could possibly be my brother!

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.089
I bet you and I...

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:52.508
...aren't even related by blood!

00:09:52.508 --> 00:09:54.969
Since we look nothing alike!

00:09:54.969 --> 00:09:56.804
You're so useless!

00:09:56.804 --> 00:09:59.390
Your one saving grace is your strength!

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.434
Nothing else!

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:04.979
You have no value at all if you lose!

00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:07.440
You worthless, ugly freak!

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:12.903
"UPPER SIX"

00:10:12.903 --> 00:10:14.739
Don't give me that crap!

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:17.366
If you were on your own,
you'd be long dead by now!

00:10:17.366 --> 00:10:19.785
How many times have I saved you?

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.748
You're the worthless one, and you know it!

00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:26.917
You're weak,
and you have no value whatsoever!

00:10:26.917 --> 00:10:32.006
I wish I hadn't protected
someone like you all this time!

00:10:33.007 --> 00:10:37.470
If it hadn't been for you,
my life would've been different!

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:40.765
Right, if it hadn't been for you!

00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:45.144
Why do I always have to
clean up your messes?

00:10:45.144 --> 00:10:47.855
You just never should've been born--

00:10:50.816 --> 00:10:52.234
That's a lie.

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:55.780
You don't really feel that way at all.

00:10:56.781 --> 00:10:58.532
You don't mean any of that.

00:11:00.117 --> 00:11:02.078
Try to get along.

00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:05.122
In this whole world, you two siblings
have no one but each other.

00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:10.127
There's no one who'll forgive you
for what you did.

00:11:10.127 --> 00:11:14.965
You'll be resented, despised
and denounced by all those you've killed.

00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:19.220
Nobody will ever be on your side.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.472
So if nothing else, you two...

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:25.184
...shouldn't be cursing each other
out like this!

00:11:36.487 --> 00:11:39.240
Why don't you shut up?

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.243
Don't you dare lecture us!

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:44.120
You stupid brat!

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.997
Get out of here! Just get lost!

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:53.838
I'm so pissed!

00:11:53.838 --> 00:11:57.258
Fix this somehow, Brother!

00:11:57.258 --> 00:12:00.886
I don't want to die, Brother!

00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:02.888
Brother!

00:12:02.888 --> 00:12:04.056
Bro--

00:12:06.267 --> 00:12:07.435
Ume!

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:11.772
That's right.

00:12:11.772 --> 00:12:15.234
My little sister's name was Ume.

00:12:15.234 --> 00:12:17.278
Not Daki.

00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:19.738
What a god-awful name.

00:12:26.745 --> 00:12:28.122
No.

00:12:28.122 --> 00:12:31.041
Ume was pretty bad, too.

00:12:31.041 --> 00:12:37.214
Since you were named after
the disease that killed our mother.

00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:41.135
The Rashomon Riverbank.

00:12:41.135 --> 00:12:45.097
We were born into the lowest class
of the Entertainment District.

00:12:45.097 --> 00:12:48.184
Children were seen as
extra mouths to feed,

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:50.769
so we were cursed for just living.

00:12:50.769 --> 00:12:55.191
My mother nearly killed me more than once
before I was even born.

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:57.693
And she also tried to kill me
numerous times after I was born,

00:12:57.693 --> 00:13:00.905
since I was nothing but a burden.

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:04.366
And yet, I still survived.

00:13:04.366 --> 00:13:10.039
My body was weak like a withered leaf,
but I clung to life as hard as I could.

00:13:11.081 --> 00:13:13.709
Worm! Dimwit!

00:13:13.709 --> 00:13:17.796
Sad sack! Coward! Good-for-nothing!

00:13:17.796 --> 00:13:20.883
I was mocked
for my ugly voice and appearance,

00:13:20.883 --> 00:13:24.011
and rocks were thrown at me
for being filthy.

00:13:25.554 --> 00:13:32.228
It was as if all of the abuse and insults
in the world were created just for me.

00:13:33.687 --> 00:13:37.233
Not only was I ugly,
but I was filthy, too.

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:40.444
Always covered in grime
and dandruff from head to toe.

00:13:40.444 --> 00:13:43.447
Giving off the stench of fleas.

00:13:44.448 --> 00:13:48.369
I was especially despised
in the Entertainment District,

00:13:48.369 --> 00:13:51.580
where beauty was
the measure of your value.

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.416
As if I were a monster.

00:13:54.416 --> 00:13:58.295
When I got hungry, I ate mice and insects.

00:13:59.588 --> 00:14:03.634
My only toy was a scythe
that a customer had left behind.

00:14:05.761 --> 00:14:09.390
Things started to change for me...

00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:13.060
...after Ume was born.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.856
Ume...

00:14:18.816 --> 00:14:22.570
You were my pride and joy.

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:28.701
Even at a tender age, grown-ups would
reel at the sight of your beautiful face.

00:14:31.745 --> 00:14:34.665
I discovered that I was good at fighting

00:14:34.665 --> 00:14:37.668
and started working as a debt collector.

00:14:37.668 --> 00:14:41.797
I revolted everyone,
and they all feared me.

00:14:41.797 --> 00:14:44.466
That made me feel so good.

00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:50.097
My ugliness became a source of pride...

00:14:51.098 --> 00:14:58.105
...and having a gorgeous sister like you
dispelled my sense of inferiority.

00:15:00.649 --> 00:15:03.277
I had the feeling...

00:15:03.277 --> 00:15:07.448
...that we were on
the fast track to a better life.

00:15:12.911 --> 00:15:15.956
Until you turned thirteen, Ume.

00:15:25.299 --> 00:15:26.717
Because you stabbed a customer,

00:15:26.717 --> 00:15:31.138
a samurai's eye with a hairpin,
blinding him,

00:15:31.138 --> 00:15:36.644
you were bound hand and foot
out of retaliation and then burned alive.

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:40.606
I wasn't there.

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:45.611
I got home from work
to find you burnt to a crisp.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.707
Stop! Stop! Stop!

00:15:58.707 --> 00:16:01.126
Don't collect from me!

00:16:01.126 --> 00:16:05.547
You're collecting from me
after never giving me a damn thing?

00:16:05.547 --> 00:16:09.093
I'll never forgive you!

00:16:09.093 --> 00:16:11.929
Turn my sister back the way she was!

00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:13.597
Or else...

00:16:13.597 --> 00:16:18.185
I'll kill the gods, Buddha,
every one of you!

00:16:25.442 --> 00:16:27.695
You're sure he's the one?

00:16:27.695 --> 00:16:30.114
Yes! That's him all right!

00:16:30.114 --> 00:16:34.243
I appreciate this! I'm so glad
to be rid of that troublemaker!

00:16:34.243 --> 00:16:36.578
He was such a savage!

00:16:36.578 --> 00:16:38.622
Severely injuring the people
he was collecting from!

00:16:38.622 --> 00:16:42.292
And lately, he's really been
out of control!

00:16:42.292 --> 00:16:44.962
It's a shame that we lost Ume,

00:16:44.962 --> 00:16:48.215
but when I find another pretty girl,
I'll send her your way.

00:16:48.215 --> 00:16:50.759
So, um, about the money...

00:16:50.759 --> 00:16:52.177
Hold on.

00:16:52.177 --> 00:16:54.263
After I finish him off.

00:17:05.315 --> 00:17:06.984
Hey you...

00:17:06.984 --> 00:17:10.028
That's a fine kimono
you're wearing, huh?

00:17:11.822 --> 00:17:15.659
You're clean,
and you have a good complexion.

00:17:15.659 --> 00:17:22.332
I bet you always have plenty to eat,
and you sleep in a nice, clean bed.

00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:27.504
I bet that's all you've ever known.

00:17:27.504 --> 00:17:31.383
Living in a house that shelters you
from the rain and wind.

00:17:32.134 --> 00:17:34.928
Lucky you.

00:17:34.928 --> 00:17:38.390
Lucky you!

00:17:40.809 --> 00:17:45.314
A guy who has it so good
doesn't get to make such a racket.

00:17:45.314 --> 00:17:48.859
Sniveling and moaning...

00:17:54.948 --> 00:17:57.743
...over one measly eyeball.

00:18:05.042 --> 00:18:07.586
No one would help us.

00:18:07.586 --> 00:18:09.546
No surprises there.

00:18:10.464 --> 00:18:14.176
That was just the story of our lives.

00:18:14.176 --> 00:18:18.138
No one ever offered us a helping hand.

00:18:22.184 --> 00:18:25.062
It started snowing.

00:18:25.062 --> 00:18:31.026
We were never shown the slightest mercy,
no matter what the situation.

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:35.948
Why was that?

00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:39.701
What happened to
"fortune and misfortune are intertwined"?

00:18:39.701 --> 00:18:44.248
Both fortune and misfortune
should come by turns!

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:49.211
Hey, what's the matter?

00:18:49.211 --> 00:18:51.171
You poor things.

00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:56.760
I happen to be kindhearted,
so I can't look the other way.

00:18:57.803 --> 00:18:58.971
That girl is probably going to die
any minute now.

00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:02.140
"UPPER SIX"
That girl is probably going to die
any minute now.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.433
"UPPER SIX"

00:19:03.433 --> 00:19:07.646
"UPPER SIX"
I'll give you some blood!
Both of you!

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:12.693
If he chooses you,
you can become demons.

00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:19.908
Life is a sacred thing.

00:19:19.908 --> 00:19:22.327
You should treasure it.

00:19:23.787 --> 00:19:25.455
Now then...

00:19:25.455 --> 00:19:28.375
...can you become demons...

00:19:28.375 --> 00:19:31.295
...a Twelve Kizuki like me...

00:19:31.295 --> 00:19:32.087
"UPPER SIX"
...a Twelve Kizuki like me...

00:19:32.087 --> 00:19:35.591
"UPPER SIX"
...and rise up to
the Upper Ranks, I wonder.

00:19:35.591 --> 00:19:36.592
"UPPER SIX"

00:19:38.051 --> 00:19:41.680
I don't regret becoming a demon.

00:19:43.515 --> 00:19:48.145
No matter how many times I'm reborn,
I'm going to be a demon every time.

00:19:48.145 --> 00:19:51.398
I'll never show mercy to anyone
who has a better life.

00:19:51.398 --> 00:19:55.235
I'll always be the Gyutaro
who seizes and collects!

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.864
But...

00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:02.910
...if I did have one regret,
that would be...

00:20:05.412 --> 00:20:07.289
Ume...

00:20:07.289 --> 00:20:11.168
You might've turned out
differently than me.

00:20:14.421 --> 00:20:19.384
If you'd worked at a better House,
you could've become a respectable Oiran.

00:20:21.136 --> 00:20:26.558
If you'd been born to normal parents,
you could've been a normal girl.

00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:31.271
If you'd been born into a good family,

00:20:31.271 --> 00:20:34.942
maybe you would've become
a well-bred young lady.

00:20:37.486 --> 00:20:41.782
Since you have
such an impressionable, pliant nature.

00:20:41.782 --> 00:20:45.953
Maybe you only turned out this way
because I was the one who raised you.

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:49.331
"Take before someone takes from you."

00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:52.250
I taught you to collect from others,

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:55.504
and that's why you stabbed
that samurai in the eye.

00:20:56.338 --> 00:20:59.049
But if you'd done as he said,

00:20:59.049 --> 00:21:03.053
you might've followed a different path.

00:21:10.143 --> 00:21:13.313
My only regret...

00:21:14.606 --> 00:21:17.067
I guess it was you.

00:21:26.118 --> 00:21:28.245
What is this place?

00:21:28.245 --> 00:21:30.622
Is this Hell?

00:21:30.622 --> 00:21:32.374
Brother!

00:21:33.375 --> 00:21:36.003
It's awful here!
I don't like this place!

00:21:36.003 --> 00:21:37.546
Where are we?

00:21:37.546 --> 00:21:40.424
I want to leave! Do something!

00:21:41.341 --> 00:21:43.301
You...

00:21:43.301 --> 00:21:45.721
Look at you.

00:21:50.308 --> 00:21:52.185
Is the exit that way?

00:21:53.812 --> 00:21:55.939
Listen.

00:21:55.939 --> 00:21:59.067
Don't follow me anymore.

00:21:59.067 --> 00:22:01.278
B-But why?

00:22:01.278 --> 00:22:02.571
Wait, I--

00:22:02.571 --> 00:22:04.489
I said don't follow me!

00:22:06.658 --> 00:22:11.329
Are you mad about what I said?
I'll apologize! So forgive me!

00:22:11.329 --> 00:22:14.166
I don't think you're ugly, Brother!

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:17.377
I was just bitter!
I was bitter because we'd lost!

00:22:17.377 --> 00:22:21.798
I didn't want to admit
that we'd lost because of me!

00:22:23.341 --> 00:22:26.428
I'm sorry! For not fighting better!

00:22:26.428 --> 00:22:29.723
If only I could've been more useful,
then we wouldn't have lost!

00:22:29.723 --> 00:22:32.851
I'm sorry I'm always dragging you down!

00:22:33.643 --> 00:22:35.896
Listen, Brother!

00:22:39.441 --> 00:22:43.779
You're not my sister anymore.
You're nothing to me.

00:22:46.698 --> 00:22:49.242
I'm heading this way,

00:22:49.242 --> 00:22:52.120
so you go in the opposite direction,

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.289
toward the light.

00:22:58.752 --> 00:23:00.212
Hey!

00:23:00.212 --> 00:23:03.048
No!

00:23:03.048 --> 00:23:07.219
I'm not leaving you!
I'm never going to leave you, okay?

00:23:07.219 --> 00:23:09.387
We're always going to be together!

00:23:09.387 --> 00:23:13.767
No matter how many times I'm reborn,
I'm always going to be your little sister!

00:23:13.767 --> 00:23:16.311
No matter what!

00:23:16.311 --> 00:23:18.313
Please don't hate me!

00:23:18.313 --> 00:23:19.815
Don't scold me!

00:23:19.815 --> 00:23:22.192
Don't leave me all by myself!

00:23:22.192 --> 00:23:25.195
I'll never forgive you
if you leave me behind!

00:23:31.868 --> 00:23:35.497
Because we're always going to be together!

00:23:36.414 --> 00:23:38.875
How could you? How could you?

00:23:38.875 --> 00:23:41.545
Don't you remember
that promise we made?

00:23:45.924 --> 00:23:48.135
Have you forgotten?

00:23:52.472 --> 00:23:55.725
The two of us together can't be beat!

00:23:55.725 --> 00:24:00.188
Being cold or hungry
doesn't bother us at all!

00:24:00.188 --> 00:24:03.733
I promise you!
We're always going to be together!

00:24:03.733 --> 00:24:06.695
I'm never going to leave you!

00:24:06.695 --> 00:24:08.071
See?

00:24:08.071 --> 00:24:10.740
You're not afraid
of anything now, are you?

00:24:59.748 --> 00:25:03.460
I wonder if they made up.

00:25:12.594 --> 00:25:15.013
It's over, huh?

00:25:15.013 --> 00:25:16.890
I'm exhausted.

00:25:20.894 --> 00:25:22.562
I see.

00:25:24.189 --> 00:25:25.857
Six, huh?

00:25:26.691 --> 00:25:30.403
That would be the lowest
of the Upper Ranks.

00:25:30.403 --> 00:25:34.032
Well, Six or not,
you still defeated an Upper Rank,

00:25:34.032 --> 00:25:37.160
so yes, congratulations are in order.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.204
Right, Six or not.

00:25:40.288 --> 00:25:42.916
I don't mind offering you my praise.

00:25:42.916 --> 00:25:45.835
Well, not that your praise
will do anything for me.

00:25:45.835 --> 00:25:47.170
That's right!

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:48.964
You sure took your time getting here!

00:25:48.964 --> 00:25:51.675
Y-Y-You took too long to get here!

00:25:51.675 --> 00:25:53.051
Way too long!

00:25:55.095 --> 00:25:56.304
Scary!

00:25:56.304 --> 00:26:00.433
What are you going to do now that
you've lost your left hand and left eye?

00:26:00.433 --> 00:26:06.022
How long will it take you to return to
duty after battling this lowly Upper Six?

00:26:06.022 --> 00:26:09.943
Who's going to fill in for you until then?

00:26:09.943 --> 00:26:11.945
I'm retiring.

00:26:11.945 --> 00:26:14.781
There's just no way I can still fight.

00:26:14.781 --> 00:26:17.951
I'm sure the Master will accept that.

00:26:17.951 --> 00:26:21.621
Don't be ridiculous.
I refuse to accept it.

00:26:21.621 --> 00:26:23.498
As it is, too many of the youngsters are

00:26:23.498 --> 00:26:25.250
dying on us before
reaching their potential.

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:29.337
There's still a vacant Hashira spot
now that Rengoku's gone.

00:26:29.337 --> 00:26:32.966
Even someone as uninspiring as you
would be better than nothing at all.

00:26:32.966 --> 00:26:35.218
Battle on until you die.

00:26:35.218 --> 00:26:39.347
Nope, there is a youngster who's
about to reach his potential for sure.

00:26:40.724 --> 00:26:44.019
That young guy you hate.

00:26:46.521 --> 00:26:47.939
Hey...

00:26:47.939 --> 00:26:49.899
No way.

00:26:49.899 --> 00:26:52.319
Then, he survived?

00:26:52.319 --> 00:26:54.321
This battle?

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.907
That Tanjiro Kamado?

00:27:04.831 --> 00:27:06.541
Is that right?

00:27:06.541 --> 00:27:09.336
They defeated it? An Upper Rank?

00:27:09.336 --> 00:27:16.509
Good job, Tengen,
Tanjiro, Nezuko, Zenitsu, Inosuke!

00:27:19.304 --> 00:27:20.638
Master Kagaya...

00:27:21.598 --> 00:27:23.308
For a hundred years...

00:27:23.308 --> 00:27:26.895
For a hundred years,
nothing had changed!

00:27:26.895 --> 00:27:29.356
But now it has!

00:27:29.356 --> 00:27:30.648
Amane...

00:27:30.648 --> 00:27:31.483
Yes?

00:27:35.612 --> 00:27:37.030
Do you see?

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:38.948
This is an omen!

00:27:39.991 --> 00:27:43.203
Fate is about to take a dramatic turn!

00:27:43.203 --> 00:27:45.830
The consequences will be widespread!

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:49.584
Sweeping up everything around them,
shaking them to their core!

00:27:49.584 --> 00:27:53.463
And eventually, they will reach that man.

00:27:54.506 --> 00:27:56.841
Muzan Kibutsuji!

00:27:56.841 --> 00:28:03.014
We will defeat you without fail
during our generation!

00:28:03.014 --> 00:28:07.143
You, the sole blemish on my family!

00:28:09.813 --> 00:28:12.065
Children, go boil some water!

00:28:12.065 --> 00:28:14.609
And fetch his medicine and some towels!

00:28:14.609 --> 00:28:15.485
Hurry!

00:28:15.485 --> 00:28:16.611
Father!

00:28:16.611 --> 00:28:18.738
--Father!
--Father!

00:28:20.031 --> 00:28:23.410
"UPPER"

00:28:31.084 --> 00:28:32.710
The alternate dimension.

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:34.337
The Infinity Castle.

00:28:35.755 --> 00:28:38.800
The fact that I was summoned here means...

00:28:40.635 --> 00:28:41.010
"UPPER THREE"

00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:44.055
"UPPER THREE"
...that an Upper Rank was killed
by the Demon Slayers!

00:28:51.438 --> 00:28:54.691
Oh, damn! This hurts like hell!

00:28:54.691 --> 00:28:59.571
But thank goodness, Lord Tengen!

00:29:00.947 --> 00:29:02.866
Really.

00:29:02.866 --> 00:29:04.617
Thank goodness you're alive.

00:29:05.618 --> 00:29:09.539
So, it'll be all four of us
returning intact, right?

00:29:10.498 --> 00:29:14.002
Yeah. Let's go home to a hero's welcome.

00:29:14.002 --> 00:29:15.628
And be flashy about it!

00:29:19.215 --> 00:29:22.093
Thank goodness!

00:29:22.093 --> 00:29:24.721
--Yeah! Yeah!
--We're alive!

00:29:30.894 --> 00:29:32.854
You guys...

00:29:32.854 --> 00:29:35.273
I'm so glad you're alive!

00:32:22.649 --> 00:32:25.985
