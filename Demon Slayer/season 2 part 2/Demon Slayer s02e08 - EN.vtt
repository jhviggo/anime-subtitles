Each day is so blissful.
I couldn't be happier.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.190
He's such a kind little kid.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.400
So considerate toward the help.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.030
I've never seen a child his age
who was so gentle-mannered.

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:12.780
Blood has nothing to do
with parental affection.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.620
I'm going to have that boy
take over my business for me!

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:22.830
I really envy you! I wish I could
trade our idiot son for him!

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.380
He's a fine boy. No doubt about it.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.630
It's just that...

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:34.970
As he suffers from a skin disease,
he can't go outside during the day.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.470
Oh dear, the poor thing.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:43.310
I'm hoping that we can develop
a wonder drug for him at my company.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:45.360
The sooner the better.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.740
I am here to report to you...

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:58.830
Master Muzan.

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:06.250
Have you found what I asked for?

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:10.170
I looked into it but came up empty.

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.510
Having no way
to even confirm its existence...

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:17.260
I was unable to locate
the Blue Spider Lily.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:20.470
And?

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:27.020
I will continue to do my utmost
to live up to your expectations, Master Muzan.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:33.280
As ordered, I did eliminate one Hashira,
so you may rest assured.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:41.950
You seem to have
the wrong idea about this...

00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:43.410
Akaza.

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:53.010
So what if you disposed of one Hashira?
As if that were such a feat.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:57.550
A demon beating a human
is a forgone conclusion.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:02.060
What I want is for the Demon Slayer Corps
to be annihilated.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.600
Pummel the life out of every last one of them

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.570
and never let another one
enter my line of sight again.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.070
It's hardly a complicated task.

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:18.820
And yet, I'm still waiting for it to happen.
What do you have to say about that?

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:25.370
You boast of having killed a Hashira,

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:29.040
but there were three
other Demon Slayers there.

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:32.050
Why did you fail to kill them off

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:37.180
after I made a point of sending you there
because you happened to be nearby?

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.180
Akaza...

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.770
Akaza...

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:45.350
Akaza...

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.480
Akaza!

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:52.610
You have disappointed me.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:57.660
To think that you suffered a blow
by a swordsman who isn't even a Hashira...

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:01.620
How far you've fallen, Upper Three.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.210
Dismissed.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.050
I just heard a loud noise.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.050
Are you okay?

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.070
<i>You coward!</i>

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.370
<i>You coward!</i>

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.960
I know what you look like, boy!

00:10:54.960 --> 00:11:00.050

your brain matter everywhere!

<i>Even someone who sounded
as well-trained as Rengoku ended up dead.</i>

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:06.030
<i>That would make anyone sad
and fall right apart.</i>

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.700
<i>Look at Inosuke. Even he was bawling.</i>

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.170
<i>I guess he was beyond frustrated.</i>

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:18.960

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:27.050
<i>they beat their wounded souls again and again
and get back on their feet.</i>

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.520
<i>I'm sure that Rengoku
was that kind of person, too.</i>

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:33.310
<i>That's the kind of sound he gave off.</i>

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:37.860
<i>Not that it wasn't a little odd,
but his sound was strong and kind.</i>

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:43.240
Tanjiro, I secretly snagged us
some bean paste buns, so let's eat!

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.320
Oh no! Tanjiro's missing!

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.030
Oh! Zenitsu!

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:50.830
I'm so sorry!

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.790
No, I'm totally fine.

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:56.000
What's wrong?

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.090
Your focus is totally off!

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:03.590
I really am sorry!
Tanjiro's nowhere to be found, so...

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:07.180
Tanjiro's wounds aren't even healed yet,
but he's been training,

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.760
so Lady Shinobu
has really been on edge, too!

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.850
He was told to rest in bed!

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:16.560
That stomach wound of his
was pretty deep, right?

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:18.480
How dumb is that?

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.410
<i>Rengoku's crow...</i>

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:34.830
<i>Thanks!</i>

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:39.000
<i>He's carrying out Rengoku's will
by guiding me to his house.</i>

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:03.320
Are you Senjuro?

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:16.250
Have you heard of
Kyojuro Rengoku's passing?

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:22.090
I have messages from Kyojuro
for his father and for you, Senjuro.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.340
So I've come to relay them to you.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.720
From my brother?

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.010
I already know
what happened to my brother.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.510
Excuse me!

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:37.390
Are you all right?
Your face is deadly pale!

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.810
Knock it off!

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:44.020
He would've only left
the most worthless of messages, anyway.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.360
No wonder he died!

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.120
Worthless!

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.790
What a fool of a son Kyojuro was!

00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:01.420
A person's talent level is determined
the day he's born.

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.800
Only a mere handful have any talent.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.550
The rest are just members of the masses!

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.220
Completely useless trash, they are!

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.470
Kyojuro was in that group.

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:18.770
He had no real talent.

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:21.560
So why wouldn't he end up dead?

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.770
Senjuro!

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:26.320
The funeral's over now.

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:30.110
It's high time you wiped
that gloomy look off your face!

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:32.950
Hold on!

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.620
That's going way too far!

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:38.330
Please stop talking about him like that!

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.290
Who the hell are you?

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:45.090
Get out! Don't you dare
set foot on our property!

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.340
I'm with...

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:47.670
the Demon Slayer Corps!

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:54.260
You...

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.640
I get it now! You...

00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:01.810
You're a wielder of the Sun Breathing
technique, right? Am I right?

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:04.190
Sun Breathing?

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:05.810
What are you talking about?

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:12.990
<i>So fast!</i>

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:15.200
<i>Those were no amateur moves!</i>

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.540
Father! Please stop!

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:20.830
Just look at his face!
Can't you see that he's not well?

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:22.500
You keep your mouth shut!

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:27.800
That's enough, you monster!

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:37.350
Why are you acting like this, anyway?

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.430
Insulting your own child,
who's lost his life...

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.270
Striking him...

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:44.140
What is it that you want to do?

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:47.270
You...

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:51.150
You're mocking us, aren't you?

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:53.200
What makes you say that?

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.700
I have no idea what you mean!
Now you're just slandering me!

00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:00.700
That's because you're a wielder
of the Sun Breathing technique!

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.830
I know all about those earrings!

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.540
I-It was in the book!

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:09.340
<i>Sun Breathing...</i>

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:11.800
<i>Could he be talking about Hinokami Kagura?</i>

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:14.340
First Breathing.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:17.890
The first breathing technique ever created!

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:20.260
The most powerful of them all!

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:25.140
And all the other techniques
are derived from Sun Breathing!

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:31.280
All the others just mimic Sun Breathing.

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:35.910
They're just cheap imitations,
retrograde versions of Sun Breathing!

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:38.780
Fire, Water, Wind...

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:39.910
All of them!

<i>What does he mean?</i>

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.370
<i>We've been charcoal burners
for generations.</i>

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:47.750
<i>We have the records to prove it.</i>

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.500
<i>Sun Breathing...</i>

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:53.460
<i>Hinokami Kagura...</i>

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:55.380
<i>No.</i>

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:57.930
<i>Never mind that.</i>

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.390
<i>There's something
more important than that!</i>

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:06.770
Don't get cocky just because you're a wielder
of the Sun Breathing technique, boy!

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:13.110
As if I could!

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:17.530
Can't you see how devastated I am
by my own weakness?

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.030
Why, you...

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.120
miserable old fart!

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.740
Look out! My father is...

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.250
Don't you badmouth Rengoku!

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:27.000
Don't you dare!

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:28.540
...a former Hashira!

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:33.880
Please stop... Father!

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.220
<i>But why?</i>

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:40.640
<i>If Hinokami Kagura
is a Sun Breathing technique...</i>

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:47.600
<i>then, that day, why wasn't I
able to save Rengoku?</i>

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.020
<i>Why?</i>

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:54.110
<i>Why?</i>

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:00.700
<i>Why couldn't I?</i>

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:13.210
<i>Now look what I've done.</i>

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.590
Here's some tea.

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:21.140
Please drink it.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.180
Oh, thank you.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:29.440
Sorry. I mean,
for head-butting your father.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.270
Is he okay?

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:34.110
I think he'll be fine.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:38.780
He even went out to buy
some sake once he came to.

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.990
Is that right?

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:43.370
Thank you very much.

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.030
Huh?

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.750
You took a load off my mind.

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:53.580
I could never even talk back
when he badmouthed my brother.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:01.800
What were my brother's last moments like?

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:11.980
I see.

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:15.360
So, my brother was valiant until the end.

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:18.480
Thank you very much.

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:22.030
Oh no, please...

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:26.950
Forgive me for coming up short.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.120
Please don't worry about it.

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:36.920
I'm sure that my brother told you
the same thing, didn't he?

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:47.390
Something in a book
my father often read rang a bell.

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:48.470
RECORD OF THE TWENTY-FIRST FLAME HASHIRA

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:51.430
I believe this must be it.

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.480
Th-Thank you very much!

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:00.730
Is what you'd like to know in those pages?

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:07.410
L-Look at this!

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:11.910
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT ARC

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:16.920
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT ARC

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:18.880
Look at this!

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:26.970
It's ripped to shreds.

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:28.970
It's unreadable for the most part.

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:31.140
Was it like this from the start?

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:34.310
No. That's not possible.

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:38.810
After all, the Flame Hashira Chronicles
are stored very carefully.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:43.110
I believe it was my father
who tore those pages.

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:45.070
I'm so sorry.

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:46.450
No.

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:48.780
It's not your fault, Senjuro.

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.450
Please don't feel bad about it.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.910
But you came all this way for it

00:21:55.250 --> 00:22:01.130
only to end up learning nothing about Hinokami
Kagura or what my father called "Sun Breathing."

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.210
It's all right.

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:06.260
I know what it is that I must do.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.890
I'm going to train harder.

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:12.890
Even when it comes to Hinokami Kagura...

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.890
though I know how to perform the dance...

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:18.940
I still haven't managed to master it.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.780
Is that right?

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:26.820
When I use Hinokami Kagura
while maintaining Total Concentration,

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:30.070
I can't move my body the way I want to.

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:32.700
I'm to blame for that.

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:36.080
I can't physically keep up with it.

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:40.170
My stamina's improved
thanks to Total Concentration, Constant,

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:42.420
but it's still not enough.

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:48.800
I'm supposed to gain stamina by the day
if I can maintain Constant,

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.430
but I can't get stronger in an instant.

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:55.810
That day, if only I'd been more powerful...

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.640
In an instant...

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:02.690
If only there'd been a way for me
to become strong enough to save Rengoku...

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:06.110
I've tried to come up with one.

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:09.360
But there's no such convenient method.

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:11.780
There just weren't any shortcuts.

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:14.790
All I can do is struggle.

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:19.210
To move forward by pulling out all the stops
to do whatever it is that I can.

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:24.210
No matter how grueling
or frustrating it may be.

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:26.050
And then, I...

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:30.220
am going to become
a powerful Hashira like Kyojuro!

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.640
No matter what!

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:45.570
My brother didn't have a Tsuguko.

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:51.740
Normally, I would've become his Tsuguko...

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:56.660
and would've had to train
as a Hashira reserve.

00:23:58.290 --> 00:23:59.620
But...

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:04.920
my Nichirin Sword failed to change color.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:12.840
Nichirin Swords don't change color until
you've acquired a certain level of sword skills...

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:20.390
but no matter how much training
I underwent, it was no good.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.730
I'm going to forget
about becoming a swordsman...

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:34.200
and be useful to others in some other way.

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:38.290
This will break the line
of the Flame Hashira

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:41.210
and inflict damage on its long history...

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.920
but I'm sure that my brother...

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.800
will forgive me.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.600
Walk down the path that you feel is right.

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:00.680
If anyone dares
to badmouth you, Senjuro,

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.480
I'll personally head-butt them!

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:04.850
I don't think that's a good idea.

00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:15.490
I'll restore the Flame Hashira Chronicles myself.
I'll look into other books, as well.

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:21.000
I'll also ask my father, and if I find out
anything, I'll send word through our crow.

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:24.500
I'm glad that I got to talk to you.

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.750
Please get home safely.

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:32.260
No, I'm the one
who should be thanking you.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.840
Wait, Tanjiro.

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:38.890
Please take this.

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:44.770
It's my brother's Nichirin Sword guard.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:49.020
I-I can't accept
something as valuable as this!

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.030
I...

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.780
I want you to take it with you.

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:57.780
I'm sure it will protect you.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.340
Thanks.

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:24.810
Excuse me.

00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:30.230
Are you back?

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.110
Um, our visitor—

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:33.110
Shut up!

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:36.320
I don't give a damn! Get out of here!

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:38.700
B-But my brother's message to you—

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:40.070
Worthless!

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:43.870
It's probably just his gripes toward me.

00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:45.580
I already know what he'd say!

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.210
Now get out of my sight!

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:53.710
Very well.

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:05.350
"Please take care of yourself."

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:11.110
Those are the only words
that my brother left behind for you, Father.

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.490
<i>I'll be heading out now, Father.</i>

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:40.800
Kyojuro...

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:47.890
<i>Do I have a fever?</i>

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:50.900
<i>I can't breathe.</i>

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:00.990
Don't worry, Nezuko.

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.410
The Butterfly Mansion's not far off.

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:15.790
Huh?

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.300
Haganezuka!

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:24.090
You lost your sword?
Are you out of your mind, you fool?

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:30.810
You deserve to die ten thousand times over!

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:35.440
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Please! I'm truly sorry!

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:57.500
He says that he got chased by Haganezuka
until close to daybreak.

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.170
So that's why you're not eating?

00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:01.170
Gimme!

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:10.680
This way!

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:12.310
Sorry!

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:23.950
If Aoi hadn't calmed him down for me,
he would've kept chasing me until noon.

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.200
Would anyone like seconds?

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:30.290
Would you like some?

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:31.790
Gimme!

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:35.210
Aoi, thank you for yesterday.

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.750
You, too, Sumi, Kiyo and Naho.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.460
Don't mention it. It was nothing.

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:47.470
What's Haganezuka up to now?

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:52.890
Haganezuka? Oh, he's sitting
on the veranda, eating rice dumplings.

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:57.230
And it seems like he's finally back
in a good mood!

00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:59.400
Thank goodness!

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:05.200
Rice dumplings
are Haganezuka's favorite food!

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.700
Next time he starts fuming,
you should go buy some.

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:10.700
I want to have some, too!

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:14.620
Fine, I'll go get you some later, all right?

00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:30.390
Help! I'm gonna die!

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:33.140
100 more to go!

00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:43.900
<i>Almost four months had gone by
since Rengoku's death.</i>

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:48.660
<i>Every day, we trained...</i>

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:52.740
<i>while following the crow's orders in between.</i>

00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:59.750
<i>And we each headed out
to take down demons.</i>

00:30:56.660 --> 00:31:01.170
Take care!

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:06.420
<i>Zenitsu no longer threw fits,
even when he had to go on solo missions.</i>

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:10.680
Give me a lock of Nezuko's hair!
I promise I'll do my best!

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:15.180
<i>Inosuke became
even more aggressive than before.</i>

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:18.060
We're gonna run hard
until our bones shatter!

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:19.690
C'mon, you guys!

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:22.730
<i>Not being all alone...</i>

00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:27.190
You're almost there! You can do it!

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:30.240
Nezuko! Nezuko!

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.240
<i>I think it's a blessing.</i>

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:35.200
Nezuko!

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:39.040
North-northwest! North-northwest!

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:43.460
Destroy the demon
lurking in the mountain shrine!

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.720
North-northwest! North-northwest!

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:12.990
Nezuko, are you okay?

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:15.200
You're not getting wet
from the rain, are you?

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:23.080
The demon should be
around here somewhere.

00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:50.360
Let's do this, Nezuko!

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:09.920
<i>Dammit! I messed up!</i>

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:13.220
<i>We're going to end up in the village!</i>

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:36.740
D-Dammit!

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:40.200
What kind of Demon Slayer is that?

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:43.040
Provoking a demon like me...

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:50.800
You're finished.

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.380
Better resign yourself.

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:55.010
I'm really sorry about this.

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:57.890
Don't gimme that...

00:33:58.300 --> 00:33:59.220
you little punk!

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:01.640
<i>Total Concentration...</i>

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:04.310
<i>Water Breathing!</i>

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.100
<i>Fourth Form...</i>

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:13.610
<i>Striking Tide!</i>

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:27.460
That's strange.

00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:31.710
I know I heard something.

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:50.020
I'm exhausted.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:54.400
Nezuko, we'll be reaching
the Butterfly Mansion soon.

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:03.450
Please stop, will you?

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.960
Nooooo!

00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:11.210
Please let us go! I...

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:12.460
This girl is...

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:14.510
I'm begging you!

00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:15.460
Stop yammering. Just shut up!

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:17.720
Please stop!

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:20.510
Please let them go!

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:22.810
K-Kanao!

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:30.810
<i>Mission... Order... Shinobu... Superior...
Aoi... Naho... Hashira... Coin... Order...</i>

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:35.320
<i>Coin... Coin!
I'll decide by flipping a coin!</i>

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:35.990
HEADS

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:40.450
<i>Follow your heart.</i>

00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:46.410
- Kanao!
- Lady Kanao!

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:55.760
Kanao...

00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:58.300
- Lady Kanao...
- Lady Kanao...

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:03.390
Could you be more unflashy?
Stop that yanking.

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:06.640
Did you forget
that you just received orders?

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:11.020
Say something, dammit!

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:12.310
You really are unflashy!

00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:15.820
Ch-Charge!

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:17.150
Charge!

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:19.150
- Charge!
- Charge!

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:23.240
Hey! You guys!
Knock it off right now!

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:28.660
How dare you treat girls like that!
Let go of them!

00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:35.460
<i>No. Are they swarming around him?</i>

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:38.420
<i>Or being held? Which is it?</i>

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:42.130
He's kidnapping them!
Please rescue them!

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:43.140
Why, you...

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:45.180
You little idiot!

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:01.320
Are you all right?

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.990
Yes!

00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:04.990
You're a fool.

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:10.660
I'm Lord Tengen Uzui, former shinobi.

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:14.500
A flashy man renown around these parts.

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:18.880
Do you really think I'd fall victim
to one of your pissant head-butts?

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:22.510
Let Aoi and Naho go,
you lousy kidnapper!

00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:24.180
You heard him! You heard him!

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:26.260
What do you think you're doing?

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:28.010
Hentai! Hentai!

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:31.480
Hey, you two! Who do you think
you're talking to, dammit?

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:34.520
I'm your superior!
I'm a Hashira, dammit!

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:37.110
I don't acknowledge you as a Hashira!

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:38.360
Huh!

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:40.280
Don't "huh" me!

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.570
Who cares if you don't acknowledge me?

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:46.120
You little bottom-feeder!
Did your brain matter explode or what?

00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:50.200
I'm taking these two because I need
some female Corps members for a mission!

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:53.660
And I don't need permission from Kocho
to take anyone who's not a Tsuguko!

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:57.630
Naho isn't a member of the Corps!
Can't you see she's not wearing the uniform?

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:02.880
I don't need her, then.

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:09.180
How could you do such a thing,
you inhuman brute?

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:10.770
He dropped me!

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:14.350
For now, I'm just going to take
this one on my mission.

00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:16.270
Not that she looks like she'll be of any use.

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:19.480
But somehow,
she is a Corps member, at least.

00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:25.990
Everyone has their own personal reasons,
so don't be so insensitive and stir things up!

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:27.990
Give us back Aoi!

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.990
Lame. So lame.

00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:35.040
No wonder the Demon Slayer Corps
is getting weaker and weaker,

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:38.170
with guys like you wailing and moaning
in your unflashy way!

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:47.090
We'll go in place of Aoi!

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:49.970
What do you mean by "we"?

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:11.660
What's going on, you three?
What do you have to say?

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:16.210
I just got back this second,
but I have power to spare!

00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:18.290
I'll be glad to go!

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:22.290
Y-Y-You let Aoi go, you hear me?

00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:28.300
You may be a muscular monster,
but I'm not b-b-b-backing down! No, sir!

00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:38.310
Is that right?
Then I guess I'll take you with me.

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:43.230
<i>You backed down just like that, huh?</i>

00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:47.450
But remember this...
Don't you dare defy me!

00:39:58.080 --> 00:39:59.920
Tanjiro...

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:06.920
He's gigantic.

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:10.430
So? Where are we going, old man?

00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:18.730
The number one spot in Japan that's dripping
with lust and desire. A super-flashy place.

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:30.450
The Entertainment District
where demons reside.

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:40.990
NIN-NIN

00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:37.230
Nin-nin!

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:58.670
CELEBRATING THE OPENING
OF THE ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT ARC!

00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:47.450
So, it's finally underway!

00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:52.120
Anyway, I hope you three
are really up to this mission!

00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:54.790
I don't know much about you.

00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:57.170
So introduce yourselves
right now on the spot!

00:44:57.170 --> 00:44:58.670
All right, I'll go first!

00:44:59.050 --> 00:45:00.550
My name is Tanjiro Kamado.

00:44:59.050 --> 00:45:00.550
TANJIRO KAMADO

00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:02.050
My favorite food is fatsia sprouts.

00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:02.050
FAVORITE FOOD:
FATSIA SPROUTS

00:45:02.050 --> 00:45:04.180
NEZUKO

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:04.180
This is my little sister, Nezuko.

00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:07.430
FAVORITE FOOD:
KONPEITO

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:06.430
She loves konpeito.

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:11.940
ZENITSU AGATSUMA

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:09.930
My name is Zenitsu Agatsuma.

00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:11.940
I love sweets most of all!

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:13.440
Not to mention high-quality eel!

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:13.440
FAVORITE FOOD:
HIGH-QUALITY EEL

00:45:14.810 --> 00:45:16.520
Who asked you about that stuff?

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:20.190
I'm asking what you can do
to fight off demons!

00:45:20.570 --> 00:45:23.950
The demons in the Entertainment District
are crazy strong!

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:25.830
Nooooo!

00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:28.620
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die! Nooooo!

00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:30.500
Then all you have to do is fight
so you won't die!

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:32.750
I don't even want
to run into a powerful demon!

00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:36.750
I still haven't done anything
with Nezuko yet, so there's no way!

00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:40.840
Shut up for a second.

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:42.760
I'm Inosuke Hashibira!

00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:46.760
If you want to hear about me,
you'll have to take me out first!

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:54.850
What's this guy's problem,
shooting off his mouth like that?

00:45:54.850 --> 00:45:56.020
What did you say?

00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:58.940
Now it's time for today's Taisho-era secret!

00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:01.280
Let me introduce myself.

00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:04.110
I was born into a shinobi clan.

00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:08.780
So when I was a kid, I led an unflashy life
in the shadows as a shinobi.

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:10.040
Really?

00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:11.120
No way!

00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:12.410
You shouldn't lie.

00:46:12.410 --> 00:46:14.000
It's not a lie!

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:16.420
All my pent-up resentment
from those days exploded,

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:18.750
turning me
into the flashy guy I am today.

00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:22.210
But that may be
because I always had it in me.

00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:25.630
I want you three to show me some
flashy moves during this mission, okay?

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:30.260
<i>I'm picking up the scent of a strong sense
of responsibility from this man.</i>

00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:32.890
<i>We can trust him.</i>

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:36.100
What's with that smirk on your face?

00:46:36.350 --> 00:46:39.270
Next, Episode 2,
"Infiltrating the Entertainment District."

00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:41.900
Do your jobs, you three!

00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:43.780
Right!

00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:51.830
