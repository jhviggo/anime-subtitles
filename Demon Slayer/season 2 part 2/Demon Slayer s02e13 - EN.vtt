00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:05.400
UPPER SIX

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.860
It's annoying me,
so this time, I'm going to kill you.
UPPER SIX

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.820
<i>Hinokami Kagura...</i>

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.660
<i>Raging Sun!</i>

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.370
<i>Flame Dance!</i>

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.540
<i>That was nothing to write home about.</i>

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.540
<i>In the end, this is all it amounts to!</i>

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.510
<i>Where is he?</i>

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.840
<i>Hinokami Kagura...</i>

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.010
<i>Fake Rainbow...</i>

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.310
<i>I can do this!</i>

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.020
<i>Hinokami Kagura...</i>

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.350
<i>Fire Wheel!</i>

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.910
<i>Recovery Breathing!</i>

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.340
<i>I'm able to fight...</i>

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.300
<i>an Upper Rank demon!</i>

EPISODE 6:
LAYERED MEMORIES

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.250
You ugly piece of trash!

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.400
<i>What's going on?</i>

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.820
<i>The Belts are entering her body!</i>

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.330
<i>No. Are they going back into her?
The ones that were split off from her?</i>

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.880
<i>Stand your ground!
Get your breathing under control!</i>

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.630
<i>Let's go!</i>

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.340
I knew it.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.930
<i>She's gone!</i>

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.270
A Hashira...

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.770
So a Hashira did come, after all!

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.520
That's great!

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.280
That will certainly please my master!

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.780
<i>She's transformed.</i>

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.660
<i>What an ominous scent.</i>

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.540
<i>It's making the back of my throat
sting with pain!</i>

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.500
<i>She's gained even more power!</i>

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.290
<i>But is Uzui with Inosuke and the others?</i>

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.000
<i>Then I can rest easy.</i>

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.260
You guys need to shut the hell up!

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.970
What's the deal with that sword?

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.890
You have a lot of nerve,
brawling in front of my House!

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.760
What kind of harassment is this?

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.520
<i>Oh no! We made too much noise,
and now people are...</i>

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.980
I'll have you know that this Hanamachi is viable
because we and our clients all follow the rules!

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.110
People like you aren't welcome here!

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.610
Now get the hell out of my sight!

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.110
Why don't you shut your trap?

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.790
<i>Don't do it!</i>

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.620
Don't do it! Don't come this way!

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:16.790
Step back!

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.010
Stay inside your buildings!

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.070
H-Hiro! No!

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.580
Stay calm.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.450
You'll survive!

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:56.460
Your arm!

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.920
Tie it up with some string!

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.590
Come back here!

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.640
I won't let you get away with this!

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:12.970
Not after what you just did!

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.980
What? You still have something to say?

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.150
That's enough, ugly one.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.070
The repulsive have no reason
to live, anyway.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.110
So you can all just die and rot together.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.660
Hiro! Hiro!

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.580
No! Somebody help us!

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.210
All of you, stay inside!

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.960
It's too dangerous, so stay hidden!

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.890
<i>Dear Kamado...</i>

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.350
<i>I know that I wronged you.</i>

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.280
<i>Thank you for shedding tears over Kyojuro.</i>

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:12.700
<i>I hear that you've also been exchanging letters
with Senjuro for the past four months.</i>

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.370
<i>He seems to be
in a much better place now.</i>

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:23.130
<i>I'm ashamed that our first meeting
went the way it did.</i>

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.340
<i>At a time when my own incompetence
had left me shattered,</i>

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:32.380
<i>things went from bad to worse
when my beloved wife succumbed to illness.</i>

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:37.770
<i>Since then, I've done nothing
but drink myself into a stupor and wallow.</i>

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.520
<i>There's no bigger fool than me.</i>

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:46.820
<i>Unlike me, Kyojuro was a fine son.</i>

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.240
<i>Even after I abandoned him
as his instructor,</i>

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:54.660
<i>he trained by reading
the Guide to Flame Breathing,</i>

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.910
<i>and became a Hashira.</i>

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.250
<i>Even though there were only three volumes.</i>

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.460
<i>He must have had more of Ruka's...</i>

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.500
<i>Of his mother's blood.</i>

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.670
<i>Both Kyojuro and Senjuro are fine boys.</i>

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.470
<i>And Kamado...</i>

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.680
<i>You have an even more amazing power.</i>

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.930
<i>I hear that those who are chosen
to wield Sun Breathing...</i>

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:26.190
<i>are born with the same red mark
on their forehead that you have.</i>

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.440
<i>And so I'm sure that you...</i>

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.070
<i>No, Shinjuro.</i>

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.450
<i>I wasn't born with this scar.</i>

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:42.790
<i>Originally, it was a burn mark from when
I protected my brother from a falling brazier.</i>

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.130
<i>Later, I injured myself there
during Final Selection,</i>

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.340
<i>and that's how it ended up
the way it is now.</i>

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:54.220
<i>I hear that my father was born
with a faint mark on his forehead,</i>

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:55.680
<i>but that wasn't the case with me.</i>

00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:01.720
<i>I must not be a chosen wielder.</i>

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:05.100
<i>But...</i>

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.850
<i>even so...</i>

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.070
<i>Even if I'm not one of the chosen ones...</i>

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.980
<i>Even if I'm not up to the task...</i>

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.990
<i>there are times
when I just can't back down!</i>

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:23.080
<i>Because in this world,
there are those who lack human hearts!</i>

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:27.210
<i>Killing for no reason
without a second thought!</i>

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:28.830
<i>Without any hint of remorse!</i>

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:35.050
<i>I won't allow...</i>

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.840
<i>that kind of tyranny...</i>

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.640
<i>no matter what!</i>

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.940
Those lost lives will never return!

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:48.900
They can never come back!

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:55.110
Those made of flesh and blood
can't do what demons do.

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:57.110
Why would you rob them?

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.120
Why would you trample over their lives?

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:04.120
<i>I've heard these words before.</i>

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:09.670
<i>What do you find so entertaining?
What's so amusing about this?</i>

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:14.590
<i>What do you take life for, exactly?</i>

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.720
<i>Who is that? I don't know.</i>

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.890
Why can't you understand?

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:24.010
<i>How can you forget?</i>

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.890
<i>This isn't me.</i>

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:29.650
<i>These aren't my memories.</i>

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:31.020
<i>It's the cells!</i>

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:33.270
<i>Master Muzan's!</i>

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:37.030
<i>The memories of the cells...</i>

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:43.030
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:48.040
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT ARC

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.050
- Muscle! Muscle!
- Muscle! Muscle!

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.680
- Mus-cle!
- Mus-cle!

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.430
Hey you!

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.640
That Worm Belt just scattered
through that hole and escaped!

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.600
You shut up!

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.350
I saved everyone who was trapped inside,
so what's the problem?

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:13.980
First, worship and praise me!

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.230
We'll discuss that other thing later!

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:20.360
Lord Tengen! You have to go after it,
or there'll be more carnage!

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:24.120
Don't worry about us! Please go!

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:29.120
Come on, boys!
We're giving chase!

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.500
Follow me!

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.000
Move it now!

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.960
Out of my way!

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.510
Lord Tengen is comin' through!

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:41.260
DESTROY

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.100
Dammit! He's too fast!

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:51.600
What is it?

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.810
You were a human once, weren't you?

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:59.570
You must've shed tears once,
struggling against pain and suffering.

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:03.700
You really are annoying,
rambling on and on like that!

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.450
I don't remember anything
about the past!

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:09.790
I'm a demon now,
so who cares about that?

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.080
Demons never grow old.

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.670
And they don't need money to eat.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.000
They don't get sick.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.420
They don't die.

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:21.420
They have nothing to lose.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.180
Not to mention...

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.550
we beautiful, powerful demons...

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:28.510
can do anything we want!

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:30.890
Fine.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:32.810
Enough, then.

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:36.900
<i>Blood Demon Art...</i>

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:42.440
<i>Eight-Layered Obi Slash!</i>

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.410
<i>Now, you can't stop this, can you?
It's because you're an idiot!</i>

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.580
<i>This interweaving attack
leaves you with nowhere to run.</i>

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.210
<i>The parts of my body that were split off
to take control of this Hanamachi...</i>

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:59.920
<i>Now that I'm whole again,
my speed is in a class of its own!</i>

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.970
<i>You could barely hold your own
against my non-Blood Demon Art attacks,</i>

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:05.430
<i>so you have no chance now.</i>

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:07.970
<i>It's all over for you, isn't it? Farewell!</i>

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:10.810
<i>I'm going to slash you, dull sword and all!</i>

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:16.690
<i>And now, I'll be making my way to that Hashira!</i>

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:20.440
<i>Hinokami Kagura...</i>

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:22.740
<i>Burning Bones, Summer Sun.</i>

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:27.910
<i>That hurts! What is this pain?</i>

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:32.240
<i>It's like a burning pain
where I received that slash!</i>

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.160
<i>I can't regenerate like I'm supposed to!</i>

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.790
<i>But his wounds must be deep, too!</i>

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:42.130
<i>Making such violent moves
would normally rupture his body on the spot!</i>

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.550
<i>In the first place,
how can he slice my Belt?</i>

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.010
<i>When its durability has increased!</i>

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.600
<i>My fingertips are trembling.</i>

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.940
<i>Is this me?</i>

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.190
<i>Master Muzan?</i>

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:05.780
<i>Damn him! Now he's faster than before!</i>

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:07.610
<i>It doesn't make sense!
Doesn't make sense!</i>

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:09.700
<i>Don't you feel any pain?</i>

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.280
<i>Are you human?</i>

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:20.790
As if someone like you...

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:25.050
could ever hope to decapitate me!

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.130
<i>It's soft.</i>

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:31.300
<i>It's too soft for me to cut through.</i>

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.270
<i>It blunted my sword slash
by bending and weaving.</i>

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:37.690
I won't let you get away!

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.350
You ugly, vile brat!

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.110
<i>There are more Belts now.</i>

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.730
<i>Thirteen of them.</i>

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.240
<i>If I dodge them,
they might wreak even more havoc.</i>

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:49.950
<i>But for some reason...</i>

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:53.370
<i>they're awfully slow.</i>

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:56.750
I won't let you cut me!
Not this time!

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.460
Making contact with my neck just now
was just a fluke!

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:06.260
<i>Huh?</i>

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:09.760
<i>The Belts he warded off with his sword ridge
are now pinned in one spot!</i>

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.180
You really think you've stopped me?

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.350
I'll blow you away!

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:21.100
You think you can pull them tight
so you can slash them?

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.860
But I can let them loose
in the blink of an eye!

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:29.030
There's no way you can
overcome this distance in an instant—

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:36.330
<i>Huh?</i>

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:37.700
<i>He slashed them?</i>

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.210
<i>So fast!</i>

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:41.290
<i>It's simple.</i>

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:45.960
<i>I just have to bring my sword down
faster than they can start bending.</i>

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.420
<i>I can do it this time. I can slash her.</i>

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:51.470
<i>Big Bro!</i>

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:58.970
<i>Big Bro, breathe! Please!</i>

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:17.540
So pathetic, you humans. Seriously.

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:22.920
No matter how you struggle, that's the best
you can do. I'm starting to feel sorry for you.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:27.290
<i>I can't stop coughing!
It's so hard to breathe!</i>

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:32.050
<i>I must've gone way past
my stamina threshold!</i>

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.720
<i>All I can see ahead of me is darkness.</i>

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:37.930
<i>All I can hear is the sound
of my own heartbeat.</i>

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.350
That's right.

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:45.440
Your wounds won't be healing any time soon,
so no wonder you've ended up like this.

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:50.570
<i>Wield your sword!</i>

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:55.280
I'll return the favor by slicing your head off!

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:27.730
You have a lot of nerve doing that to me!

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:29.190
You!

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:30.860
Right, it's you!

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:32.490
It's you, isn't it?

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:35.610
The one he was talking about was you, huh?

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.450
<i>Daki...</i>

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:43.250
<i>There's a demon
who slipped from my grasp.</i>

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:45.410
<i>Just like Tamayo.</i>

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:48.750
<i>Find her and get rid of her.</i>

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.550
<i>You're the only one I can turn to.</i>

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:59.140
<i>She's a girl clad in a kimono
with a hemp leaf pattern, and a checkered belt.</i>

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:06.730
Yes!

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:09.980
Of course I'll be happy
to torture her to death!

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:11.480
As you wish!

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:20.570
Is kicking the only thing you know?

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.000
You damn bottom-feeder demon!

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.680
Could you be any weaker?

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.050
I can see that you've hardly
devoured any humans.

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:43.350
I wonder how you managed
to escape his control.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.480
You poor thing!

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:50.150
Your torso and lower body
went their separate ways, didn't they?

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:51.980
You'd better not move.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:59.240
A half-developed demon like you
can't possibly regenerate right away, I'm sure.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.120
We're both demons, after all.
I won't bully you anymore.

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:08.750
I'll absorb you into my Belt, and when morning
comes, I'll kill you by exposing you to the sun!

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:11.630
Demons killing each other...

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:13.540
Such a waste of time!

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:21.010
Huh?

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:23.390
<i>Hold on a second. What's this?</i>

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.680
<i>She's regenerated her leg.</i>

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.600
<i>Never mind her leg,</i>

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:29.770
<i>how can she be standing?</i>

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.560
<i>I know I just severed her body!</i>

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.860
<i>I know that I felt it!</i>

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:36.690
<i>I slashed her for sure!</i>

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.450
<i>Her healing and regeneration speed...</i>

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.200
<i>is...</i>

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:50.080
<i>Upper Rank caliber.</i>

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:10.640
<i>What is this cruelty?</i>

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.060
<i>This intimidating air?</i>

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:14.810
<i>She changed all a sudden.</i>

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.320
<i>Big Bro...</i>

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:26.740
<i>You and our sister
sure take after each other.</i>

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.580
<i>You're gentle but scary
when you get mad.</i>

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:33.040
<i>Like our sister...</i>

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:37.340
<i>when that rough-looking grown-up
bumped into a kid and hurt him,</i>

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:40.340
<i>she got in his face,
asking him to apologize.</i>

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:45.890
<i>I mean, luckily there were
tons of grown-ups around, but...</i>

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:49.180
<i>it was scary. For me.</i>

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:54.940
<i>Since people who get mad for others
tend not to have any regard for their own safety.</i>

00:20:56.020 --> 00:21:01.320
<i>And because of that, they may lose
something precious someday.</i>

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:02.650
<i>That scares me.</i>

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:11.540
<i>Another kick?</i>

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:14.710
<i>You're a one-trick pony, aren't you?</i>

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:15.920
<i>Your neck is next!</i>

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:00.860
NIN-NIN

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:02.060
Nin-nin!

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:07.610
Monjiro! We're coming to save you right now,
so don't you croak before we get there!

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:12.070
How can you run while you're sleeping?

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.740
Can you see ahead of you?

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.620
How's this? Better?

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:23.750
Hey, that's pretty good for you!

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:26.300
Anyway, where did the God of Festivals go?

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.260
You two are way too slow!

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:29.930
God of Festivals!

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:33.050
We're out of time,
so no Taisho-era secret today!

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:36.020
Next, Episode 7, "Transformation"!

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:38.430
Get a move on! Let's go!

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:40.020
TO BE CONTINUED
