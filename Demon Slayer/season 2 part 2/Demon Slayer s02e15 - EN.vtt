WEBVTT

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.320
<i>Thank goodness Nezuko's asleep.</i>

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.410
<i>Hushabye...</i>

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.660
<i>Nezuko!</i>
<i>Hushabye...</i>

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.990
<i>Hushabye...</i>

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.870
<i>Stop it!</i>
<i>Hushabye...</i>

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:19.410
<i>Baby bunny on the hill...</i>
<i>Stop it!</i>

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.330
<i>Baby bunny on the hill...</i>

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.040
<i>Tell me why your eyes are so very red...</i>

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.730
You sleep tight now.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.200
<i>I can still fight.</i>

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.580
<i>I can still move.</i>

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:05.960
<i>This time...</i>

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.000
<i>I'm going to fight to the end!</i>

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.340
<i>To the very end!</i>

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.020
EPISODE 8:
GATHERING

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.560
Huh! This really pisses me off.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.980
You're good-looking,
you have three wives,

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.280
and on top of that,
you're full of swagger.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.660
You're different, aren't you?

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.620
You're not like any of the other Hashira
I have killed.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.000
You must've been special
since the day you were born.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.880
A chosen talent, right?

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:20.130
That makes me so jealous!
I need you to die as soon as possible!

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.220
Talent?

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.720
Do I look like someone with any talent?

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.860
If someone like me gives that impression,
you really are living a blessed life.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.110
You may be centuries old, but if you've stayed
shut up inside a place like this...

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.110
UPPER SIX
I guess you can't help
being ignorant of the real world.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.120
What do you know about it?
UPPER SIX

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.030
I know, all right.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.040
But you have no clue, do you?
See, this country is vast.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.540
It's teeming with people
who'd blow your mind.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.340
Some are complete enigmas.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.220
Some can take up a sword
and become a Hashira in two months.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.720
DESTROYER
OF DEMONS

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.300
Me, chosen?
DESTROYER
OF DEMONS

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.470
Don't give me that crap!

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.140
Just how many lives do you think
I've let slip through my fingers until now?

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.930
<i>That's right.</i>

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.190
<i>I can't be like Rengoku!</i>

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.190
Then how do you explain it?

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.780
UPPER SIX

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.240
My Blood Sickles
are drenched with deadly poison,
UPPER SIX

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.950
yet you simply refuse to die!
UPPER SIX

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.790
I come from a line of shinobi. I've become
resistant, so poison doesn't work on me.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.750
The shinobi were wiped out
back during the Edo Period!

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.130
Don't give us that crap!

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.920
That's no lie.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.550
<i>The shinobi exist.</i>

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.340
<i>I had nine brothers and sisters.</i>

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.430
<i>Seven of them died
by the time I turned 15.</i>

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.350
<i>Panicked by our clan's decline,</i>

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.730
<i>my father, just like a man possessed,
forced us to submit to brutal training,</i>

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.440
<i>and the only survivors were myself
and my brother, who was two years younger.</i>

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.110
<i>My brother was exactly like my father.</i>

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.070
<i>The same mindset,
the same mannerisms as my father...</i>

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.530
<i>His subordinates were pawns.</i>

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.370
<i>His wives were expendable
so long as they produced heirs.</i>

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.080
<i>No one else ever had any say.</i>

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.000
<i>Resolutely indifferent.</i>

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.420
<i>And I...</i>

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.840
<i>didn't want to become like him!</i>

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.470
<i>It's hard, isn't it, Tengen?</i>

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.430
<i>The path you have chosen.</i>

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:40.020
<i>Rejecting the values that shape you,
that were instilled in you during your childhood,</i>

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.820
<i>even as you place yourself on the battlefield...
That's surely agonizing.</i>

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.240
<i>Carrying all that conflict
and quandaries inside yourself...</i>

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.660
<i>You still...</i>

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:56.460
<i>All of you still persist in moving forward
and battling on. Isn't that right?</i>

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.210
<i>So that you can protect
other people's lives.</i>

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.460
<i>Thank you.</i>

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.720
<i>You're a remarkable child.</i>

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.260
<i>I'm the one who should be grateful.</i>

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.900
<i>Master, for your sake, I'd never think twice
about laying down my life.</i>

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.150
<i>I can surely accomplish everything.</i>

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.780
<i>Those who have baggage like conflict
or quandaries are spineless fools.</i>

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.200
<i>That's always been the story of my life.</i>

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:30.660
Huh?

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:31.820
Huh?

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.870
Huh?

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.080
What the hell are you laughing about?

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.880
The poison's affecting you, after all!
Slowly but surely!

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:52.390
Claiming it didn't work on you was just bravado!
Pretty humiliating, huh?

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.770
Oh no! It has absolutely no effect on me!

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.100
Wanna see me dance?

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:03.360
I'm so on fire, I could eat 100 bowls
of tempura udon!

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.730
In a flashy way, that is!

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.040
Don't you dare kick my little sister!

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.120
You scumbag!

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.340
<i>Well, those are unique explosions.</i>

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.970
<i>They can inflict damage on a demon's body</i>

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.430
<i>and explode with the slightest friction
from a strike.</i>

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.470
<i>She got hit because she slashed one
without realizing that.</i>

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:42.310
<i>She's always taking a hit, that one!</i>

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.360
<i>The blade is extend—</i>

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.320
<i>He's holding onto the tip of his sword!</i>

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.660
<i>What kind of insane grip does he have?</i>

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:54.280
<i>Go!</i>

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:03.670
Damn, I botched the chance
to finish off this one!

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.050
He beheaded me again!

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:10.590
Damn you! Damn you!

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:12.050
I'll make you pay for this!

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:18.430
Not fair! Not fair! Why am I the one
who's always getting beheaded?

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:25.940
Hold on. You're onto us, aren't you?

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:28.190
About what?

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.150
Not that finding out about us
will do you any good!

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:36.030
Since you're going to die
a slow and steady death, anyway!

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:42.960
Even as we speak, we're creeping
toward victory, aren't we?

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:45.830
I don't know about that!

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:48.340
Better not forget me!

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:52.260
Not only yours truly, Lord Inosuke,
but his minion is here, as well!

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.350
Who the hell are these guys?

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:12.530
Huh?

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:19.160
DESTROY

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.760
If you're wounded, come this way!

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:42.770
Everyone else, please flee from here!

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:54.860
Huh.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.490
Hey, you guys...

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:06.000
Talk about flashy entrances!

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:08.040
That's what I like to see!

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT ARC

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.010
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT ARC

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.220
You can summon
all the underlings you want...

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.770
but there'll still be no blissful future
waiting for you!

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:35.150
You're all going to die, anyway...

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:38.900
so stop staring
with those sparkling eyes!

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:41.620
<i>There are two demons now.</i>

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:43.530
<i>How did that happen?</i>

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.290
<i>Also, the Belt Demon isn't dead!</i>

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.170
<i>Are they both Upper Six?</i>

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:52.170
<i>Splintered off from each other?</i>

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.670
<i>If that's the case...</i>

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:58.420
<i>the main unit has to be this man!</i>

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:00.550
<i>His scent is different!</i>

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.100
<i>The weight of his scent!</i>

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:07.350
<i>It feels like the back
of my throat's gone numb!</i>

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.560
<i>My hands are shaking!</i>

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:13.480
<i>I wonder if it's from fatigue.</i>

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:15.440
<i>Or...</i>

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:16.860
<i>is it fear?</i>

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:18.280
<i>No!</i>

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:20.820
<i>Even so, I...</i>

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:23.240
<i>We...</i>

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.200
We're going to win!

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.950
Us the Demon Slayers!

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:29.040
No way can you win!

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.670
Not when the Hashira who's your only hope
is ravaged by poison!

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:34.920
Poison?

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.710
Oh, we're going to win easy,
you dumbass bottom-feeders!

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:42.220
I'm at the top of my game
when I'm shackled by poison in my system!

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.010
Oh, spare us your bravado!

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:46.850
Shut up! Don't you dare
underestimate humans!

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:50.230
All three of these boys
are my brilliant Tsuguko!

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.480
They have relentless grit!

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.360
Yeah, we do!

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.150
Even if their limbs fall off,
they won't let go!

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:00.990
And I've already identified
how to bring you down!

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.370
Beheading you at the same time!

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:08.200
Both of you at the same time!
Am I right?

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:19.510
Otherwise, there'd be no reason
to disperse your respective skills

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:22.590
rather than assimilating
your weak sister into yourself!

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.180
Easy-peasy, you two!

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:28.890
I see! It's that simple!

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:31.100
We've as good as won, huh?

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:37.110
All those Demon Slayers perished
because they couldn't do that simple thing.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.400
Not even the Hashira!

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.610
Fifteen for me and seven for my sister.

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:44.990
That's how many we've devoured!

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:46.570
You heard him!

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:49.580
Not a single one lived to see daybreak!

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:56.130
Long nights are always on our side, after all.

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:59.300
Every last one of you, just die!

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:12.980
Zenitsu!

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.730
Leave that worm woman
to me and Sleepyhead!

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.230
You two go defeat that praying mantis!

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:19.230
Got that?

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:20.730
Watch your back!

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:22.070
Sure thing!

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:25.780
I won't let you kill my sister.

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:30.910
You! You're the one from...

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.660
I have something to say to you.

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:38.790
Apologize to the girl you hurt by pulling her ear.

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:40.290
Huh?

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:42.920
Even if it was your earnings...

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:46.470
that provided them with their basic needs,

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:49.760
that still doesn't make those girls your belongings.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.520
You have no right to do whatever you want to them.

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:57.480
Don't bore me with your stupid lecture!

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:02.780
In what world does someone as ugly as you
get to speak to me as an equal?

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.360
In this city, women are merchandise.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.110
The same as objects.

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:11.660
Getting sold, bought and destroyed.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.250
The owner is free to do
with them as she chooses.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:17.460
Ugly people have no right to eat any meals.

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:21.540
The inept shouldn't be treated as humans!

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:28.590
You shouldn't do the same horrible things
to others that were done to you.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.220
You're wrong about that!

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:35.980
The horrible things done to us...
The things that made us suffer...

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:39.520
We do them back to others
and collect on those debts.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:46.490
We can never make up for our own misfortune
unless we collect it from the blessed.

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:51.620
Because that's the way we live our lives!

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.240
SIX
Because that's the way we live our lives!

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:59.460
We've killed off everyone who's ever leveled
false accusations at us, right?

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:05.630
We're going to slash your windpipes
just like we did to the others!

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:09.930
<i>Unbelievable bloodlust!</i>

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:12.640
<i>It's giving me the chills
from my elbows to my neck!</i>

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:16.140
<i>No wonder! You're up against
the Upper Six demon!</i>

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.520
<i>Get a hold of yourself!</i>

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.060
<i>Uzui's been poisoned!</i>

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:21.770
<i>I have to protect him!</i>

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:24.770
<i>Strike with your sword
the instant he moves!</i>

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:27.230
<i>The second he moves even an inch!</i>

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:28.490
<i>In that instant!</i>

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:31.570
<i>Swing it! Swing your sword!</i>

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:33.160
<i>Evade it! Evade it!</i>

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:35.530
<i>Bend backward! Bend—</i>

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:46.090
<i>What are you doing?</i>

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:48.800
<i>He protected you instead,
and now you're a hindrance!</i>

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.640
<i>Tons of Belts from up above!</i>

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:10.740
Huh? Three eyes?

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:15.240
I can see everything!
All of your movements!

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:17.950
Now that my brother's awake,

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:20.580
what you're seeing now
is my true power!

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.540
Shut up! Stop screeching
in that damn shrill voice!

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.590
Them being your Tsuguko was a lie, right?

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:33.720
Your movements are so out of sync!

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:36.470
What a total bust!

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:43.770
You can't even get close to me!

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:46.520
Shut up, Worm Woman!

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:50.190
If you want to prove anything, why don't you
shut your trap and see if you can kill us!

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.490
All right, as you wish!

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:15.550
You can just die!

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:17.680
<i>So quick!</i>

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.640
<i>He really is like a praying mantis!</i>

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.680
<i>What's up with these slashes?</i>

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:40.370
<i>There's no way out of this!</i>

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:46.500
<i>Heavy! These slashes are so heavy!</i>

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.340
<i>Sidestep it! Ward off the blow!</i>

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:53.760
<i>If you take the blow head-on,
it'll snap your blade in two!</i>

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:59.050
<i>If it's power versus power,
the weaker side always loses!</i>

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:03.270
<i>Don't misjudge the flow of power
and ward it off as you should!</i>

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:06.390
<i>The flexible Water Breathing technique
is better for defense...</i>

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:09.100
<i>if it's only to ward off the blow!</i>

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:12.440
<i>My blade never would've gotten nicked!</i>

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:21.990
<i>Sound Breathing...</i>

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.200
<i>Fifth Form...</i>

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.620
<i>String Performance!</i>

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:34.000
<i>You can assault me with your noisy moves,
but it'll do you no good!</i>

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.840
Die! Die! You ugly toads!

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:42.680
It's not just the Belts!

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.520
Now we have blood blades flying toward us!

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:48.020
What's going on?
I can't get near that Worm Woman!

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:49.100
Dammit!

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:51.190
These blood blades are big trouble!

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:55.440
I can feel it all over my body
that just a scratch would be deadly!

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:01.910
Damn!

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:06.700
Be useful! Don't let him attack as much!

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.170
Find a way to win!

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:11.420
<i>He's not going to hold up much longer!</i>

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.000
<i>It's a miracle that he can still move at all!</i>

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.170
<i>That shoulder wound must be really deep!</i>

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:19.550
<i>He seems to have stopped the bleeding,
but it's touch and go!</i>

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:23.550
<i>That left hand tied to his hilt
is the only thing keeping his sword in his grip!</i>

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:27.220
<i>All because I got poisoned!</i>

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.810
<i>I have to take care of this,
or we'll be wiped out!</i>

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:35.150
<i>I can't breathe!</i>

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:38.110
<i>This furious attack is leaving me gasping!</i>

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:40.320
<i>I'm about to black out!
I have to find a way...</i>

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:42.950
<i>to start Recovery Breathing!</i>

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:06.350
<i>What are those?</i>

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:08.180
<i>Kunai?</i>

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:13.100
<i>It's going to be a pain, dealing with this
much of them in front of a Hashira.</i>

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:16.360
<i>What a chore! So annoying!</i>

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:19.690
<i>When there are still
three fledgling Demon Slayers, too!</i>

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:22.740
<i>Well, even if they hit me,
those things are no...</i>

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:24.620
<i>No.</i>

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:27.870
<i>Would they really try to pull off
such a meaningless attack?</i>

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:32.710
<i>Blood Demon Art...
Rampant Arc Rampage!</i>

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:35.040
<i>He's creating a dome with the slashes!</i>

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.290
<i>Hey, hey, hey!</i>

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:41.050
<i>What's going on here?
He's coming at me!</i>

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.050
<i>There's one stuck in you!</i>

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:45.550
<i>A Kunai, piercing you, too!</i>

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:49.560
<i>That's right, he's a shinobi.
Not a swordsman.</i>

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.940
<i>This guy's always had
otherworldly senses!</i>

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:56.560
What the...

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.440
<i>My legs won't regenerate!</i>

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.820
<i>I knew it! They're laced with something!</i>

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.070
<i>This Kunai!</i>

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:09.080
<i>Probably with something
extracted from wisteria!</i>

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.080
<i>M-My body's going numb!</i>

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.250
<i>Hey, not too shabby!</i>

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:21.170
<i>Starting to get into sync
in such a short time! Pretty amusing!</i>

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:22.670
<i>Please!</i>

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.110
NIN-NIN

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:02.150
Nin-nin!

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:05.990
Rengoku, how would you fight?

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:10.610
I might not be able to handle it
like you would.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.740
I could never be like you, either!

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:16.620
Rengoku!

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:19.000
Your sword skills are a thing of beauty!

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.130
Though you do have too many wives!

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:29.760
Look after Young Kamado, the yellow boy
and the boar head boy for me, Uzui.

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:35.260
Just leave those flashy jobs to me.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:36.930
Next, Episode 9,

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:38.730
"Defeating an Upper Rank Demon."

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:40.020
