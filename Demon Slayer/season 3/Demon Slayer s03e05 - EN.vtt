00:22.870 --> 00:24.710
<i>Whatever you do for others...</i>

00:25.000 --> 00:26.880
<i>comes around to help you,
as well, in the end.</i>

00:40.180 --> 00:41.680
Run.

00:42.520 --> 00:44.180
You...

00:49.190 --> 00:52.190
You're getting in the way, so just run.

02:52.850 --> 02:58.030
EPISODE 4:
THANK YOU, TOKITO

03:13.370 --> 03:15.840
<i>I sliced off what I thought was its head,</i>

03:15.840 --> 03:18.210
<i>but rather than disintegrate,
its body is regenerating.</i>

03:18.960 --> 03:20.300
<i>So, that must be it.</i>

03:39.230 --> 03:41.610
<i>It was getting its power from that vase.</i>

03:42.110 --> 03:44.950
<i>So, it's definitely a product
of Blood Demon Art.</i>

03:51.120 --> 03:53.580
Thank you!

03:53.580 --> 03:55.170
I thought I was a goner!

03:55.170 --> 03:57.000
I thought I was dead!

03:57.000 --> 03:58.630
I was so scared!

04:00.380 --> 04:02.920
I shouldn't have called you
"seaweed head"!

04:02.920 --> 04:05.130
I'm so sorry!

04:05.800 --> 04:08.470
You called me "seaweed head"?

04:11.560 --> 04:15.060
Sorry! I didn't like you!

04:15.480 --> 04:18.110
I don't have time for this.

04:18.110 --> 04:21.190
I'm leaving now,
so do whatever you want.

04:24.070 --> 04:24.900
Wait!

04:25.280 --> 04:27.200
They attacked Mr. Kanamori, too!

04:27.200 --> 04:29.910
When I went to help him out,
that monster assaulted me!

04:34.710 --> 04:38.840
Mr. Haganezuka's been working non stop
without sleep to restore a sword...

04:38.840 --> 04:42.360
so if he stops even for a second,
that will be the end of it!

04:42.360 --> 04:43.840
Please...

04:43.840 --> 04:45.590
save him!

04:50.510 --> 04:52.720
Please!

04:54.730 --> 04:55.980
No...

04:55.980 --> 04:57.520
I...

05:00.730 --> 05:04.070
<i>You'll be able to find yourself
again for sure...</i>

05:05.110 --> 05:06.740
<i>Muichiro.</i>

05:11.830 --> 05:14.040
<i>I know you must be confused,</i>

05:14.370 --> 05:17.960
<i>but for now, just focus
on living, nothing more.</i>

05:19.000 --> 05:22.380
<i>As long as you're alive,
things will work out.</i>

05:24.840 --> 05:27.760
<i>You'll regain your lost memories
without fail.</i>

05:28.260 --> 05:30.180
<i>There's nothing to worry about.</i>

05:32.890 --> 05:35.480
<i>Just don't let your chance slip away.</i>

05:37.980 --> 05:40.940
<i>It will start out
as something insignificant...</i>

05:42.400 --> 05:45.030
<i>and then it will clear away...</i>

05:45.360 --> 05:48.030
<i>the mist in your head.</i>

05:54.330 --> 05:56.040
Whoa!

05:56.040 --> 05:56.910
Hold up!

05:57.330 --> 05:58.790
Go a little slower, will you?

05:58.790 --> 06:01.630
Just a tiny bit slower!

06:01.630 --> 06:03.800
Don't talk, or you'll bite your tongue.

06:06.760 --> 06:08.930
<i>Is this the right thing to do?</i>

06:09.340 --> 06:13.180
<i>Isn't this going to keep me
from protecting the entire village?</i>

06:14.100 --> 06:15.560
<i>No, I can do it.</i>

06:16.180 --> 06:19.350
<i>Because I'm a Demon Slayer
who's been recognized by the Master.</i>

06:19.810 --> 06:21.230
<i>The Mist Hashira...</i>

06:21.650 --> 06:24.190
<i>Muichiro Tokito.</i>

06:40.670 --> 06:42.080
<i>Oh, snap!</i>

06:42.380 --> 06:43.840
<i>I slashed it!</i>

06:43.840 --> 06:44.920
<i>What should I do?</i>

06:45.250 --> 06:47.090
<i>I'm creating more of them!</i>

06:54.350 --> 06:55.850
<i>The same name?</i>

07:04.940 --> 07:06.270
<i>I get it!</i>

07:06.820 --> 07:08.110
<i>That's how it works!</i>

07:10.400 --> 07:12.740
<i>Their attack power's weaker!</i>

07:13.450 --> 07:17.240
<i>It probably can't split off into
the stronger clones indefinitely.</i>

07:17.790 --> 07:20.620
<i>Those characters inside its mouth
that I got a glimpse of.</i>

07:20.620 --> 07:22.290
<i>Emotions...</i>

07:22.290 --> 07:25.130
<i>Those four are the most powerful versions, right?</i>

07:26.340 --> 07:28.630
<i>If they divide any further...</i>

07:29.050 --> 07:30.590
<i>they get weaker!</i>

07:39.470 --> 07:40.270
<i>Behind me!</i>

07:47.570 --> 07:48.690
<i>I have to defeat it!</i>

07:49.360 --> 07:50.900
<i>Even just one of them!</i>

07:50.900 --> 07:52.990
<i>I need to get back to Nezuko and Genya!</i>

07:55.370 --> 07:56.530
<i>Where's the demon?</i>

07:56.530 --> 07:58.330
<i>The mouth that I stabbed is gone!</i>

07:59.330 --> 08:00.370
<i>So...</i>

08:00.370 --> 08:02.210
<i>it can't split off any further?</i>

08:08.250 --> 08:09.840
How do you like my talons?

08:10.420 --> 08:12.550
How swift, how sharp they are?

08:12.550 --> 08:15.840
They're strong enough
to even smash diamonds!

08:19.600 --> 08:21.140
Go on, tremble!

08:22.600 --> 08:23.980
Make that joyful bloodspray...

08:24.440 --> 08:26.480
gush out even more!

08:39.990 --> 08:41.450
You, too!

09:13.570 --> 09:15.650
Now you've gone and done it!

09:26.920 --> 09:30.170
<i>I want to get back
to Nezuko and Genya right away!</i>

09:30.170 --> 09:31.540
<i>What am I going to do?</i>

09:32.000 --> 09:33.130
<i>Nezuko...</i>

09:33.130 --> 09:34.630
<i>Hang in there!</i>

09:53.940 --> 09:56.360
Keep trying, little girl!
You're almost there!

09:59.660 --> 10:01.120
Come on, what's the matter?

10:01.120 --> 10:04.330
Would you hurry up and dismember her?

10:04.330 --> 10:06.450
I'm getting more and more annoyed!

10:06.790 --> 10:10.630
Keep your hands to yourself!
This girl's mine!

10:10.630 --> 10:12.920
You and Aizetsu can get lost!

10:13.250 --> 10:14.500
Karaku...

10:14.500 --> 10:18.470
I will... finish off that girl.

10:20.890 --> 10:22.850
<i>My spear is stuck?</i>

10:26.060 --> 10:29.230
I'm the one you're gonna fight!

10:32.650 --> 10:35.730
Why are you getting blasted
like that, Aizetsu?

10:35.730 --> 10:37.240
So infuriating!

10:37.570 --> 10:38.740
You're a fool!

10:41.530 --> 10:42.820
<i>Dammit!</i>

10:42.820 --> 10:44.240
<i>It's coming out!</i>

10:55.670 --> 11:00.010
How sad it is
not to be able to die instantly.

11:12.020 --> 11:16.980
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
SWORDSMITH VILLAGE ARC

11:16.980 --> 11:21.990
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
SWORDSMITH VILLAGE ARC

11:35.380 --> 11:38.550
I went for his vital spot
so he could die right away,

11:38.550 --> 11:42.550
but I guess he couldn't die
with my spear still lodged in his body.

11:46.680 --> 11:49.600
But now, at last, he can die.

11:49.600 --> 11:58.860
<i>Shaekoku Gijugikkodokuon...</i>

11:58.860 --> 11:59.780
<i>Yodaibikushu.</i>

11:59.780 --> 12:01.440
What's this?
<i>Yodaibikushu.</i>

12:01.440 --> 12:03.110
The Amida Sutra?
<i>Yodaibikushu.</i>

12:03.110 --> 12:03.360
<i>Yodaibikushu.</i>

12:03.360 --> 12:04.860
Well, isn't he a devout one?
<i>Yodaibikushu.</i>

12:04.860 --> 12:06.200
Well, isn't he a devout one?

12:06.780 --> 12:08.870
Can't you see he's still alive?

12:08.870 --> 12:10.790
Split his head into two, Aizetsu!

12:11.620 --> 12:14.750
I was just about to do that,
so stop yelling at me.

12:15.080 --> 12:16.880
You're making me sad.

12:20.840 --> 12:24.970
I'll slice your head off as many times
as it takes until you're dead! You scumbag!

12:29.390 --> 12:33.310
<i>Crap! I can't dodge this lightning!</i>

12:33.640 --> 12:36.150
<i>Damn that bastard with the staff!</i>

12:41.280 --> 12:42.820
<i>What's going on?</i>

12:42.820 --> 12:44.450
<i>Why won't he die?</i>

12:44.450 --> 12:47.240
<i>After Aizetsu dealt him a fatal blow?</i>

12:55.210 --> 12:56.920
Hey, what's this?

12:56.920 --> 12:59.210
That guy looks more fun!

13:00.550 --> 13:03.050
I'm done with you, little girl!

13:09.350 --> 13:10.810
Sekido!

13:10.810 --> 13:15.100
After I've ripped this girl's limbs off,
you impale her with your staff,

13:15.100 --> 13:18.310
then if you keep blasting her with lightning,
she'll be immobilized, huh?

13:19.360 --> 13:21.770
That was my plan from the start!

13:30.700 --> 13:33.120
<i>What kind of a ferocious kick was that?</i>

13:46.720 --> 13:49.720
What are you doing, you idiot?

14:26.130 --> 14:28.470
<i>That was quick! It's faster now!</i>

14:29.510 --> 14:31.340
<i>I need to get back!</i>

14:31.340 --> 14:33.970
<i>The building they're in is so close!</i>

14:34.470 --> 14:36.470
<i>What are you going to do? Think!</i>

14:37.890 --> 14:39.390
<i>I know!</i>

14:39.390 --> 14:41.480
<i>If I can't bring the demon down here...</i>

14:41.980 --> 14:43.190
<i>Wait...</i>

14:43.190 --> 14:45.980
<i>but that might just make
matters worse!</i>

14:46.280 --> 14:48.610
<i>I don't know what to do!
I don't know what to do!</i>

14:49.650 --> 14:50.860
<i>Make up your mind!</i>

14:50.860 --> 14:52.950
<i>You have no choice now but to do it!</i>

14:59.540 --> 15:01.330
<i>Nezuko! Genya!</i>

15:02.040 --> 15:03.500
<i>Don't die!</i>

15:03.500 --> 15:05.090
<i>I'll be there soon!</i>

15:12.140 --> 15:14.720
So, did you finally die?

15:19.980 --> 15:26.940
<i>Kaizedaiarakan shushochishiki
chorosharihotsu...</i>

15:26.940 --> 15:27.730
You're still alive, then?
<i>Kaizedaiarakan shushochishiki
chorosharihotsu...</i>

15:27.730 --> 15:29.360
<i>Makamokukenren Makakasennen...</i>
You're still alive, then?

15:29.360 --> 15:29.690
<i>Makamokukenren Makakasennen...</i>

15:29.690 --> 15:31.240
What is this?
<i>Makamokukenren Makakasennen...</i>

15:31.240 --> 15:34.490
Who the hell are you anyway?
<i>Makamokukenren Makakasennen...</i>

15:38.580 --> 15:40.500
You really wanna know?

15:42.250 --> 15:45.670
My name is Genya Shinazugawa!

15:46.130 --> 15:48.250
Make sure you don't forget it!

15:55.300 --> 15:58.140
That's the name...

16:05.860 --> 16:08.780
...of the man who's going to kill you!

16:09.980 --> 16:12.860
<i>Nezuko and Genya
are in that building right there!</i>

16:13.400 --> 16:14.660
<i>I'm going there!</i>

16:14.660 --> 16:15.780
<i>In one go!</i>

16:17.080 --> 16:19.200
<i>Don't misjudge the direction!</i>

16:19.660 --> 16:22.830
<i>Use the demon's ability to fly
and momentum!</i>

16:23.330 --> 16:24.710
<i>To save Nezuko and Genya...</i>

16:25.000 --> 16:27.210
<i>as soon as possible!</i>

16:30.460 --> 16:31.880
Huh?

16:34.970 --> 16:36.550
So, you're making a run for it?

16:36.550 --> 16:38.810
You're all out of energy now?

16:57.370 --> 16:59.410
<i>I knew it! It's light!</i>

17:00.030 --> 17:02.500
<i>Or else it wouldn't be able to fly around...</i>

17:02.500 --> 17:04.540
<i>with wings this size!</i>

17:04.910 --> 17:06.210
<i>I can make it!</i>

17:29.230 --> 17:30.900
Nezuko! Genya!

17:33.230 --> 17:35.780
First Karaku, now even Urogi...

17:35.780 --> 17:37.910
What the hell are you doing?

17:40.780 --> 17:41.990
Nezuko!

17:42.240 --> 17:44.370
Stop that!

17:46.290 --> 17:49.540
Infuriating! Infuriating!

17:53.760 --> 17:55.420
<i>Urogi's foot!</i>

17:56.050 --> 17:58.470
<i>Flesh made of the same cells as my own!</i>

17:58.470 --> 18:00.430
<i>Impervious to lightning!</i>

18:00.970 --> 18:02.350
<i>This little brat...</i>

18:02.350 --> 18:03.770
<i>has good intuition!</i>

18:04.850 --> 18:05.850
<i>Just now...</i>

18:05.850 --> 18:08.100
<i>he came into this room,
and in the blink of an eye...</i>

18:08.440 --> 18:11.110
<i>he sliced off Urogi's foot!</i>

18:13.360 --> 18:15.690
<i>He can think on his feet in battle!</i>

18:16.490 --> 18:18.450
<i>I can't cut off its head with my sword!</i>

18:18.860 --> 18:19.910
<i>Its tongue!</i>

18:19.910 --> 18:21.370
<i>Go for its tongue!</i>

18:27.250 --> 18:28.710
<i>If their tongues are slashed...</i>

18:29.170 --> 18:30.710
<i>these demons...</i>

18:30.710 --> 18:33.210
<i>take just a little while longer to recover!</i>

18:34.960 --> 18:36.510
<i>All right! I can pull it out!</i>

18:41.510 --> 18:43.470
<i>Curse you! I'll make you pay for this!</i>

18:44.470 --> 18:46.890
<i>This is bad!
The demon's already recovered?</i>

18:51.350 --> 18:52.810
<i>It stopped.</i>

18:57.650 --> 18:59.150
<i>Nezuko!</i>

19:02.490 --> 19:04.490
What an insolent spell!

19:04.990 --> 19:06.120
<i>Amazing!</i>

19:06.120 --> 19:08.370
<i>Look how effective Nezuko's blood is!</i>

19:10.960 --> 19:11.880
Nezuko!

19:18.090 --> 19:20.090
You look like you're having fun!

19:20.510 --> 19:23.550
Let me join you guys!

19:31.350 --> 19:33.560
<i>Unbelievable pressure!</i>

19:34.150 --> 19:36.320
<i>It's crushing our bodies!</i>

20:07.760 --> 20:10.350
And now... for the final blow!

20:13.270 --> 20:14.900
Enemy attack!

20:14.900 --> 20:16.980
Demons!

20:43.420 --> 20:44.340
Get up!

20:48.220 --> 20:49.680
Enemy attack!

20:49.680 --> 20:51.350
Protect the village!

20:59.020 --> 21:00.940
Hurry! Hurry!

21:00.940 --> 21:03.110
The village is in danger!
The village is in danger!

21:03.110 --> 21:05.990
We must rush to its aid
as soon as possible!

21:07.780 --> 21:09.410
I've got to hurry! I've got to hurry!

21:09.410 --> 21:11.370
The villagers are all in danger!

21:11.660 --> 21:17.210
But... to think I was stationed
so close to the swordsmiths' village...

21:17.210 --> 21:18.590
Who knew?

21:19.920 --> 21:23.170
Hurry! The village is close to destruction!

21:27.180 --> 21:29.680
All right! I'm going to give it my all!

23:03.270 --> 23:04.360
Long time no see!

23:04.360 --> 23:07.280
Junior High and High School!!
Kimetsu Academy Story!

23:07.780 --> 23:09.900
I'm Mitsuri Kanroji, aged 19!

23:09.900 --> 23:13.660
My dream is to bring joy to people
all over the world with my paintings!

23:14.240 --> 23:15.660
Hey, listen to me, will you?

23:16.080 --> 23:20.920
When will I meet the gentleman
who's going to make me happy?

23:21.290 --> 23:24.290
No one's ever going to fall in love
with someone like you.

23:24.290 --> 23:25.250
Whaaaaat?

23:25.750 --> 23:29.840
Your hair's pink, you're a voracious eater,
and you're crazy strong.

23:30.180 --> 23:31.430
Bummer!

23:32.010 --> 23:33.800
That's why you paint!
