00:17.450 --> 00:19.990
<i>The numbness is so severe.</i>

00:20.990 --> 00:22.580
<i>These needles...</i>

00:23.040 --> 00:26.040
<i>I may have escaped the water pot...</i>

00:26.040 --> 00:28.590
<i>but I'm not...</i>

00:32.300 --> 00:32.630
K-Kotetsu...

00:32.630 --> 00:35.680
HYOTTOKO
K-Kotetsu...

00:35.680 --> 00:36.260
K-Kotetsu...

00:44.980 --> 00:46.390
<i>My strength...</i>

00:46.390 --> 00:47.690
<i>is sapped.</i>

00:49.900 --> 00:51.360
<i>There's nothing...</i>

00:52.030 --> 00:53.440
<i>I can...</i>

00:56.780 --> 00:58.620
<i>I know you can do it, Muichiro.</i>

00:58.620 --> 01:00.620
<i>Now, on your feet!</i>

01:01.660 --> 01:03.950
<i>Father...</i>

02:34.840 --> 02:40.010
EPISODE 8:
THE MU IN MUICHIRO

02:43.430 --> 02:45.100
<i>That's right.</i>

02:45.430 --> 02:47.890
<i>My father was a woodcutter.</i>

02:48.310 --> 02:50.060
<i>And as his son...</i>

02:50.520 --> 02:53.520
<i>I would help him cut down trees.</i>

03:02.070 --> 03:03.110
<i>I...</i>

03:08.120 --> 03:09.580
<i>I...</i>

03:09.580 --> 03:12.920
<i>liked helping my father work.</i>

03:18.170 --> 03:19.960
Mother, are you all right?

03:19.960 --> 03:23.340
Father's out getting you herbs
right now, so...

03:23.590 --> 03:24.930
Mother!

03:30.230 --> 03:32.190
<i>She's burning up.</i>

03:44.740 --> 03:46.620
Here, take my blanket.

03:46.620 --> 03:48.490
How's that, Mother?

03:50.790 --> 03:52.250
I'm cold.

03:55.630 --> 03:59.170
Father will be back soon, all right?

04:28.030 --> 04:29.080
<i>That day...</i>

04:30.240 --> 04:32.790
<i>I lost both my mother and father...</i>

04:33.910 --> 04:36.960
<i>people dear to me, at once.</i>

04:39.960 --> 04:43.050
<i>My parents died when I was ten.</i>

04:43.670 --> 04:46.090
<i>I found myself alone at ten.</i>

04:48.800 --> 04:50.350
Muichiro?

04:51.890 --> 04:53.930
<i>No, that's not right.</i>

04:53.930 --> 04:56.850
<i>I was 11 when I found myself alone.</i>

04:58.150 --> 04:59.360
<i>I...</i>

05:00.060 --> 05:02.110
<i>I had a twin.</i>

05:03.490 --> 05:07.360
<i>My brother's name was Yuichiro.</i>

05:11.160 --> 05:13.700
Compassion does no good for anyone.

05:13.700 --> 05:17.580
Doing something for others
won't get you anywhere.

05:18.120 --> 05:19.630
You're wrong.

05:19.630 --> 05:21.590
Whatever you do for others...

05:21.590 --> 05:25.340
comes around to help you,
as well, in the end.

05:25.340 --> 05:27.130
That's what Father said.

05:27.430 --> 05:32.390
You can't trust the word of a man
who died trying to help someone else.

05:33.520 --> 05:35.810
Why would you say that?

05:35.810 --> 05:38.060
It was for Mother's sake—

05:38.060 --> 05:41.860
As if some herbs
would've healed her in that state.

05:41.860 --> 05:43.400
It's beyond stupid.

05:43.780 --> 05:45.690
That's an awful thing to say, Brother!

05:46.150 --> 05:51.160
If he hadn't gone out in the middle of a storm,
we would've only lost Mother.

05:51.160 --> 05:54.700
Don't say things like that!
That's going too far!

05:55.120 --> 05:57.210
I'm only telling you how it is.

05:57.210 --> 06:00.790
Don't yell. It's too noisy.
You might attract some boars.

06:02.170 --> 06:05.210
The "mu" in Muichiro
stands for "incompetence."

06:05.590 --> 06:07.420
This conversation is meaningless.

06:07.840 --> 06:10.220
You can't change the past.

06:11.300 --> 06:15.350
The "mu" in Muichiro
stands for "meaningless."

06:22.020 --> 06:24.860
<i>My brother always spoke harshly.</i>

06:25.480 --> 06:27.610
<i>I have a feeling that, in a way...</i>

06:27.940 --> 06:30.610
<i>I was like him when I had amnesia.</i>

06:33.320 --> 06:35.620
<i>My life with my brother...</i>

06:35.620 --> 06:37.750
<i>was stifling.</i>

06:38.540 --> 06:41.620
<i>I was sure that he despised me...</i>

06:42.290 --> 06:45.380
<i>and I thought he was a cold person.</i>

06:46.710 --> 06:48.970
<i>The seasons changed...</i>

06:50.180 --> 06:52.010
<i>and it was spring.</i>

06:54.220 --> 06:57.020
I'm going to go fetch some water, okay?

06:57.680 --> 06:59.520
You still haven't gotten around to it?

07:23.880 --> 07:25.840
<i>She was so beautiful...</i>

07:26.880 --> 07:28.510
<i>that at first...</i>

07:28.510 --> 07:31.970
<i>I thought she was a white birch spirit.</i>

07:31.970 --> 07:35.970
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
SWORDSMITH VILLAGE ARC

07:35.970 --> 07:39.970
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
SWORDSMITH VILLAGE ARC

07:41.430 --> 07:42.810
<i>This person was...</i>

07:42.810 --> 07:44.730
<i>Master's wife...</i>

07:45.190 --> 07:46.610
<i>and she'd traveled...</i>

07:47.110 --> 07:49.860
<i>this far up the mountain to visit us.</i>

07:50.690 --> 07:51.860
<i>But...</i>

07:54.950 --> 07:56.490
<i>in the end...</i>

07:56.490 --> 08:01.120
<i>my brother just spewed his usual insults
and drove Lady Amane away.</i>

08:01.870 --> 08:05.380
Can you believe it? She says
we're descended from swordsmen!

08:05.670 --> 08:10.510
Descendants of an amazing swordsman who used
something called "First Breathing" no less!

08:10.880 --> 08:12.340
What do I care?

08:12.340 --> 08:13.840
Wash the rice already.

08:13.840 --> 08:16.010
Listen! Let's become swordsmen!

08:16.430 --> 08:19.640
I can't believe that demons
actually exist in this world...

08:20.010 --> 08:22.180
but if we can do something to help...

08:22.180 --> 08:23.230
Listen!

08:23.230 --> 08:26.270
Let's save the people who are suffering
because of those demons!

08:26.560 --> 08:27.480
I bet you and I can—

08:42.040 --> 08:44.660
What the hell do you think you can do?

08:44.960 --> 08:48.130
Someone who can't even cook rice
on his own, become a swordsman?

08:48.130 --> 08:49.630
Save others?

08:49.630 --> 08:51.920
Give me a break, will you?

08:51.920 --> 08:55.380
Seriously, you're exactly
like Father and Mother, aren't you?

08:55.380 --> 08:58.970
You're too optimistic!
How does your mind even work?

08:58.970 --> 09:03.020
Just like Mother, who worked without telling us
she was unwell until she collapsed!

09:03.310 --> 09:06.190
Just like Father, who went out
in a storm to find herbs!

09:06.640 --> 09:07.730
After all...

09:08.100 --> 09:10.270
After all I did to try to stop him!

09:10.270 --> 09:13.820
After I begged Mother to rest
over and over!

09:13.820 --> 09:16.400
You know who can help others?

09:16.700 --> 09:18.820
Only the chosen ones!

09:19.160 --> 09:23.580
Our ancestors may have been swordsmen,
but what can kids like us do?

09:23.870 --> 09:25.210
Want me to tell you?

09:25.210 --> 09:26.540
What it is we can do?

09:26.540 --> 09:28.210
This is what you and I can do...

09:28.540 --> 09:30.590
Die like dogs and die in vain!

09:30.920 --> 09:33.460
Because we're Father
and Mother's children!

09:33.800 --> 09:36.010
We're only going to be used
by that woman!

09:36.010 --> 09:38.090
There's no way
she's not plotting something!

09:38.590 --> 09:41.220
We're never gonna talk
about this again! Got that?

09:41.220 --> 09:43.720
Now hurry up and get dinner ready!

09:49.560 --> 09:51.400
<i>After that...</i>

09:52.190 --> 09:54.860
<i>we stopped speaking to each other.</i>

09:55.690 --> 09:58.740
<i>Except for the one time we fought...</i>

09:58.740 --> 10:01.950
<i>when my brother hurled water
at Lady Amane...</i>

10:01.950 --> 10:03.740
<i>who continued to visit us.</i>

10:36.940 --> 10:38.440
<i>Then, summer came.</i>

10:38.780 --> 10:41.200
<i>It was hot that summer...</i>

10:41.200 --> 10:43.870
<i>and my brother and I
were always irritable.</i>

10:44.410 --> 10:48.080
<i>It was hot even at night,
and the cicadas were singing.</i>

11:34.500 --> 11:36.090
Oh, hell...

11:36.090 --> 11:38.340
Just a couple of brats?

11:39.800 --> 11:40.920
Well, whatever.

11:40.920 --> 11:42.090
Muichiro!

11:49.140 --> 11:51.890
- Ow! Ow!
- Brother! Brother!

11:59.860 --> 12:01.990
Shut up! Shut up!

12:02.570 --> 12:04.070
Not a sound.

12:04.570 --> 12:07.530
A couple of poor woodcutters like you...

12:07.530 --> 12:10.200
You're totally useless anyway.

12:10.620 --> 12:13.370
Since it doesn't matter
whether you exist or not...

12:13.670 --> 12:17.040
your lives are that worthless!

12:20.260 --> 12:21.710
<i>At that moment...</i>

12:22.170 --> 12:23.970
<i>all I could see was red.</i>

12:24.970 --> 12:27.930
<i>It was a violent rage I'd never before felt...</i>

12:28.350 --> 12:33.230
<i>that seemed to be boiling over
from the pit of my stomach.</i>

12:34.230 --> 12:37.810
<i>I really don't remember
what happened next.</i>

12:37.810 --> 12:40.610
<i>A monstrous roar... I couldn't believe...</i>

12:41.820 --> 12:46.660
<i>that it was coming from my own throat,
from my own mouth.</i>

12:56.040 --> 12:57.460
<i>The next thing I knew...</i>

12:57.460 --> 12:59.630
<i>the demon was on the brink of death.</i>

12:59.630 --> 13:03.210
<i>But apparently, it couldn't die
even with its head smashed in...</i>

13:03.210 --> 13:04.920
<i>so it was suffering.</i>

13:16.560 --> 13:18.610
<i>Soon after, the sun came up...</i>

13:19.610 --> 13:22.190
<i>and the demon turned to dust
and vanished.</i>

13:22.530 --> 13:25.360
<i>But I truly couldn't care less about that.</i>

13:30.280 --> 13:34.250
<i>All I wanted was to go to Yuichiro...</i>

13:34.580 --> 13:38.210
<i>but suddenly,
my body was as heavy as lead.</i>

13:38.210 --> 13:43.300
<i>It took me what felt like ages
just to reach the house right in front of me.</i>

13:50.050 --> 13:55.600
Please... I beg of you...

13:56.310 --> 13:57.390
Brother...

13:57.940 --> 14:00.400
Are you alive? Brother!

14:14.740 --> 14:20.210
Dear God... Buddha...

14:20.210 --> 14:21.960
Please...

14:23.000 --> 14:24.960
Please...

14:24.960 --> 14:29.340
just save my brother.

14:35.890 --> 14:40.520
My brother... is not like me.

14:40.520 --> 14:44.570
He's a kindhearted kid.

14:44.570 --> 14:49.550
He says he wants to help others...

14:49.550 --> 14:53.120
but I got in his way.

14:54.410 --> 14:56.240
I'm...

14:56.620 --> 14:58.450
the only one...

14:58.450 --> 15:00.080
to blame.

15:00.460 --> 15:03.040
If you're going to punish anyone...

15:03.040 --> 15:04.920
then...

15:04.920 --> 15:07.260
let it be only me.

15:09.300 --> 15:12.800
I've always known.

15:13.760 --> 15:15.640
The truth is...

15:16.760 --> 15:20.600
the "mu" in Muichiro...

15:29.780 --> 15:30.950
...stands for...

15:31.700 --> 15:33.450
"infinity."

15:34.410 --> 15:35.700
<i>Mist Breathing...</i>

15:36.120 --> 15:37.580
<i>Fourth Form...</i>

15:44.460 --> 15:46.380
<i>Shifting Flow Slash!</i>

15:49.590 --> 15:50.510
Kotetsu!

15:51.170 --> 15:52.590
Mr. Tokito...

15:52.590 --> 15:55.090
Don't worry about me.

15:55.090 --> 15:57.010
Save...

15:57.350 --> 15:58.810
Mr. Haganezuka!

15:58.810 --> 16:00.140
Protect...

16:00.640 --> 16:02.230
the swords!

16:04.770 --> 16:05.980
Right.

16:09.730 --> 16:12.740
<i>Damn him! Damn him!</i>

16:12.740 --> 16:14.530
<i>This man!</i>

16:14.530 --> 16:16.700
<i>This human!</i>

16:17.240 --> 16:22.120
<i>He still won't stop honing
after all I've done to him!</i>

16:22.120 --> 16:22.410
UPPER FIVE

16:22.410 --> 16:28.380
<i>Even when I destroyed his eye,
he kept honing without so much as crying out!</i>
UPPER FIVE

16:31.420 --> 16:32.920
<i>I know!</i>

16:32.920 --> 16:35.510
<i>If I tell him I'm going to kill that one...</i>

16:40.010 --> 16:42.430
<i>He escaped the Water Prison Pot!</i>

16:42.980 --> 16:44.810
<i>How on earth?</i>

16:44.810 --> 16:46.350
<i>I have no idea!</i>

16:46.350 --> 16:50.940
<i>I thought his death was imminent,
so my mind wasn't on him at all!</i>

16:51.730 --> 16:53.990
<i>No, wait a second.</i>

16:53.990 --> 16:58.700
<i>On the other hand,
that shows how focused I was!</i>

16:58.700 --> 16:58.990
FIVE
<i>On the other hand,
that shows how focused I was!</i>

16:58.990 --> 16:59.330
FIVE

16:59.330 --> 17:00.330
<i>Yes!</i>
FIVE

17:01.040 --> 17:01.830
<i>Hmm?</i>

17:01.830 --> 17:05.160
<i>Hold on, hold on, hold on!
What is that mark?</i>

17:05.790 --> 17:08.960
<i>According to the information
Lord Muzan gave me,</i>

17:08.960 --> 17:13.050
<i>that child with the earrings
also has a similar mark!</i>

17:13.050 --> 17:15.430
<i>No! Never mind that!</i>

17:15.430 --> 17:18.720
<i>How can you stand there
looking so nonchalant?</i>

17:18.720 --> 17:23.560
<i>My attack should've paralyzed your body!</i>

17:24.140 --> 17:28.690
<i>How were you able to summon
even greater speed to wound me?</i>

17:31.690 --> 17:33.360
<i>Octopus Vase Hell!</i>

17:34.860 --> 17:36.280
Lord Tokito!

17:40.450 --> 17:42.200
Hyo, hyo!

17:42.200 --> 17:45.830
How do you like how springy
this octopus flesh is?

17:45.830 --> 17:47.960
Surely you can't slash this!

17:56.550 --> 17:58.890
<i>Still honing that sword!</i>

17:58.890 --> 18:00.350
<i>Is he a fool?</i>

18:00.350 --> 18:02.470
<i>He's not in his right mind.</i>

18:02.470 --> 18:04.770
<i>But that's sublime in its own way!</i>

18:04.770 --> 18:08.230
<i>That swordsmith can wait!
First, the Hashira!</i>

18:08.520 --> 18:11.820
I wasn't really trying earlier!

18:11.820 --> 18:16.110
This time, I'm going to crush him
for sure, then absorb him!

18:17.700 --> 18:18.660
Hyo?

18:22.830 --> 18:23.950
You made...

18:24.370 --> 18:26.200
this sword for me.

18:27.370 --> 18:28.330
DESTROYER
OF DEMONS

18:28.870 --> 18:30.080
Thank you...

18:30.420 --> 18:31.840
Mr. Kanamori.

18:33.500 --> 18:35.260
N-No!

18:35.260 --> 18:36.550
All I did was...

18:36.550 --> 18:40.430
follow the instructions
of your first swordsmith!

18:41.180 --> 18:42.930
That's right.

18:42.930 --> 18:47.100
It was Mr. Tetsuido
who forged my first sword for me.

18:47.100 --> 18:49.690
He passed away from heart disease.

18:51.230 --> 18:55.190
<i>No matter how many times you replace
your sword, it won't change a thing!</i>

19:00.950 --> 19:02.200
<i>Ah...</i>

19:02.200 --> 19:04.030
<i>It fits like a glove.</i>

19:06.450 --> 19:09.210
I worry about you, boy.

19:10.420 --> 19:15.170
Who will ever understand
what you're going through?

19:15.590 --> 19:18.970
How you have no time for anything else?

19:19.470 --> 19:23.140
How you're barely getting by
and have no breathing room?

19:23.140 --> 19:27.850
How anxious you are
because you can't remember anything?

19:27.850 --> 19:30.980
And how you strive so hard
that you vomit blood?

19:31.690 --> 19:34.650
Who will ever understand all that?

19:35.230 --> 19:40.860
Whenever I see the swords you've used,
it brings tears to my eyes.

19:41.820 --> 19:44.570
I won't be around much longer.

19:44.570 --> 19:47.660
Not that I want to cling to life at my age...

19:48.660 --> 19:53.580
but I just can't stop worrying about you.

19:55.170 --> 19:56.340
<i>Mr. Tetsuido...</i>

19:56.670 --> 19:57.380
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

19:57.380 --> 19:58.170
DESTROYER
OF DEMONS

19:58.170 --> 19:58.550
<i>I know I made you worry.</i>
DESTROYER
OF DEMONS

19:58.550 --> 19:59.880
<i>I know I made you worry.</i>

20:00.510 --> 20:01.470
<i>But I'm...</i>

20:02.930 --> 20:05.220
<i>all right now!</i>

20:06.430 --> 20:07.850
<i>Mist Breathing...</i>

20:08.180 --> 20:09.310
<i>Fifth Form...</i>

20:10.930 --> 20:12.690
<i>Sea of Clouds and Haze!</i>

20:17.770 --> 20:20.280
Well, that was some rapid-fire chopping,

20:20.280 --> 20:23.950
but you don't seem to be able
to keep up with my vase's speed!

20:24.740 --> 20:25.950
Are you sure about that?

20:26.240 --> 20:27.370
What?

20:27.990 --> 20:30.750
It looks like your senses
have totally dulled.

20:30.750 --> 20:33.080
It's because you've lived
for hundreds of years.

20:35.750 --> 20:37.540
I'm going to slash you next time.

20:37.540 --> 20:41.880
I have better things to do
than playing your stupid vase game all day.

20:43.090 --> 20:46.090
Don't underestimate me, you brat!

20:52.520 --> 20:54.230
DESTROY

20:54.230 --> 20:55.520
<i>Muichiro...</i>
DESTROY

20:57.060 --> 21:00.070
<i>Sorry I couldn't be more gentle with you.</i>

21:01.780 --> 21:03.190
<i>I could just never...</i>

21:03.190 --> 21:05.280
<i>afford to be that way.</i>

21:06.320 --> 21:08.410
<i>Being kind to others...</i>

21:09.370 --> 21:12.410
<i>is one more thing
that only the chosen ones can do.</i>

21:13.450 --> 21:14.580
<i>But...</i>

21:14.580 --> 21:16.170
<i>Muichiro...</i>

21:16.920 --> 21:19.380
<i>no matter how virtuous
a life you may lead,</i>

21:19.840 --> 21:24.630
<i>neither the gods nor Buddha
will protect you in the end.</i>

21:24.630 --> 21:27.890
<i>That's why I thought
I had to protect you.</i>

21:28.640 --> 21:29.850
<i>Muichiro...</i>

21:30.260 --> 21:33.020
<i>You're not like me.</i>

21:35.520 --> 21:38.190
<i>For the sake of someone
other than yourself...</i>

21:40.150 --> 21:41.820
<i>you can exert infinite strength.</i>

21:47.740 --> 21:50.120
<i>You're one of the chosen ones!</i>

23:21.040 --> 23:21.500

Nowadays, Ms. Kanroji's favorite foods

Both modern and fashionable
Western-style foods!
