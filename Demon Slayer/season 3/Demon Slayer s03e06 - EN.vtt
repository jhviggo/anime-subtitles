WEBVTT

00:03.410 --> 00:04.910
You're sure it's this way?

00:05.210 --> 00:07.040
Yes! We're almost there!

00:10.000 --> 00:11.170
There he is.

00:13.300 --> 00:14.510
Mr. Kanamori!

00:23.890 --> 00:26.600
Oh! He slashed it in the blink of an eye!

00:29.940 --> 00:32.610
Lord Tokito! Thank goodness!

00:32.610 --> 00:34.110
Mr. Kanamori!

00:34.570 --> 00:36.490
Young Kotetsu!

00:36.820 --> 00:38.950
Thank goodness you're safe!

00:38.950 --> 00:41.780
To be honest,
I thought you'd be dead by now!

00:41.780 --> 00:43.950
HYOTTOKO
Same here, Mr. Kanamori!

00:43.950 --> 00:46.410
So, you're Kanamori?
HYOTTOKO

00:46.410 --> 00:46.790
HYOTTOKO

00:47.830 --> 00:50.670
Mr. Tokito, this is Mr. Kanamori.

00:51.460 --> 00:54.170
Do you have a sword for me?

00:54.840 --> 00:56.050
Give it to me now.

00:56.380 --> 00:57.470
Oh my!

00:57.470 --> 00:58.550
Look at this!

00:58.550 --> 01:00.640
It's quite badly chipped!

01:01.390 --> 01:03.720
That's why I came to the village.

01:04.020 --> 01:05.890
I see! I see!

01:06.230 --> 01:09.350
I do have a sword ready for you,
so let me give it to you right away!

01:10.100 --> 01:12.320
You don't waste time, do you?

01:12.320 --> 01:15.490
I'm happy for you!
You should be thankful!

01:15.780 --> 01:18.360
Tanjiro asked me to take care of it.

01:18.360 --> 01:20.240
Your sword, that is.

01:20.240 --> 01:23.620
He also said I should be
understanding toward you.

01:24.450 --> 01:26.120
Tanjiro?

01:26.870 --> 01:28.870
Tanjiro said it, huh?

01:29.250 --> 01:33.090
So, I checked up
on the first swordsmith who served you—

01:33.090 --> 01:34.630
Mr. Kanamori! Mr. Kanamori!

01:34.630 --> 01:38.800
We have to head to Mr. Haganezuka's!
If he's under attack by those demons—

01:38.800 --> 01:40.220
Oh, that's right!

01:40.590 --> 01:44.010
Come on, I'll show you
the way to my work shed!

03:15.810 --> 03:20.990
EPISODE 5:
BRIGHT RED SWORD

03:21.820 --> 03:23.360
I'm worried about the village!

03:23.990 --> 03:26.120
Since you're a Hashira,
I want you to take that sword...

03:26.120 --> 03:29.240
and go to their aid as soon as possible!

03:30.120 --> 03:31.120
It's that shed over there!

03:31.500 --> 03:34.250
Thank goodness!
I don't see any fish monsters!

03:34.250 --> 03:36.130
I was working in that shed!

03:36.130 --> 03:39.130
The sword I'm supposed to give you
is inside, too!

03:39.130 --> 03:42.510
Please take it
and rush to where the chief is!

03:43.170 --> 03:44.380
No, I can't.

03:44.760 --> 03:46.220
Huh? What's that?

03:48.260 --> 03:49.970
Ouch! You're so annoying!

03:50.770 --> 03:51.980
It's here.

03:58.150 --> 03:59.070
Hyo!

04:00.570 --> 04:01.440
Huh?

04:13.540 --> 04:16.710
I'm impressed that you noticed me!

04:19.460 --> 04:23.630
But wait, you're a Hashira.

04:25.880 --> 04:26.720
UPPER FIVE

04:26.720 --> 04:29.390
Hyo, hyo, hyo!
UPPER FIVE

04:29.390 --> 04:29.890
UPPER

04:29.890 --> 04:33.390
Is this rundown shed
that important to you?
UPPER

04:35.190 --> 04:38.900
What is it that you're being
so secretive about, I wonder.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.400
Hyo, hyo!

04:42.280 --> 04:43.530
Enemy attack!

04:43.530 --> 04:44.860
Demons!

04:44.860 --> 04:46.320
Enemy attack!

04:46.780 --> 04:48.990
Protect the leaders of each clan!

04:49.280 --> 04:51.410
Take out the Hashira's swords!

04:51.700 --> 04:52.910
Help the chief get away!

05:00.920 --> 05:02.590
Tetsugorou!

05:02.920 --> 05:03.960
Watch out!

05:03.960 --> 05:06.840
Those monsters' claws
are as sharp as blades!

05:06.840 --> 05:09.590
Take cover inside the buildings for now!

05:10.550 --> 05:13.310
No good! Get back! Get back!

05:22.690 --> 05:24.230
Whoa! A Hashira showed up!

05:24.940 --> 05:26.740
Sorry I'm late!

05:26.740 --> 05:29.200
I'll take care of this right away, everyone!

05:31.870 --> 05:33.160
Wow!

05:33.160 --> 05:34.700
- So fast!
- So strong!

05:35.120 --> 05:37.500
I'd forgotten because she's so cute...

05:37.790 --> 05:40.670
but the Hashira sure are strong, huh?

05:41.170 --> 05:42.290
The chief!

05:42.290 --> 05:44.550
Please look after the chief!

06:01.860 --> 06:03.730
Chief!

06:09.200 --> 06:11.450
Ch-Ch-Chief...

06:14.450 --> 06:15.700
Chief!

06:16.870 --> 06:22.380
The Demon Slayer guards
who were stationed here have been killed.

06:22.670 --> 06:25.630
As the most highly-skilled person
in the village, Chief...

06:26.000 --> 06:28.630
I can't let you die!

06:30.010 --> 06:32.090
This monster is...

06:32.090 --> 06:33.760
way too big!

06:33.760 --> 06:35.680
My attacks have no effect!

06:35.680 --> 06:37.770
And it's abnormally quick!

06:42.980 --> 06:43.400
DESTROYER
OF DEMONS

06:43.400 --> 06:45.440
You shouldn't move!
DESTROYER
OF DEMONS

06:45.440 --> 06:48.360
You likely have internal injuries!
DESTROYER
OF DEMONS

06:48.360 --> 06:50.650
L-Lady Kanroji!

06:52.360 --> 06:54.320
<i>What kind of sword is that?</i>

06:54.320 --> 06:57.040
<i>Did the chief...
Did Lord Tecchin forge it?</i>

06:57.370 --> 07:01.040
<i>I've heard the rumors,
but how odd it looks!</i>

07:04.210 --> 07:05.670
<i>Love Breathing...</i>

07:06.250 --> 07:07.590
<i>First Form...</i>

07:13.010 --> 07:15.470
<i>Shivers Of First Love!</i>

07:20.640 --> 07:25.520
My heart would never flutter for those
who needlessly hurt others!

07:37.080 --> 07:38.540
Lord Tecchin!

07:43.000 --> 07:45.120
Are you all right, Lord Tecchin?

07:45.420 --> 07:47.000
Stay with me!

07:48.340 --> 07:50.590
Lord Tecchin! Can you hear me?

07:51.210 --> 07:57.140
Here I am in the arms of a young,
beautiful girl! I'm on cloud nine!

07:59.060 --> 08:02.180
Oh my! Lord Tecchin! Please!

08:02.520 --> 08:04.940
I fell on my head, too!

08:04.940 --> 08:05.690
What?

08:05.690 --> 08:07.730
Please hold my hand!

08:07.730 --> 08:09.360
Oh dear, forgive me!

08:09.360 --> 08:10.650
Are you okay?

08:10.650 --> 08:11.690
You back off!

08:12.440 --> 08:14.780
Wh-What a relief.

08:19.660 --> 08:20.870
<i>What...</i>

08:21.290 --> 08:23.000
<i>What is this?</i>

08:23.580 --> 08:24.960
<i>This scent?</i>

08:25.290 --> 08:27.130
Stop trying to flee...

08:27.540 --> 08:29.040
like a pesky gnat!

08:45.890 --> 08:47.350
<i>Now I remember.</i>

08:47.350 --> 08:50.730
<i>I was knocked out
by that demon with the fan!</i>

08:51.070 --> 08:53.900
<i>Nezuko came to before I did!</i>

09:01.200 --> 09:03.370
Curses! Could they be any slower?

09:03.370 --> 09:05.620
Karaku! Blast it away!

09:05.620 --> 09:06.710
Right!

09:11.460 --> 09:13.840
I was just about to do that anyway!

09:18.010 --> 09:20.090
<i>Think! You've got to think!</i>

09:20.600 --> 09:23.260
<i>How to inflict massive damage
on the enemy!</i>

09:23.510 --> 09:26.480
<i>An attack that they can't
recover from right away!</i>

09:26.810 --> 09:28.060
Damn.

09:30.810 --> 09:31.060
UPPER FOUR

09:31.060 --> 09:32.570
Hey, brat...
UPPER FOUR

09:32.570 --> 09:33.650
Die!
UPPER FOUR

09:33.650 --> 09:33.940
Die!

09:37.320 --> 09:39.070
It's all over for you now!

09:47.960 --> 09:53.040
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
SWORDSMITH VILLAGE ARC

09:53.060 --> 09:58.050
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
SWORDSMITH VILLAGE ARC

10:06.760 --> 10:09.560
Now that's what you call a fine view!

10:09.930 --> 10:11.020
All right...

10:11.020 --> 10:14.400
now there's nowhere for you
to scurry around and hide!

10:16.310 --> 10:18.320
Dammit! The rubble!

10:18.650 --> 10:20.360
Nezuko, it's okay!

10:20.360 --> 10:21.820
I'd never abandon you!

10:21.820 --> 10:24.700
Let go of my sword!
I'll clear away the rubble, okay?

10:25.240 --> 10:26.700
Nezuko! Stop it!

10:26.700 --> 10:28.370
You're going to cut your fingers!

10:30.330 --> 10:32.830
It certainly blew up completely.

10:33.620 --> 10:37.340
Once this smoke clears,
it will spell their demise.

10:39.710 --> 10:40.710
Nezuko!

10:41.010 --> 10:43.050
Stop! You have to stop!

10:49.890 --> 10:50.930
Hyo, hyo!

10:51.600 --> 10:55.900
A pleasure to meet you!
My name is Gyokko.

10:55.900 --> 10:59.440
Before I kill you,
might I ask for a minute of your time?

10:59.940 --> 11:01.570
Why are you closing in on me?

11:01.570 --> 11:04.200
Because we'd be scared on our own.

11:04.990 --> 11:11.450
I'd be delighted to show my artwork
to my three guests tonight!

11:12.450 --> 11:14.080
Artwork?

11:14.080 --> 11:16.250
What are you talking about?

11:17.670 --> 11:20.500
Now then, let me start with this piece!

11:31.430 --> 11:35.230
Behold, "Death Throes of the Smiths"!

11:37.560 --> 11:39.270
Please take a look!

11:39.270 --> 11:41.150
First, those hands!

11:41.150 --> 11:45.110
The hallmark of a swordsmith,
those thick, blister-ridden, soiled hands!

11:45.110 --> 11:49.370
I intentionally pushed them
to the forefront!

11:49.950 --> 11:52.370
Lord Kongouji! Mr. Tetsuo!

11:52.910 --> 11:54.450
Mr. Hagaike!

11:54.450 --> 11:55.790
Koutarou!

11:56.210 --> 11:58.170
Uncle Tetsuhiro!

11:58.500 --> 11:59.460
Yes!

11:59.460 --> 12:01.590
You're absolutely right!

12:01.590 --> 12:08.260
For this piece, I used five swordsmiths
to lavish, extravagant effect!

12:11.390 --> 12:14.890
I didn't expect you
to be this moved!

12:14.890 --> 12:17.980
Moreover, I've truly brought out
their swordsmith qualities...

12:17.980 --> 12:20.070
by piercing them with swords!

12:20.400 --> 12:26.740
I left these hyottoko masks on
to juxtapose emptiness and absurdity.

12:26.740 --> 12:30.660
Needless to say,
this, too, was a deliberate choice!

12:30.660 --> 12:33.030
And this is the best part!

12:33.030 --> 12:36.330
Just twist the sword like so, and...

12:39.540 --> 12:42.250
Stop it!

12:47.670 --> 12:49.130
What do you think?

12:49.130 --> 12:51.590
Isn't it marvelous?

12:51.590 --> 12:54.970
I've reproduced their death throes!

12:54.970 --> 12:56.310
Hey.

12:56.600 --> 12:58.270
You'd better knock it off...

12:58.270 --> 12:59.940
you piece of crap.

13:04.230 --> 13:05.150
Hyo!

13:12.370 --> 13:15.290
I'm not done describing my artwork!

13:16.120 --> 13:19.250
Kindly hear me out to the end.

13:20.040 --> 13:22.750
<i>It can teleport from one vase to another.</i>

13:23.330 --> 13:24.590
<i>I see.</i>

13:25.090 --> 13:28.840
What I especially take pride in
is the vase's—

13:29.130 --> 13:30.840
<i>I can barely feel it.</i>

13:34.930 --> 13:36.680
<i>It got away again.</i>

13:36.680 --> 13:38.430
<i>It can move fast.</i>

13:38.850 --> 13:40.890
<i>Now it's over there.</i>

13:40.890 --> 13:42.690
<i>Those vases pop up out of nowhere.</i>

13:43.020 --> 13:45.400
You have a lot of gall, slashing it!

13:45.400 --> 13:47.230
My vase!

13:47.230 --> 13:48.570
My art!

13:48.570 --> 13:50.950
You have no eye for beauty,
you damn ape!

13:51.860 --> 13:54.570
<i>How are those vases spawned?</i>

13:55.070 --> 13:59.040
You bastards with muscles
where your brains should be...

13:59.040 --> 14:02.870
Clearly, you lack the ability
to appreciate my artwork!

14:02.870 --> 14:04.710
Which, in a way, is fine!

14:05.210 --> 14:06.290
<i>No...</i>

14:06.290 --> 14:08.840
<i>but since it's so intent on fleeing,</i>

14:08.840 --> 14:11.090
<i>then unlike that clone demon...</i>

14:11.760 --> 14:14.470
<i>beheading this one will kill it.</i>

14:19.310 --> 14:22.230
<i>Thousand Needle Fish Kill!</i>

14:24.350 --> 14:25.270
Mr. Tokito!

14:32.320 --> 14:33.530
Young Kotetsu!

14:41.450 --> 14:42.660
- Lord Tokito!
- Lord Tokito!

14:43.160 --> 14:45.670
You're getting in the way, so go hide.

14:46.790 --> 14:48.130
I'm sorry!

14:48.540 --> 14:50.170
I... I...

14:57.550 --> 14:59.060
Hyo, hyo, hyo!

14:59.060 --> 15:03.060
Look at you, riddled with needles...
A comical sight, indeed!

15:03.060 --> 15:04.850
How do you like it?

15:04.850 --> 15:09.320
The poison must slowly be numbing
your limbs, right?

15:09.320 --> 15:13.820
So very comical!
You saved some worthless lives...

15:13.820 --> 15:17.450
and now you're going to die
in a worthless place.

15:17.450 --> 15:21.830
So worthless, it doesn't matter
whether they exist or not.

15:22.160 --> 15:25.330
<i>Because your lives are worthless!</i>

15:26.750 --> 15:27.960
<i>Who's that?</i>

15:28.330 --> 15:29.960
<i>I can't remember.</i>

15:30.920 --> 15:33.920
<i>I think someone said
the same thing to me years ago.</i>

15:34.590 --> 15:36.340
<i>Who was it?</i>

15:37.720 --> 15:40.350
<i>It was summer. It was hot.</i>

15:41.180 --> 15:42.850
<i>We'd left the door open.</i>

15:43.310 --> 15:48.650
<i>I guess because it was too hot,
the cicadas were buzzing really loud.</i>

15:48.650 --> 15:49.900
Hyo, hyo!

15:49.900 --> 15:54.360
Still, you are a Hashira,
even looking like that.

15:54.360 --> 15:58.160
What kind of artwork should I produce?
Oh, I'm giddy!

15:58.320 --> 15:59.320
DESTROY

15:59.820 --> 16:01.120
Shut up.

16:01.120 --> 16:03.830
It's all your talk that's worthless.

16:14.420 --> 16:16.090
<i>Blood Demon Art...</i>

16:16.090 --> 16:18.720
<i>Water Prison Pot!</i>

16:19.260 --> 16:21.890
Death by suffocation is rather stylish.

16:21.890 --> 16:23.510
Beautiful!

16:23.510 --> 16:28.350
And that chilling feeling of a blade
pressed against your neck...

16:28.350 --> 16:31.360
Now that's simply sublime!

16:34.230 --> 16:36.440
<i>It's no good. I can't slash it.</i>

16:36.860 --> 16:40.950
I just stopped a Demon Slayer's
greatest weapon. His breathing.

16:41.280 --> 16:46.040
I can barely contain myself,
just imagining your face twisted in agony!

16:46.040 --> 16:46.910
Hyo, hyo!

16:47.370 --> 16:51.830
Obliterating this village will be
a devastating blow to you Demon Slayers.

16:52.290 --> 16:54.710
Once we've brought
the Demon Slayers to their knees,

16:54.710 --> 16:58.010
even Ubuyashiki's head
will be within reach!

17:00.470 --> 17:01.390
Nezuko!

17:01.390 --> 17:04.390
Please let go of my sword! Nezuko!

17:12.360 --> 17:15.780
<i>The sword's ablaze with Nezuko's blood!</i>

17:17.320 --> 17:19.280
<i>The sword's changing color!</i>

17:20.610 --> 17:24.830
<i>The temperature's rising,
and my black sword is turning red!</i>

17:25.240 --> 17:27.330
<i>Enveloped in exploding blood!</i>

17:27.700 --> 17:28.830
<i>This is...</i>

17:32.630 --> 17:34.460
<i>Exploding Blood Sword!</i>

17:35.840 --> 17:38.090
<i>So, it turns red, right?</i>

17:38.550 --> 17:43.340
<i>A samurai's sword turns red
only during battle, right?</i>

17:43.890 --> 17:45.140
<i>What's this?</i>

17:45.140 --> 17:46.600
<i>Why is that?</i>

17:46.600 --> 17:48.270
<i>So mysterious!</i>

17:48.270 --> 17:51.770
<i>Even though normally,
it's pitch-black like obsidian...</i>

17:51.770 --> 17:52.850
<i>Who is that?</i>

17:53.190 --> 17:55.900
<i>It's so beautiful, isn't it?</i>

17:55.900 --> 17:57.190
<i>Who are you?</i>

17:58.190 --> 17:59.650
<i>Oh, right.</i>

17:59.650 --> 18:01.700
<i>This is an inherited memory.</i>

18:02.530 --> 18:04.370
<i>The samurai she's talking about...</i>

18:04.370 --> 18:07.330
<i>Could it be that swordsman
with the earrings?</i>

18:07.700 --> 18:11.000
<i>Was that swordsman's sword pitch-black?</i>

18:11.290 --> 18:13.080
<i>I've got a black sword just like his.</i>

18:13.460 --> 18:15.960
<i>And my own sword just turned red, too!</i>

18:16.380 --> 18:17.840
<i>It changed color!</i>

18:19.050 --> 18:23.090
<i>This sword turned red
thanks to the power of Nezuko's blood, so...</i>

18:23.430 --> 18:26.010
<i>even if it was through a different method
than that swordsman's,</i>

18:26.010 --> 18:29.100
<i>right now, my sword is just like his.</i>

18:29.600 --> 18:33.850
<i>You may think you've gotten stronger, but
there are always even more powerful demons!</i>

18:34.560 --> 18:38.230
<i>I'm only flesh and blood,
so my body is scarred and battered...</i>

18:39.190 --> 18:40.150
<i>but...</i>

18:40.150 --> 18:42.700
<i>every time, someone comes to my aid!</i>

18:42.700 --> 18:44.740
<i>They keep me alive!</i>

18:45.490 --> 18:47.740
<i>I have to meet their expectations!</i>

18:48.280 --> 18:52.250
<i>Everyone who's helped me out
has just one wish...</i>

18:52.250 --> 18:53.540
<i>just one desire!</i>

18:54.460 --> 18:56.250
<i>To defeat the demons!</i>

18:56.830 --> 18:59.250
<i>To protect human lives!</i>

19:04.840 --> 19:07.550
<i>I have to come through for them!</i>

19:09.810 --> 19:12.680
Even if you resort to cheap tricks,
you can't beat me.

19:12.980 --> 19:17.020
You can slash me,
but I won't feel a thing!

19:18.440 --> 19:19.980
<i>A burning blade.</i>

19:19.980 --> 19:21.280
<i>Raging Sword.</i>

19:22.240 --> 19:24.150
<i>Lord Muzan's memories.</i>

19:24.650 --> 19:25.490
UPPER FOUR

19:25.490 --> 19:29.160
<i>The sword of the swordsman
who drove Lord Muzan into a corner...</i>
UPPER FOUR

19:29.910 --> 19:32.000
<i>and nearly beheaded him!</i>

19:35.960 --> 19:38.210
<i>I see that swordsman in him.</i>

19:41.880 --> 19:43.880
<i>Hinokami Kagura...</i>

19:44.260 --> 19:46.090
<i>Sun Halo Dragon...</i>

20:06.240 --> 20:07.910
<i>Head Dance!</i>

20:26.720 --> 20:28.550
<i>I've been thinking about...</i>

20:28.890 --> 20:30.800
<i>that one blow all this time.</i>

20:31.760 --> 20:36.060
<i>The reason why I was able to cut off
Gyutaro's head with that blow.</i>

20:37.940 --> 20:40.520
<i>How I felt in that moment, my breathing...</i>

20:40.520 --> 20:42.020
<i>the way I exerted myself.</i>

20:43.020 --> 20:45.570
<i>The way my whole body felt
like it was on fire...</i>

20:45.570 --> 20:47.400
<i>and my forehead!</i>

20:48.490 --> 20:49.610
<i>Now I know.</i>

20:49.990 --> 20:51.410
<i>I can do it now!</i>

20:52.160 --> 20:53.790
<i>Just one more!</i>

20:53.790 --> 20:56.080
<i>I need to slash all four at once!</i>

20:56.370 --> 20:57.960
<i>Where's the last one?</i>

21:00.460 --> 21:02.960
<i>Genya! So you're okay!</i>

21:04.340 --> 21:04.630
UPPER FOUR

21:04.630 --> 21:06.800
<i>He beheaded the fourth demon!</i>
UPPER FOUR

21:06.800 --> 21:08.470
<i>That's great! That's great!</i>
UPPER FOUR

21:08.760 --> 21:09.880
<i>Was it simultaneous?</i>

21:09.880 --> 21:11.760
<i>If it was at the same time...</i>

21:11.760 --> 21:13.180
Genya—

21:21.520 --> 21:22.770
<i>Is that Genya?</i>

21:23.110 --> 21:25.320
<i>Why... does he look like that?</i>

21:26.480 --> 21:27.650
<i>It's like...</i>

21:29.150 --> 21:30.410
<i>It's like...</i>

23:01.040 --> 23:01.500
PART 5

23:02.790 --> 23:06.330
How do you sheathe that sword?

23:06.330 --> 23:07.920
How?

23:08.250 --> 23:10.380
Poison potato!

23:14.720 --> 23:16.680
I'm just kidding! I'm kidding!

23:20.180 --> 23:22.520
Wow! That's amazing!

23:23.690 --> 23:26.400
What, you really think
it's that amazing?

23:26.400 --> 23:28.150
It sure is!

23:28.150 --> 23:29.900
That's our Ms. Kanroji, all right!

23:29.900 --> 23:31.610
You sure about that?

23:31.610 --> 23:33.900
Then, maybe I'll show it to you
just one more time!

23:37.410 --> 23:39.410
That was amazing, Ms. Kanroji!

23:39.410 --> 23:40.910
You think so?

23:41.240 --> 23:44.210
Then, why don't I show you again
just one more time?

23:44.210 --> 23:46.290
Now, I'm only doing this for you, Tanjiro!

23:46.290 --> 23:47.790
Wait, first things first!

23:47.790 --> 23:50.960
Next, Episode 6,
"Aren't You Going to Become A Hashira?"

23:51.250 --> 23:52.710
There! There! There!

23:52.710 --> 23:54.720
Wow, amazing!
There! There! There!

23:54.720 --> 23:56.010
