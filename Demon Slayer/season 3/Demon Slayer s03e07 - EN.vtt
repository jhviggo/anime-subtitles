00:09.010 --> 00:10.130
Genya!

01:52.740 --> 01:57.910
EPISODE 6:
AREN'T YOU GOING TO BECOME A HASHIRA?

02:12.880 --> 02:13.880
Gen...

02:13.880 --> 02:15.130
ya...

02:18.390 --> 02:20.890
What kind of slashing attack was that?

02:20.890 --> 02:21.390
I can't regenerate!

02:21.390 --> 02:23.020
<i>The attack worked!</i>
I can't regenerate!

02:23.020 --> 02:23.430
The pain is scorching me!

02:23.430 --> 02:24.810
Calm down! You're pathetic!
The pain is scorching me!

02:24.810 --> 02:25.520
The pain is scorching me!

02:25.520 --> 02:25.940
It takes time, but we can regenerate!
The pain is scorching me!

02:25.940 --> 02:27.940
It takes time, but we can regenerate!

02:29.560 --> 02:31.570
<i>I don't know
what's going on with Genya,</i>

02:31.570 --> 02:34.070
<i>but I've figured something out
because he slashed one of them!</i>

02:34.400 --> 02:37.240
<i>Looks like even if we behead
all four at the same time,</i>

02:37.240 --> 02:40.080
<i>we can't finish them off
like we did Gyutaro!</i>

02:41.450 --> 02:45.330
<i>Attacking these four Emotion Demons
is pretty much pointless!</i>

02:46.580 --> 02:47.330
Nezuko!

02:49.500 --> 02:50.500
Nezuko!

02:55.880 --> 02:56.880
Nezuko!

03:00.260 --> 03:02.970
<i>Something's been bothering me all this time.</i>

03:05.060 --> 03:08.020
<i>Is it possible that their heads
aren't their vital spots?</i>

03:08.980 --> 03:10.360
<i>Something felt so off.</i>

03:10.900 --> 03:13.110
<i>That scent that I caught
for just an instant...</i>

03:13.570 --> 03:14.570
<i>Right.</i>

03:14.570 --> 03:15.820
<i>That was...</i>

03:16.190 --> 03:18.280
<i>the scent of a fifth demon!</i>

03:18.740 --> 03:20.200
<i>There's a fifth demon!</i>

03:20.870 --> 03:22.330
<i>I have to find it!</i>

03:22.660 --> 03:24.370
<i>The fifth demon's head's got to be...</i>

03:27.250 --> 03:28.920
Don't get so full of yourself!

03:29.210 --> 03:31.710
I'm the one who's going to defeat...

03:31.710 --> 03:32.920
an Upper Rank!

03:32.920 --> 03:33.880
Genya...

03:34.340 --> 03:38.050
You didn't defeat
Upper Six on your own!

03:38.050 --> 03:41.050
That's why you haven't become a Hashira!

03:41.050 --> 03:42.640
Uh, yeah, that's right!

03:42.930 --> 03:45.350
You can bet...

03:45.810 --> 03:47.520
that I'm going to...

03:47.520 --> 03:48.690
beat you to it!

03:48.690 --> 03:51.440
Genya! You're drooling, okay?
What's wrong?

03:51.440 --> 03:53.520
Not to mention, you're choking me!

03:54.900 --> 03:56.780
I'm the one who's going to become a Hashira!

03:57.320 --> 03:58.490
I see!

03:58.490 --> 03:59.780
I get it, sure!

03:59.780 --> 04:01.910
Nezuko and I will give you our full support!

04:01.910 --> 04:03.530
Let's give it our all, all three of us!

04:03.910 --> 04:04.910
Huh?

04:04.910 --> 04:07.040
I'm sure there's a fifth demon somewhere!

04:07.040 --> 04:09.750
I'll look for it,
so I want you to buy me some time!

04:09.750 --> 04:12.080
I know what you're up to!

04:12.080 --> 04:14.840
You're just making me
let my guard down, and—

04:16.130 --> 04:17.130
Huh?

04:20.430 --> 04:21.090
Look out!

04:27.220 --> 04:29.560
<i>The Anger Demon's revived already!</i>

04:29.850 --> 04:30.850
<i>Hurry!</i>

04:31.190 --> 04:31.900
Genya!

04:32.650 --> 04:34.900
I'll let you know
as soon as I've found the fifth demon,

04:34.900 --> 04:36.480
so keep these demons at bay!

04:37.860 --> 04:39.820
They've all regenerated, dammit!

04:41.570 --> 04:44.070
Whatever you do,
just don't slash Nezuko!

04:44.070 --> 04:45.740
Because she's my little sister!

04:46.910 --> 04:47.910
Uh...

04:54.670 --> 04:56.000
<i>Where's that fifth demon?</i>

04:59.380 --> 05:02.300
<i>I have to find it while Genya and Nezuko
are fending off the others!</i>

05:09.850 --> 05:10.730
<i>What's this?</i>

05:11.480 --> 05:13.810
<i>Thanks to the wind
created by that demon with the fan,</i>

05:13.810 --> 05:16.150
<i>the sulphur smell
from the hot springs is gone!</i>

05:17.110 --> 05:18.400
<i>Find it!</i>

05:19.030 --> 05:20.780
<i>Concentrate!</i>

05:28.910 --> 05:30.750
It's all right!

05:30.750 --> 05:32.960
They'll never find me!

05:32.960 --> 05:34.580
It's all right!

05:34.580 --> 05:39.050
My four Emotions
will defeat those villains for me!

05:39.420 --> 05:40.420
<i>Found it!</i>

05:40.420 --> 05:42.720
<i>Found it! Found it! I found it!</i>

05:43.760 --> 05:44.970
Genya!

05:46.220 --> 05:47.140
Urogi!

05:49.930 --> 05:51.560
Go straight, northeast!

05:54.100 --> 05:56.690
The fifth demon's hiding itself
close to the ground!

06:03.320 --> 06:04.570
Genya!

06:05.030 --> 06:06.160
Go after it!

06:06.160 --> 06:07.370
I'll cover you!

06:07.370 --> 06:08.450
Northeast!

06:10.950 --> 06:12.950
<i>Crap, more lightning!</i>

06:16.250 --> 06:18.130
Nezuko! Go help Genya!

06:18.420 --> 06:21.460
Don't let the Lightning Demon
get in Genya's way!

06:22.630 --> 06:24.380
DESTROY

06:31.350 --> 06:32.810
<i>Don't let yourself get swept away!</i>

06:32.810 --> 06:35.270
<i>Stay in this spot, no matter what!</i>

06:36.640 --> 06:39.020
<i>This is bad! Here comes
a lightning attack, too!</i>

06:51.450 --> 06:54.200
Nezuko!

06:58.670 --> 07:01.340
Hyo, hyo, hyo!

07:02.250 --> 07:04.710
Is it excruciating?

07:05.050 --> 07:07.880
It must be excruciating!

07:09.390 --> 07:10.890
UPPER FIVE

07:13.640 --> 07:15.730
<i>So, it's the same everywhere?</i>

07:15.730 --> 07:17.390
Hyo, hyo, hyo!

07:18.190 --> 07:21.400
Not only are you unable
to unleash your breathing techniques,

07:21.400 --> 07:25.650
but you'll soon be drawing
your last breath in there, too!

07:29.070 --> 07:32.780
Hyo, hyo, hyo!

07:32.780 --> 07:34.990
That look of fake stoicism...

07:34.990 --> 07:37.040
How very sublime it is!

07:37.580 --> 07:42.040
My creative juices are simply gushing!

07:45.210 --> 07:46.380
Don't fight back.

07:46.920 --> 07:48.680
You're making me sad.

07:48.680 --> 07:49.430
Sekido...

07:49.430 --> 07:50.050
UPPER
FOUR

07:50.050 --> 07:52.680
I know! I'm going to crucify her—
UPPER
FOUR

08:02.980 --> 08:03.270
UPPER
FOUR

08:03.270 --> 08:04.190
<i>That youngster...</i>
UPPER
FOUR

08:04.860 --> 08:07.610
<i>Now he's even faster than before!</i>

08:07.610 --> 08:08.320
<i>No.</i>

08:08.780 --> 08:10.490
<i>Even from the moment I first met him...</i>

08:10.490 --> 08:12.490
<i>he's exceeded all of his reports!</i>

08:12.870 --> 08:15.990
<i>Those unbelievable reflexes!
His ability to adapt himself in combat!</i>

08:20.790 --> 08:24.000
<i>That explosive growth he displays
when he's on the brink!</i>

08:33.140 --> 08:34.180
<i>Damn!</i>

08:34.720 --> 08:36.430
<i>Karaku! Karaku!</i>

08:39.770 --> 08:41.640
You little punk!

08:44.940 --> 08:46.190
All right!

08:46.190 --> 08:49.070
Now I just gotta go
after that bullet-popping kid!

08:49.400 --> 08:50.280
Huh?

08:51.610 --> 08:52.320
Damn!

08:52.860 --> 08:54.450
I've been slashed!

08:54.950 --> 08:56.330
Damn you, punk!

08:56.830 --> 08:57.830
Genya!

08:58.240 --> 08:59.450
To your right!

08:59.450 --> 09:01.120
It's moving south!

09:01.120 --> 09:02.500
Search for it!

09:02.500 --> 09:04.920
<i>Jeez! I am searching for it!</i>

09:04.920 --> 09:07.000
<i>I've been searching for it all this time!</i>

09:07.380 --> 09:08.380
<i>A spell?</i>

09:08.380 --> 09:11.300
<i>I can't see it because of another spell?</i>

09:11.300 --> 09:13.640
<i>Crap! Crap! Crap!</i>

09:13.640 --> 09:14.890
<i>Where are you?</i>

09:14.890 --> 09:18.810
<i>The longer this goes on,
the closer I get to being depleted!</i>

09:23.060 --> 09:24.480
Turn west!

09:24.480 --> 09:25.520
More to the right!

09:25.520 --> 09:26.770
It's nearby!

09:26.770 --> 09:27.900
Down below!

09:28.820 --> 09:30.030
<i>Where are you?</i>

09:30.780 --> 09:31.570
<i>Where—</i>

09:31.570 --> 09:33.360
Genya! Down below!

09:33.360 --> 09:34.160
Huh?

09:39.950 --> 09:41.450
<i>Puny!</i>

09:45.170 --> 09:46.880
<i>That thing's beyond small!</i>

09:46.880 --> 09:48.210
<i>This is the main body?</i>

09:48.750 --> 09:50.050
<i>This thing?</i>

09:50.050 --> 09:53.170
<i>Dammit! How the hell am I supposed
to spot something like that?</i>

09:53.760 --> 09:56.340
<i>It's no bigger than a field mouse!</i>

09:56.340 --> 09:58.720
<i>Those other four are crazy strong!</i>

09:58.720 --> 10:01.560
<i>And this little squirt's the one
that's controlling them?</i>

10:01.560 --> 10:03.640
<i>Fighting off those four demons...</i>

10:03.640 --> 10:05.400
<i>while chasing after this mouse...</i>

10:05.690 --> 10:07.440
<i>What a pain in the ass!</i>

10:07.440 --> 10:10.900
<i>Now I can see why so many Demon Slayers
keep ending up dead!</i>

10:11.150 --> 10:13.070
<i>Don't mess with me!
You're so annoying!</i>

10:13.450 --> 10:15.450
<i>What am I supposed to do
with all this rage?</i>

10:17.450 --> 10:20.120
<i>All right! I can do this! I win!</i>

10:25.460 --> 10:27.580
<i>I-I can't slash it?</i>

10:27.580 --> 10:28.710
<i>I can't slash it!</i>

10:29.130 --> 10:30.090
<i>No way!</i>

10:30.340 --> 10:31.420
<i>No way!</i>

10:31.420 --> 10:34.920
<i>Look at it! Its head
is no bigger than my finger!</i>

10:42.430 --> 10:44.140
<i>No good!</i>

10:48.560 --> 10:49.980
<i>Oh, crap!</i>

10:49.980 --> 10:51.610
<i>I was too slow!</i>

10:52.150 --> 10:54.110
<i>I can't get out of the way!</i>

10:54.900 --> 10:56.650
<i>I'm going to die.</i>

10:56.990 --> 10:59.620
<i>I can't regenerate my head.</i>

11:01.030 --> 11:02.950
DESTROY

11:02.950 --> 11:04.870
<i>Big Brother...</i>
DESTROY

11:04.870 --> 11:06.710
DESTROY

11:08.290 --> 11:10.500
<i>I wanted to become a Hashira...</i>

11:10.840 --> 11:13.460
<i>so my big brother would acknowledge me.</i>

11:14.050 --> 11:15.510
<i>And...</i>

11:15.510 --> 11:17.590
<i>I also wanted to apologize...</i>

11:18.300 --> 11:20.600
<i>for what I said that day!</i>

11:21.930 --> 11:26.940
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
SWORDSMITH VILLAGE ARC

11:26.940 --> 11:31.940
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
SWORDSMITH VILLAGE ARC

11:34.690 --> 11:36.990
<i>My mom...</i>

11:36.990 --> 11:39.660
<i>was such a tiny person.</i>

11:40.120 --> 11:45.450
<i>I grew taller than her at an early age.</i>

11:46.870 --> 11:51.710
<i>My mother was always working,
from morning until night.</i>

11:52.420 --> 11:57.300
<i>Not once did I ever see her sleeping.</i>

11:59.510 --> 12:04.100
<i>My father was not only a big guy,
but he was also a good-for-nothing.</i>

12:04.720 --> 12:07.810
<i>He got stabbed to death
by someone with a grudge...</i>

12:07.810 --> 12:09.600
<i>which served him right.</i>

12:10.100 --> 12:11.520
<i>The old man...</i>

12:11.520 --> 12:14.980
<i>was always beating up
my mother and us kids.</i>

12:16.280 --> 12:18.700
<i>With that tiny body of hers...</i>

12:19.030 --> 12:22.200
<i>our mother would shield us
from our monstrous father...</i>

12:22.200 --> 12:25.290
<i>without so much as flinching.</i>

12:25.290 --> 12:27.660
<i>I think she was amazing.</i>

12:48.680 --> 12:51.140
Mom's late, isn't she?

12:52.190 --> 12:53.350
Huh?

12:56.980 --> 12:58.190
Genya...

12:58.190 --> 12:59.650
You can't sleep?

12:59.650 --> 13:01.360
Well, neither can you, Big Brother.

13:02.780 --> 13:04.870
I'm going to go look for Mom.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.660
Oh, I'll go with you.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.330
No.

13:08.330 --> 13:11.540
I'll go. I want you to stay home.

13:15.460 --> 13:16.800
We promised, remember?

13:18.920 --> 13:20.340
Okay.

13:25.180 --> 13:26.850
All right, I'm counting on you.

13:27.510 --> 13:28.560
Yeah.

13:40.490 --> 13:41.780
Big Brother!

13:42.200 --> 13:43.360
Big Brother!

13:43.950 --> 13:45.280
Big Brother!

13:45.990 --> 13:47.030
Big Brother!

13:49.290 --> 13:52.790
Hey, I didn't know you were all awake.

13:56.880 --> 13:59.880
You think Mom's okay?

14:00.260 --> 14:01.920
She's fine, all right?

14:01.920 --> 14:04.720
Big Brother went to look for her.

14:04.720 --> 14:05.970
But...

14:08.260 --> 14:12.140
She's never been this late before.

14:12.930 --> 14:15.900
The sun will be coming up soon.

14:16.230 --> 14:17.770
It's okay.

14:17.770 --> 14:20.570
You must be tired.
Go to sleep, all right?

14:20.570 --> 14:24.530
I bet Mom and Big Brother
will be back when you wake up.

14:28.030 --> 14:29.160
It's Mom!

14:29.450 --> 14:30.620
Mom!

14:30.870 --> 14:32.450
- Mom!
- Mom!

14:34.460 --> 14:35.330
Wait!

14:35.330 --> 14:36.170
Don't open the door!

14:36.170 --> 14:37.580
It might not be Mom—

14:49.470 --> 14:51.680
<i>Is it a beast? A stray dog?</i>

14:51.680 --> 14:53.430
<i>No! It's a wolf!</i>

14:54.730 --> 14:56.560
<i>I can't see it! It's too dark!</i>

14:57.270 --> 14:57.940
<i>It's so fast!</i>

14:59.770 --> 15:01.020
Genya! Run!

15:02.110 --> 15:02.900
Big Brother!

15:11.950 --> 15:12.950
Koto!

15:13.330 --> 15:14.160
Shuya!

15:15.160 --> 15:16.120
Hiroshi!

15:16.120 --> 15:17.000
Teiko!

15:17.000 --> 15:18.040
Sumi!

15:19.330 --> 15:21.540
P-Put pressure on your wounds!

15:22.380 --> 15:24.340
I'll go get the doctor right away!

15:24.340 --> 15:26.380
Just hang on a little longer!

15:33.310 --> 15:35.890
<i>Wh-What's going on?</i>

15:35.890 --> 15:38.060
<i>What was that thing just now?</i>

15:38.060 --> 15:39.270
<i>Where's Big Brother?</i>

15:39.270 --> 15:42.270
<i>No, right now, I have to see to their wounds!</i>

15:48.320 --> 15:49.160
Big Brother—

15:53.620 --> 15:54.910
Mom!

15:57.620 --> 16:01.460
Mom! Mom!
Why'd you do it?

16:01.460 --> 16:03.000
Why'd you do it?

16:03.000 --> 16:05.630
Why'd you kill our mother?

16:07.760 --> 16:09.590
You murderer!

16:10.260 --> 16:13.430
You murderer!

16:15.890 --> 16:19.980
<i>I'm sorry I said
those awful things, Big Brother.</i>

16:20.810 --> 16:22.190
<i>It's all...</i>

16:22.520 --> 16:25.020
<i>It's all just excuses...</i>

16:25.020 --> 16:26.860
<i>but I was in a panic.</i>

16:27.900 --> 16:33.240
<i>Shuya, Hiroshi, Koto, Teiko and Sumi
were all lying there dead...</i>

16:33.580 --> 16:35.450
<i>not answering me.</i>

16:36.830 --> 16:38.120
<i>"It's over."</i>

16:38.120 --> 16:41.460
<i>I knew that I was about to die.</i>

16:42.830 --> 16:44.340
<i>And that wolf...</i>

16:45.550 --> 16:48.170
<i>What I thought was a wolf...</i>

16:48.840 --> 16:51.680
<i>was our mother,
who'd turned into a demon.</i>

16:53.220 --> 16:56.220
<i>You fought her to protect us...</i>

16:56.560 --> 16:59.020
<i>running outside
where day was starting to break.</i>

16:59.930 --> 17:05.190
<i>When you first realized
it was Mom who'd attacked our family...</i>

17:07.110 --> 17:10.450
<i>how did it make you feel, Big Brother?</i>

17:11.780 --> 17:14.660
<i>When you stood there, shattered...</i>

17:14.990 --> 17:17.580
<i>after killing our beloved mother...</i>

17:18.040 --> 17:21.870
<i>and the brother you'd fought tooth and nail
to protect denounced you...</i>

17:21.870 --> 17:24.460
<i>how did that make you feel?</i>

17:26.590 --> 17:29.010
<i>When we'd only just promised
each other...</i>

17:29.010 --> 17:32.510
<i>to protect the family together!</i>

17:42.480 --> 17:43.520
Genya...

17:43.520 --> 17:44.520
Huh?

17:45.480 --> 17:48.400
Let's protect our family together,
you and me.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.400
Um...

17:49.400 --> 17:51.990
Dad got himself stabbed,
and now he's dead.

17:51.990 --> 17:54.780
I feel a lot easier with him
out of the picture...

17:56.160 --> 17:58.370
but without a father around...

17:58.740 --> 18:01.450
everyone will feel lonely.

18:04.540 --> 18:06.000
From now on...

18:06.330 --> 18:08.130
you and I...

18:08.130 --> 18:11.170
are going to protect Mom and our siblings.

18:12.300 --> 18:13.630
Got that?

18:17.850 --> 18:19.510
What you mean is...

18:19.510 --> 18:22.930
"from now on, too..."

18:22.930 --> 18:24.810
right?

18:26.860 --> 18:27.810
Yeah.

18:35.030 --> 18:36.950
<i>Sorry, Big Brother.</i>

18:37.490 --> 18:41.370
<i>I'm going to die
without getting a chance to say I'm sorry.</i>

18:42.870 --> 18:45.710
<i>And that memory of you
smiling at me...</i>

18:46.040 --> 18:48.880
<i>will be the last thing I see.</i>

18:49.960 --> 18:53.720
<i>I had no talent, Big Brother.</i>

18:54.050 --> 18:56.220
<i>I can't use breathing techniques...</i>

18:56.220 --> 18:58.550
<i>and I'll never become a Hashira.</i>

18:59.100 --> 18:59.390
DESTROY

18:59.390 --> 19:03.390
<i>Unless I become a Hashira,
I can never meet the other Hashira.</i>
DESTROY

19:03.390 --> 19:03.810
DESTROY

19:03.810 --> 19:05.020
<i>I gave it my all...</i>
DESTROY

19:05.020 --> 19:05.770
<i>I gave it my all...</i>

19:05.770 --> 19:07.980
<i>but it was beyond me.</i>

19:08.520 --> 19:10.770
<i>A slowpoke like you...</i>

19:10.770 --> 19:12.980
<i>You're no brother of mine!</i>

19:12.980 --> 19:14.820
<i>Just quit the Demon Slayer Corps!</i>

19:16.650 --> 19:18.700
<i>But why?</i>

19:18.700 --> 19:21.160
<i>I am your brother!</i>

19:22.200 --> 19:23.290
Genya!

19:24.950 --> 19:25.960
Don't give up!

19:31.840 --> 19:33.050
Go after it again!

19:33.920 --> 19:35.840
Slash it again!

19:36.130 --> 19:37.630
Whatever you do, don't give up!

19:37.630 --> 19:39.010
This time, you'll make it!

19:39.970 --> 19:41.300
I'll protect you, all right?

19:42.260 --> 19:44.100
Don't think about anything else
but beheading it!

19:45.520 --> 19:47.100
Aren't you going to become a Hashira?

19:47.560 --> 19:49.310
Genya Shinazugawa?

19:52.820 --> 19:53.690
<i>Oh no!</i>

19:53.690 --> 19:54.780
<i>Behind us!</i>

19:55.530 --> 19:57.570
<i>Weeping Spears.</i>

19:59.860 --> 20:01.870
<i>This is bad! I'm hit!</i>

20:01.870 --> 20:03.120
<i>Squarely!</i>

20:07.210 --> 20:08.370
Huh?

20:12.090 --> 20:13.550
Go!

20:14.420 --> 20:15.710
Genya!

20:20.470 --> 20:21.800
I can't...

20:22.140 --> 20:23.640
behead it!

20:25.430 --> 20:26.770
You be the one...

20:27.310 --> 20:28.560
to behead it!

20:29.940 --> 20:31.520
Just this once...

20:31.860 --> 20:32.940
I'm going to...

20:34.690 --> 20:35.690
Genya...

20:40.160 --> 20:41.910
...let you have it!

20:53.130 --> 20:54.250
<i>I'll do it...</i>

20:54.250 --> 20:55.590
<i>no matter what!</i>

21:04.640 --> 21:05.560
<i>There it is!</i>

21:07.770 --> 21:08.640
<i>It's tiny!</i>

21:15.270 --> 21:16.860
<i>You're not getting away!</i>

23:00.880 --> 23:01.340
PART 6

23:02.710 --> 23:05.590
Genya, you didn't have
anything to eat again today.

23:05.590 --> 23:06.840
Are you okay?

23:07.180 --> 23:11.010
I hear that you haven't eaten
since we met at the Butterfly Mansion.

23:11.350 --> 23:13.680
<i>You can't battle demons unless you eat!</i>

23:13.680 --> 23:14.770
<i>That's right!</i>

23:14.770 --> 23:16.270
<i>I said I don't want anything!</i>

23:16.770 --> 23:19.020
You're always acting too familiar!

23:19.020 --> 23:20.190
But we're friends!

23:20.190 --> 23:22.110
Since when are we friends?

23:22.110 --> 23:24.110
Well, we soaked
in the hot springs together!

23:24.110 --> 23:25.740
That was only because you barged in—

23:25.740 --> 23:27.740
And we were in the same
Final Selection class, too!

23:28.030 --> 23:30.030
So, that makes us friends, right?

23:31.910 --> 23:34.120
I told you!
That's what's so annoying about—

23:34.120 --> 23:35.040
Hold up a second!

23:35.040 --> 23:37.540
Next, Episode 7, "Awful Villain."

23:37.540 --> 23:39.130
Genya, let's always be good friends!

23:39.130 --> 23:39.920
I said—

23:39.920 --> 23:40.920
