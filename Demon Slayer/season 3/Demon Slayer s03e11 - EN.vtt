HATRED

00:17.530 --> 00:18.490
UPPER FOUR

00:18.490 --> 00:20.370
You damn slip of a girl...
UPPER FOUR

00:59.700 --> 01:04.920
Where do we go running through
the dark night?

01:04.920 --> 01:10.880
The moonlight is the only guiding light

01:10.880 --> 01:15.970
The pain and sadness can't be wiped away

01:15.970 --> 01:21.770
But I won't let
the blaze in my heart put out

01:21.770 --> 01:24.680
For who do we carry out this will

01:24.680 --> 01:27.600
And tear apart the darkness for?

01:27.600 --> 01:30.150
Under the sunlight

01:30.150 --> 01:33.440
Until the light shines through

01:33.440 --> 01:38.870
Soar above and put on

01:38.870 --> 01:44.500
The fire in your unleashed heart,
now beyond the dawn

01:44.500 --> 01:50.040
Until I can love this world
you are in once again

01:50.040 --> 01:54.880
Even if my life ends, carry on

01:54.880 --> 02:01.760
The miracle that the bond created

02:12.810 --> 02:17.990
EPISODE 10:
LOVE HASHIRA MITSURI KANROJI

02:22.070 --> 02:23.280
Hey you!

02:23.580 --> 02:25.290
You've gone too far!

02:25.290 --> 02:28.290
I'm taking Nezuko and Genya
back from you, all right?

02:28.790 --> 02:31.170
Shut up, you shameless tramp!

02:31.170 --> 02:35.340
There's only one person in this world
who can order me around!

02:37.960 --> 02:39.630
<i>"Shameless tramp"?</i>

02:40.300 --> 02:41.720
<i>"Tra..."</i>

02:41.720 --> 02:44.010
<i>Me? You're talking about me?</i>

02:44.010 --> 02:45.600
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

02:45.600 --> 02:48.020
<i>What a foul mouth that boy has!</i>

02:48.020 --> 02:51.810
<i>And he's around the same age and size
as my little brother!</i>

02:52.520 --> 02:57.320
<i>Oh, wait, but demons don't look
their actual age, do they?</i>

02:57.650 --> 02:59.940
<i>Still! What a horrible thing to say!</i>

03:01.110 --> 03:03.620
<i>Crazed Cry of Thunderdeath!</i>

03:05.160 --> 03:06.200
Ms. Kanroji!

03:07.330 --> 03:08.370
<i>Love Breathing...</i>

03:08.700 --> 03:09.950
<i>Third Form...</i>

03:12.960 --> 03:14.500
<i>Catlove Shower!</i>

03:17.300 --> 03:18.840
I'm angry, all right?

03:19.210 --> 03:21.760
I'm not holding back
just because you look like a child!

03:21.760 --> 03:24.010
Holy...

03:25.470 --> 03:26.890
<i>This young girl...</i>

03:27.220 --> 03:30.230
<i>slashed through the attack itself.</i>

03:35.400 --> 03:37.690
<i>I've never seen a sword shaped like that!</i>

03:38.530 --> 03:41.610
<i>It's too fast to follow with the eye!</i>

03:41.610 --> 03:44.070
<i>Is that because of how supple it is?</i>

03:44.070 --> 03:45.910
<i>It's flexible beyond belief!</i>

03:46.120 --> 03:48.030
<i>The swordsmith who forged it is amazing...</i>

03:48.540 --> 03:51.410
<i>but Ms. Kanroji is even more amazing
for being able to wield it!</i>

03:59.920 --> 04:01.340
<i>Love Breathing...</i>

04:01.340 --> 04:02.470
<i>Second Form...</i>

04:02.840 --> 04:04.510
<i>Love Pangs!</i>

04:09.060 --> 04:10.390
<i>Sixth Form...</i>

04:11.140 --> 04:13.100
<i>Catlegged Winds of Love!</i>

04:14.060 --> 04:16.600
<i>She can still keep up even at this speed?</i>

04:18.730 --> 04:20.940
<i>Then, I'll bury her with a spell!</i>

04:21.570 --> 04:22.690
<i>Blood Demon Art...</i>

04:23.150 --> 04:24.650
<i>Countless Striking Trees!</i>

04:26.450 --> 04:27.530
<i>Oh no!</i>

04:27.530 --> 04:29.080
<i>What a wide-ranging spell!</i>

04:37.130 --> 04:38.210
Oh, crap!

04:38.210 --> 04:39.540
The main body's running off!

04:41.000 --> 04:43.800
<i>Can I take on this many of them?</i>

04:45.800 --> 04:47.090
<i>Love Breathing...</i>

04:47.090 --> 04:48.180
<i>Fifth Form...</i>

04:48.600 --> 04:50.180
<i>Swaying Love...</i>

04:50.760 --> 04:51.970
<i>Wildclaw!</i>

05:02.320 --> 05:03.490
Got him!

05:03.490 --> 05:05.570
<i>So fast! But it's no good!</i>

05:05.570 --> 05:06.200
Ms. Kanro—

05:07.820 --> 05:09.410
<i>Is he about to do something?</i>

05:10.070 --> 05:11.330
<i>But I'm good!</i>

05:11.330 --> 05:12.740
<i>As long as I slice off his head...</i>

05:12.740 --> 05:13.950
Ms. Kanroji!

05:13.950 --> 05:15.460
That's not the main body!

05:15.460 --> 05:17.460
It won't die if you cut off its head!

05:17.460 --> 05:19.710
<i>What? No way! For real?</i>

05:19.710 --> 05:21.960
<i>I made the wrong call—</i>

05:22.250 --> 05:24.090
<i>Compressed Sound Waves!</i>

05:28.340 --> 05:29.510
Ms. Kanroji!

05:38.390 --> 05:40.480
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

05:41.060 --> 05:42.400
<i>This girl...</i>

05:42.400 --> 05:47.610
<i>Even after getting hit by that attack,
she's kept her body structure intact!</i>

05:48.030 --> 05:52.240
<i>Did she tense up all of her muscles
just before she got hit?</i>

05:52.740 --> 05:53.790
<i>Nevertheless...</i>

05:53.790 --> 05:57.000
<i>she still shouldn't have been able
to withstand it!</i>

05:59.080 --> 06:00.460
<i>It's baffling!</i>

06:00.460 --> 06:01.540
<i>No, wait.</i>

06:01.540 --> 06:02.670
<i>I see.</i>

06:02.670 --> 06:03.750
<i>This girl's muscular strength...</i>

06:04.210 --> 06:06.920
<i>is a mismatch for her build.</i>

06:07.220 --> 06:09.510
<i>An abnormal constitution!</i>

06:10.050 --> 06:11.850
<i>This is great!</i>

06:12.140 --> 06:16.470
<i>Consuming high-quality flesh
leads directly to power.</i>

06:16.470 --> 06:18.100
<i>But first...</i>

06:18.520 --> 06:22.610
<i>let me pulverize
her skull and brain tissue!</i>

06:32.950 --> 06:34.120
Ms. Kanroji?

06:35.580 --> 06:36.870
Ms. Kanroji?

06:37.910 --> 06:39.460
Ms. Kanroji?

06:41.330 --> 06:43.790
No one could ever marry you...

06:43.790 --> 06:46.750
but a bear, a boar or a cow.

06:47.510 --> 06:49.880
The thought of that bizarre hair color...

06:49.880 --> 06:53.260
being passed down to my children
makes me shudder.

06:53.930 --> 06:56.510
Let's forget this marriage interview
ever happened.

06:57.020 --> 06:59.560
Please forget about me.

06:59.560 --> 07:01.020
Farewell.

07:02.940 --> 07:04.690
<i>At 17...</i>

07:05.060 --> 07:06.940
<i>my prospective marriage...</i>

07:07.440 --> 07:08.820
<i>was called off.</i>

07:14.910 --> 07:17.120
Isn't your daddy amazing?

07:24.130 --> 07:26.500
What are you doing? She's just a child!

07:26.920 --> 07:28.670
<i>I couldn't flex the muscles
on my thin arms...</i>
Mother!

07:28.670 --> 07:29.260
<i>I couldn't flex the muscles
on my thin arms...</i>

07:29.260 --> 07:31.260
Why can't I make one?
<i>I couldn't flex the muscles
on my thin arms...</i>

07:32.010 --> 07:35.010
<i>but there's a story that my mother
has told me over and over...</i>

07:35.300 --> 07:37.510
<i>about my childhood.</i>

07:38.520 --> 07:41.020
<i>When I was 14 months old...</i>

07:41.600 --> 07:45.650
<i>right when my mother was pregnant
with my little brother...</i>

07:49.480 --> 07:50.740
Mitsuri?

07:51.320 --> 07:53.150
Where are you, Mitsuri?

07:54.740 --> 07:55.530
Mitsu—

07:55.820 --> 07:57.120
Ta-da!

07:59.120 --> 08:00.620
<i>Small child that I was...</i>

08:00.950 --> 08:03.080
<i>I wanted to help her in the kitchen...</i>

08:03.080 --> 08:08.210
<i>and lifted up a 33-pound pickling stone.</i>

08:09.130 --> 08:12.260
<i>Though my mother was renowned
for being unflappable...</i>

08:12.260 --> 08:16.340
<i>that day, she was blown away
for the first time in her life.</i>

08:17.890 --> 08:20.520
Thanks for always being a good helper!

08:21.220 --> 08:22.230
SOBA SHOP

08:22.230 --> 08:23.350
<i>And...</i>
SOBA SHOP

08:23.350 --> 08:23.690
SOBA SHOP

08:23.690 --> 08:26.730
<i>ever since I was a child,
I've had a big appetite.</i>
SOBA SHOP

08:27.150 --> 08:29.360
<i>I loved to eat.</i>

08:30.860 --> 08:33.530
Now, that's a healthy appetite!

08:33.530 --> 08:36.870
Come on, how can you sumo wrestlers
lose to her?

08:37.200 --> 08:39.410
I mean, we hear you...

08:39.410 --> 08:40.290
but man...

08:40.290 --> 08:40.950
Yeah.

08:40.950 --> 08:41.740
There you go!

08:42.040 --> 08:43.910
Sakura rice cakes for dessert!

08:44.250 --> 08:46.750
Thanks, don't mind if I do!

08:47.670 --> 08:50.000
Are you really sure about this?

08:50.000 --> 08:51.750
It's totally fine!

08:52.010 --> 08:54.380
No need to hold back at all!

08:54.380 --> 08:56.220
Hey, you heard him!

08:56.220 --> 08:57.930
Go for it!

09:00.310 --> 09:01.810
Are you ready?

09:01.810 --> 09:02.600
Game on!

09:07.060 --> 09:08.980
Your arms may be thin, Mitsuri...

09:09.230 --> 09:12.730
but the density of your muscles
must be extraordinary!

09:15.530 --> 09:16.400
<i>But...</i>

09:16.740 --> 09:19.370
<i>as I grew older, little by little...</i>

09:19.910 --> 09:24.500
<i>I began to realize
I wasn't like the other girls around me.</i>

09:24.500 --> 09:29.830
Mother, do you think
I can ever become someone's bride?

09:29.830 --> 09:32.710
Why would you ask me that?

09:33.420 --> 09:34.670
Well...

09:34.670 --> 09:36.760
because I'm so strong...

09:37.090 --> 09:38.840
and I eat a lot...

09:39.180 --> 09:41.720
and even my hair color's weird.

09:42.350 --> 09:46.350
You can just stay at home forever, Mitsuri.

09:46.350 --> 09:47.600
But...

09:47.600 --> 09:51.480
women are supposed to get married
and be someone's wife, right?

09:52.150 --> 09:55.990
You can just stay at home forever.

09:58.990 --> 10:01.450
<i>The day my prospective marriage
was called off...</i>

10:01.990 --> 10:04.240
<i>I decided I had to hide it all.</i>

10:05.250 --> 10:07.750
<i>I dyed my hair black.</i>

10:08.410 --> 10:10.670
<i>I stifled my urge to eat.</i>

10:11.290 --> 10:13.880
<i>And I pretended to be weak.</i>

10:14.170 --> 10:16.880
<i>Everyone in my family worried about me.</i>

10:19.430 --> 10:20.760
<i>And then one day...</i>

10:21.140 --> 10:23.930
<i>I met a man who said
he wanted to marry me.</i>

10:25.890 --> 10:27.310
<i>Can I do this?</i>

10:27.680 --> 10:29.270
<i>Can I let this happen?</i>

10:29.890 --> 10:33.270
<i>Am I going to live like this
for the rest of my life?</i>

10:34.190 --> 10:35.780
<i>Eating voraciously...</i>

10:36.110 --> 10:37.740
<i>being strong...</i>

10:37.740 --> 10:39.030
<i>my hair color...</i>

10:39.700 --> 10:41.450
<i>All of that is who I am!</i>

10:43.070 --> 10:45.450
<i>Am I going to pretend
to be someone I'm not?</i>

10:46.040 --> 10:48.710
<i>Isn't there something I can do?</i>

10:49.040 --> 10:52.130
<i>Some way that I can help others
while being me?</i>

10:52.580 --> 10:56.800
<i>Does this mean that there's no place
in this world for me as I am?</i>

10:57.920 --> 11:01.470
<i>Isn't there anyone who will love me?</i>

11:02.680 --> 11:04.890
<i>This isn't right!</i>

11:04.890 --> 11:06.310
<i>It can't be right!</i>

11:14.230 --> 11:15.650
Get up! Get up! Get up!

11:15.650 --> 11:17.110
The next attack's coming!

11:17.110 --> 11:18.860
I know that, all right?

11:19.400 --> 11:20.490
<i>Huh?</i>

11:20.490 --> 11:22.610
<i>Did I black out?</i>

11:22.610 --> 11:24.410
We have to protect Ms. Kanroji!

11:24.410 --> 11:28.200
She has the most potential,
so she's our ray of hope!

11:28.200 --> 11:30.460
As long as she survives...

11:30.460 --> 11:31.830
we can win for sure!

11:31.830 --> 11:33.420
Let's win together!

11:33.420 --> 11:35.290
Nobody's gonna die!

11:35.290 --> 11:36.540
We're all...

11:37.960 --> 11:40.300
How comical.

11:43.890 --> 11:45.300
You're kidding me!

11:52.730 --> 11:54.270
<i>Did I get them?</i>

11:54.270 --> 11:57.270
You guys, thank you!

11:57.570 --> 12:00.780
I'm a Hashira, and I messed up! Sorry!

12:00.780 --> 12:03.530
I'll never let my friends die, okay?

12:03.530 --> 12:07.160
Because the Demon Slayer Corps
is my precious home!

12:07.160 --> 12:10.250
Upper Rank or whatever you are!
It makes no difference to me!

12:10.250 --> 12:12.870
<i>She slashed through it all!
She's so cool!</i>

12:13.460 --> 12:14.580
No way...

12:14.580 --> 12:16.750
will I ever lose to evil people!

12:17.090 --> 12:18.750
Now brace yourself!

12:18.750 --> 12:21.010
I'm going for the kill now!

13:56.810 --> 13:57.640
What?

13:57.640 --> 13:59.270
What? What's this?

13:59.270 --> 14:02.020
What's this? Mr. Iguro, what's this?

14:03.320 --> 14:04.480
Take them.

14:04.480 --> 14:06.400
Huh? For me?

14:09.530 --> 14:12.120
Whaaaaat? I'm so happy!

14:12.120 --> 14:13.870
I promise you, I'll treasure them!

14:14.950 --> 14:17.160
No need to treasure them.

14:18.250 --> 14:20.080
No way.

14:20.080 --> 14:22.130
That would be such a waste.

14:23.380 --> 14:24.250
It's fine.

14:27.590 --> 14:29.180
If they get ripped...

14:29.180 --> 14:30.970
I'll give you a new pair.

14:32.640 --> 14:33.850
Okay!

14:37.140 --> 14:38.940
<i>I've wondered to myself...</i>

14:39.350 --> 14:42.020
<i>"Should a girl be this strong?"</i>

14:42.020 --> 14:43.360
<i>Would people...</i>

14:43.360 --> 14:46.400
<i>say yet again that I couldn't be human?</i>

14:46.780 --> 14:48.070
<i>I was afraid...</i>

14:48.400 --> 14:50.410
<i>so I've been holding back my power.</i>

14:51.030 --> 14:52.410
<i>But not anymore!</i>

14:52.910 --> 14:55.410
<i>She's our ray of hope!</i>

15:03.210 --> 15:04.540
Just leave it to me!

15:04.540 --> 15:07.010
I'm going to protect you all, okay?

15:17.810 --> 15:20.560
I'll take care of this one!

15:25.020 --> 15:27.940
So you guys go on ahead
and defeat the main body!

15:27.940 --> 15:28.820
Nezuko!

15:28.820 --> 15:29.780
Genya!

15:30.150 --> 15:31.030
Uh-huh!

15:31.030 --> 15:33.410
DESTROY

15:35.120 --> 15:37.580
<i>I have to increase my heart rate!</i>

15:37.580 --> 15:39.830
<i>I need to speed up my circulation...</i>

15:40.540 --> 15:41.830
<i>to get faster...</i>

15:42.170 --> 15:43.170
<i>and stronger!</i>

15:43.170 --> 15:44.790
<i>More!</i>

15:48.550 --> 15:49.170
DESTROY

15:49.170 --> 15:51.010
<i>You little brats...</i>
DESTROY

15:51.010 --> 15:51.840
HATRED

16:04.770 --> 16:06.810
Didn't I say I was going to protect them?

16:06.810 --> 16:09.230
I'm not letting you go that way!

16:11.070 --> 16:12.320
Tanjiro!

16:12.320 --> 16:14.070
Where's the thing
containing the main body?

16:14.070 --> 16:14.950
Can you spot it?

16:14.950 --> 16:16.030
I can!

16:27.710 --> 16:28.960
Found it!

16:30.340 --> 16:31.630
This way!

16:31.630 --> 16:35.470
<i>While Ms. Kanroji's dealing
with that child demon...</i>

16:35.470 --> 16:38.470
<i>we have to slash the demon's main body
as soon as we can!</i>

16:41.890 --> 16:43.310
<i>This young girl...</i>

16:43.600 --> 16:46.150
<i>She's moving even faster than before!</i>

16:46.150 --> 16:47.270
<i>What did you do?</i>

16:47.270 --> 16:49.440
<i>What are you doing? What on earth—</i>

16:52.070 --> 16:53.150
<i>A mark?</i>

16:53.490 --> 16:55.150
<i>Did she have that from the start?</i>

16:55.740 --> 16:56.780
<i>That...</i>

16:57.160 --> 16:59.330
<i>looks a lot like a demon's crest!</i>

17:04.620 --> 17:06.960
<i>This is beyond annoying!</i>

17:07.250 --> 17:11.300
<i>Thanks to this slip of a girl,
I can't unleash my lizards on those brats!</i>

17:15.470 --> 17:17.470
<i>Despicable!</i>

17:17.470 --> 17:20.310
<i>Nevertheless, it won't last forever.</i>

17:20.600 --> 17:23.180
<i>She's sure to lose stamina!</i>

17:23.520 --> 17:25.350
<i>All humans do!</i>

17:28.150 --> 17:29.610
When I say I won't let you go...

17:29.900 --> 17:32.070
I mean I won't let you go!

17:35.070 --> 17:36.150
That's it!

17:36.150 --> 17:38.280
It's inside that tree!

17:39.370 --> 17:40.950
<i>There's no doubt in my mind!</i>

17:41.830 --> 17:44.120
The demon's inside that tree!

17:44.450 --> 17:45.540
Let's catch up to it!

17:49.630 --> 17:50.880
Almost there!

17:51.380 --> 17:53.380
Stop, you bastard!

18:01.680 --> 18:04.100
Don't let it shake you off!
Hang tight!

18:04.100 --> 18:05.390
Hang tight!

18:05.390 --> 18:07.100
Before the tree-thing...

18:07.100 --> 18:08.900
Before that snake-lizard thing...

18:08.900 --> 18:11.020
comes this way!

18:11.020 --> 18:13.730
While Ms. Kanroji's stopping it
from attacking!

18:15.490 --> 18:18.490
<i>I can't even swing my sword like this!</i>

18:18.780 --> 18:19.740
<i>So...</i>

18:19.740 --> 18:21.780
<i>all I can do is this!</i>

18:23.580 --> 18:25.330
<i>Whoa! He's biting it!</i>

18:25.330 --> 18:27.370
<i>His teeth are crazy strong!</i>

18:27.580 --> 18:29.330
But won't that give you an upset stomach?

18:29.330 --> 18:31.540
Genya, are you gonna be okay?

18:33.800 --> 18:35.090
<i>By...</i>

18:35.090 --> 18:37.090
<i>devouring demons...</i>

18:37.090 --> 18:39.880
<i>It's only temporary,
but I can gain demonic traits!</i>

18:40.930 --> 18:43.300
<i>If I consume a strong demon...</i>

18:43.300 --> 18:45.430
UPPER FOUR
<i>it boosts my regenerative abilities...</i>

18:45.720 --> 18:47.310
<i>and increases my muscular strength!</i>

18:56.990 --> 18:57.940
<i>It's down!</i>

18:58.820 --> 18:59.900
<i>Now!</i>

19:02.410 --> 19:04.120
<i>The branches are like whips!</i>

19:04.370 --> 19:05.790
<i>Stand your ground!</i>

19:05.790 --> 19:07.040
<i>Keep moving!</i>

19:15.800 --> 19:17.880
<i>Nezuko's Blood Demon Art!</i>

19:19.630 --> 19:21.890
<i>It's sluggish now thanks to the flames!</i>

19:22.180 --> 19:23.140
<i>It's going to work!</i>

19:23.140 --> 19:24.140
<i>I can do this!</i>

19:27.310 --> 19:29.180
<i>Hinokami Kagura...</i>

19:29.560 --> 19:30.350
<i>Flame Dance!</i>

19:33.940 --> 19:35.860
<i>I still haven't landed a blow
on the demon!</i>

19:39.070 --> 19:41.740
<i>This isn't going to end
until I cut off the main body's head!</i>

19:41.740 --> 19:44.240
Do it! Tanjiro!

19:49.290 --> 19:50.330
<i>It's gone!</i>

19:50.620 --> 19:51.830
<i>It ran off again!</i>

19:51.830 --> 19:53.960
<i>Where'd it go?</i>

19:54.250 --> 19:56.340
<i>It can't have gotten that far!</i>

20:04.260 --> 20:05.890
You bastard!

20:05.890 --> 20:08.220
Don't run away!

20:08.220 --> 20:11.100
Don't run away from your responsibilities!

20:11.390 --> 20:13.520
For every sin you've ever committed!

20:13.520 --> 20:14.810
Every evil deed!

20:14.810 --> 20:18.480
I'm going to make you
pay for everything you've ever done!

20:18.480 --> 20:20.360
You're not getting away, no matter what!

20:25.030 --> 20:26.740
<i>For what you've done...</i>

20:27.030 --> 20:28.740
<i>you're going to take responsibility!</i>

20:28.740 --> 20:31.000
<i>Not anyone else!</i>

20:31.000 --> 20:34.500
<i>You two-faced, shameless liar!</i>

20:35.540 --> 20:41.510
<i>I've never once uttered a lie
ever since the day I was born!</i>

20:41.510 --> 20:44.130
<i>I'm a virtuous weakling!</i>

20:44.430 --> 20:46.640
<i>As pitiful as I am...</i>

20:46.970 --> 20:49.510
<i>nobody shows me any sympathy!</i>

20:49.510 --> 20:53.890
I... I...

20:55.100 --> 20:57.150
I've never lied!

21:00.190 --> 21:02.360
Come on, Nezuko, Genya!

21:09.030 --> 21:11.330
You piece of crap!

21:14.750 --> 21:16.880
Enough is enough...

21:16.880 --> 21:19.960
you stupid moron!

21:34.450 --> 21:39.450
I call the elemental name of love...

21:42.420 --> 21:45.500
I've always been looking for it

21:45.500 --> 21:48.210
Where did love go astray?

21:48.210 --> 21:53.470
I keep struggling in the endless nights

21:53.470 --> 21:56.430
The absurdity is just
going circles in this world

21:56.430 --> 21:59.100
I'm feeling my life trembling so hard

21:59.100 --> 22:04.350
What chaos,
falling in love in these times

22:04.350 --> 22:09.400
No matter how many times
sorrow overwhelms the world

22:09.400 --> 22:15.320
Your elegant, dancing blade

22:15.320 --> 22:18.620
Will clear the way so dreams can pass

22:19.410 --> 22:22.160
I wish we could love each other
and laugh together

22:22.160 --> 22:27.420
I wish I could protect
all kindhearted people

22:27.420 --> 22:30.500
If I wish earnestly,
it will surely come true

22:30.500 --> 22:33.090
I hear your voice calling me

22:33.090 --> 22:41.310
Soon, sunrise will burn the sky
as we see in our dreams

22:41.310 --> 22:49.320
I ran beyond the fluttering flag

22:49.320 --> 22:52.280
With this beautiful world,

22:52.280 --> 22:57.870
I'm deeply in love

23:01.060 --> 23:01.520
PART 10

23:02.770 --> 23:05.780
Ms. Kanroji, thank you for protecting us.

23:06.110 --> 23:09.280
We're going to defeat
that Upper Rank demon for sure!

23:09.900 --> 23:10.820
Yeah!

23:11.280 --> 23:13.660
Now, it's time for a Taisho-era secret!

23:13.990 --> 23:17.410
Ms. Kanroji says that her hair and eyes
changed to their current color...

23:17.410 --> 23:22.170
after eating 170 sakura rice cakes
a day for eight months!

23:22.500 --> 23:24.540
Is that really true?

23:24.540 --> 23:26.880
In Ms. Kanroji's case,
I can see it happening.

23:27.260 --> 23:32.010
In the first place, there's no way she could
eat that many sakura rice cakes every—

23:32.010 --> 23:33.850
Here, Muichiro!

23:33.850 --> 23:35.390
Ms. Kanroji!

23:35.390 --> 23:37.850
You join me, too, Tanjiro!

23:37.850 --> 23:39.350
Thank you very much!

23:40.020 --> 23:41.480
These are really good!

23:42.020 --> 23:43.480
Next, the final episode...

23:43.480 --> 23:47.030
"A Connected Bond: Daybreak and First Light."

23:47.030 --> 23:49.990
No way are we going to let
some arrogant demon have his way!

23:49.990 --> 23:51.200
That's right.

23:51.200 --> 23:52.660
Let's put up a good fight!

23:52.660 --> 23:54.320
We're so not gonna lose!

23:54.700 --> 23:56.080
TO BE CONTINUED
