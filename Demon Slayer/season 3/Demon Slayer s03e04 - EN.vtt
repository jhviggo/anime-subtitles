WEBVTT

00:05.590 --> 00:07.590
DESTROY

00:29.780 --> 00:31.820
What could that be?

00:31.820 --> 00:33.120
At the very least...

00:33.120 --> 00:35.990
it's a sword from over 300 years ago, right?

00:36.490 --> 00:38.040
It probably is!

00:38.040 --> 00:39.750
This is... crazy, huh?

00:39.750 --> 00:41.000
What should we do?

00:43.460 --> 00:45.380
Can't stop our hearts from pounding, huh?

00:45.380 --> 00:46.170
No!

00:46.500 --> 00:50.170
Mr. Tanjiro! You were at a loss because
you couldn't get a new sword forged, right?

00:50.550 --> 00:53.430
I'm thinking it would be all right
if you took this sword!

00:53.430 --> 00:55.970
No, no! That wouldn't be right!

00:55.970 --> 00:59.600
The steel they used in the Sengoku Period
is the best quality ever!

00:59.850 --> 01:01.690
No, no, I couldn't!

01:01.690 --> 01:04.230
But we only found it because you came here!

01:04.230 --> 01:07.270
HYOTTOKO
That's because it already had
a battle history stored inside,

01:07.270 --> 01:10.490
and I just happened to be there
when it broke! So no!
HYOTTOKO

01:10.490 --> 01:10.820
and I just happened to be there
when it broke! So no!

01:10.820 --> 01:12.740
Are you sure about that? Really?

01:15.320 --> 01:17.740
Want to pull it out just to take a look?

01:17.740 --> 01:20.000
Sure! I know I'd like to see it!

01:25.830 --> 01:27.130
It's rusty.

01:28.300 --> 01:30.800
Well, yeah. Of course it is.

01:30.800 --> 01:35.050
It's been neglected for like 300 years,
and no one knew about it.

01:35.340 --> 01:37.680
Sorry! I got you worked up for nothing.

01:38.510 --> 01:39.770
It's okay!

01:39.770 --> 01:41.350
I don't mind, all right?

01:41.680 --> 01:43.350
Whoa! Mr. Tanjiro!

01:43.350 --> 01:45.730
Mr. Tanjiro, my bad!

01:47.900 --> 01:49.070
What was that?

03:28.800 --> 03:33.970
EPISODE 3:
A SWORD FROM OVER 300 YEARS AGO

03:39.480 --> 03:41.560
Who's that? Mr. Haganezuka?

03:42.150 --> 03:44.610
I have heard your story.

03:44.940 --> 03:46.900
I'll take it from here.

03:46.900 --> 03:48.450
Take what from here?

03:50.660 --> 03:52.570
What do you think you're doing?

03:52.570 --> 03:54.580
Leave it to me!

03:54.580 --> 03:55.830
Let go, please!

03:55.830 --> 03:58.580
Hey, why are you trying to take off with it?

03:59.120 --> 04:01.370
Just shut up and leave it to me!

04:01.370 --> 04:05.670
You can't just show up out of the blue and say,
"Leave it to me"! That doesn't make any sense!

04:05.670 --> 04:07.090
You leave it to me!

04:07.460 --> 04:09.590
No, this belongs to Kotetsu!

04:09.590 --> 04:11.380
Leave it to me!

04:11.380 --> 04:15.600
I came here to see you, Mr. Haganezuka!
Where have you been?

04:18.730 --> 04:21.350
Leave it to me means leave it to me!

04:21.730 --> 04:24.230
And I asked you what you meant by that!

04:24.230 --> 04:26.360
So explain that to us!

04:26.360 --> 04:29.820
Which part of "leave it to me" don't you get?

04:30.860 --> 04:33.490
What grown-up does that?

04:34.280 --> 04:35.740
Listen, boys.

04:35.740 --> 04:38.620
Mr. Haganezuka's weak spots are his sides.

04:38.620 --> 04:40.080
Go after him here.

04:40.330 --> 04:43.330
Tickle, tickle, tickle...

04:43.580 --> 04:45.170
Hey! Mr. Kanamori...

04:45.170 --> 04:46.670
Long time no see.

04:47.090 --> 04:49.710
Hey, long time no see, Tanjiro.

04:49.710 --> 04:53.300
Mr. Haganezuka always goes limp
for a while after being tickled,

04:53.300 --> 04:55.430
so I'll do the explaining.

04:56.600 --> 04:59.180
Please forgive Mr. Haganezuka.

04:59.770 --> 05:03.060
You see, he's been hiding out
in the mountains, training.

05:03.060 --> 05:04.690
Training?

05:04.690 --> 05:05.980
That's right.

05:05.980 --> 05:07.570
In order to forge you
a stronger sword...

05:07.570 --> 05:10.240
so that you won't get killed.

05:10.240 --> 05:11.490
Oh...

05:11.950 --> 05:14.200
Not that he'd ever admit that himself.

05:14.780 --> 05:17.200
For me?

05:17.660 --> 05:21.870
All this time, you've been asking
Mr. Haganezuka for another sword, right?

05:21.870 --> 05:23.960
I'm sure that it made him happy.

05:24.290 --> 05:28.840
After all, he's always losing clients
because most swordsmen can't stand him.

05:28.840 --> 05:29.960
Is that right?

05:30.460 --> 05:33.760
- He's got zero social skills, this one.
- Huh?

05:33.760 --> 05:36.300
No wonder he still can't find a bride.

05:37.260 --> 05:39.390
Oh, look, he's revived.

05:40.060 --> 05:43.310
I shall take this rusty sword into my care.

05:43.730 --> 05:46.980
And using the Nichirin Sword polishing art
of the Haganezuka Family,

05:46.980 --> 05:49.980
I will surely restore it!

05:50.320 --> 05:53.570
Then, why didn't you just say so
from the start?

05:53.570 --> 05:56.780
Instead of "Leave it to me, leave it to me"
when you have zero trust built up?

05:56.780 --> 05:58.950
Oh, right, that's the one thing you know.

05:59.240 --> 06:01.500
What the hell was that?

06:01.500 --> 06:03.500
Let's hear you say that again!

06:03.500 --> 06:05.290
I can't breathe!

06:05.290 --> 06:07.080
His sides! His sides! His sides!

06:07.080 --> 06:08.540
Go for his sides!

06:08.840 --> 06:12.460
Tickle, tickle, tickle!

06:19.510 --> 06:21.640
I'll be taking this with me.

06:21.640 --> 06:24.060
In the meantime, use this sword.

06:30.900 --> 06:33.240
Th-Thank you very much!

06:34.530 --> 06:36.740
So, that's what happened yesterday.

06:36.740 --> 06:40.160
They say it takes three days
and three nights to polish a sword...

06:40.660 --> 06:43.330
so he'll be done the day after tomorrow.

06:43.330 --> 06:48.670
That polishing art of his is so brutal,
some people have even died, and that worries me.

06:49.290 --> 06:52.670
He said not to look in, no matter what.

06:52.670 --> 06:54.170
But do you think it's okay if I go?

06:54.170 --> 06:56.510
How should I know? Get out of here!

06:56.510 --> 06:58.840
Stop talking to me like we're friends!

06:58.840 --> 07:01.560
DESTROY
Huh? But aren't we friends?

07:01.560 --> 07:03.310
Not by a long shot!
DESTROY

07:03.810 --> 07:05.810
You broke my arm, remember?

07:06.140 --> 07:07.810
Don't tell me you've forgotten!

07:10.730 --> 07:13.980
That was totally your own fault
for hitting a girl, Genya.

07:13.980 --> 07:15.190
I had no choice.

07:15.190 --> 07:17.280
Don't call me by my first name!

07:18.030 --> 07:19.700
These rice crackers are delicious!

07:19.700 --> 07:20.740
Want one?

07:20.740 --> 07:21.530
Damn you!

07:21.530 --> 07:24.120
No, I don't want one! Get lost!

07:25.120 --> 07:28.670
Huh? Didn't you lose a tooth?

07:28.670 --> 07:30.750
A front tooth... at the hot spring?

07:38.260 --> 07:40.260
You must've been seeing things.

07:40.640 --> 07:42.140
No, I wasn't seeing things.

07:42.140 --> 07:43.510
I've got the tooth right here.

07:43.850 --> 07:47.520
Why'd you pick it up?
You sure are creepy, you know that?

07:47.520 --> 07:50.940
Well, but you dropped it,
so I thought I'd return it.

07:50.940 --> 07:53.520
Are you out of your mind?
Toss that thing!

07:53.860 --> 07:55.360
- Get out of my sight!
- Hey!

08:04.950 --> 08:08.460
Like this, like that, then like this...

08:08.960 --> 08:12.210
Let's see. And now I go like this...

08:12.960 --> 08:16.090
I wonder why Genya's always
so mad all the time.

08:16.420 --> 08:19.220
Could it be that he's hungry?

08:20.050 --> 08:23.470
Wanna ask Genya to breakfast
tomorrow morning?

08:25.970 --> 08:27.850
You like him, too, Nezuko?

08:28.270 --> 08:32.480
We've already soaked in the hot spring,
so the next step is to eat together, I think.

08:33.980 --> 08:36.860
I'd like to get closer to Genya.

08:39.110 --> 08:41.360
Braiding sure is hard.

08:41.700 --> 08:45.620
Now you've got the same hairstyle
as your idol, Ms. Kanroji!

08:49.250 --> 08:50.250
Hey!

08:50.540 --> 08:54.250
Nezuko, the moon is so beautiful tonight!

09:12.270 --> 09:14.860
I might've soaked a little too long tonight.

09:15.360 --> 09:18.020
Never mind that I have
another early morning tomorrow.

09:21.360 --> 09:22.780
Huh?

09:23.110 --> 09:24.360
A vase?

09:24.360 --> 09:28.030
I didn't see anything like that
on my way up just now.

09:28.660 --> 09:30.200
This is a hazard!

09:30.200 --> 09:33.290
Who would put a vase here?

10:02.190 --> 10:02.320
UPPER FIVE

10:02.320 --> 10:04.820
Horrible, horrible!
UPPER FIVE

10:04.820 --> 10:10.120
I should've known that a mountain swordsmith's
flesh would be unfit for consumption!
UPPER FIVE

10:10.660 --> 10:13.540
But that's what makes it so appealing!

10:14.290 --> 10:17.790
But if I destroy this place,
then those Demon Slayers...

10:17.790 --> 10:18.920
Hyo!

10:18.920 --> 10:22.920
They'll be undermined for sure!

10:24.090 --> 10:27.430
I must hurry! I must hurry!

10:28.050 --> 10:31.720
Thanks to Gyokko, we found the village...

10:33.730 --> 10:37.270
but my lord is in a rage!

10:37.730 --> 10:39.980
Quickly, quickly!

10:40.320 --> 10:42.400
We must kill them all!

10:42.900 --> 10:46.530
All who stand up to my lord!

10:47.910 --> 10:52.990
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
SWORDSMITH VILLAGE ARC

10:52.990 --> 10:58.000
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
SWORDSMITH VILLAGE ARC

11:11.140 --> 11:12.760
Old man? You done?

11:14.600 --> 11:15.890
You're not here?

11:27.900 --> 11:29.240
Brother...

11:31.830 --> 11:34.290
I have to do this!

11:41.170 --> 11:43.840
Have you seen the swordsmith
named Kanamori?

11:44.250 --> 11:46.720
Whoa! Tokito? What's wrong? What is it?

11:46.720 --> 11:49.340
Wait, first of all,
did you just pinch my nose?

11:49.840 --> 11:51.090
I did pinch it.

11:51.090 --> 11:53.220
You took too long to react.

11:53.220 --> 11:56.980
No, no, I would've sensed it
if there'd been any animosity!

11:57.310 --> 12:00.850
Well, not that I'd pinch someone's nose
with animosity.

12:01.610 --> 12:03.610
I do know Mr. Kanamori.

12:03.610 --> 12:04.770
What's going on?

12:04.770 --> 12:07.860
My guess is he's with Mr. Haganezuka.

12:08.450 --> 12:11.570
Kanamori's my new swordsmith.

12:12.160 --> 12:14.120
Where's Haganezuka?

12:14.580 --> 12:16.540
Why don't we go look for them together?

12:18.750 --> 12:21.750
Why do you care so much
about other people?

12:21.750 --> 12:24.880
Isn't there something
that you need to do for yourself?

12:26.000 --> 12:31.640
Whatever you do for others
comes around to help you, as well, in the end.

12:31.640 --> 12:34.510
I was planning to go anyway,
so the timing's great!

12:37.140 --> 12:38.230
Huh?

12:38.520 --> 12:40.730
What? What did you just say?

12:41.100 --> 12:42.480
Right now. Right now.

12:42.810 --> 12:45.360
Huh? I said the timing's great—

12:45.610 --> 12:46.320
Ouch!

12:47.230 --> 12:49.360
You're awake, huh, Nezuko?

12:49.740 --> 12:51.150
Ow...

13:00.580 --> 13:03.080
Let's go see Mr. Haganezuka together.

13:06.210 --> 13:09.840
This girl is one really odd creature.

13:10.130 --> 13:11.840
What? Is she odd?

13:12.180 --> 13:12.970
Yes.

13:12.970 --> 13:14.220
She's super odd.

13:14.930 --> 13:18.060
Let's see. I can't describe it.

13:18.430 --> 13:21.060
Have I met this girl before?

13:21.390 --> 13:23.480
Was she like that before, too?

13:23.980 --> 13:25.400
How should I put it?

13:37.200 --> 13:38.240
Hmm...

13:38.240 --> 13:39.870
Is someone here?

13:40.200 --> 13:41.580
Seems like it.

14:00.060 --> 14:02.310
<i>Wh-What's that?</i>

14:02.310 --> 14:03.730
<i>Is it a demon?</i>

14:04.730 --> 14:06.730
<i>What's a demon doing here?</i>

14:07.610 --> 14:09.900
<i>I didn't notice him
until I actually saw him!</i>

14:10.400 --> 14:13.400
<i>No question, this demon is an Upper Rank!</i>

14:17.280 --> 14:18.620
<i>Mist Breathing...</i>

14:20.080 --> 14:21.370
<i>Fourth Form...</i>

14:21.700 --> 14:23.080
<i>Shifting Flow Slash.</i>

14:23.910 --> 14:25.580
DESTROY

14:27.290 --> 14:28.210
<i>So quick.</i>

14:28.630 --> 14:30.300
<i>I couldn't take him out.</i>

14:30.300 --> 14:32.590
Please stop!

14:33.130 --> 14:35.760
Please stop tormenting me!

14:36.470 --> 14:38.720
It hurts!

14:38.720 --> 14:42.430
<i>Don't lose your nerve!
This is a demon who's murdered tons of people!</i>

14:42.430 --> 14:45.520
<i>Otherwise, he wouldn't be able
to dodge a Hashira's attack!</i>

14:46.520 --> 14:47.810
<i>Hinokami Kagura...</i>

14:50.770 --> 14:52.280
<i>Sunflower Thrust!</i>

14:56.570 --> 14:57.780
<i>Did I get him?</i>

14:58.160 --> 15:01.450
<i>Why isn't he fighting back?
He's not an Upper Rank?</i>

15:09.250 --> 15:11.500
Nezuko! Don't transform!

15:11.800 --> 15:13.800
You'll go into full demon form, so stop it!

15:20.300 --> 15:22.560
I've been slashed!

15:23.220 --> 15:25.100
<i>He slashed off his head!</i>

15:25.100 --> 15:26.690
<i>So fast! But...</i>

15:26.890 --> 15:28.230
<i>Upper Ranks don't always die even
if you've beheaded them!</i>
UPPER SIX

15:28.230 --> 15:31.310
<i>Upper Ranks don't always die even
if you've beheaded them!</i>

15:31.310 --> 15:32.820
UPPER

15:33.150 --> 15:34.990
Tokito! Don't let your guard down!

15:50.920 --> 15:52.130
<i>He split into two!</i>

15:52.130 --> 15:53.300
<i>One grew a head...</i>

15:53.920 --> 15:56.550
<i>while the other gained a body!</i>

15:56.840 --> 15:58.380
<i>I'll take the one in the back!</i>

15:58.800 --> 16:00.470
<i>If we can slash them at the same time...</i>

16:09.850 --> 16:11.310
Nezuko!

16:11.690 --> 16:12.650
Tokito!

16:22.870 --> 16:25.080
This is fun!

16:25.080 --> 16:28.080
That peanut sure went flying!

16:28.080 --> 16:29.960
Right, Sekido?

16:30.330 --> 16:32.500
There's nothing fun about this!

16:32.500 --> 16:35.130
All I'm feeling is rage!

16:35.500 --> 16:36.760
Karaku!

16:36.760 --> 16:39.130
That also goes for being lumped in with you!

16:39.130 --> 16:39.590
UPPER FOUR
PLEASURE

16:39.590 --> 16:40.260
UPPER FOUR

16:40.260 --> 16:41.760
Is that right?
UPPER FOUR

16:41.760 --> 16:44.260
Well, good thing we got separated, then!
UPPER FOUR

16:45.060 --> 16:46.260
<i>Again...</i>

16:46.260 --> 16:49.850
<i>are we going to have to behead
these two at once?</i>

16:49.850 --> 16:52.060
UPPER FOUR

16:57.610 --> 16:58.900
<i>What...</i>

16:58.900 --> 17:00.700
<i>is this?</i>

17:01.280 --> 17:03.200
<i>That staff!</i>

17:03.950 --> 17:06.370
<i>This is bad... I'm about to...</i>

17:06.700 --> 17:08.410
<i>lose consciousness!</i>

17:10.410 --> 17:11.960
<i>Someone's...</i>

17:12.370 --> 17:13.960
<i>on the roof?</i>

17:15.040 --> 17:16.460
<i>Genya...</i>

17:19.170 --> 17:20.300
UPPER

17:22.840 --> 17:24.890
<i>What is that weapon?</i>

17:24.890 --> 17:28.220
<i>A gun? It has the same scent
as a Nichirin Sword!</i>

17:30.390 --> 17:32.100
So I missed one of them.

17:36.860 --> 17:39.990
Well, isn't this fun and entertaining!

17:39.990 --> 17:42.860
I've never been hit with an attack
that felt like that!

17:44.030 --> 17:45.240
It's no good, Genya!

17:45.240 --> 17:47.370
No matter how powerful
your weapon is, this demon...

17:49.240 --> 17:52.370
can't be defeated! If you slash it, it's only
going to split into that many more demons!

17:52.660 --> 17:54.870
It gets younger! It gets stronger!

17:54.870 --> 17:57.040
It's making us behead them on purpose!

17:59.420 --> 18:02.420
<i>This demon doesn't care about
being decapitated.</i>

18:02.800 --> 18:04.680
<i>Meaning that its vital spot isn't its head!</i>

18:05.260 --> 18:08.100
<i>It's splitting into four!
It's regenerating fast!</i>

18:08.350 --> 18:11.470
<i>Is there a pattern here?
Which part will heal up first?</i>

18:12.100 --> 18:14.480
<i>There's got to be a vital spot!</i>

18:14.890 --> 18:17.310
<i>Find it! Figure it out!</i>

18:17.730 --> 18:18.980
<i>What is it?</i>

18:21.070 --> 18:23.070
<i>I thought it split up into four demons!</i>

18:27.410 --> 18:29.370
This makes my heart sing!

18:29.370 --> 18:32.700
It's been so long since I was last split off!

18:33.080 --> 18:35.000
<i>This demon can fly!</i>

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
<i>All four of them have different powers!</i>

18:37.330 --> 18:40.340
Nezuko! Don't worry about me!
I want you to help Genya—

18:44.090 --> 18:44.880
UPPER FOUR

18:44.880 --> 18:47.090
You're so weak, it's sad.
UPPER FOUR

18:50.680 --> 18:52.850
Genya!

18:52.850 --> 18:54.430
Nezuko, save him!

18:54.430 --> 18:57.810
Save Genya! Please! Hurry!

18:58.270 --> 19:01.820
Worrying about someone else?
How confident we are!

19:05.610 --> 19:06.780
<i>Hinokami Kagura!</i>

19:15.790 --> 19:16.330
UPPER FOUR

19:16.330 --> 19:20.710
Not bad. This is quite delightful!
UPPER FOUR

19:20.710 --> 19:21.590
JOY
UPPER FOUR

19:23.000 --> 19:25.050
<i>Grab onto a branch! A branch!</i>

19:36.480 --> 19:37.890
<i>Get up right now!</i>

19:37.890 --> 19:39.400
<i>Get on your feet!</i>

19:39.400 --> 19:41.360
<i>The villagers are in danger, too!</i>

19:41.360 --> 19:43.070
<i>I have to protect them!</i>

19:43.070 --> 19:46.030
<i>Dammit! My body's numb!</i>

19:46.030 --> 19:48.110
<i>I can't hear, either!</i>

20:01.080 --> 20:02.630
<i>I got blasted quite far away.</i>

20:03.210 --> 20:05.170
<i>I've got to get back as soon as I can.</i>

20:10.510 --> 20:11.720
<i>A demon and a child.</i>

20:12.850 --> 20:17.020
<i>As a swordsmith,
the child is still unseasoned.</i>

20:17.390 --> 20:19.810
<i>Saving him is a low priority.</i>

20:20.350 --> 20:25.030
<i>Judging by its presence, that's not the main body,
but something generated by a spell.</i>

20:29.360 --> 20:31.620
<i>There's no reason to stop now.</i>

20:32.280 --> 20:35.950
<i>If the entire village is under attack,
the village chief comes first,</i>

20:35.950 --> 20:39.870
<i>then those with greater skills and talents
are my top priority to protect.</i>

20:43.880 --> 20:48.720
<i>My job right now is to destroy
that Upper Rank demon and protect the village.</i>

20:50.430 --> 20:53.970
<i>Saving an inexperienced,
budding swordsmith isn't going to...</i>

20:54.600 --> 20:59.020
<i>Whatever you do for others
comes around to help you, as well, in the end.</i>

21:15.580 --> 21:17.080
Run.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.580
You...

21:24.580 --> 21:27.590
You're in my way, so just run.

23:01.010 --> 23:01.470
PART 3

23:02.970 --> 23:06.480
A demon showed up while Mr. Haganezuka
was working on your sword,

23:06.480 --> 23:07.900
but are you all right?

23:07.900 --> 23:12.400
Yes. After all, Mr. Haganezuka
forged this sword for me, too.

23:12.400 --> 23:15.700
But I have to say
that Mr. Haganezuka is the same as ever!

23:15.700 --> 23:18.110
That one's never
going to change for the better!

23:19.950 --> 23:22.450
Now, it's time for a Taisho-era secret!

23:22.740 --> 23:25.460
The reason why Mr. Haganezuka has
wind chimes tied to his umbrella...

23:25.460 --> 23:27.080
is because he loves wind chimes.

23:27.080 --> 23:27.500
VILLAGE CHIEF
TECCHIN'S FACE

23:27.500 --> 23:30.090
And when he was little,
every time he threw a tantrum,
VILLAGE CHIEF
TECCHIN'S FACE

23:30.090 --> 23:33.460
the grown-ups around him
would play wind chimes to quiet him.
VILLAGE CHIEF
TECCHIN'S FACE

23:33.800 --> 23:35.130
I didn't know that.

23:35.130 --> 23:36.760
This is for you, Mr. Tanjiro.

23:36.760 --> 23:42.060
If you think something like that will put me
in a better mood, you couldn't be more wrong!

23:42.350 --> 23:43.600
There, there, there!

23:43.850 --> 23:45.600
Stop treating me like a child!

23:45.850 --> 23:47.060
There, there, there!

23:47.640 --> 23:50.560
Next, Episode 4, "Thank You, Tokito."

23:50.860 --> 23:51.940
Have you calmed down now?

23:51.940 --> 23:53.730
I said, I'm not a child!

23:53.730 --> 23:54.940
There, there, there!

23:54.940 --> 23:56.030
