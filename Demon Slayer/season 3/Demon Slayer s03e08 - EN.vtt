00:03.560 --> 00:05.060
<i>You're not getting away!</i>

00:15.240 --> 00:16.370
<i>It's tiny...</i>

00:17.080 --> 00:18.660
<i>and hard to target!</i>

00:23.250 --> 00:24.830
<i>All right! I can do it!</i>

00:25.130 --> 00:31.970
FEAR

02:02.760 --> 02:07.940
EPISODE 7:
AWFUL VILLAIN

02:12.980 --> 02:14.690
<i>What a horrible voice!</i>

02:14.690 --> 02:15.690
<i>My ears!</i>

02:16.690 --> 02:17.610
<i>But...</i>

02:17.610 --> 02:18.820
<i>I can do it!</i>

02:18.820 --> 02:19.950
<i>I can behead it!</i>

02:24.040 --> 02:25.870
HATRED

02:26.750 --> 02:27.830
<i>What's this?</i>

02:27.830 --> 02:29.370
<i>Behind me...</i>

02:29.790 --> 02:31.460
<i>There's something behind me!</i>

02:33.460 --> 02:34.210
<i>Joy!</i>

02:34.210 --> 02:34.960
<i>Anger!</i>

02:34.960 --> 02:35.670
<i>Sorrow!</i>

02:35.670 --> 02:36.550
<i>Pleasure!</i>

02:36.920 --> 02:39.510
<i>This doesn't smell like any other demon!</i>

02:39.970 --> 02:41.220
<i>What's behind me?</i>

02:41.220 --> 02:42.470
<i>What should I do?</i>

02:46.520 --> 02:48.520
<i>I'm just going to focus
on slashing its head off!</i>

02:48.520 --> 02:50.440
<i>If I can just behead it, I'm sureâ€”</i>

02:54.320 --> 02:55.020
<i>Too hard!</i>

02:55.730 --> 02:57.490
<i>I can't slash any farther!</i>

02:57.820 --> 03:00.280
<i>The power from Nezuko's blood
has run out, too!</i>

03:00.570 --> 03:02.200
Tanjiro! Get out of the way!

03:02.530 --> 03:03.450
<i>It's no good!</i>

03:03.450 --> 03:05.030
<i>That was the wrong call!</i>

03:06.120 --> 03:07.950
<i>Genya can't fire his gun...</i>

03:07.950 --> 03:09.870
<i>without hitting me, as well!</i>

03:14.590 --> 03:16.130
<i>Oh, crap!</i>

03:16.130 --> 03:17.420
HATRED

03:17.420 --> 03:18.840
DESTROY
<i>Here comes an attack!</i>

03:58.800 --> 04:00.090
Nezuko!

04:07.640 --> 04:08.520
Nezuko!

04:08.520 --> 04:09.600
Are you okay?

04:13.600 --> 04:14.980
Nezuko!

04:18.360 --> 04:19.440
<i>She'll be fine!</i>

04:19.780 --> 04:22.400
<i>Her arms and legs have regenerated!</i>

04:27.830 --> 04:30.830
You brutal fiends who torment the weak...

04:32.580 --> 04:33.670
Atrocious...

04:34.080 --> 04:35.460
Offensive...

04:36.670 --> 04:38.550
to the extreme.

04:38.960 --> 04:40.630
UPPER FOUR

04:50.180 --> 04:52.730
Damn you, awful villains...

04:54.350 --> 04:56.020
<i>A sixth...</i>

04:56.400 --> 04:57.980
<i>demon?</i>

04:58.440 --> 05:00.150
<i>Another one showed up?</i>

05:00.150 --> 05:02.490
<i>Come on, enough is enough!</i>

05:03.320 --> 05:04.490
<i>No.</i>

05:04.490 --> 05:06.740
<i>That's not the sixth one.</i>

05:07.950 --> 05:09.280
<i>The four Emotions.</i>

05:10.290 --> 05:12.620
<i>There's no trace of the other demons!</i>

05:15.370 --> 05:17.000
<i>What the hell is this?</i>

05:17.000 --> 05:19.250
<i>What's going on here?</i>

05:20.000 --> 05:23.590
<i>That one was the Anger Demon
just a second ago!</i>

05:25.470 --> 05:30.560
<i>The moment Tanjiro's sword
nearly slashed that tiny demon's neck...</i>

05:37.310 --> 05:40.060
<i>the Anger Demon raised both hands!</i>

05:41.780 --> 05:44.150
<i>And in the blink of an eye,
he drew in...</i>

05:45.030 --> 05:46.150
<i>the Joy Demon and the Pleasure Demon!</i>

05:46.150 --> 05:47.070
UPPER FOUR
<i>the Joy Demon and the Pleasure Demon!</i>

05:47.070 --> 05:47.910
UPPER FOUR

05:48.280 --> 05:50.870
<i>He pulverized their flesh...</i>

05:50.870 --> 05:53.410
<i>then absorbed both demons!</i>

05:54.160 --> 05:56.250
<i>Then, in another instant...</i>

05:56.250 --> 05:59.580
<i>the Anger Demon moved toward Aizetsu!</i>

06:00.130 --> 06:02.420
<i>Aizetsu opened his mouth as if to protest...</i>
UPPER
FOUR

06:02.420 --> 06:03.880
<i>Aizetsu opened his mouth as if to protest...</i>

06:04.460 --> 06:07.260
<i>but he was absorbed
before he could get a word out!</i>

06:13.350 --> 06:15.930
<i>The Anger Demon's body transformed...</i>

06:15.930 --> 06:17.560
<i>and turned into that!</i>

06:23.270 --> 06:25.280
<i>What's up with that?</i>

06:26.990 --> 06:29.780
<i>He absorbed those three demons?</i>

06:29.780 --> 06:31.570
<i>Did he fuse with them?</i>

06:44.500 --> 06:47.510
<i>This wasn't a split,
but he got even younger!</i>

06:48.260 --> 06:49.720
<i>He's a kid!</i>

06:49.720 --> 06:52.890
<i>He's surpassed the probable main body,
the old geezer...</i>

06:52.890 --> 06:54.220
<i>and fused!</i>

07:00.600 --> 07:01.900
<i>Oh, crap!</i>

07:01.900 --> 07:03.360
<i>The main body's being surrounded!</i>

07:03.360 --> 07:04.020
Hold up!

07:18.620 --> 07:20.290
<i>I can't breathe!</i>

07:20.750 --> 07:22.420
<i>It's so overpowering!</i>

07:27.170 --> 07:29.010
<i>My heart hurts!</i>

07:37.100 --> 07:38.810
What is it?

07:39.680 --> 07:41.190
You wretch...

07:41.190 --> 07:45.820
Do you have a problem
with what I'm doing?

07:53.660 --> 07:54.820
Well...

07:55.240 --> 07:56.450
you...

07:56.910 --> 07:58.700
awful villains?

08:03.880 --> 08:05.170
<i>So heavy!</i>

08:05.170 --> 08:06.380
<i>That voice!</i>

08:06.380 --> 08:08.090
<i>That force!</i>

08:08.840 --> 08:11.880
<i>It's sapping the strength from my limbs!</i>

08:12.550 --> 08:14.720
<i>I can't stay on my feet!</i>

08:27.360 --> 08:28.610
What makes...

08:29.110 --> 08:31.190
What makes us...

08:31.650 --> 08:33.400
awful villains?

08:34.200 --> 08:37.120
It's because you torment the weak.

08:37.120 --> 08:38.160
Right?

08:38.160 --> 08:44.290
Just now, you tried to slash a small, weak being
who could fit in the palm of your hand.

08:55.390 --> 08:58.470
Utterly atrocious!

08:58.470 --> 09:02.180
Only a pure fiend would do that!

09:03.480 --> 09:06.940
Small, weak being?

09:09.360 --> 09:10.730
Who...

09:10.730 --> 09:12.070
Who's small and weak?

09:12.440 --> 09:13.820
Don't give me that!

09:14.820 --> 09:16.950
That scent you're giving off...

09:16.950 --> 09:18.620
The scent of blood...

09:18.620 --> 09:22.330
It's not just 100 or even 200 humans
that you've devoured!

09:23.120 --> 09:26.210
What did those people ever do to you?

09:27.000 --> 09:32.340
Did they all do something
they had to pay for with their lives?

09:33.130 --> 09:37.760
Don't you dare play the victim card
after killing and eating scores of people!

09:37.760 --> 09:40.050
You're twisted through and through!

09:40.470 --> 09:42.600
You won't get away with this!

09:44.180 --> 09:45.350
You evil demon...

09:45.890 --> 09:48.440
I'll be the one to behead you!

09:54.940 --> 09:59.950
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
SWORDSMITH VILLAGE ARC

09:59.950 --> 10:04.950
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
SWORDSMITH VILLAGE ARC

10:26.600 --> 10:28.020
<i>That demon...</i>

10:28.020 --> 10:29.900
<i>How can it be so overpowering?</i>

10:29.900 --> 10:31.980
<i>I can't move a muscle!</i>

10:35.320 --> 10:37.650
Is that all you have to say?

10:40.620 --> 10:42.160
I'm going to...

10:42.490 --> 10:44.330
cut your head off!

10:45.200 --> 10:50.330
Were any of the humans I devoured
members of your family?

10:52.500 --> 10:54.210
No.

10:54.920 --> 10:57.920
Then, it has nothing to do with you.

10:58.260 --> 11:00.550
That's not what I'm talking about!

11:00.550 --> 11:02.180
People like that...

11:02.180 --> 11:04.720
people who will suffer
the same way after this...

11:04.720 --> 11:06.980
I'm not letting any more go through that!

11:07.520 --> 11:11.190
Surely, you have nothing to do
with those people, either.

11:11.190 --> 11:14.360
What kind of reason
does one person need to help another?

11:15.940 --> 11:19.820
If you can't understand something like that,
then you're the fiend!

11:43.090 --> 11:44.890
Hyo, hyo, hyo!

11:44.890 --> 11:45.310
UPPER FIVE

11:45.310 --> 11:48.220
That look of fake stoicism...
UPPER FIVE

11:48.220 --> 11:50.600
How very sublime it is!
UPPER FIVE

11:50.600 --> 11:54.650
My creative juices are simply gushing!
UPPER FIVE

11:58.990 --> 12:04.820
Not that I wouldn't love to stay
and watch you die in there a bit longer...

12:06.490 --> 12:11.460
but first, I'll be taking a look
inside this shack.

12:12.620 --> 12:17.210
Now, what on earth could they
be protecting so fiercely here?

12:17.210 --> 12:18.710
Hyo, hyo, hyo!

12:26.180 --> 12:28.600
<i>With the air left in my lungs...</i>

12:29.770 --> 12:32.730
<i>I can just manage one more attack!</i>

12:34.270 --> 12:35.560
<i>Mist Breathing...</i>

12:35.940 --> 12:37.360
<i>First Form...</i>

12:38.110 --> 12:40.240
<i>Low Clouds Distance Haze!</i>

12:45.700 --> 12:48.490
<i>I can't break through
even with this thrust attack.</i>

12:48.830 --> 12:52.120
<i>It's no wonder,
given how badly chipped this sword is.</i>

12:58.000 --> 12:59.550
<i>It's futile.</i>

12:59.550 --> 13:00.920
<i>It's over.</i>

13:04.510 --> 13:07.180
<i>I hope that help is on the way.</i>

13:10.350 --> 13:11.680
<i>Master...</i>

13:12.730 --> 13:14.390
<i>I'm going to die...</i>

13:15.350 --> 13:17.150
<i>so please send...</i>

13:17.150 --> 13:19.150
<i>at least two Hashira.</i>

13:22.990 --> 13:24.900
What makes you think that?

13:31.580 --> 13:33.910
What makes you think that?

13:35.170 --> 13:38.380
Nobody knows what the future holds.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.300
<i>What's that?</i>

13:42.880 --> 13:44.300
<i>No, wait.</i>

13:45.300 --> 13:47.050
<i>Tanjiro never...</i>

13:47.050 --> 13:49.350
<i>said such a thing to me.</i>

13:51.890 --> 13:54.180
<i>So, who...</i>

13:54.180 --> 13:55.810
<i>did say it?</i>

13:57.480 --> 13:58.440
No, you don't!

13:58.440 --> 14:00.400
I won't let you inside!

14:00.400 --> 14:01.980
Hyo, hyo!

14:01.980 --> 14:05.240
Why do you even bother?

14:05.570 --> 14:10.530
Could it be that you actually think
you can fend me off somehow?

14:11.620 --> 14:13.580
Hyo, hyo, hyo!

14:13.950 --> 14:15.910
Well, that's...

14:16.250 --> 14:17.920
comical!

14:25.300 --> 14:30.010
What good will it do you
to frantically defend this sorry shack?

14:30.010 --> 14:34.600
The village chief
wouldn't be here, right?

14:36.430 --> 14:37.440
Hmm?

14:42.980 --> 14:45.030
Hmm?

14:51.160 --> 14:53.240
Extraordinary steel!

14:53.240 --> 14:55.370
What an extraordinary sword!

14:57.250 --> 14:59.670
<i>That human is young.</i>

14:59.670 --> 15:02.460
<i>The body of someone not yet 40.</i>

15:02.460 --> 15:04.800
<i>Surely he's not the chief.</i>

15:05.510 --> 15:07.760
Such brilliant craftsmanship!

15:07.760 --> 15:09.760
It's stunning!

15:11.220 --> 15:12.300
Hmm...

15:12.680 --> 15:16.060
Hey, you human there!

15:16.640 --> 15:18.850
Who is the creator?

15:18.850 --> 15:21.770
By what kind of person
was this sword forged?

15:21.770 --> 15:26.320
Why did he carve this single character
rather than his own name?

15:26.320 --> 15:27.320
No!

15:27.320 --> 15:28.570
I understand!

15:28.900 --> 15:30.610
I understand why!

15:32.410 --> 15:33.580
<i>Damn him!</i>

15:34.410 --> 15:37.160
<i>What kind of focus is that?</i>

15:37.160 --> 15:40.750
<i>He's so immersed that he's unaware of me!</i>

15:41.170 --> 15:42.380
<i>I...</i>

15:42.380 --> 15:44.500
<i>I don't like this!</i>

15:45.920 --> 15:50.130
<i>Even I've never concentrated this hard!</i>

15:50.130 --> 15:54.010
<i>As an artist, I feel inferior!</i>

15:58.270 --> 15:59.310
Hyo!

15:59.680 --> 16:00.770
Stop it!

16:01.100 --> 16:02.690
Mr. Haganezuka!

16:06.860 --> 16:09.190
M-Mr. Haganezuka...

16:09.190 --> 16:10.240
<i>What the...</i>

16:20.330 --> 16:24.500
<i>Th-That man still refuses to stop!</i>

16:25.340 --> 16:30.840
The reason why he didn't carve his name
into such an incredible sword...

16:30.840 --> 16:32.680
This single character!

16:32.680 --> 16:37.010
This sword was forged with nothing
but single-minded determination!

16:37.010 --> 16:38.260
This sword...

16:38.600 --> 16:42.310
was forged for this sole purpose
and nothing else!

16:43.900 --> 16:45.520
Mr. Haganezuka!

16:48.820 --> 16:50.990
<i>I don't like this!</i>

16:50.990 --> 16:54.030
<i>It would be child's play to kill him,</i>

16:54.030 --> 16:57.910
<i>but I want to somehow make this man
abandon that sword!</i>

16:58.450 --> 17:01.410
<i>I want to shatter his concentration!</i>

17:15.470 --> 17:16.930
<i>My vision...</i>

17:17.350 --> 17:19.390
<i>is getting distorted.</i>

17:20.560 --> 17:21.600
<i>I'm dying.</i>

17:22.680 --> 17:24.560
<i>I'm out of air.</i>

17:26.310 --> 17:30.190
You can't decide for yourself
when it's all over.

17:32.070 --> 17:34.950
<i>You never told me that.</i>

17:36.200 --> 17:38.070
I promise you, it will be all right.

17:38.070 --> 17:39.410
Don't give up.

17:39.830 --> 17:42.580
Someone will save you for sure.

17:43.870 --> 17:45.120
<i>Come on.</i>

17:45.460 --> 17:47.750
<i>So, I have to leave it to someone else?</i>

17:47.750 --> 17:50.420
<i>That's the worst thing I could do.</i>

17:51.380 --> 17:55.550
This is about all anyone can do on their own.

17:55.550 --> 17:59.260
That's why people join forces
and work together.

18:01.970 --> 18:04.350
<i>There's no one who can save me...</i>

18:05.350 --> 18:07.900
<i>because everyone's weaker than I am.</i>

18:09.480 --> 18:13.030
<i>I'm the one
who should've been stronger.</i>

18:13.650 --> 18:15.570
<i>But I misjudged myself.</i>

18:16.400 --> 18:19.320
<i>I overestimated my own skills...</i>

18:19.320 --> 18:20.660
<i>subconsciously...</i>

18:21.030 --> 18:23.120
<i>because I'm a Hashira.</i>

18:25.120 --> 18:27.460
You're not wrong, Muichiro.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.540
You'll be fine.

18:33.090 --> 18:36.840
<i>I'm going to die
because I made more than one mistake.</i>

18:40.890 --> 18:42.350
Mr. Tokito!

18:42.760 --> 18:44.100
I won't let you die!

18:44.100 --> 18:45.770
Mr. Tokito, hang in there!

18:45.770 --> 18:46.310
HYOTTOKO

18:46.310 --> 18:49.350
I'll get you out, no matter what!
I'm going to save you!
HYOTTOKO

18:49.350 --> 18:49.690
HYOTTOKO

18:49.690 --> 18:52.230
Crap! What is this?
HYOTTOKO

18:52.230 --> 18:54.440
It's all rubbery and disgusting!
HYOTTOKO

18:55.320 --> 18:58.990
<i>If even I can't slash through it,
how on earth can you?</i>

19:00.120 --> 19:03.580
<i>You have bigger priorities
than me right now.</i>

19:04.240 --> 19:06.120
<i>Protect the chief.</i>

19:08.540 --> 19:11.080
<i>Oh, that would be beyond you.</i>

19:11.630 --> 19:15.050
<i>At least make a run for it
with as many swords as you can hold.</i>

19:23.680 --> 19:25.720
<i>What are you doing? Behind you!</i>

19:26.180 --> 19:27.020
<i>Hello!</i>

19:27.350 --> 19:28.480
<i>Behind you!</i>

19:34.520 --> 19:35.360
Blood!

19:35.360 --> 19:37.490
<i>What are you doing? What are you doing?</i>

19:37.490 --> 19:38.820
<i>Just run!</i>

19:38.820 --> 19:40.160
<i>Hurry the hell up!</i>

19:52.210 --> 19:53.420
<i>His solar plexus.</i>

19:53.790 --> 19:55.340
<i>He got stabbed in a vital point.</i>

19:56.170 --> 19:57.340
<i>He's going to die.</i>

19:59.720 --> 20:01.380
<i>You're not strong enough!</i>

20:01.680 --> 20:03.090
<i>Why don't you get it?</i>

20:03.550 --> 20:05.180
<i>Put pressure on that wound!</i>

20:05.180 --> 20:06.600
<i>Get the hell out of here!</i>

20:07.100 --> 20:08.980
<i>Stay away from me!</i>

20:08.980 --> 20:10.600
<i>Don't try to save me!</i>

20:11.140 --> 20:13.150
<i>There's nothing you can do!</i>

20:29.500 --> 20:35.460
<i>Whatever you do for others
comes around to help you, as well, in the end.</i>

20:41.380 --> 20:43.260
<i>And humans are creatures...</i>

20:43.590 --> 20:46.140
<i>who can summon unbelievable strength...</i>

20:46.140 --> 20:50.390
<i>for the sake of someone
other than themselves...</i>

20:51.980 --> 20:53.770
<i>Muichiro.</i>

20:57.150 --> 20:58.440
<i>Yes, I know.</i>

21:04.950 --> 21:07.780
<i>Mist Breathing, Second Form...</i>

21:08.450 --> 21:10.040
<i>Eight-Layered Mist!</i>

21:19.340 --> 21:21.630
<i>I remember now, Tanjiro.</i>

21:23.630 --> 21:25.300
<i>My father...</i>

21:25.800 --> 21:27.550
<i>had the same...</i>

21:27.890 --> 21:30.310
<i>red eyes as you!</i>

23:00.940 --> 23:01.400
PART 7

23:08.450 --> 23:10.200
30 KG

23:10.570 --> 23:13.080
So, this is what you've been up to in secret?

23:13.080 --> 23:16.200
But why should you have to go this far?

23:16.580 --> 23:19.960
The swordsman puts his life
on the line in battle...

23:20.380 --> 23:24.960
so his swordsmith should feel
even more pressure...

23:25.260 --> 23:27.630
as he pours his soul into his sword!

23:27.630 --> 23:28.970
Oh yeah?

23:29.380 --> 23:32.100
Now, it's time for a Taisho-era secret!

23:32.470 --> 23:35.520
The knife he was wielding
when he chased after Mr. Tanjiro...

23:36.020 --> 23:37.890
was forged by Mr. Haganezuka himself...

23:37.890 --> 23:40.230
but since it's unbelievably sharp,

23:40.230 --> 23:42.770
he says he's too scared
to use it for cooking!

23:42.770 --> 23:45.020
Is that totally pointless or what?

23:47.690 --> 23:48.860
Mr. Haganezuka?

23:48.860 --> 23:49.860
Scary, scary, scary!

23:49.860 --> 23:51.870
Mr. Haganezuka,
you're scaring me! So scary!

23:51.870 --> 23:54.660
Next, Episode 8, "The Mu in Muichiro"!

23:54.660 --> 23:55.950
