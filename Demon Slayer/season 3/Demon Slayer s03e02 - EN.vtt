WEBVTT

00:25.710 --> 00:27.750
This is awful.

00:27.750 --> 00:31.340
What kind of battle do you have to wage
to end up like this?

00:38.220 --> 00:39.220
Found them!

00:39.550 --> 00:41.850
Everyone! I need you to come!

00:41.850 --> 00:44.180
They're here!

00:45.600 --> 00:47.350
Is that right?

00:47.350 --> 00:48.610
They defeated it?

00:48.610 --> 00:50.110
An Upper Rank?

00:52.690 --> 00:54.440
Master Kagaya...

00:54.440 --> 00:56.200
For a hundred years...

00:56.200 --> 00:59.910
For a hundred years,
nothing had changed!

00:59.910 --> 01:01.700
But now it has!

01:02.160 --> 01:03.580
Do you see?

01:03.580 --> 01:05.580
This is an omen!

01:06.540 --> 01:09.460
Fate is about to take a dramatic turn!

01:09.710 --> 01:12.340
The consequences will be widespread!

01:12.340 --> 01:15.470
Sweeping up everything around them,
shaking them to their core!

01:16.090 --> 01:19.970
And eventually, they will reach that man!

01:20.510 --> 01:22.640
Muzan Kibutsuji!

01:22.890 --> 01:29.020
We will defeat you without fail
during our generation!

01:29.020 --> 01:33.320
You, the sole blemish on my family!

02:45.430 --> 02:47.390
<i>The alternate dimension.</i>

02:47.850 --> 02:49.350
<i>The Infinity Castle.</i>

02:50.100 --> 02:52.900
<i>The fact that I was summoned here means...</i>

02:53.560 --> 02:56.110
<i>that an Upper Rank
was killed by the Demon Slayers!</i>

04:27.030 --> 04:33.540
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
SWORDSMITH VILLAGE ARC

04:41.960 --> 04:45.130
Well, well, if it isn't you, Lord Akaza!

04:55.600 --> 04:59.060
So lovely to see you in such good health!

04:59.060 --> 05:02.820
What has it been, 90 years?

05:08.450 --> 05:13.370
The thought that you might've perished
made my heart sing—

05:15.620 --> 05:19.630
It made my worried heart fill with anguish!

05:24.300 --> 05:27.050
Terrifying! Terrifying!

05:27.050 --> 05:32.970
In the time we've been apart,
you've even forgotten how to count, Gyokko.

05:34.270 --> 05:37.980
It's been 113 years
since we were last summoned.

05:38.560 --> 05:40.730
An indivisible number...

05:40.730 --> 05:42.730
Unlucky and uneven...

05:43.070 --> 05:44.400
An odd number!

05:44.400 --> 05:46.780
Terrifying! Terrifying!

05:47.280 --> 05:48.950
Biwa Woman!

05:48.950 --> 05:51.620
Is Lord Muzan not here?

05:53.450 --> 05:56.290
He has not yet arrived.

05:56.830 --> 05:59.620
Then, where's Upper One?

06:00.080 --> 06:03.170
Don't tell me he's been killed.

06:03.460 --> 06:04.960
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:08.550 --> 06:12.140
Hold up a second, will you, Lord Akaza?

06:14.680 --> 06:17.930
Aren't you even
a little bit worried about me?

06:18.180 --> 06:21.350
You don't know
how dreadfully worried I was,

06:21.350 --> 06:23.860
since you all are cherished comrades of mine!

06:23.860 --> 06:27.610
And I'd be heartbroken
if I lost any of my comrades.

06:27.610 --> 06:28.400
Hyo!

06:28.820 --> 06:30.700
Lord Doma!

06:32.870 --> 06:33.830
Hey there!

06:34.080 --> 06:35.830
Long time no see, Gyokko!

06:36.160 --> 06:38.330
Is that a brand-new pot?

06:38.330 --> 06:40.040
It's a beauty!

06:40.040 --> 06:41.580
You know the pot you gave me?

06:42.080 --> 06:44.840
I'm displaying a woman's head in it!

06:45.090 --> 06:46.500
In my room.

06:47.260 --> 06:50.550
That wasn't its intended use.

06:50.550 --> 06:53.470
But I do find it intriguing!

06:53.470 --> 06:54.220
Listen!

06:54.800 --> 06:57.220
You should come over
to my place sometime.

06:57.220 --> 06:58.680
Get off.

06:58.680 --> 06:59.930
Huh?

07:00.600 --> 07:02.310
Get your hand off me!

07:13.360 --> 07:14.660
Whoa!

07:17.120 --> 07:20.160
Wow, that was some punch.

07:20.160 --> 07:24.500
A bit stronger than before,
would you say, Lord Akaza?

07:28.920 --> 07:32.930
I summoned Upper One here first.

07:33.300 --> 07:35.930
Even now he's listening to us.

07:42.890 --> 07:45.400
I've been here the entire time.

07:48.360 --> 07:51.570
Lord Muzan has arrived.

08:19.810 --> 08:22.270
Gyutaro is no longer with us.

08:23.060 --> 08:25.900
Meaning the Upper Ranks
are now incomplete.

08:31.530 --> 08:33.740
Is that true, my lord?

08:33.740 --> 08:36.490
You have my sincerest apologies!

08:36.490 --> 08:39.740
Since I was the one
who brought Gyutaro in.

08:39.740 --> 08:42.250
How can I atone
for this embarrassment?

08:42.250 --> 08:43.540
Shall I...

08:43.540 --> 08:45.290
gouge out my eyeballs?

08:45.620 --> 08:46.330
Or should I—

08:46.330 --> 08:50.670
I have no need
for your wretched eyeballs.

08:53.300 --> 08:56.550
I knew that Gyutaro would be defeated.

08:56.550 --> 09:00.600
As expected,
Daki proved to be his weakness.

09:04.430 --> 09:08.610
Had Gyutaro fought alone from the start,
he would've won.

09:09.520 --> 09:14.110
If the battle hadn't gone on
after he'd poisoned them.

09:15.740 --> 09:17.070
Oh well.

09:18.410 --> 09:20.870
It doesn't matter anymore.

09:27.790 --> 09:29.630
How worthless.

09:31.380 --> 09:36.220
Can't you see you're falling in order of who has
the most of their humanity remaining?

09:39.510 --> 09:42.470
But neither does that matter anymore.

09:43.100 --> 09:46.850
I expect nothing of you all.

09:53.110 --> 09:56.690
There you go again
with the melancholic words.

09:57.320 --> 10:02.280
Has there ever been a time
when I didn't meet your expectations?

10:05.870 --> 10:10.120
You still haven't annihilated
the Ubuyashiki Family.

10:11.250 --> 10:14.340
What about the Blue Spider Lily?

10:24.720 --> 10:28.060
Why can't you find it
after so many hundreds of years?

10:32.560 --> 10:34.480
I'm...

10:35.020 --> 10:39.400
starting to question
why you all even exist.

10:45.120 --> 10:47.200
Oh! Please forgive us!

10:47.200 --> 10:49.410
I beg of you!

10:52.460 --> 10:55.000
I don't know what to tell you.

10:55.750 --> 10:57.960
Ubuyashiki...

10:57.960 --> 11:01.800
is a master at concealing himself.

11:02.220 --> 11:06.470
Search and detection
isn't my strong suit, either.

11:06.470 --> 11:08.640
I'm at my wits' end.

11:09.350 --> 11:13.310
Lord Muzan! Not me!

11:13.310 --> 11:20.530
I've acquired some information
that will bring you a step closer to your goals!

11:20.530 --> 11:22.240
A mere moment ago—

11:23.780 --> 11:27.370
The one thing I dislike is change.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.290
Changes in circumstances.

11:32.290 --> 11:34.290
Physical changes.

11:34.290 --> 11:36.420
Emotional changes.

11:36.920 --> 11:40.130
In most cases, change of any kind
means degradation.

11:40.550 --> 11:42.680
It's decay.

11:42.680 --> 11:45.510
I prefer the unchanging.

11:45.510 --> 11:50.180
A perfect unchanging state
that lasts forever.

11:51.430 --> 11:53.190
<i>Ah!</i>

11:53.190 --> 11:57.270
<i>To have Lord Muzan's hand on my head!</i>

11:57.270 --> 11:59.900
<i>How sublime!</i>

12:05.370 --> 12:10.620
For the first time in 113 years,
an Upper Rank has been killed...

12:10.620 --> 12:14.040
and my frustration
has reached a boiling point!

12:19.050 --> 12:22.130
Don't ever give me
unconfirmed information!

12:22.130 --> 12:25.050
And wipe that smirk off of your face!

12:32.640 --> 12:36.770
I'd advise you all to apply yourselves
with more desperate urgency from now on.

12:37.480 --> 12:40.610
I've been far too lenient
considering your failures...

12:40.610 --> 12:43.740
all because of your status
as Upper Ranks.

12:44.450 --> 12:48.160
Gyokko, once you've confirmed
that information,

12:48.160 --> 12:51.160
head over there with Hantengu.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.670
Understood, my lord!

13:08.510 --> 13:12.640
<i>That's hardly fair! I'm the one
who got the information in the first place!</i>

13:12.640 --> 13:14.890
<i>How annoying is that!</i>

13:16.440 --> 13:19.520
<i>But that's what makes it intriguing!</i>

13:20.940 --> 13:21.900
Huh?

13:22.190 --> 13:23.860
Lord Gyokko!

13:23.860 --> 13:26.400
What kind of information do you have?

13:27.950 --> 13:30.120
I'd like to tag along.

13:30.410 --> 13:33.240
No, that wouldn't be...

13:36.330 --> 13:39.880
Can't you let me in on it?
Please, I'm begging—

13:44.460 --> 13:48.760
Did Lord Muzan give you any orders?

13:49.340 --> 13:50.220
Get lost.

13:56.430 --> 13:57.690
Akaza...

13:59.100 --> 14:01.690
You always go too far.

14:04.690 --> 14:07.200
It's all right, Lord Kokushibo.

14:08.950 --> 14:10.820
I don't mind in the least.

14:11.530 --> 14:14.830
It's not for your benefit that I speak.

14:15.450 --> 14:17.580
Disrupting the hierarchy...

14:18.210 --> 14:23.340
which, in turn, undermines subordination.

14:23.340 --> 14:25.760
That's what dismays me.

14:30.130 --> 14:32.720
Oh, is that right? I see.

14:33.010 --> 14:34.390
Akaza...

14:35.010 --> 14:37.270
If you're disgruntled,

14:37.600 --> 14:41.100
you should battle for a replacement.

14:41.520 --> 14:45.780
Well, well! If I may, Lord Kokushibo,

14:45.780 --> 14:50.530
even if he were to challenge us,
Lord Akaza could never defeat us.

14:51.070 --> 14:55.540
And in my case, since I became
a demon after Lord Akaza...

14:55.870 --> 14:58.120
yet was promoted before him,

14:58.120 --> 15:00.620
I'd be angry, too, if I were in his shoes.

15:01.120 --> 15:02.880
Don't be so hard on him!

15:05.380 --> 15:09.920
And besides, I didn't dodge
that blow on purpose.

15:09.920 --> 15:11.890
It's just a little harmless horseplay!

15:11.890 --> 15:15.140
This is how you nurture friendship, you know.

15:15.760 --> 15:19.180
Those of us on top shouldn't give
our subordinates a hard time.

15:19.180 --> 15:20.310
Don't you think—

15:20.310 --> 15:21.770
Akaza!

15:26.440 --> 15:27.940
Do you understand...

15:28.400 --> 15:30.490
what it is...

15:30.900 --> 15:33.450
I'm trying to say?

15:37.990 --> 15:39.540
I understand.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.790
I'm going to kill you...

15:45.170 --> 15:47.090
if it's the last thing I do.

15:53.300 --> 15:55.010
Is that right?

15:55.550 --> 15:57.760
Then do your best.

16:04.270 --> 16:06.690
Goodbye, Lord Kokushibo!

16:06.690 --> 16:08.020
Goodbye!

16:10.490 --> 16:15.740
It kind of feels like I got shut
out of the conversation.

16:16.070 --> 16:19.830
But that's just me overthinking it,
right, Lord Akaza? Huh?

16:22.330 --> 16:24.830
Lord Akaza!

16:25.830 --> 16:28.090
Hey, I was talking to you.

16:28.880 --> 16:29.500
Huh?

16:32.010 --> 16:36.510
Please send Hantengu and myself
to the same location!

16:41.640 --> 16:44.020
Wait! Can you send me, too?

16:50.280 --> 16:51.280
Hey!

16:51.280 --> 16:53.150
Biwa Lady!

16:53.780 --> 16:55.780
If you're interested,
would you join me for...

16:56.780 --> 16:58.240
I respectfully decline.

17:04.250 --> 17:05.500
Huh.

17:05.870 --> 17:08.590
You're all so cold to me.

17:10.750 --> 17:12.130
Lord Founder...

17:12.130 --> 17:14.510
Your disciples have arrived.

17:14.510 --> 17:16.340
Oh, is that right?

17:16.340 --> 17:17.930
Sorry to keep everyone waiting.

17:18.760 --> 17:20.140
Here we go.

17:20.390 --> 17:21.220
All right.

17:21.220 --> 17:23.020
Let me put this on first.

17:24.230 --> 17:25.770
Ready when you are!

17:26.100 --> 17:28.610
Please send them in.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.190
I've brought you some tea.

17:34.240 --> 17:35.360
Right.

17:35.360 --> 17:36.990
Thank you.

17:37.740 --> 17:41.240
Look how soundly he's sleeping.

17:41.740 --> 17:46.000
Sorry about this.
Looks like my wife's fast asleep, too.

17:46.580 --> 17:48.830
I really must apologize.

17:48.830 --> 17:52.500
Making our guest babysit like this.

17:52.920 --> 17:54.340
No need to apologize.

17:54.800 --> 17:56.470
She must be exhausted.

17:56.840 --> 18:00.010
It's a lot of hard work,
giving birth and raising a child.

18:03.350 --> 18:05.600
I'll be leaving after I've had this.

18:06.480 --> 18:09.940
It wouldn't be right
to keep eating for free here.

18:10.230 --> 18:11.690
Don't say that!

18:11.690 --> 18:13.820
You saved our lives!

18:13.820 --> 18:16.400
If it hadn't been for you,
not only would we be dead,

18:16.400 --> 18:18.860
but this child
wouldn't have been born, either.

18:23.240 --> 18:24.910
Very well.

18:24.910 --> 18:29.170
Then the least I can do
is to pass down your name to posterity.

18:29.170 --> 18:30.880
No need for that.

18:31.210 --> 18:36.550
But didn't you say you were at a loss
because you have no heirs?

18:36.550 --> 18:39.180
Even if a humble charcoal-seller
like myself can't do it,

18:39.180 --> 18:41.470
I'm sure that one day, somebody will.

18:41.470 --> 18:42.800
No need for that...

18:43.350 --> 18:45.060
Sumiyoshi.

18:47.600 --> 18:50.690
Those who have mastered their skill...

18:51.060 --> 18:53.060
share the same fate.

18:53.610 --> 18:55.610
Even if it's a new era.

18:55.610 --> 18:58.900
Even if you must take
a different path to get there,

18:59.450 --> 19:02.070
you'll always find your way
back to the same place.

19:03.990 --> 19:09.660
You seem to perceive me
as some kind of special person,

19:09.660 --> 19:11.500
but you're wrong about that.

19:14.420 --> 19:18.010
I failed to protect anything
that was important to me,

19:18.420 --> 19:22.760
and throughout my life, I was unable
to do what I was supposed to do.

19:24.470 --> 19:27.140
My name is as worthless as I am.

19:28.390 --> 19:31.190
Please don't.

19:31.190 --> 19:33.690
Please don't say something like that.

19:34.190 --> 19:36.190
Please, I'm begging you!

19:36.190 --> 19:38.530
Don't think of yourself like that!

19:39.400 --> 19:40.780
So sad.

19:41.610 --> 19:43.160
So sad.

19:54.540 --> 19:57.880
It... was a dream.

20:06.510 --> 20:07.930
Where...

20:08.850 --> 20:10.230
am I?

20:13.440 --> 20:18.730
Are you okay? You've been in a coma
for two months ever since that battle!

20:20.320 --> 20:23.150
Is that right?

20:23.570 --> 20:25.570
I see.

20:29.160 --> 20:33.080
I'm so glad you woke up!

20:34.960 --> 20:40.000
EPISODE 1:
SOMEONE'S DREAM

20:44.550 --> 20:46.850
<i>My name is Goto.</i>

20:47.260 --> 20:51.520
<i>I'm a member of the Demon Slayer Corps
Cleanup Crew, a Kakushi.</i>

20:52.350 --> 20:55.060
<i>During the Hashira Meeting,
someone said to Tanjiro Kamado,</i>

20:55.060 --> 20:58.400
<i>"Are you going to sleep all day?
Wake the hell up, will you?"</i>

20:58.770 --> 20:59.770
<i>That was me.</i>

21:01.030 --> 21:03.280
<i>It seems fate tends to draw us together.</i>

21:04.820 --> 21:08.910
<i>I was also the one who found him and his friends
two months ago in the Entertainment District.</i>

21:09.580 --> 21:11.540
<i>Since I found them like this...</i>

21:12.000 --> 21:14.540
<i>"They're pretty close!" I thought.</i>

21:14.750 --> 21:19.710
<i>Or so I thought, until I saw that all three of them
were critically wounded and comatose.</i>

21:20.000 --> 21:24.260
<i>They're younger than me, and they became
swordsmen who risked their lives in battle,</i>

21:24.260 --> 21:26.430
<i>so I respect them wholeheartedly.</i>

21:27.260 --> 21:29.850
<i>I have no clue about this one.
What's his deal?</i>

21:31.810 --> 21:36.230
<i>And what I have here in my hands
is premium castella.</i>

21:36.810 --> 21:41.480
<i>To be honest, it's taking everything I have
to stop myself from gobbling it up this second.</i>

21:41.900 --> 21:45.280
<i>But this is a gift for him,
since he's still unconscious.</i>

21:45.900 --> 21:48.990
<i>They say he's got a great sense
of smell, so maybe...</i>

21:57.330 --> 21:59.000
<i>Clean up this mess!</i>

21:59.420 --> 22:01.840
<i>I swear, this girl never sees
anything through!</i>

22:01.840 --> 22:04.880
<i>Gee, Kanao. You never talk,
and you're such a weirdo!</i>

22:04.880 --> 22:08.260
<i>It's all because they made you slay demons
since you were a kid!</i>

22:09.470 --> 22:12.100
<i>Well, it's not like I can scold her
since she's higher ranked than me.</i>

22:12.100 --> 22:13.770
<i>Even though I'm already 23.</i>

22:16.100 --> 22:21.110
Excuse me. I'm going to set this castella down,
so please clear it away after a while.

22:21.110 --> 22:23.530
If it seems like it's about to go bad,
you can have it.

22:24.230 --> 22:27.820
Oh, thank you... very much.

22:31.870 --> 22:34.240
Hey, he's out of his coma!

22:34.240 --> 22:36.540
Make some noise about that!

22:36.540 --> 22:38.870
You really are scatterbrained,
you know that?

22:38.870 --> 22:40.750
You're supposed to call for someone!

22:40.750 --> 22:42.840
Say, "He's regained consciousness!"

22:42.840 --> 22:44.800
You little idiot!

22:45.210 --> 22:47.130
Everyone's worried, okay?

22:47.130 --> 22:51.050
Seniority doesn't mean jack, all right?
At least, not in this case!

22:52.390 --> 22:55.390
Kiyo! Sumi! Naho!

22:55.390 --> 22:57.100
Aoi!

22:57.100 --> 23:00.060
Tanjiro woke up from his coma!

23:06.530 --> 23:08.190
Thank goodness you're okay!

23:08.190 --> 23:09.990
You can have my crackers!

23:09.990 --> 23:12.240
There's castella on the bed!

23:12.240 --> 23:13.410
Gee.

23:18.540 --> 23:21.170
Oh my gosh, it's a ghost!

23:23.750 --> 23:28.010
Oh, it's just Ms. Aoi tangled up in the laundry!

23:28.340 --> 23:31.010
Thank goodness you woke up!

23:31.010 --> 23:33.470
Since you went in my place!

23:33.470 --> 23:34.600
You guys...

23:36.850 --> 23:38.730
Thank you.

23:39.140 --> 23:40.730
What about the others?

23:41.140 --> 23:43.150
Are they all right?

23:43.480 --> 23:46.360
The kid with the yellow hair...
Was it the day before yesterday?

23:46.360 --> 23:47.150
Yes!

23:47.150 --> 23:48.530
He's back at work!

23:48.530 --> 23:50.490
I hear he's already out on a mission.

23:50.490 --> 23:51.610
Against his will.

23:51.610 --> 23:55.660
Mr. Zenitsu woke up the next day.

23:57.240 --> 24:02.330
The Sound Hashira walked out
with his wives' help.

24:02.330 --> 24:05.250
<i>Man, ow! So annoying!</i>

24:05.590 --> 24:09.550
The Kakushi all recoiled at the sight.
Too tough to believe.

24:09.800 --> 24:11.840
I mean, they were reeling.

24:11.840 --> 24:12.760
<i>I'm scared!</i>

24:12.760 --> 24:14.970
<i>He's standing... on his own!</i>

24:14.970 --> 24:16.100
<i>It's scary!</i>

24:16.100 --> 24:18.810
<i>It's insane, huh? With those injuries?</i>

24:19.600 --> 24:21.100
I see.

24:22.100 --> 24:23.350
What about Inosuke?

24:23.350 --> 24:26.810
Mr. Inosuke was also
on the brink of death at one point.

24:27.860 --> 24:31.190
Mr. Inosuke was in such terrible shape!

24:31.190 --> 24:32.820
Because of all the poison in his body,

24:32.820 --> 24:35.950
he couldn't stop the bleeding
with his breathing in time!

24:36.410 --> 24:38.080
I see.

24:38.080 --> 24:43.960
So, I must be hallucinating
Inosuke stuck on the ceiling above me.

24:48.800 --> 24:50.210
How are you doing that?

24:51.970 --> 24:54.050
Good on you for noticing me, Tanpachiro!

24:55.390 --> 24:56.340
Well...

24:56.640 --> 24:58.680
I am lying face up.

25:01.520 --> 25:05.230
I'm the guy who woke up
seven days before you did!

25:05.850 --> 25:07.650
I'm so glad...

25:07.650 --> 25:09.020
Inosuke.

25:09.360 --> 25:10.980
You're amazing.

25:12.610 --> 25:15.820
Keep heaping on the praise!
And you! You're a weakling!

25:15.820 --> 25:17.870
Shame on you for making us all worry!

25:17.870 --> 25:20.330
It's you who's not normal, Mr. Inosuke!

25:20.330 --> 25:22.290
Lady Shinobu said
as much herself, remember?

25:22.620 --> 25:24.370
Oh, wait, Mr. Tanjiro!

25:24.370 --> 25:27.040
Please take a look at this book!

25:27.380 --> 25:30.630
This is a weasel from a foreign country
called a "honey badger"!

25:30.630 --> 25:33.090
It has a thick hide-like armor!

25:33.090 --> 25:35.840
Even getting bitten by a lion can't hurt it!

25:36.130 --> 25:37.640
It's so cute.

25:37.640 --> 25:41.640
Since it's poison-proof,
it'll just eat up poisonous snakes, too!

25:41.640 --> 25:42.850
Wow.

25:43.390 --> 25:47.150
Lady Shinobu said that Mr. Inosuke
is just like this honey badger!

25:48.150 --> 25:50.480
Lady Kocho makes
some irresponsible comments, huh.

25:50.480 --> 25:51.270
Huh?

25:51.270 --> 25:54.610
Maybe she just got tired of thinking about him?

25:55.030 --> 25:57.320
Hey... Come on! Get down from there!

25:57.740 --> 26:00.580
In other words, I'm immortal!

26:01.910 --> 26:03.910
In your dreams. Are you an idiot?

26:04.200 --> 26:06.660
Who you callin' "an idiot"?

26:06.960 --> 26:07.290
Stop it, please!

26:07.290 --> 26:09.040
Fight me! Step outside with me, scumbag!
Stop it, please!

26:09.040 --> 26:10.590
Hey! Knock it off, will you?
Fight me! Step outside with me, scumbag!

26:10.920 --> 26:14.840
Poison doesn't have much effect on you,
but neither does medicine,

26:14.840 --> 26:17.180
so you need to be careful
like Lady Shinobu said!

26:17.800 --> 26:18.260
You forget so easily!

26:18.260 --> 26:19.390
B-Be quiet.
You forget so easily!

26:19.390 --> 26:19.800
B-Be quiet.

26:19.800 --> 26:21.970
Shut up! Quit yanking at me, you shrimp!
B-Be quiet.

26:21.970 --> 26:25.390
What's that? You're not
that much taller than me!

26:25.730 --> 26:28.310
Tanjiro's asleep, so please be quiet!

26:28.600 --> 26:30.310
Oh...

26:32.150 --> 26:34.940
Oh man! He went back into a coma!

26:34.940 --> 26:37.570
Would you mind not saying
ominous stuff like that?

26:37.570 --> 26:39.610
Please just be quiet!

26:39.610 --> 26:40.950
Ms. Kanao?

26:40.950 --> 26:43.330
Let's go cook some rice gruel.

26:43.330 --> 26:44.330
Okay.

26:44.620 --> 26:49.500
Let's hope he recovers soon,
so he can eat tons of food!

27:10.980 --> 27:13.110
It's like I'm the wind!

27:13.110 --> 27:15.900
- Let me go next!
- Let me go next!

27:15.900 --> 27:20.320
<i>A week later,
Mr. Tanjiro was back on his feet.</i>

27:23.120 --> 27:25.990
<i>When we notified Mr. Goto,
who was away on an expedition,</i>

27:25.990 --> 27:29.460
<i>he was stunned by the speed
of Tanjiro's recovery.</i>

27:29.750 --> 27:31.620
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

27:31.620 --> 27:33.540
<i>Beasts, all of them!</i>

27:34.130 --> 27:37.800
<i>Soon afterward,
Mr. Inosuke returned to duty.</i>

27:39.010 --> 27:40.760
<i>I'm the strongest of all!</i>

27:40.760 --> 27:41.630
<i>Yeah!</i>

27:41.630 --> 27:43.140
<i>Heading out now!</i>

27:44.010 --> 27:45.970
<i>Nooooo!</i>

27:45.970 --> 27:47.770
<i>I'm so cold!</i>

27:47.770 --> 27:49.770
<i>I'm so scared!</i>

27:49.770 --> 27:52.150
<i>I'm going home!</i>

27:52.150 --> 27:53.980
<i>I'm lonely! No! Let me go!</i>

27:54.310 --> 27:58.320
<i>Oh, yes. Mr. Zenitsu is still out
on a mission far away,</i>

27:58.320 --> 28:01.780
<i>and the other Corps members say
it's like a nonstop racket.</i>

28:02.240 --> 28:03.360
<i>Ms. Aoi!</i>

28:03.360 --> 28:05.830
<i>You just remembered me now!</i>

28:05.830 --> 28:07.950
<i>Miss me? You miss me, do you?</i>

28:07.950 --> 28:10.620
<i>Of course you miss me, don't you?</i>

28:10.620 --> 28:11.620
<i>Shut up!</i>

28:12.710 --> 28:18.510
<i>As for Mr. Tanjiro, he's been doing
his Rehabilitation Training every day.</i>

28:25.300 --> 28:26.890
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

28:28.350 --> 28:29.970
So frustrating!

28:29.970 --> 28:33.390
I've got a long way to go
before I gain back my stamina!

28:34.060 --> 28:35.610
Hey, wait!

28:35.610 --> 28:38.730
Did a new sword come
while I was asleep?

28:38.730 --> 28:41.400
To replace the one that I chipped!

28:41.690 --> 28:42.650
Oh!

28:43.070 --> 28:44.860
A sword, you say?

28:44.860 --> 28:46.320
A sword...

28:46.570 --> 28:49.700
You did get some letters
from Mr. Haganezuka.

28:50.290 --> 28:52.580
Would you like to see them?

28:53.000 --> 28:55.580
<i>I have no sword for the likes of you!</i>

28:56.080 --> 28:58.840
This is... really bad!

28:58.840 --> 29:01.590
<i>It is, isn't it?</i>

29:06.220 --> 29:10.930
Two months went by,
but no sword ever arrived.

29:13.140 --> 29:16.770
And it was only chipped this time!

29:16.770 --> 29:19.650
I snapped it into two last time!

29:21.230 --> 29:24.950
Swords are always getting damaged,

29:25.280 --> 29:28.910
but Mr. Haganezuka just happens
to be a bit difficult, doesn't he?

29:29.200 --> 29:32.000
Why don't you go to the village?

29:32.000 --> 29:35.540
Maybe it would be best
to talk to him directly.

29:35.830 --> 29:37.130
The village?

29:37.130 --> 29:39.540
The village where all the swordsmiths live.

29:39.840 --> 29:40.630
Huh?

29:40.630 --> 29:42.210
I can go?

29:42.800 --> 29:47.050

DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
SWORDSMITH VILLAGE ARC

29:51.560 --> 29:52.810
Nice to meet you.

29:53.140 --> 29:57.310
As the Master has granted approval,
I shall be guiding you there.

29:57.310 --> 29:58.810
Nice to meet you!

29:58.810 --> 30:00.570
I'm Tanjiro Kamado!

30:00.570 --> 30:02.150
Thank you for taking me!

30:02.530 --> 30:07.450
As your guide, I cannot tell you my name,
but I look forward to serving you.

30:07.820 --> 30:09.320
Now then, put these on.

30:09.320 --> 30:10.450
What are they?

30:11.030 --> 30:13.200
A blindfold and earplugs.

30:13.540 --> 30:15.290
The village is hidden.

30:15.290 --> 30:16.290
Also...

30:16.290 --> 30:18.750
I will be carrying you on my back.

30:18.750 --> 30:19.460
Huh?

30:20.000 --> 30:22.710
Moreover, as you are known
to have an acute sense of smell...

30:23.000 --> 30:24.170
take these nose plugs.

30:25.260 --> 30:27.510
Have a safe journey!

30:28.550 --> 30:31.430
<i>The Swordsmith Village,
where Nichirin Swords are forged,</i>

30:31.430 --> 30:34.680
<i>is an extremely vital place
for the Demon Slayer Corps.</i>

30:35.180 --> 30:39.600
<i>Its whereabouts must be kept secret
to protect it from demon attacks.</i>

30:40.360 --> 30:41.360
<i>That's why...</i>

30:41.360 --> 30:43.570
<i>nobody knows where the village is.</i>

30:44.940 --> 30:48.150
<i>Needless to say, this lady
doesn't know where it is, either.</i>

30:49.200 --> 30:53.540
<i>Meaning that after traveling a certain distance,
I get passed to another Kakushi.</i>

30:53.910 --> 30:54.910
<i>Not only that,</i>

30:54.910 --> 30:59.040
<i>but both the routes and the Kakushi
get changed up again and again.</i>

30:59.370 --> 31:03.630
<i>The Kakushi are guided
to the next Kakushi by crows...</i>

31:03.960 --> 31:06.630
<i>but the crows do a lot of switching up, too.</i>

31:07.260 --> 31:09.760
Please be careful on your way back!

31:10.840 --> 31:12.760
What a good kid!

31:13.560 --> 31:18.270
<i>I'm told that the mansion where the Master lives
is hidden in an even more complex way!</i>

31:18.560 --> 31:21.650
<i>Seriously, smart people are incredible!</i>

31:22.690 --> 31:24.110
I'm going to remove this now.

31:33.410 --> 31:35.030
Whoa!

31:45.380 --> 31:46.340
Wow!

31:46.340 --> 31:48.300
These buildings sure are amazing!

31:48.630 --> 31:51.720
Everyone who comes here
says the same thing.

31:53.260 --> 31:54.890
And this scent...

31:54.890 --> 31:56.930
There must be a hot spring nearby!

31:56.930 --> 31:59.890
Yes, you're right about that!

31:59.890 --> 32:02.560
Please go there later to refresh yourself.

32:02.560 --> 32:03.900
But first things first.

32:03.900 --> 32:07.940
Turn left at the end of this street,
and you'll find the chief's home.

32:07.940 --> 32:10.700
Please go there to greet him
before you do anything else.

32:10.700 --> 32:11.740
Right!

32:12.280 --> 32:14.320
I'll be taking my leave now,
but I wish you the best.

32:14.780 --> 32:16.580
Thank you very much!

32:16.830 --> 32:18.490
Thank you very much!

32:18.490 --> 32:20.410
Thank you very much!

32:20.410 --> 32:21.960
Thank you very much!

32:22.330 --> 32:23.920
Thank you very much!

32:27.210 --> 32:29.840
I just heard an echo of gratitude.

32:37.600 --> 32:42.190
Does that mean someone's here?
I think I feel my heart pounding!

33:04.920 --> 33:09.550
Well, why don't you bow your head down so low
your forehead touches the mat?

33:13.380 --> 33:15.260
I'm Tanjiro Kamado!

33:15.260 --> 33:17.010
It's a privilege to meet you!

33:17.430 --> 33:20.270
Well, what a fine boy. Come here.

33:20.770 --> 33:22.770
Have some sweets.

33:23.310 --> 33:25.100
Thank you very much!

33:25.940 --> 33:27.310
These are delicious!

33:27.310 --> 33:28.360
Aren't they?

33:29.400 --> 33:32.280
Oh, about Hotaru,

33:32.280 --> 33:34.950
at this time, he seems
to have gone missing.

33:34.950 --> 33:38.370
We're searching for him, too,
so please be patient.

33:38.700 --> 33:39.700
Hotaru?

33:39.700 --> 33:42.330
That's right. Hotaru Haganezuka.

33:42.330 --> 33:44.210
That's such a cute name!

33:44.540 --> 33:47.670
Right? I'm the one who named him!

33:47.670 --> 33:51.800
But Hotaru himself said
it was too cute and blasted me.

33:51.800 --> 33:53.590
That's sad.

33:55.090 --> 33:58.470
That boy's been like this
since he was a child.

33:58.470 --> 34:02.970
He loses his temper just like that and falls
off the face of the earth. Sorry about that.

34:02.970 --> 34:04.350
No, please!

34:04.350 --> 34:08.060
It's my own fault for breaking my sword
and chipping it so easily!

34:08.400 --> 34:10.570
No, you're wrong about that.

34:11.190 --> 34:16.450
He's the one who forged a faulty sword,
so it's all on him.

34:18.320 --> 34:21.580
As soon as he's found,
we'll apprehend him and bring him back here.

34:21.580 --> 34:22.990
So, please, rest assured.

34:23.370 --> 34:24.950
Right.

34:25.710 --> 34:28.460
You... aren't gonna hurt him, right?

34:28.750 --> 34:34.920
I hear that you haven't healed
enough yet to hunt down demons.

34:34.920 --> 34:38.840
If Hotaru hasn't forged
another sword by then,

34:38.840 --> 34:41.970
I'll assign someone else
to be your swordsmith.

34:42.850 --> 34:46.980
Our hot spring can work wonders
on a weakened body,

34:46.980 --> 34:49.980
so go have a good, long soak.

34:51.480 --> 34:52.820
I'll show you the way.

34:54.940 --> 34:57.740
I hope this won't turn into an argument.

35:06.040 --> 35:07.040
There are...

35:07.040 --> 35:10.040
foundries and workshops
all over this village.

35:12.170 --> 35:15.380
That's how all your swords are forged.

35:19.220 --> 35:23.220
It's thanks to you all
that we can wield our swords, isn't it?

35:23.510 --> 35:24.760
Thank you very much!

35:25.270 --> 35:29.520
Oh please, it's our job,
so no need to thank us.

35:31.730 --> 35:34.020
The hot spring is at the top of this hill.

35:34.020 --> 35:36.480
It has all kinds of healing properties.

35:36.480 --> 35:40.860
Cuts, burns, hemorrhoids,
bleeding piles, constipation,

35:40.860 --> 35:42.950
everything from gout
to the pain of a broken heart.

35:42.950 --> 35:46.790
It works on anything, so please
treat yourself to a leisurely soak.

35:46.790 --> 35:47.700
Right!

35:47.700 --> 35:50.870
I'll be down here, preparing your meal.

35:50.870 --> 35:53.170
Right! Thank you so much!

35:53.170 --> 35:55.170
Ohhhhh!

35:56.800 --> 35:58.050
Ohhh!

35:58.050 --> 36:02.300
It's you, Tanjiro! Tanjiro!

36:02.300 --> 36:03.760
W-Watch out!

36:04.050 --> 36:07.430
Please be careful! Your breasts
are this close to spilling out!

36:08.480 --> 36:10.980
Ohhhhh!

36:10.980 --> 36:12.560
Listen to me! Listen, will you?

36:12.560 --> 36:13.980
Watch out!
Listen to me! Listen, will you?

36:16.610 --> 36:19.440
Just now, up there, I got ignored!

36:19.440 --> 36:22.410
I said hello, but he ignored me!

36:22.700 --> 36:23.950
Who ignored you?

36:23.950 --> 36:26.120
I don't know!

36:26.370 --> 36:29.120
So, I asked him his name,
only to be ignored!

36:29.120 --> 36:32.620
Isn't that awful?
I'm a Hashira, you know!

36:32.620 --> 36:36.210
And now all the good vibes I got
from my bath have been canceled out!

36:36.460 --> 36:39.010
I hear that dinner will be ready soon.

36:39.010 --> 36:40.590
It's supposed to be matsutake rice!

36:40.880 --> 36:42.090
Whaaat?

36:42.090 --> 36:44.090
For real?

36:44.090 --> 36:45.010
<i>Dinner tonight is matsutake rice! Oh, yes it is!</i>

36:45.010 --> 36:48.100
<i>So, she's a hearty eater.</i>
<i>Dinner tonight is matsutake rice! Oh, yes it is!</i>

36:50.640 --> 36:52.980
Wow! It's so spacious!

36:53.400 --> 36:54.230
Ouch!

36:56.610 --> 36:57.860
A front tooth?

36:58.150 --> 37:00.530
Did somebody drop a tooth?

37:06.410 --> 37:07.950
That mohawk-style haircut!

37:10.620 --> 37:14.290
Right, the name I heard from Sumi...

37:14.620 --> 37:16.540
Genya Shinazugawa!

37:17.460 --> 37:18.550
Die!

37:26.390 --> 37:27.220
Huh?

37:28.050 --> 37:28.930
Long time no see!

37:29.260 --> 37:32.310
How've you been? I meant to ask.
Are you and the Wind Hashira related?

37:35.440 --> 37:37.770
Stop talking to me, dammit!

37:40.780 --> 37:44.200
And here I thought
we could bond in our nakedness.

37:44.530 --> 37:46.950
Making new friends sure is tough.

37:50.200 --> 37:51.700
Wow, that's impressive!

37:52.160 --> 37:53.580
You think so?

37:53.580 --> 37:56.080
I really only nibbled today!

37:56.080 --> 37:58.630
I'm going to eat plenty, too,
so I can get strong!

37:58.920 --> 38:00.170
I almost forgot.

38:00.170 --> 38:03.670
The guy you met at the hot spring
was Genya Shinazugawa,

38:03.670 --> 38:05.090
who was my fellow swordman.

38:05.090 --> 38:07.840
What? Is that so?

38:08.350 --> 38:11.100
That would make him
Mr. Shinazugawa's younger brother, right?

38:11.100 --> 38:14.600
But Mr. Shinazugawa said
he didn't have a younger brother.

38:14.600 --> 38:16.350
I wonder if they're on bad terms.

38:16.350 --> 38:18.060
That's just heart-wrenching.

38:18.060 --> 38:19.980
Is that right?

38:19.980 --> 38:21.320
I wonder why.

38:24.360 --> 38:26.450
What is it, Nezuko?

38:26.740 --> 38:28.820
There, there!

38:29.240 --> 38:32.950
There are five of us siblings in my family,
and we all get along...

38:33.240 --> 38:34.620
so it's hard for me to fathom.

38:34.620 --> 38:38.120
I thought, "Those Shinazugawa
brothers are scary!"

38:38.460 --> 38:40.500
Genya still hasn't shown up.

38:40.750 --> 38:43.460
I was hoping that we could
at least have a talk.

38:44.710 --> 38:46.930
I don't think he's coming.

38:46.930 --> 38:50.220
I heard the villagers saying
that he never takes meals.

38:50.720 --> 38:53.260
I wonder if he brought something with him.

38:53.720 --> 38:55.560
I wonder if he's all right.

38:55.560 --> 38:57.940
I'll bring him some rice balls later.

38:58.400 --> 39:00.770
Good idea! Let's do that!

39:02.860 --> 39:04.980
Nezuko, Nezuko!

39:05.990 --> 39:07.110
You know what?

39:07.110 --> 39:11.410
The sight of these rice balls
is making me hungry again!

39:11.410 --> 39:13.280
Don't tell anyone, okay?

39:15.040 --> 39:18.500
Why did you join
the Demon Slayer Corps, Ms. Kanroji?

39:19.040 --> 39:20.540
Hmm? Me?

39:21.290 --> 39:24.630
This is embarrassing!
Oh dear, what should I do?

39:24.630 --> 39:27.300
You want to hear? Well, it's...

39:27.590 --> 39:31.970
To find the gentleman
with whom I'll be spending eternity!

39:32.260 --> 39:35.520
I mean, any girl would prefer
someone stronger than herself, right?

39:35.520 --> 39:38.270
Because we want to be protected!
Do you know what I mean?

39:38.270 --> 39:40.560
Or maybe it's hard
for a boy to understand!

39:40.560 --> 39:44.020
See, Hashira are powerful, right?
But it's not like you can just meet up with one!

39:44.020 --> 39:47.320
So I knew I'd have to become a Hashira myself,
and I worked really hard!

39:50.070 --> 39:52.410
Genya doesn't seem to be here.

39:53.070 --> 39:54.450
Lady Kanroji?

39:56.080 --> 39:58.660
They'll be done honing your sword soon.

39:58.960 --> 40:03.170
We'd like you to come to the workshop
to make some final adjustments.

40:03.590 --> 40:06.920
Oh my, it looks like I have to go now.

40:06.920 --> 40:09.510
Please don't mind us.
I'll be happy to walk you over.

40:09.760 --> 40:13.220
That's all right. I'll probably be leaving
in the middle of the night.

40:14.760 --> 40:16.430
Oh, but...

40:16.770 --> 40:18.430
I see, then...

40:20.190 --> 40:21.770
Tanjiro...

40:22.480 --> 40:27.280
We might not live to see each other again,
but let's fight the good fight!

40:27.820 --> 40:31.240
You took on an Upper Rank demon
and survived.

40:31.610 --> 40:33.780
That kind of experience is priceless!

40:34.240 --> 40:39.000
Nothing can ever top
what you've learned from firsthand experience.

40:39.330 --> 40:43.040
It's equal to five years,
no, ten years of hard training!

40:43.330 --> 40:48.170
Right now, Tanjiro, you're far stronger
than you ever were before!

40:51.340 --> 40:55.800
Mitsuri Kanroji is rooting
for the Kamado siblings!

41:00.980 --> 41:02.560
Thank you very much!

41:03.020 --> 41:05.150
But I've still got a long ways to go.

41:05.150 --> 41:08.320
Mr. Uzui just let me win, that's all!

41:08.610 --> 41:10.400
I'll work even harder!

41:11.030 --> 41:14.200
To defeat Muzan Kibutsuji!

41:15.530 --> 41:16.490
Oh!

41:17.990 --> 41:22.160
Tanjiro, you've been granted permission
for a long stay, right?

41:22.160 --> 41:24.210
Uh, yes, that's what I've been told.

41:29.250 --> 41:33.470
They say there's a secret weapon
in this village that will make you stronger.

41:34.050 --> 41:35.720
Try to find it, okay?

41:36.680 --> 41:38.140
Bye now!

41:58.780 --> 42:00.580
Wow!

42:01.950 --> 42:04.040
You're starting me off
with a feast this morning!

42:04.330 --> 42:07.330
These wild vegetables were all picked
on the mountainside here.

42:07.330 --> 42:10.500
And this fish was caught fresh
from the river this morning.

42:10.500 --> 42:11.840
Really?

42:12.420 --> 42:17.550
The chief has sent word that he'll be contacting you
as soon as they've found Mr. Haganezuka.

42:17.550 --> 42:21.180
Until then, please build back your stamina
and get some rest.

42:21.180 --> 42:23.390
Right! Thank you so much!

42:24.730 --> 42:26.230
Thank you for this meal!

42:30.820 --> 42:32.610
Hey, listen, Nezuko...

42:34.360 --> 42:36.490
I know I have to rest up,

42:36.860 --> 42:38.870
but while I'm waiting for Mr. Haganezuka,

42:38.870 --> 42:44.370
I wanna look for the secret weapon that'll make you
stronger, the one Ms. Kanroji told me about.

42:44.620 --> 42:46.250
Wanna come with me?

42:50.880 --> 42:52.840
I wonder what kind of weapon it is.

42:54.590 --> 42:57.840
It has to be a sword, right?
You think it's buried in the ground, maybe?

42:57.840 --> 43:00.470
Isn't this exciting, like a treasure hunt?

43:01.140 --> 43:02.010
Ugh!

43:02.600 --> 43:07.440
I really like it here,
but that hot spring smell is so overpowering.

43:09.520 --> 43:13.530
I guess not being at full strength
is affecting my sense of smell.

43:13.530 --> 43:16.360
Quit pestering me! Give it a rest!

43:17.650 --> 43:19.990
I've had enough of you holding out on me.

43:19.990 --> 43:22.870
You're wasting my time, arguing with me.

43:23.410 --> 43:26.160
A kid? And the other one is...

43:27.040 --> 43:27.830
Huh?

43:28.120 --> 43:29.620
That's a Hashira.

43:30.170 --> 43:32.540
What did Ms. Shinobu say his name was?

43:33.420 --> 43:34.630
Oh, right!

43:35.590 --> 43:37.010
The Mist Hashira...

43:37.010 --> 43:38.760
Muichiro Tokito!

43:40.010 --> 43:43.930
So, there's another Hashira
here at the village.

43:44.510 --> 43:45.470
Give me the key.

43:46.140 --> 43:47.390
I'm not handing it over!

43:47.390 --> 43:50.100
My ancestor made this,
and it's precious to me!

43:51.400 --> 43:54.230
Wait, is there someone else behind them?

43:54.900 --> 43:57.900
Didn't you hear me?
I said I'm not giving it to you!

43:58.700 --> 44:00.700
Hey... Is that...

44:01.200 --> 44:02.410
a person?

44:03.200 --> 44:04.530
Who could it be?

44:08.960 --> 44:10.580
I know him.

44:10.580 --> 44:11.670
I've...

44:12.580 --> 44:14.040
seen that man before!

48:22.000 --> 48:24.840
Thank goodness you woke up, Tanjiro.

48:24.840 --> 48:26.550
Thank goodness!

48:26.550 --> 48:28.010
Thanks, everybody!

48:28.420 --> 48:32.510
By the way, how long do you think
Inosuke was stuck onto the ceiling?

48:37.720 --> 48:42.230
So, that means he was there
for over an hour at least?

48:42.230 --> 48:44.690
He's as reckless as ever.

48:44.690 --> 48:45.980
Uh-huh!

48:45.980 --> 48:47.440
Wrong!

48:49.320 --> 48:50.780
What do you mean, "wrong"?

48:51.150 --> 48:53.570
I was there since yesterday!

48:53.570 --> 48:54.780
Whaaaaat?

48:56.160 --> 48:57.040
<i>Rustle, rustle, rustle...</i>

48:57.620 --> 48:59.910
<i>Wake up! Wake up, Kanpachiro!</i>

49:00.330 --> 49:02.080
<i>Open your eyes!</i>

49:02.080 --> 49:04.040
<i>Wake up already! You hear me?</i>

49:04.040 --> 49:06.340
Is that what you were up to?

49:06.340 --> 49:10.010
So, Tanjiro had no choice
but to wake up, right?

49:10.010 --> 49:11.340
- I guess so.
- I guess so.

49:11.340 --> 49:13.390
Being sick is all in the mind!

49:13.390 --> 49:15.550
Inosuke, thanks a lot.

49:16.810 --> 49:19.810
Next time, Episode 2, "Yoriichi Type Zero."

49:19.810 --> 49:22.690
I'm going to give it my all
in the Swordsmith Village, too!

49:22.690 --> 49:24.850
Don't even think about making me worry!

49:24.850 --> 49:26.060
TO BE CONTINUED
