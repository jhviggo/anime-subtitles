00:55.740 --> 00:59.450
You demons who kill and devour humans...

01:06.870 --> 01:09.040
Come on, Nezuko, Genya!

01:13.210 --> 01:14.630
<i>Why are you running away?</i>

01:16.720 --> 01:19.970
<i>Isn't this just what

01:32.940 --> 01:34.900
<i>Why are you all...</i>

01:35.240 --> 01:37.450
<i>so self-serving?</i>

01:38.660 --> 01:41.870
Behold, "Death Throes of the Smiths"!

01:42.450 --> 01:45.750
Just twist the sword like so, and...

03:37.400 --> 03:39.280
What's his deal?

03:43.240 --> 03:45.030
Dammit!

03:45.410 --> 03:47.120
We'll never catch up!

03:47.120 --> 03:50.120
Did he really have
that much strength left in reserve?

03:50.700 --> 03:53.080
<i>We'll be reaching our limit soon.</i>

03:53.080 --> 03:55.290
<i>If this goes on, he's going to get away!</i>

03:56.960 --> 03:58.960
<i>It's almost daybreak!</i>

04:00.000 --> 04:02.260
<i>Ms. Kanroji's reeling off

04:02.260 --> 04:04.470
<i>It won't be long

<i>And when day breaks,

<i>We've got to hurry!</i>

04:14.480 --> 04:15.690
<i>Still...</i>

04:16.940 --> 04:18.190

<i>We're not gonna let you do that!</i>

04:28.990 --> 04:30.620
<i>We're not...</i>

04:30.990 --> 04:32.790
<i>gonna let you win!</i>

04:36.290 --> 04:37.420
<i>It's no use!</i>

04:37.420 --> 04:39.000
<i>I can't plant my feet!</i>

04:39.500 --> 04:42.170
<i>If only I hadn't injured my left leg!</i>

04:43.590 --> 04:46.010
<i>No good! I can't let this happen!</i>

04:46.300 --> 04:48.050
<i>I have to figure this out!</i>

04:48.930 --> 04:50.140
<i>Tanjiro?</i>

04:51.930 --> 04:56.520
<i>Thunder Breathing's all about

<i>when it comes to the size of your own body

05:03.400 --> 05:06.610

05:07.360 --> 05:11.870
<i>"It's not true Total Concentration

05:12.870 --> 05:14.200
<i>That's what...</i>

05:14.200 --> 05:17.620
<i>Gramps, my trainer,
was always telling me.</i>

05:18.460 --> 05:21.340
<i>Each and every fiber of my muscles...</i>

06:11.180 --> 06:13.100
...feel the least bit...

06:14.430 --> 06:16.720
sorry for me?

06:17.230 --> 06:19.850
Not at all?

06:21.900 --> 06:26.900
Don't you dare bully the weak!

06:45.380 --> 06:47.670
Your so-called reasons...

06:48.010 --> 06:50.680
are all total crap!

06:50.970 --> 06:53.930
You stupid bastard!

07:26.880 --> 07:28.130
<i>Oh, crap!</i>

07:29.670 --> 07:31.630
<i>I'm getting burned by these flames, too!</i>

07:31.630 --> 07:33.550
<i>Because I've eaten demon flesh!</i>

07:34.090 --> 07:35.090
Tanjiro!

08:11.590 --> 08:12.800
Tanjiro!

08:12.800 --> 08:14.550
Nezuko!

08:31.730 --> 08:32.900
<i>Damn.</i>

08:33.280 --> 08:36.240
<i>My regeneration's slowing down.</i>

08:36.780 --> 08:40.240
<i>Zohakuten's using too much of my power!</i>

08:40.830 --> 08:44.290
<i>I need to replenish myself
with human flesh and blood!</i>

08:49.290 --> 08:51.210
I won't let you escape!

08:56.470 --> 08:57.970
<i>I can sense...</i>

08:58.720 --> 09:01.260
<i>that there are humans...</i>

09:02.020 --> 09:04.390
<i>nearby.</i>

09:05.060 --> 09:06.600
Come back here.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.570
I'm not gonna let you escape!

09:17.780 --> 09:22.540
I'll chase you down
even if you flee to the depths of hell!

09:22.910 --> 09:24.040
And...

09:24.830 --> 09:26.290
I'm gonna cut off your head!

09:29.500 --> 09:32.170
<i>He dares to threaten me?</i>

09:33.550 --> 09:35.470
<i>Where are those humans?</i>

09:36.090 --> 09:38.340
<i>If I consume them...</i>

09:38.720 --> 09:43.310
<i>then I can send that little brat
to his demise in a flash!</i>

09:43.810 --> 09:44.640
<i>Huh?</i>

09:46.020 --> 09:47.390
<i>There they are!</i>

09:48.100 --> 09:50.520
<i>I've found some food!</i>

09:51.060 --> 09:54.570
<i>Of those three brats,
one is a demon and a handful!</i>

09:54.900 --> 09:57.530
<i>Thwarting me at every turn!</i>

09:58.030 --> 10:03.540
<i>As it turns out, that brat's sword can only
lodge itself into my neck, not slash it.</i>

10:03.540 --> 10:08.290
<i>First, let me devour those humans,
and when I've replenished myself...</i>

10:08.670 --> 10:11.420
Oh, crap! That way!

10:11.750 --> 10:12.540
Right!

10:13.460 --> 10:14.500
Come back here!

10:14.880 --> 10:17.170
You're not getting away!

10:24.930 --> 10:26.180
Nezuko...

10:33.020 --> 10:34.400
<i>Get going!</i>

10:35.070 --> 10:36.530
<i>You've got to hurry!</i>

10:36.990 --> 10:38.780
<i>One more time!</i>

10:39.650 --> 10:41.200
<i>One more time...</i>

10:41.570 --> 10:44.450
<i>Use Total Concentration
to push off against the ground!</i>

10:46.660 --> 10:48.500
Tanjiro!

10:53.750 --> 10:55.590
Tanjiro!

10:57.920 --> 10:59.420
Tanjiro!

11:09.560 --> 11:10.770
My sword!

11:11.230 --> 11:12.440
Use it!

11:18.480 --> 11:19.440
To...

11:19.740 --> 11:21.650
Tanjiro, use that sword!

11:21.650 --> 11:23.240
Give that back!

11:23.780 --> 11:25.330
You've got to be kidding me!

11:25.330 --> 11:27.160
I'll kill you! Don't use it!

11:27.450 --> 11:29.540
I've only honed it up to the first stage!

11:29.540 --> 11:30.830
Give it back!

11:30.830 --> 11:32.170
Tanjiro!

11:32.460 --> 11:35.170
It's almost daybreak!
He's going to get away!

11:37.380 --> 11:38.920

11:38.920 --> 11:39.960
Ouch!

11:42.180 --> 11:43.470
<i>Tokito...</i>

11:44.970 --> 11:46.180

Lord Tokito?

11:56.860 --> 11:57.940
Whoa!

11:57.940 --> 12:00.240
Mr. Haganezuka murdered Mr. Tokito!

12:00.240 --> 12:02.530
What the hell? I didn't do anything!

12:02.530 --> 12:03.610
You inhuman monster!

12:03.610 --> 12:05.530
It's the poison and fever!

12:05.530 --> 12:07.490
Calm down, both of you!

12:08.410 --> 12:09.740
<i>Take it...</i>

12:09.740 --> 12:10.870

21:53.620 --> 21:55.160
Atone for your sins...

22:02.000 --> 22:03.760
with your life!

22:10.350 --> 22:13.560
<i>Why would you steal from others?</i>

22:14.640 --> 22:16.140
<i>And even worse...</i>

22:16.140 --> 22:20.150
<i>from a man who was so kind
to those of us who cannot see...</i>

22:20.730 --> 22:24.400
<i>The Master has chosen
to look the other way,</i>

22:24.400 --> 22:26.610
<i>but I cannot forgive you.</i>

22:27.360 --> 22:29.360
<i>I am going to the magistrate's office now.</i>

22:30.450 --> 22:32.870
<i>I'm not the one at fault here!</i>

22:32.870 --> 22:34.870
<i>It's these hands that are to blame!</i>

22:36.000 --> 22:37.870
<i>These hands acted on their own!</i>

22:39.710 --> 22:41.710
<i>What the hell is this?</i>

22:46.630 --> 22:49.260
<i>Is that me when I was a human?</i>

22:49.760 --> 22:51.930
<i>Why now after all this time?</i>

22:53.600 --> 22:59.060
<i>I'm told you've committed theft and murder
numerous times in another town, as well.</i>

22:59.390 --> 23:01.060
<i>I have absolutely no sympathy for you!</i>

23:01.650 --> 23:03.110
<i>That's absurd!</i>

23:03.110 --> 23:05.780
<i>I'm not even capable of such a thing!</i>

23:05.780 --> 23:07.440
<i>As someone who's blind...</i>

23:07.820 --> 23:10.450
<i>I know that you can see just fine!</i>

23:12.370 --> 23:15.620
<i>I've had a masseur
come here to Shirasu...</i>

23:15.620 --> 23:19.870
<i>and he would face the wall
until I started speaking.</i>

23:21.290 --> 23:23.420
<i>You say that your hands are to blame?</i>

23:24.170 --> 23:25.920
<i>Then, we'll just slice...</i>

23:26.340 --> 23:27.920
<i>both of them off!</i>

23:29.300 --> 23:32.470
<i>You're going to be beheaded
tomorrow? I pity you.</i>

23:33.260 --> 23:35.970
<i>Let me save you.</i>

23:37.060 --> 23:41.730
<i>No matter how you may try to talk your way
out of it, the facts remain the same!</i>

23:41.730 --> 23:44.520
<i>Silencing me will do you no good!</i>

23:45.690 --> 23:47.280
<i>Is this...</i>

23:47.730 --> 23:50.990
<i>The day will surely come
when you atone for your sins...</i>

23:50.990 --> 23:54.320
<i>with that vile life of yours!</i>

23:54.820 --> 23:56.950
UPPER FOUR

23:56.950 --> 23:59.500
<i>...my life flashing before my eyes?</i>
UPPER FOUR

25:02.020 --> 25:03.310
<i>I won...</i>

25:04.390 --> 25:06.480
<i>but I had to sacrifice Nezuko!</i>

25:07.480 --> 25:09.520
<i>Burned by the sunlight!</i>

25:10.150 --> 25:12.360
<i>Not even Nezuko's bones remain!</i>

25:29.750 --> 25:31.460
Nezuko...

25:31.460 --> 25:33.210
Nezuko!

25:34.760 --> 25:37.640
To turn Nezuko back into a human...

25:38.640 --> 25:39.760
That was why...

25:40.970 --> 25:44.560
That was why I came this far!

25:46.730 --> 25:47.770
Lord Kamado...

25:48.810 --> 25:51.070
L-Lord Kamado?

25:51.400 --> 25:52.900
Lord Kamado!

25:56.110 --> 25:57.700
Lord Kamado...

26:42.120 --> 26:42.950
Mo...

26:46.040 --> 26:47.210
Mo...

26:53.130 --> 26:55.210
Morning!

27:01.850 --> 27:03.600
Nezuko!

27:05.970 --> 27:07.390
Lord Kamado!

27:23.490 --> 27:25.160
Nezuko...

27:27.410 --> 27:29.040
Thank goodness!

27:29.540 --> 27:33.540
Are you all right?

27:34.040 --> 27:35.300
Thank...

27:35.300 --> 27:37.050
Thank goodness.

27:37.510 --> 27:38.460
Are you...

27:38.800 --> 27:41.300
Are you all right?

27:45.680 --> 27:48.100
Thank goodness, right?

27:48.980 --> 27:50.310
Right?

27:51.810 --> 27:54.190
No, really...

27:54.560 --> 27:56.440
thank goodness...

27:56.440 --> 27:59.440
you didn't turn to ash and disappear!

28:07.040 --> 28:09.000
Thank goodness!

28:09.000 --> 28:13.120
I thought that you were dead!

28:13.460 --> 28:16.250
Thank goodness, Nezuko!

28:16.250 --> 28:18.550
I'm so glad you're all right!

28:19.010 --> 28:21.090
Thank goodness!

28:21.090 --> 28:23.220
Yes, thank goodness!

28:28.220 --> 28:31.350
Thanks, both of you, for saving us!

28:31.350 --> 28:35.060
We never could've forgiven ourselves
if Nezuko had perished!

28:44.610 --> 28:46.070
Good for you...

28:46.410 --> 28:47.700
Tanjiro...

28:48.030 --> 28:49.410
Nezuko!

28:52.580 --> 28:54.670
He hit the wall all of a sudden!

28:55.000 --> 28:57.170
Young Kamado, hang in there!

28:57.170 --> 28:58.460
Is he dead? Is he dead?

28:58.460 --> 28:59.170
Idiot!

29:00.000 --> 29:01.210
Are you all right?

29:01.210 --> 29:02.550
Stay with us!

29:03.800 --> 29:05.680
Thank goodness...

29:06.930 --> 29:08.300
Nezuko...

29:09.890 --> 29:11.520
Thank goodness.

29:32.500 --> 29:34.330
I can't take it any more!

29:37.670 --> 29:39.290
I'm so sorry!

29:39.290 --> 29:41.050
I'm about to be killed!

29:51.310 --> 29:52.060
Huh?

30:04.150 --> 30:06.400
Yay! I'm saved!

30:06.990 --> 30:10.580
Tanjiro and the others
must've beheaded the main body!

30:20.040 --> 30:21.380
Toshikuni?

30:23.000 --> 30:24.670
I'm coming in, all right?

30:25.920 --> 30:27.130
Oh my...

30:30.510 --> 30:32.600
What's gotten into you, Toshikuni?

30:32.600 --> 30:34.970
Making such a mess...

30:35.270 --> 30:37.520
I see that you've been doing some research.

30:37.890 --> 30:40.270
You can't find the book that you need?

30:40.770 --> 30:43.110
I'll help you find it.

30:43.110 --> 30:45.150
But first, take a break.

30:45.150 --> 30:46.990
Let's have some tea.

30:47.490 --> 30:49.280
At last...

30:49.570 --> 30:51.240
What's that?

30:51.990 --> 30:57.120
At last, someone able
to withstand the sun has appeared!

30:57.120 --> 31:00.120
Good work, Hantengu!

31:00.500 --> 31:02.960
Well, you certainly seem
to be enjoying yourself.

31:02.960 --> 31:05.760
Perhaps it's the stories
you've been reading—

31:06.090 --> 31:06.920
Huh?

31:12.180 --> 31:15.010
Huh? Madam?

31:15.010 --> 31:16.680
What happened...

31:16.680 --> 31:18.520
to your head?

31:18.890 --> 31:20.810
Now...

31:20.810 --> 31:24.570
there's no need to search
for the Blue Spider Lily.

31:24.570 --> 31:25.530
Madam...

31:26.150 --> 31:27.940
That took so long.

31:27.940 --> 31:32.530
But it was for this reason,
for this reason, for one thousand years...

31:32.870 --> 31:37.790
that I've continued
to increase my kind unwillingly!

31:45.750 --> 31:51.430
A rare constitution that never showed up
even among the Twelve Kizuki.

31:51.430 --> 31:53.550
The chosen demon.

31:53.930 --> 31:57.310
If I devour that girl and absorb her...

31:57.310 --> 32:00.940
I, too, will be able to conquer the sun!

32:00.940 --> 32:03.940
You murderer! You murderer!
You monster!

32:03.940 --> 32:06.400
Master! Master!

32:06.400 --> 32:07.230
Ma—

32:21.540 --> 32:24.040
<i>Now that I think of it, it was on that day.</i>

32:26.000 --> 32:29.050
<i>It all started one thousand years ago.</i>

32:29.550 --> 32:33.550
<i>The era was still called Heian back then.</i>

32:34.640 --> 32:36.550
If I may, sir...

32:36.930 --> 32:41.060
Your medicine is ready for you now.

32:41.810 --> 32:43.810
You inept doctor...

32:44.980 --> 32:50.150
That said, this inept doctor
is the only one I have to lean on.

32:51.690 --> 32:53.200
What will become of me...

32:53.530 --> 32:55.450
if I don't take this?

32:56.160 --> 32:58.120
As you know...

32:58.120 --> 33:00.370
you will not live...

33:00.370 --> 33:02.830
to see your 20th birthday.

33:03.160 --> 33:05.120
I am doing all I can...

33:05.120 --> 33:07.840
to help you live...

33:07.840 --> 33:10.340
even a little longer.

33:11.300 --> 33:12.470
All right, fine.

33:12.470 --> 33:14.130
That's enough.

33:16.760 --> 33:19.100
<i>It won't work anyway.</i>

33:24.100 --> 33:25.900
<i>Ah...</i>

33:25.900 --> 33:27.610
<i>I want to destroy them!</i>

33:27.610 --> 33:30.280
<i>Every living being!</i>

33:32.320 --> 33:35.320
<i>No matter how many times
he examines me...</i>

33:35.320 --> 33:37.780
<i>or administers that medicine...</i>

33:38.200 --> 33:41.290
<i>nothing can stop
my symptoms from worsening.</i>

33:55.840 --> 33:58.340
Death is all you deserve!

33:58.340 --> 34:00.560
You damn incompetent doctor!

34:01.220 --> 34:06.900
<i>But then I realized that this doctor's
medicine was working...</i>

34:06.900 --> 34:10.440
<i>not longer after I'd killed him.</i>

34:11.480 --> 34:14.570
<i>My body was bursting with energy...</i>

34:14.570 --> 34:18.780
<i>and I thought that I'd gained
a durable physique...</i>

34:18.780 --> 34:21.200
<i>but there was one problem.</i>

34:21.950 --> 34:25.290
<i>I couldn't walk in the sunlight.</i>

34:35.050 --> 34:37.260
<i>I could tell.</i>

34:37.260 --> 34:40.680
<i>That if exposed to sunlight, I would die.</i>

34:50.310 --> 34:53.650
<i>I began to crave human flesh and blood.</i>

34:54.110 --> 34:55.650
<i>To remedy that...</i>

34:55.650 --> 34:57.950
<i>all I had to do was devour humans.</i>

35:00.780 --> 35:05.080
If anyone stands in your way,
just eliminate them.

35:05.540 --> 35:07.870
That's all there is to it.

35:07.870 --> 35:09.290
Come back here!

35:09.290 --> 35:12.130
You cursed demon who disrupts
the peace of the capital!

35:14.920 --> 35:16.420
Are you...

35:17.920 --> 35:20.260
talking about me?

35:34.230 --> 35:36.860
<i>I had gained power.</i>

35:37.190 --> 35:39.610
<i>Eternal power!</i>

35:42.660 --> 35:44.160
<i>But...</i>

35:44.160 --> 35:48.660
<i>having to restrict my movements
during the day was humiliating...</i>

35:48.660 --> 35:51.750
<i>and my anger only grew.</i>

35:52.250 --> 35:57.510
<i>I began to seek a body
that wouldn't perish in the sunlight.</i>

35:58.510 --> 36:01.890
<i>I examined the compounds
for the doctor's elixir,</i>

36:01.890 --> 36:04.470
<i>but perhaps because it was still
in the experimental stages,</i>

36:04.470 --> 36:10.440
<i>I couldn't figure out how to make
the medicine called "Blue Spider Lily."</i>

36:10.850 --> 36:16.610
<i>It did seem to contain actual
blue-colored Spider Lilies...</i>

36:16.610 --> 36:23.620
<i>but as for where this Blue Spider Lily bloomed
or whether or not it could be cultivated...</i>

36:24.160 --> 36:27.160
<i>no one knew but the doctor I'd killed.</i>

36:27.160 --> 36:30.870
<i>I searched all over Japan
but failed to find it.</i>

36:32.000 --> 36:36.170
<i>In order to become truly immortal...</i>

36:36.630 --> 36:39.130
<i>finding the Blue Spider Lily...</i>

36:39.130 --> 36:43.260
<i>and someone who had the ability
to survive the sunlight...</i>

36:43.680 --> 36:47.640
<i>Those two have been my top priorities.</i>

36:50.730 --> 36:52.640
<i>And at last...</i>

36:53.020 --> 36:54.650
<i>I've found her!</i>

36:59.190 --> 37:02.780
<i>Since that girl has conquered the sun...</i>

37:03.110 --> 37:07.030
<i>there's no longer any reason
to increase my kind.</i>

37:07.330 --> 37:09.330
<i>I will absorb her...</i>

37:09.330 --> 37:13.420
<i>and then I will conquer the sunlight.</i>

37:14.000 --> 37:16.380
<i>I will get my hands on Nezuko...</i>

37:16.380 --> 37:20.760
<i>and become a perfect being!</i>

37:24.630 --> 37:27.260
Tanjiro, are you all right?

37:29.930 --> 37:31.100
Hey...

37:31.100 --> 37:33.980
T-Tokito...

37:35.150 --> 37:36.560
Thank goodness...

37:36.560 --> 37:37.940
you're safe!

37:38.360 --> 37:40.940
Thank you for my sword!

37:41.820 --> 37:44.070
I should be thanking you.

37:44.070 --> 37:47.820
Because of you, I recovered
something precious that I'd lost.

37:48.200 --> 37:50.830
Huh? No...

37:50.830 --> 37:52.830
but I didn't do anything.

37:53.750 --> 37:55.120
It's all right.

37:55.120 --> 37:57.460
Thank you from the bottom of my heart!

37:58.420 --> 38:00.710
Tokito...

38:01.300 --> 38:04.800
Anyway, what's going on with Nezuko?

38:05.180 --> 38:07.010
Well, actually...

38:07.010 --> 38:09.100
Why, you...

38:12.180 --> 38:14.350
What did you do with my sword?

38:14.350 --> 38:15.730
Calm down!

38:16.020 --> 38:16.940
Huh?

38:17.650 --> 38:18.860
Mr. Haganezuka?

38:19.190 --> 38:23.490
I asked you what happened
to the sword I was honing!

38:23.490 --> 38:25.700
I used it to fight an Upper Rank!

38:25.700 --> 38:27.780
Yeah, to fight?

38:27.780 --> 38:29.370
To fight, and...

38:29.370 --> 38:30.450
Huh?

38:30.450 --> 38:31.990
What happened then?

38:31.990 --> 38:34.000
I blacked out, and...

38:34.620 --> 38:36.500
Oh, the sword? I've got it—

38:36.500 --> 38:37.620
You broke it, right?

38:38.330 --> 38:39.540
Uh, no.

38:39.540 --> 38:42.300
You broke it, didn't you? Tell me the truth!

38:42.300 --> 38:44.340
Tell! Me! The! Truth!

38:44.340 --> 38:46.300
I didn't... I didn't...

38:46.300 --> 38:47.680
No, it's right here!

38:47.680 --> 38:49.510
I'm going to kill you!

38:49.510 --> 38:51.050
Nezuko, run!

38:51.050 --> 38:52.010
Run!

38:52.010 --> 38:53.220
You're not getting away!

38:53.520 --> 38:55.890
Mr. Haganezuka! Calm down!

38:55.890 --> 38:57.810
The sword is right here!
Come back here!
Come back here!

38:57.810 --> 38:58.350
Like hell, I'll calm down!
The sword is right here!

38:58.350 --> 38:58.940
Like hell, I'll calm down!

38:58.940 --> 38:59.650
- Come on, come on!
- You guys!
Like hell, I'll calm down!

38:59.650 --> 39:01.560
- Come on, come on!
- You guys!

39:02.150 --> 39:04.480
You guys!

39:07.700 --> 39:09.490
Ms. Kanroji!

39:17.710 --> 39:20.540
We won! We won!

39:20.540 --> 39:22.630
We all won together!

39:22.630 --> 39:25.880
So amazing! We're all alive!

39:26.170 --> 39:28.470
Thank goodness!

39:29.050 --> 39:31.260
Yes, thank goodness!

39:35.020 --> 39:35.810
Huh?

39:35.810 --> 39:36.850
Yes...

39:36.850 --> 39:39.020
thank goodness!

39:40.400 --> 39:42.860
Whaaaaat?

39:50.780 --> 39:52.070
Tanjiro!

39:52.570 --> 39:53.580
Yes?

39:56.450 --> 39:59.250
Thank goodness!

40:00.250 --> 40:02.000
She's talking...

40:02.000 --> 40:04.250
but her eyes and fangs are the same...

40:04.630 --> 40:07.380
so I'm not sure what's going on, but I...

40:07.710 --> 40:09.880
I'm so glad that Nezuko's alive!

40:10.260 --> 40:12.470
Thank goodness she's alive!

40:13.930 --> 40:15.600
Yes! Yes!

40:16.010 --> 40:18.140
Thank goodness!

40:18.930 --> 40:21.640
Thank goodness!

40:22.230 --> 40:24.270
Thank goodness!

40:24.810 --> 40:27.030
Thank goodness!

40:29.070 --> 40:31.450
Thank goodness!

40:32.280 --> 40:33.740
<i>Tanjiro...</i>

40:34.410 --> 40:37.910
<i>I thank you for providing me
with the Twelve Kizuki's and Nezuko's blood...</i>

40:37.910 --> 40:41.290
<i>and for helping me with my research.</i>

40:46.090 --> 40:50.050
<i>The man in Asakusa
who was turned into a demon by Muzan...</i>

40:50.050 --> 40:52.510
<i>has regained his sense of self.</i>

40:52.970 --> 40:55.300
<i>It's thanks to Nezuko's blood.</i>

40:56.430 --> 40:58.810
<i>Released from Muzan's control...</i>

40:59.180 --> 41:02.310
<i>he can live on a small amount of blood.</i>

41:02.600 --> 41:06.690
<i>The transformation of Nezuko's blood
surprises me.</i>

41:06.980 --> 41:12.700
<i>In such a short time, the components
of her blood have changed again and again.</i>

41:22.160 --> 41:23.620
<i>All this time...</i>

41:23.620 --> 41:25.500
<i>I have been thinking.</i>

41:26.290 --> 41:29.380
<i>Why it is that Nezuko has yet to regain
her sense of self...</i>

41:29.710 --> 41:33.260
<i>and remains in a child-like state?</i>

41:33.930 --> 41:35.260
<i>I believe that...</i>

41:35.260 --> 41:37.180
<i>in Nezuko's mind...</i>

41:37.180 --> 41:40.020
<i>there's something more important
than regaining her sense of self...</i>

41:40.020 --> 41:43.230
<i>something that she needs to prioritize.</i>

41:45.440 --> 41:46.480
Yushiro?

41:46.770 --> 41:47.650
Yushiro?

41:48.860 --> 41:50.860
Yes, Lady Tamayo?

41:50.860 --> 41:52.280
What can I do for you?

41:52.280 --> 41:54.030
Can you summon Chachamaru for me?

41:58.830 --> 42:02.160
Chachamaru is ready to go now.

42:08.250 --> 42:11.630
Give my regards
to Tanjiro and Nezuko, okay?

42:19.930 --> 42:21.310
<i>Tanjiro...</i>

42:21.640 --> 42:25.520
<i>This is pure speculation on my part.</i>

42:26.730 --> 42:29.190
<i>But I believe that it won't be long...</i>

42:30.230 --> 42:33.360
<i>before Nezuko can conquer the sun.</i>

42:42.910 --> 42:43.870
Right!

42:47.920 --> 42:49.040
Thanks!

42:49.750 --> 42:51.130
Understood!

43:01.430 --> 43:03.770
Lord Tecchin!

43:04.390 --> 43:06.390
Oh! Kotetsu!

43:07.190 --> 43:10.900
Mr. Tanjiro's leaving the village,
so he'd like to say goodbye.

43:14.110 --> 43:15.320
Mr. Tanjiro?

43:19.410 --> 43:22.330
HYOTTOKO

43:22.330 --> 43:24.740
Are you feeling all right?
HYOTTOKO

43:24.740 --> 43:28.120
Yes! Thank you
for all that you did for me.
HYOTTOKO

43:28.120 --> 43:29.290
And thank you.
HYOTTOKO

43:29.290 --> 43:31.500
You even provided me
with this cart.
HYOTTOKO

43:32.000 --> 43:34.960
I'm the one who should be thanking you.

43:34.960 --> 43:37.670
You did a good job protecting this village!

43:37.670 --> 43:39.180
I'm grateful to you!

43:39.510 --> 43:42.600
I wasn't able to do that much on my own.

43:43.050 --> 43:44.810
It was everyone pulling together!

43:45.220 --> 43:46.850
Our combined strength...

43:46.850 --> 43:51.150
and that sword that's been connecting us
to centuries of hopes until today.

43:51.150 --> 43:53.940
That's why we were able to defeat
those Upper Rank demons.

43:54.270 --> 43:55.780
Yes, yes.

43:55.780 --> 43:57.440
You're right.

43:58.240 --> 44:00.110
And where's your sister?

44:00.950 --> 44:02.410
She's asleep.

44:02.410 --> 44:04.580
Since I really exhausted her.

44:12.580 --> 44:13.840
I see!

44:13.840 --> 44:16.420
I'm truly glad that she's all right!

44:17.760 --> 44:19.010
Yes!

44:20.220 --> 44:21.380
Huh?

44:24.550 --> 44:29.230
Hey, Kanamori! Is that Hotaru
lurking around over there?

44:29.230 --> 44:30.480
Yes.

44:30.480 --> 44:32.270
What is he doing?

44:32.270 --> 44:34.980
He seems to think that he's hiding...

44:34.980 --> 44:39.150
but apparently, he can't forgive Tanjiro
for using a sword before it was fully honed.

44:39.150 --> 44:40.650
Huh?

44:40.950 --> 44:43.280
What am I going to do with that guy?

44:43.280 --> 44:44.370
Hotaru!

44:44.370 --> 44:46.120
Come over here a second!

44:48.750 --> 44:51.500
I said, come over here!

44:56.800 --> 44:58.050
Hotaru!

44:58.630 --> 45:00.470
I'm telling you, it's all his fault.

45:01.340 --> 45:02.340
Ouch!

45:02.630 --> 45:04.260
Right? Am I right?

45:04.260 --> 45:04.890
Am I right?

45:04.890 --> 45:05.350
Hey! Come on... Hey!
Am I right?

45:05.350 --> 45:06.300
Sorry!
Hey! Come on... Hey!

45:06.300 --> 45:07.560
Ouch! That hurts!
Hey! Come on... Hey!

45:07.560 --> 45:07.890
Ouch! That hurts!

45:07.890 --> 45:08.720
Hotaru!

45:09.020 --> 45:11.690
But... if Mr. Tanjiro
and the others hadn't come...

45:11.690 --> 45:14.230
I'm sure the village
would've been destroyed!

45:14.560 --> 45:16.440
Ow! Ow!

45:16.440 --> 45:17.400
Hah!

45:19.610 --> 45:20.820
Now, Hotaru...

45:21.190 --> 45:24.610
the real reason you came here
was to speak to Tanjiro...

45:24.610 --> 45:27.160
who came all the way here, right?

45:30.830 --> 45:32.370
Mr. Haganezuka...

45:32.370 --> 45:36.210
Thank you for always
taking care of my sword!

45:36.630 --> 45:38.340
I came to this village...

45:38.340 --> 45:40.590
because I wanted to thank you for that.

45:42.550 --> 45:48.050
I-I'll reforge your sword for you,
so wait for it at the Butterfly Mansion.

45:48.560 --> 45:50.560
You're going to repair it for me?

45:50.560 --> 45:53.060
Don't you want me to fix it?

45:53.060 --> 45:54.600
Thank you very much!

45:54.940 --> 45:57.060
S-S-Sure.

45:57.770 --> 45:58.980
Mr. Haganezuka...

45:58.980 --> 46:00.780
Are you, like, embarrassed?

46:02.110 --> 46:03.320
Kotetsu!

46:03.320 --> 46:04.900
Young Kotetsu!

46:05.280 --> 46:06.910
Pretty funny, huh?

46:11.950 --> 46:14.830
No way am I embarrassed!

46:17.250 --> 46:20.000
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Putting his foot in his mouth again!

46:20.000 --> 46:20.380
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

46:23.300 --> 46:26.470
But really, thank you so much!

46:26.470 --> 46:29.300
I'm going to work harder and harder!

46:29.800 --> 46:32.390
Yes! Good luck to you!

46:32.890 --> 46:34.600
All right, Kakushi.

46:34.600 --> 46:36.770
I'm counting on you.

46:37.440 --> 46:38.400
Huh?

46:39.230 --> 46:41.480
Now then, just as you did coming here...

46:41.480 --> 46:43.400
you'll wear this blindfold
and put in these nose plugs.

46:51.120 --> 46:53.620
All right, take care, everyone!

46:54.290 --> 46:55.960
I wish you good health!

46:55.960 --> 46:57.830
Please be careful!

46:57.830 --> 46:59.750
Please come back sometime, okay?

47:00.250 --> 47:02.210
Goodbye!

47:16.270 --> 47:17.980
What's the matter?

47:22.150 --> 47:23.650
Mr. Tanjiro...

47:28.450 --> 47:29.950
Tanjiro!

47:29.950 --> 47:31.120
Thanks!

47:31.120 --> 47:32.370
Thank you!

47:33.540 --> 47:34.490
Take care!

47:34.490 --> 47:36.540
You can count on us
to take care of your swords!

47:36.540 --> 47:37.460
Tanjiro!

47:37.460 --> 47:38.920
Hey, thanks!

47:38.920 --> 47:39.960
Tanjiro!

47:39.960 --> 47:41.460
Thanks!

47:44.170 --> 47:45.460
Thanks!

48:11.490 --> 48:16.450
Shall we do without the blindfold and nose plugs
until we've left this village?

48:17.200 --> 48:18.000
Yes!

48:18.000 --> 48:18.870
Thanks!

48:18.870 --> 48:19.960
Tanjiro!

48:21.250 --> 48:22.080
See you!

48:22.080 --> 48:22.920
Thank you!

48:22.920 --> 48:26.250
- Tanjiro!
- Thanks!

48:26.250 --> 48:28.800
- Thank you!
- Tanjiro!

48:42.010 --> 48:47.270
Where do we go running through
the dark night?

48:47.270 --> 48:53.460
The moonlight is the only guiding light

48:53.460 --> 48:58.580
The pain and sadness can't be wiped away

48:58.580 --> 49:04.360
But I won't let the blaze
in my heart put out

49:04.360 --> 49:07.220
For who do we carry out this will

49:07.220 --> 49:10.050
And tear apart the darkness for?

49:10.050 --> 49:12.750
Under the sunlight

49:12.750 --> 49:15.680
Until the light shines through

49:15.680 --> 49:18.220
Soar above and put on

49:18.220 --> 49:21.370
The fire in your unleashed heart

49:21.370 --> 49:26.890
Now beyond the dawn

49:26.890 --> 49:32.500
Until I can love this world
you are in once again

49:32.500 --> 49:37.490
Even if my life ends, carry on

49:37.490 --> 49:44.580
The miracle that the bond created

49:49.810 --> 49:55.580
Feelings, dreams, wavеring reality

49:55.580 --> 50:00.830
Brandishing each our own justice
timе and again

50:00.830 --> 50:03.510
For who do we carry on our lives for

50:03.510 --> 50:06.500
Intertwining destiny

50:06.500 --> 50:09.230
Road of serpent, countless sins

50:09.230 --> 50:12.190
Cut them all down

50:12.190 --> 50:17.800
Now, unleash the fire we lit

50:17.800 --> 50:23.300
Soar above and run ahead
to change our tomorrow

50:23.300 --> 50:29.010
Never again will I let go of this world
where I'm with you

50:29.010 --> 50:31.510
I'll go with you

50:31.510 --> 50:37.260
I relive that day even when
I close my eyes

50:37.260 --> 50:42.900
No matter how overwhelmed, someday

50:42.900 --> 50:49.970
I will dedicate to you the future
you've been yearning for

51:00.130 --> 51:02.710
Soar above and put on

51:02.710 --> 51:05.880
The fire in your unleashed heart

51:05.880 --> 51:11.410
Now beyond the dawn

51:11.410 --> 51:17.030
Now, unleash the fire we lit

51:17.030 --> 51:22.630
Soar above and run ahead
to change our tomorrow

51:22.630 --> 51:28.160
Until I can love this world
you were in once again

51:28.160 --> 51:33.230
Even if my life ends, I'll carry on

51:33.230 --> 51:40.330
The miracle that the bond created

51:56.710 --> 51:59.100
