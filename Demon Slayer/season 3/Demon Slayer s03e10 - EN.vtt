WEBVTT

00:13.320 --> 00:15.860
L-Lord Tokito!

00:18.740 --> 00:21.410
Don't underestimate me, you brat!

00:42.800 --> 00:48.020
Where do we go running through
the dark night?

00:48.020 --> 00:53.980
The moonlight is the only guiding light

00:53.980 --> 00:59.070
The pain and sadness can't be wiped away

00:59.070 --> 01:04.870
But I won't let
the blaze in my heart put out

01:04.870 --> 01:07.790
For who do we carry out this will

01:07.790 --> 01:10.710
And tear apart the darkness for?

01:10.710 --> 01:13.250
Under the sunlight

01:13.250 --> 01:16.550
Until the light shines through

01:16.550 --> 01:21.970
Soar above and put on

01:21.970 --> 01:27.600
The fire in your unleashed heart,
now beyond the dawn

01:27.600 --> 01:33.150
Until I can love this world
you are in once again

01:33.150 --> 01:37.980
Even if my life ends, carry on

01:37.980 --> 01:44.870
The miracle that the bond created

01:55.840 --> 02:01.010
EPISODE 9:
MIST HASHIRA MUICHIRO TOKITO

02:04.390 --> 02:07.180
Hey, it's not like I'm underestimating you.

02:07.180 --> 02:09.310
I'm just stating a fact.

02:09.310 --> 02:12.770
You're only going to get beheaded
by me and die anyway.

02:13.230 --> 02:14.270
Because...

02:14.270 --> 02:17.280
for some reason,
I'm really in the zone right now.

02:18.400 --> 02:19.990
I wonder why.

02:19.990 --> 02:24.660
UPPER FIVE
The way you're speaking to me
is disrespectful, you miserable brat!

02:24.660 --> 02:29.080
After only having lived for ten years or so!
UPPER FIVE

02:33.170 --> 02:38.210
Even if that's true, there isn't one thing
about you that I can respect, so...

02:39.010 --> 02:41.090
The way you look and the way you talk...

02:41.090 --> 02:43.220
are both totally creepy.

02:43.220 --> 02:46.560
You can't appreciate my beauty, my grace...

02:46.890 --> 02:49.060
nor my elegance...

02:49.060 --> 02:53.060
because you're uneducated and poor!

02:53.400 --> 02:57.440
Just like a dung beetle can't read
even if you show it a book!

02:57.780 --> 03:01.110
I don't know, you seem
more likely to be living in dung.

03:01.110 --> 03:03.030
Shut up, dung beetle!

03:03.030 --> 03:06.740
Look at you with your short limbs
and undersized blade!

03:06.740 --> 03:09.080
You can't even reach my neck!

03:09.450 --> 03:12.620
No, didn't I just reach it with a vengeance?

03:12.620 --> 03:15.670
And in the first place,
your limbs are shorter.

03:15.670 --> 03:16.710
Oh, wait.

03:16.710 --> 03:20.010
Were you just thinking out loud
about yourself?

03:20.010 --> 03:21.590
Sorry to interrupt.

03:22.050 --> 03:23.380
Hyo, hyo!

03:23.380 --> 03:25.510
My, what a cheap insult!

03:25.510 --> 03:28.680
Did you think that was enough to fluster me?

03:28.680 --> 03:31.060
I can see that you'll do anything to win!

03:31.060 --> 03:33.310
Not a pretty sight!

03:33.650 --> 03:35.480
Hmm... Hmm...

03:35.860 --> 03:37.150
Hyo, hyo!

03:37.150 --> 03:38.480
What is it?

03:39.150 --> 03:40.940
It's really bugging me.

03:40.940 --> 03:44.110
Isn't that vase of yours
kind of misshapen?

03:44.570 --> 03:46.990
It doesn't look symmetrical.

03:48.240 --> 03:50.330
What a piece of crap.

03:50.330 --> 03:51.370
UPPER

03:51.700 --> 03:56.130
That's because your eyeballs are rotten, dammit!

03:56.130 --> 03:59.050
My vase!

03:59.460 --> 04:03.090
How the hell is it misshapen?

04:03.680 --> 04:04.970
<i>Blood Demon Art...</i>

04:06.850 --> 04:09.350
<i>Ten Thousand Gliding Slime Fish!</i>

04:09.640 --> 04:13.640
These 10,000 assassins
will pick you to the bone!

04:13.640 --> 04:16.560
And I'll make you part of one of my works!

04:16.560 --> 04:17.860
<i>Mist Breathing...</i>

04:22.110 --> 04:23.490
<i>Sixth Form...</i>

04:23.820 --> 04:26.070
<i>Lunar Dispersing Mist!</i>

04:31.160 --> 04:32.290
<i>All?</i>

04:32.290 --> 04:34.620
<i>He slashed them all?</i>

04:34.910 --> 04:37.500
<i>That speed and that attack range!</i>

04:37.500 --> 04:40.550
<i>What happened to my poison?</i>

04:40.550 --> 04:42.550
<i>Unexpected!</i>

04:42.550 --> 04:44.840
<i>But even so, no harm, no foul!</i>

04:45.260 --> 04:50.720
<i>Those fish will disperse poison before they turn
to dust after being slashed by that Nichirin Sword!</i>

04:50.720 --> 04:53.430
<i>Transdermal poison no less!</i>

04:53.430 --> 04:56.190
<i>So it can also be absorbed through the skin!</i>

04:56.480 --> 04:58.940
<i>Get hit with that, and you're done!</i>

04:59.270 --> 05:00.860
<i>Mist Breathing...</i>

05:00.860 --> 05:02.360
<i>Third Form...</i>

05:02.360 --> 05:03.990
<i>Scattering Mist Splash!</i>

05:10.530 --> 05:12.490
<i>What the hell?</i>

05:12.790 --> 05:16.000
<i>That one swing blasted them all away!</i>

05:20.130 --> 05:21.840
<i>You can shed your skin, too?</i>

05:25.970 --> 05:28.550
Oh, what a pain in the butt.

05:28.550 --> 05:31.930
Would you mind not dodging
and racing up trees?

05:31.930 --> 05:34.270
Hyo, hyo, hyo, hyo!

05:34.270 --> 05:38.230
Allow me to show you my true form.

05:38.230 --> 05:39.230
Sure.

05:41.360 --> 05:44.940
You're just the third person
to see me in this state.

05:45.280 --> 05:46.320
So a lot of us, huh?

05:46.320 --> 05:47.490
Shut up!

05:47.490 --> 05:51.830
No one has ever lived to tell the tale
after I've started taking it seriously!

05:52.160 --> 05:53.660
That's amazing.

05:55.040 --> 05:57.750
Shut your mouth,
you dim-witted brat!

05:57.750 --> 06:03.170
These translucent scales
are even harder and stronger than diamonds!

06:03.170 --> 06:05.960
I kneaded them myself inside my vase!

06:05.960 --> 06:09.550
Behold my perfect beauty and...

06:09.880 --> 06:11.800
bow down in awe!

06:22.110 --> 06:26.280
Why don't you say something,
you useless puppet!

06:26.280 --> 06:29.780
You really know how to rub someone
the wrong way, brat!

06:29.780 --> 06:33.200
But you just told me to shut my mouth.

06:33.660 --> 06:34.780
Not to mention...

06:35.410 --> 06:37.750
it didn't really surprise me.

06:50.180 --> 06:52.260
Hyo, hyo, hyo!

06:52.680 --> 06:56.350
Didn't you just tell me
not to race up trees?

06:56.350 --> 06:59.140
What a hassle!

06:59.140 --> 07:03.480
No, that was just because it stunk.
I thought my nose was going to fall off.

07:03.480 --> 07:06.610
What do you think of my godlike power?

07:06.610 --> 07:10.990
Everything I touch with my fist
turns into lovely fresh fish!

07:10.990 --> 07:12.860
And this speed!

07:12.860 --> 07:16.240
The flexible, yet tough springs of my body!

07:16.240 --> 07:20.250
Not only that, but these rippling scales
allow me to move without restraint!

07:20.250 --> 07:22.370
Free as a bird!

07:23.790 --> 07:26.750
You're trembling, huh? Are you terrified?

07:26.750 --> 07:30.340
I still wasn't serious
when I launched that attack just now!

07:33.380 --> 07:34.430
Huh?

07:37.100 --> 07:41.430
Even the most jaw-dropping attack
is pointless if you can't land it, right?

07:43.020 --> 07:44.690
<i>Remember...</i>

07:44.980 --> 07:47.360
<i>that boiling fury.</i>

07:53.320 --> 07:59.040
<i>I watched as maggots infested
my beloved brother's body, and he began to rot.</i>

07:59.490 --> 08:02.540
<i>Then, the maggots started on me, as well...</i>

08:02.790 --> 08:05.330
<i>and I found myself on the brink of death.</i>

08:10.170 --> 08:11.710
Boil some water right away!

08:11.710 --> 08:14.470
Apply some clean cloths to the wounds!

08:14.470 --> 08:15.590
Yes!

08:20.850 --> 08:22.230
How's he doing?

08:22.230 --> 08:24.140
He's already passed away!

08:24.440 --> 08:27.310
Don't let the other one die,
no matter what!

08:27.310 --> 08:28.150
Yes!

08:30.650 --> 08:33.360
Brother...

08:44.750 --> 08:47.040
<i>If they hadn't saved me
in the nick of time,</i>

08:47.040 --> 08:49.340
<i>I would've died.</i>

08:55.720 --> 08:59.640
Lord Tokito! You haven't healed yet!

09:01.180 --> 09:03.270
<i>I may have lost my memory...</i>

09:03.270 --> 09:05.350
<i>but my body remembers.</i>

09:09.610 --> 09:12.440
<i>This fury will never leave me until I die.</i>

09:15.650 --> 09:20.830
<i>That's why I worked my way up
by training so hard that I'd vomit blood!</i>

09:21.330 --> 09:23.160
<i>To annihilate the demons!</i>

09:23.490 --> 09:26.160
<i>To wipe them out once and for all!</i>

09:26.540 --> 09:30.210
See me in all my serious glory!

09:30.210 --> 09:31.960
<i>Blood Demon Art...</i>

09:31.960 --> 09:34.010
<i>Killer Fish Scales!</i>

09:34.510 --> 09:36.220
Hyo, hyo, hyo!

09:36.550 --> 09:40.970
Now, what do you say
to my illogical movements?

09:40.970 --> 09:43.260
My scales allow me to move at will!

09:43.260 --> 09:44.970
Impossible to predict!

09:44.970 --> 09:48.850
I love nothing more than going
against the laws of nature!

09:49.190 --> 09:52.360
Now, what kind of art
should I make out of you?

09:52.360 --> 09:57.780
I can rip off that ugly head of yours
and replace it with a lovely fish!

09:58.780 --> 10:00.660
<i>It's over for you!</i>

10:03.200 --> 10:04.700
<i>Mist Breathing...</i>

10:04.700 --> 10:06.410
<i>Seventh Form...</i>

10:06.910 --> 10:08.000
<i>Obscuring Clouds.</i>

10:13.800 --> 10:16.170
<i>No, there he is! Found him!</i>

10:17.970 --> 10:19.180
<i>Not there?</i>

10:21.680 --> 10:23.600
<i>Over there, huh? Hyo, hyo!</i>

10:23.890 --> 10:25.600
<i>You're too slow!</i>

10:26.100 --> 10:27.350
<i>What's this?</i>

10:27.600 --> 10:29.390
<i>How can you vanish?</i>

10:30.600 --> 10:32.310
<i>What's going on here?</i>

10:32.310 --> 10:33.980
<i>Where did he go?</i>

10:33.980 --> 10:35.860
<i>It's like... It's like...</i>

10:36.530 --> 10:39.610
<i>The area's being enveloped in mist!</i>

10:44.740 --> 10:46.450
Hey, so tell me...

10:46.450 --> 10:47.580
What?

10:47.580 --> 10:49.080
What made you think...

10:49.080 --> 10:50.460
Huh?

10:50.750 --> 10:54.460
...that you were the only one
not taking this seriously?

11:07.890 --> 11:09.230
<i>What the hell?</i>

11:09.230 --> 11:11.600
<i>What the hell? I'm upside-down!</i>

11:11.900 --> 11:15.110
<i>What's going on? I can't sense anything!</i>

11:15.110 --> 11:17.820
<i>That little pest is finally showing himself!</i>

11:17.820 --> 11:21.110
<i>I need to make short work of him
and report to Lord Muzan!</i>

11:25.660 --> 11:27.120
<i>Huh?</i>

11:27.410 --> 11:30.750
<i>D-D-D-D-Decapitated?</i>

11:30.750 --> 11:33.630
<i>Decapitated, decapitated, decapitated?</i>

11:33.960 --> 11:36.090
<i>Ridiculous! Impossible! Unbelievable!</i>

11:36.090 --> 11:38.170
<i>What an unheard-of, abnormal situation!</i>

11:38.170 --> 11:40.380
<i>Did I actually lose?</i>

11:40.380 --> 11:42.970
<i>To a child... Me, lose?</i>

11:42.970 --> 11:44.970
<i>Me, of all people?</i>

11:45.390 --> 11:46.850
It's over for you.

11:46.850 --> 11:48.060
Goodbye.

11:48.060 --> 11:51.310
No need to ever be reborn again, all right?

11:51.890 --> 11:53.650
Curses!

11:53.650 --> 11:55.560
This should just never happen!

11:55.560 --> 11:57.360
You, a lowly human!

11:57.360 --> 12:00.110
How dare you slice off my head!

12:00.400 --> 12:03.110
You abominable, low-level life-form!

12:03.110 --> 12:07.160
My life is worth 100 of you and your ilk!

12:07.160 --> 12:10.330
I am one of the chosen, exalted, life-forms!

12:10.330 --> 12:13.160
You're weak! After you're born,
all you do is grow old!

12:13.410 --> 12:16.670
And I took your insignificant,
unimportant life in my hands...

12:17.040 --> 12:21.050
and used my divine hands
to elevate you to a nobler work of art!

12:21.380 --> 12:24.220
You vulgar little maggot—

12:34.100 --> 12:35.980
I've heard enough, so...

12:36.810 --> 12:40.070
could you just go to hell already?

You saved us!

14:05.570 --> 14:07.320
Are you all right?

14:07.740 --> 14:09.570
I'm fine, I'm fine.

14:09.570 --> 14:11.160
Are you sure about that?

14:11.450 --> 14:12.410
Yeah.

14:12.410 --> 14:14.700
I really feel amazing right now.

14:14.700 --> 14:18.370
And I've got to join
Tanjiro and the others right away.

14:18.670 --> 14:21.460
You're looking really pale, you know!

14:21.790 --> 14:23.550
Are you sure you're all right?

14:24.050 --> 14:26.170
I told you, I'm totally fine.

14:26.170 --> 14:28.170
Are you even listening to me?

14:29.180 --> 14:30.010
Huh?

14:30.010 --> 14:31.890
You're heaving!

14:31.890 --> 14:33.970
And you're trembling, aren't you?

14:33.970 --> 14:35.100
Hey you! Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?
Don't worry about me.

14:35.100 --> 14:37.680
Could you go check on Kotetsu and—
Hey you! Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?

14:37.680 --> 14:38.390
Could you go check on Kotetsu and—

14:39.690 --> 14:42.150
You're frothing at the mouth!

14:42.150 --> 14:43.270
Whoa!

14:43.270 --> 14:44.570
Lord Tokito!

14:44.570 --> 14:46.820
Oh, crap! Oh, crap! Is he going to die?

14:46.820 --> 14:48.030
What am I supposed to do?

14:48.030 --> 14:50.030
Hey! Somebody!

15:03.500 --> 15:06.170
Whoa! He's choking on the foam!
This is bad!

15:06.170 --> 15:08.840
Wh-What... What should I do?

15:08.840 --> 15:11.180
You should lay him on his side.

15:11.180 --> 15:11.930
Huh?

15:11.930 --> 15:13.600
R-Right!

15:14.260 --> 15:15.760
Huh?

15:19.020 --> 15:20.350
Whoa!

15:20.350 --> 15:22.650
It's the ghost of Young Kotetsu! Whoa!

15:22.650 --> 15:24.190
HYOTTOKO
No, I'm not a ghost
since I'm so not dead.
It's the ghost of Young Kotetsu! Whoa!

15:24.190 --> 15:25.440
No, I'm not a ghost
since I'm so not dead.
HYOTTOKO

15:25.900 --> 15:30.280
No, ghosts are never aware
that they're ghosts! That they're dead!

15:30.280 --> 15:31.950
No, come on, I'm alive.

15:31.950 --> 15:37.040
No, your solar plexus! How could you
possibly be alive after losing all that blood?

15:37.370 --> 15:40.620
This is the blood from the arm they slashed.

15:40.620 --> 15:42.500
It got on me when I was pressing on it.

15:42.830 --> 15:44.670
My arm wound's pretty deep,

15:44.670 --> 15:47.840
and if it doesn't stop bleeding soon,
I might actually die from that.

15:48.250 --> 15:50.840
As for my belly...

15:51.800 --> 15:56.220
that's where I was carrying the hilt
Tanjiro entrusted to me, and it saved me!

15:56.970 --> 16:00.810
He said he wanted it on his new sword.

16:08.820 --> 16:11.400
<i>Let's give it our all together as Hashira!</i>

16:23.410 --> 16:24.500
<i>See?</i>

16:25.710 --> 16:28.210
<i>Everything turned out just fine.</i>

16:29.960 --> 16:31.510
<i>Father...</i>

16:32.840 --> 16:34.340
<i>Mother...</i>

16:41.680 --> 16:43.180
<i>Muichiro...</i>

16:52.650 --> 16:54.450
<i>You did great.</i>

16:56.950 --> 16:58.490
<i>Brother...</i>

17:05.120 --> 17:06.830
<i>Thank you.</i>

17:16.630 --> 17:18.640
<i>There are five wooden dragon heads!</i>

17:18.930 --> 17:21.470
<i>They can expand to about 66 shaku!</i>

17:21.470 --> 17:23.560
<i>All right! That's one thing I've found out!</i>

17:26.560 --> 17:28.190
<i>Hinokami Kagura...</i>

17:28.190 --> 17:29.150
<i>Clear Blue...</i>

17:59.180 --> 18:01.890
<i>M-My eardrums just burst!</i>

18:02.180 --> 18:03.560
<i>I'm so dizzy...</i>

18:03.560 --> 18:05.390
<i>I can't get up! It's no good!</i>

18:05.680 --> 18:06.680
<i>Get on your feet!</i>

18:06.680 --> 18:07.600
<i>Hurry!</i>

18:07.600 --> 18:09.770
<i>Here comes an attack!</i>

18:09.770 --> 18:10.900
HATRED

18:23.200 --> 18:25.580
<i>It can use the powers
of the four Emotion demons, too!</i>

18:26.410 --> 18:28.920
<i>Not only that, but it's raised
its attack power, too!</i>

18:33.800 --> 18:36.590
<i>No time to use breathing skills!
I can't heal!</i>

18:41.890 --> 18:43.760
<i>I can't handle the attacks anymore...</i>

18:43.760 --> 18:45.310
<i>even if I anticipate them!</i>

18:47.180 --> 18:48.810
<i>I'm so winded!</i>

18:49.100 --> 18:52.810
<i>But if I can get 66 shaku away,
I can somehow...</i>

18:53.150 --> 18:54.730
<i>All right, I can do it from here!</i>

18:54.730 --> 18:55.900
UPPER FOUR

18:59.950 --> 19:01.530
<i>It's stretching!</i>

19:03.280 --> 19:05.030
<i>Make a move!</i>

19:05.030 --> 19:06.040
<i>Slash it!</i>

19:33.480 --> 19:34.560
<i>It's hopeless!</i>

19:34.560 --> 19:36.150
<i>I'm getting crushed!</i>

19:42.910 --> 19:44.370
It's over.

20:07.850 --> 20:09.600
A Hashira?

20:12.190 --> 20:14.600
What a ghastly monster!
What is that thing?

20:15.650 --> 20:16.690
Ms. Kanroji?

20:16.690 --> 20:17.980
Are you okay?

20:17.980 --> 20:21.030
Sorry I'm late!
That was really cutting it close, huh?

20:25.410 --> 20:27.830
M-Ms. Kanroji!

20:28.950 --> 20:30.660
Tanjiro...

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
You can take a break now! Good job!

20:34.000 --> 20:35.170
I'm proud of you!

20:35.170 --> 20:39.050
I-I can't hear because my eardrums burst.

20:39.670 --> 20:41.210
Right.

20:41.590 --> 20:43.220
Tanjiro...

20:46.550 --> 20:49.970
I'm going to rescue
Nezuko and Genya, all right?

20:51.100 --> 20:52.980
You damn slip of a girl...

20:54.890 --> 20:57.060
So just leave the rest to me!

21:02.990 --> 21:04.110
Wait!

21:04.610 --> 21:06.780
That's an Upper Rank!
It's an Upper Rank demon!

21:36.640 --> 21:41.640
I call the elemental name of love...

21:44.600 --> 21:47.690
I've always been looking for it

21:47.690 --> 21:50.400
Where did love go astray?

21:50.400 --> 21:55.660
I keep struggling in the endless nights

21:55.660 --> 21:58.620
The absurdity is just
going circles in this world

21:58.620 --> 22:01.290
I'm feeling my life trembling so hard

22:01.290 --> 22:06.540
What chaos,
falling in love in these times

22:06.540 --> 22:11.590
No matter how many times
sorrow overwhelms the world

22:11.590 --> 22:17.510
Your elegant, dancing blade

22:17.510 --> 22:20.810
Will clear the way so dreams can pass

22:21.600 --> 22:24.350
I wish we could love each other
and laugh together

22:24.350 --> 22:29.610
I wish I could protect
all kindhearted people

22:29.610 --> 22:32.690
If I wish earnestly,
it will surely come true

22:32.690 --> 22:35.280
I hear your voice calling me

22:35.280 --> 22:43.500
Soon, sunrise will burn the sky
as we see in our dreams

22:43.500 --> 22:51.500
I ran beyond the fluttering flag

22:51.500 --> 22:54.470
With this beautiful world,

22:54.470 --> 23:00.050
I'm deeply in love

23:03.020 --> 23:03.480
PART 9

23:10.240 --> 23:11.570
So when's...

23:11.950 --> 23:13.240
our turn?

23:14.280 --> 23:16.490
Hey, when's my turn?

23:16.830 --> 23:18.080
Huh? Huh?

23:18.370 --> 23:20.830
I'm not detecting any traces of the enemy!

23:20.830 --> 23:22.460
Where the hell's the enemy?

23:22.460 --> 23:25.090
It's not happening for a while! Our turn!

23:25.420 --> 23:26.710
Huh?

23:28.050 --> 23:31.340
All right, we're gonna carry out today's mission,
then move on to the next mission.

23:31.630 --> 23:35.100
Next, Episode 10,
"Love Hashira Mitsuri Kanroji."

23:35.100 --> 23:37.350
You better demolish
that Upper Rank demon!

23:37.350 --> 23:38.350
Got that?

23:38.350 --> 23:39.430
Senpachiro?

23:39.430 --> 23:41.100
TO BE CONTINUED
