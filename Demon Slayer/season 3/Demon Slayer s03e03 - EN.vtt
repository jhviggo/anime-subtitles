WEBVTT

00:01.720 --> 00:02.850
Get lost, will you?

00:03.350 --> 00:05.350
I'm not giving you that key, no matter what!

00:05.350 --> 00:08.270
And don't think
I'm ever going to show you how to use it!

00:09.150 --> 00:10.360
<i>What's going on?</i>

00:10.360 --> 00:13.280
<i>Are those two fighting, maybe?</i>

00:13.650 --> 00:16.700
<i>What should I do?
It's bad manners to eavesdrop!</i>

00:16.700 --> 00:20.200
<i>But if they're fighting,
I should try to mediate.</i>

00:25.670 --> 00:27.670
Cut it out!

00:28.290 --> 00:30.750
What do you think you're doing?
Take your hands off him!

00:31.670 --> 00:34.090
Your voice is very annoying.

00:34.720 --> 00:35.760
Who are you?

00:35.760 --> 00:37.890
How could you do that to a little kid?

00:37.890 --> 00:39.140
Take your hands—

00:40.720 --> 00:42.640
<i>He's not even budging!</i>

00:43.180 --> 00:44.810
<i>He's got thinner arms than me.</i>

00:44.810 --> 00:46.810
<i>And he's not very big!</i>

00:47.310 --> 00:49.770
You take your hands off me.

00:52.730 --> 00:54.690
You're quite weak.

00:54.690 --> 00:57.320
It's a wonder you got into the Demon Slayer Corps.

00:57.950 --> 00:58.990
Huh?

00:59.870 --> 01:02.910
I'm getting a strange vibe from that box.

01:03.240 --> 01:05.250
A demon's presence, perhaps?

01:06.000 --> 01:07.870
What's inside?

01:07.870 --> 01:09.380
That box there?

01:09.960 --> 01:11.960
Don't you dare touch it!

02:42.840 --> 02:48.020
EPISODE 2:
YORIICHI TYPE ZERO

02:54.360 --> 02:55.520
<i>He took him.</i>

02:55.520 --> 02:56.570
Are you all right?

02:56.570 --> 02:58.150
L-Let go of me!

02:58.480 --> 03:00.780
You must be dizzy. That's dangerous!

03:00.780 --> 03:02.160
Get out of here!

03:02.450 --> 03:05.240
I'm not... I'm not giving that key to anyone!

03:05.240 --> 03:07.620
Not even if you torture me! No way!

03:07.620 --> 03:09.910
One more time, and it's going to break down!

03:10.250 --> 03:12.790
Have you been through torture training?

03:14.540 --> 03:18.670
Even most grown-ups can't take it.
You'd never last.

03:19.010 --> 03:22.180
I can see that you're stupid beyond belief.

03:22.930 --> 03:26.720
So what if it breaks down?
Just make another one.

03:26.720 --> 03:33.520
How many people do you think will perish
while you drone on and on about trivial matters?

03:35.060 --> 03:38.820
That's what it means
to obstruct a Hashira in his duty.

03:38.820 --> 03:43.280
A Hashira's time is worth far more
than time spent by you people.

03:43.570 --> 03:46.160
If you just think a little,
you'll eventually get that, won't you?

03:46.160 --> 03:48.280
Swordsmiths can't fight.

03:48.280 --> 03:50.540
You can't save lives.

03:50.540 --> 03:53.370
Because making weapons
is all you're good for.

03:55.080 --> 03:56.080
Come on.

03:56.080 --> 03:57.340
The key.

03:57.340 --> 04:00.670
Remember your place
whenever you take action.

04:00.670 --> 04:02.800
Since you're not a baby anymore.

04:06.890 --> 04:08.810
What are you doing?

04:08.810 --> 04:10.010
I just...

04:10.010 --> 04:11.310
I don't know why, but...

04:11.310 --> 04:12.850
I can't stand you!

04:12.850 --> 04:14.850
What is it? Tact, maybe?

04:14.850 --> 04:17.650
You have no tact, and you're cruel!

04:18.150 --> 04:21.070
You think this is cruel? You...

04:21.070 --> 04:22.740
You're not wrong!

04:22.740 --> 04:25.700
I admit that what you're saying
is mostly true,

04:25.700 --> 04:27.700
and it's probably not wrong!

04:27.950 --> 04:29.950
But being a swordsmith...

04:29.950 --> 04:31.790
is an important, vital job!

04:34.210 --> 04:38.080
Swordsmiths have amazing skills
that are totally different than ours!

04:38.080 --> 04:40.960
Because the fact is, if we didn't have
them to forge our swords,

04:40.960 --> 04:43.300
we couldn't do anything, could we?

04:44.550 --> 04:48.760
Swordsmen and swordsmiths
need each other!

04:48.760 --> 04:51.060
We're all fighting the same battle!

04:51.060 --> 04:53.270
Day in and day out,
each in our own way, we're fighting—

04:53.270 --> 04:54.020
Sorry...

04:55.100 --> 04:58.860
but I don't have time to stand here
listening to your boring speech.

05:03.820 --> 05:07.570
What should I do?
Can I carry him down by myself?

05:07.570 --> 05:09.990
No. I'll carry him.

05:09.990 --> 05:12.290
As long as he doesn't come to soon.

05:12.290 --> 05:15.120
Huh? His eyelids are twitching!

05:15.120 --> 05:16.790
He's about to wake up!

05:16.790 --> 05:17.710
See you!

05:17.710 --> 05:18.880
Huh? Hey!

05:20.840 --> 05:22.960
Uh... Are you okay?

05:22.960 --> 05:24.760
You shouldn't get up so fast.

05:24.760 --> 05:26.380
Was Mr. Haganezuka here?

05:26.380 --> 05:28.800
- Huh?
- Wasn't he here just now?

05:28.800 --> 05:31.510
No, he wasn't here!

05:33.470 --> 05:36.180
I see. So I was just imagining things.

05:36.520 --> 05:37.980
Where's that Hashira?

05:37.980 --> 05:41.060
I handed over the key, so he took off.

05:41.060 --> 05:43.070
So you handed it over, huh?

05:43.070 --> 05:45.440
I know you didn't seem to have a choice.

05:45.440 --> 05:50.410
Well, since I don't know what's going on,
I shouldn't be making a fuss about it.

05:50.410 --> 05:52.490
Oh no, don't say that!

05:52.490 --> 05:53.990
It made me happy.

05:53.990 --> 05:56.500
I'm a stranger to you,
but you stood up for me.

05:56.830 --> 05:58.710
Thank you very much!

05:58.710 --> 06:01.580
No, I wasn't that much help!

06:02.960 --> 06:06.010
Where's that man or whatever
who was standing here?

06:06.010 --> 06:08.050
That was a Mechanical Doll.

06:08.050 --> 06:10.300
Mechanical Doll?

06:10.300 --> 06:12.850
That guy just took it away with him.

06:13.220 --> 06:17.520
He needed the key to make the doll move.

06:18.310 --> 06:20.560
So it's really important to you.

06:21.600 --> 06:24.320
But what would a Hashira want with it?

06:24.320 --> 06:26.780
That one's special.

06:27.110 --> 06:32.910
That Mechanical Doll can overpower a human,
and it's capable of 108 moves.

06:32.910 --> 06:35.790
It can be used to train for combat.

06:36.330 --> 06:38.080
So that's why...

06:38.080 --> 06:39.250
But...

06:39.250 --> 06:40.750
now it's...

06:44.000 --> 06:45.090
What was that?

06:45.090 --> 06:47.010
That guy must've already...

06:47.010 --> 06:48.720
This way!

06:59.180 --> 07:00.810
Against a Hashira...

07:00.810 --> 07:02.020
Wow!

07:02.020 --> 07:06.020
That's the Mechanical Doll
built by my ancestors.

07:06.020 --> 07:08.190
Yoriichi Type Zero.

07:09.440 --> 07:10.360
But...

07:10.360 --> 07:12.160
why does he have six arms?

07:12.160 --> 07:13.740
His arms?

07:13.740 --> 07:19.870
According to my father, that doll
was modeled on an actual swordsman,

07:19.870 --> 07:25.250
but his moves couldn't be replicated
unless they gave it six arms.

07:27.300 --> 07:28.920
<i>That face...</i>

07:29.260 --> 07:32.550
<i>It somehow seems familiar,
but I'm not sure.</i>

07:32.550 --> 07:35.510
That swordsman... Who was he?
What did he do and where?

07:35.800 --> 07:39.020
Uh, sorry, but I don't know
too much about him, either.

07:39.020 --> 07:41.020
Since he was from the Sengoku Period.

07:41.310 --> 07:45.650
S-Sengoku? You mean he lived
more than 300 years ago?

07:45.650 --> 07:47.320
That's what I was told.

07:47.320 --> 07:51.190
It's never broken down
in all that time? That doll?

07:51.190 --> 07:55.280
The technology's so mind-blowing,
we can't catch up to it today.

07:56.830 --> 08:00.290
If it were to break down,
there'd be no fixing it.

08:01.540 --> 08:05.000
My father passed away suddenly,
and I have no brothers or sisters.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.590
I'm the one who's supposed to step up now,

08:07.590 --> 08:11.210
but since I'm no good with swords
or Mechanical Dolls...

08:12.220 --> 08:14.010
So, that's why you were so...

08:14.340 --> 08:16.220
Right, I get it.

08:18.220 --> 08:20.600
That guy's incredible.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.390
He's only around my age...

08:23.690 --> 08:26.230
but he's a Hashira, and he's so talented.

08:26.230 --> 08:28.360
Well, what did you expect?

08:28.360 --> 08:31.780
After all, he's a descendant
of the wielder of the Sun Breathing technique!

08:32.530 --> 08:34.530
That boy is a prodigy!

08:34.530 --> 08:37.240
He's in a different league
than the likes of you!

08:39.280 --> 08:41.370
Are you Tokito's crow?

08:41.370 --> 08:45.170
The First Breathing Style, Sun Breathing?

08:45.170 --> 08:47.580
So he's really that amazing.

08:50.250 --> 08:52.960
But that's not Sun Breathing
that he's using now, is it?

08:52.960 --> 08:53.970
Huh?

08:55.510 --> 08:58.470
You shut your mouth,
or I'll gouge out your eyes!

08:58.800 --> 09:00.560
Hey, I remember now!

09:00.560 --> 09:01.810
That dream!

09:01.810 --> 09:04.730
I saw that man in a dream!

09:04.730 --> 09:07.650
Huh? Are you an idiot or what?

09:07.650 --> 09:09.730
Have you been to this village before?

09:09.730 --> 09:12.230
That's so preposterous, you make me laugh!

09:12.480 --> 09:15.200
You mean you've met
a warrior from the Sengoku Period?

09:15.200 --> 09:17.990
How old are you, exactly? Huh!

09:19.160 --> 09:20.700
Listen, I'm sorry.

09:20.700 --> 09:22.870
There's something wrong with me, right?

09:22.870 --> 09:24.500
No, no!

09:25.040 --> 09:28.000
Maybe it's an inherited memory?

09:28.290 --> 09:30.960
People talk about it
all the time in our village.

09:30.960 --> 09:33.920
It isn't just your physical form
that gets passed on.

09:33.920 --> 09:36.800
Living creatures pass on their memories, too.

09:38.680 --> 09:42.760
What you saw in your dream
must've been your ancestor's memory!

09:42.760 --> 09:46.020
Preposterous! Preposterous!

09:47.020 --> 09:49.270
That's so kind of you! Thanks!

09:49.270 --> 09:50.270
Huh!

09:50.270 --> 09:51.520
I'm Tanjiro.

09:51.520 --> 09:52.900
What's your name?

09:53.230 --> 09:54.900
I'm Kotetsu.

09:54.900 --> 09:58.530
Don't pay any attention
to that mean female crow.

10:02.620 --> 10:03.830
Huh?

10:06.330 --> 10:08.410
Hey! His armor!

10:13.130 --> 10:14.000
Kotetsu!

10:14.000 --> 10:19.010
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
SWORDSMITH VILLAGE ARC

10:19.010 --> 10:24.010
DEMON SLAYER: KIMETSU NO YAIBA
SWORDSMITH VILLAGE ARC

10:24.350 --> 10:25.560
Kotetsu!

10:25.890 --> 10:27.180
Kotetsu!

10:27.520 --> 10:29.020
I'm going to find you!

10:29.020 --> 10:31.100
I've got a great sense of smell!

10:31.560 --> 10:34.150
Even if it's not in good shape right now.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.650
I think he went this way.

10:40.740 --> 10:41.990
Kotetsu!

10:42.320 --> 10:45.790
Could you have climbed any higher, Kotetsu?

10:46.790 --> 10:49.160
If there's anything I can do,
I'll help you out.

10:49.160 --> 10:51.250
You can't give up on your doll!

10:52.630 --> 10:54.710
You have a future ahead of you!

10:54.880 --> 10:56.130
Huh?

10:56.380 --> 10:59.300
You have to try hard now
for your future self...

10:59.300 --> 11:01.260
ten, twenty years from now!

11:01.260 --> 11:04.970
Someday, you'll be able to do
what you can't do now!

11:05.760 --> 11:07.180
No, I won't!

11:07.520 --> 11:10.770
I don't need anyone
to tell me that I'm a loser!

11:10.770 --> 11:15.400
It's all going to end with my generation!
All because of me!

11:15.400 --> 11:16.150
Huh?

11:16.480 --> 11:17.650
Huh?

11:17.900 --> 11:18.650
Ouch!

11:19.030 --> 11:21.650
You can't give up and stop caring.

11:21.650 --> 11:24.910
I wish you wouldn't talk
about yourself that way.

11:25.490 --> 11:29.160
He came without making a sound.
That's what a swordsman can do.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.210
Even if you can't do it yourself,

11:31.210 --> 11:34.210
there's always someone
who will carry on for you.

11:34.210 --> 11:37.090
You have to do what you can
so that it gets passed on.

11:37.420 --> 11:42.180
Even if it's beyond you, maybe your kids
or grandkids might find a way, right?

11:43.050 --> 11:46.850
I want to defeat Muzan Kibutsuji.

11:47.180 --> 11:50.810
I want to save my sister,
who's been turned into a demon.

11:51.270 --> 11:53.900
But I might die
before I can fulfill my goals.

11:54.980 --> 11:59.230
But I have faith that someone
will surely finish the job for me.

11:59.570 --> 12:04.200
Just like we were able to beat an Upper Rank
demon with the lives that were connected for us,

12:04.200 --> 12:06.200
someday, for sure,

12:06.200 --> 12:10.200
the lives we've connected
will bring down Kibutsuji!

12:13.250 --> 12:14.790
Let's do our best together!

12:19.210 --> 12:20.340
Okay.

12:20.340 --> 12:24.630
I didn't want to see the doll break down,
but my mind is made up now.

12:25.260 --> 12:28.300
The combat training
should last until nightfall,

12:28.300 --> 12:30.770
so I'm going to brace myself
and see it through.

12:30.770 --> 12:31.890
To the end.

12:34.690 --> 12:35.520
Really?

12:35.850 --> 12:37.690
So you're ten, Kotetsu?

12:37.690 --> 12:38.650
Yeah.

12:38.900 --> 12:40.730
My little brother is—

12:41.230 --> 12:42.320
- Huh?
- Huh?

12:43.240 --> 12:45.240
What? You're done?

12:46.410 --> 12:47.660
I'm done.

12:47.990 --> 12:50.120
That was a good training session.

12:50.990 --> 12:52.540
Who are you again?

12:52.870 --> 12:54.500
Oh, right.

12:54.750 --> 12:56.750
My sword snapped, so...

12:56.750 --> 12:57.500
- Huh?
- Huh?

12:57.880 --> 13:01.000
I'll be taking this one with me.

13:03.840 --> 13:04.840
Kotetsu—

13:04.840 --> 13:05.680
Ow!

13:05.970 --> 13:08.430
Dispose of that one for me.

13:10.260 --> 13:12.310
<i>Not a whiff of malice.</i>

13:12.640 --> 13:15.520
<i>He must not be doing that on purpose.</i>

13:15.980 --> 13:17.730
<i>But the thing is...</i>

13:19.520 --> 13:20.520
Humph!

13:21.070 --> 13:24.190
<i>That crow is just oozing spite.</i>

13:24.190 --> 13:26.990
<i>She's so condescending... toward me.</i>

13:28.280 --> 13:29.780
Kotetsu!

13:48.300 --> 13:49.260
Kotetsu...

13:49.720 --> 13:51.140
Let's make sure.

13:51.140 --> 13:53.220
See if it still works or not.

14:05.820 --> 14:07.530
Nothing.

14:07.530 --> 14:09.070
So it must be...

14:17.120 --> 14:19.870
All right! It's working, Kotetsu!

14:19.870 --> 14:21.000
That's great—

14:23.630 --> 14:26.630
Yes, it is, Tanjiro.

14:27.470 --> 14:29.010
I want you to train with this doll

14:29.010 --> 14:33.760
and become stronger than that
indifferent little jerk, no matter what!

14:33.760 --> 14:37.020
And you will have my full support!

14:38.810 --> 14:39.850
<i>Huh?</i>

14:39.850 --> 14:41.770
<i>Does he mean right now?</i>

14:56.580 --> 14:58.960
I'm gonna die! Six arms is too much!

14:58.960 --> 15:00.210
There are only five arms!

15:00.710 --> 15:04.630
Since that jerk broke one off,
it's less functional now!

15:06.670 --> 15:09.380
Tanjiro, please become stronger!

15:09.380 --> 15:11.840
And this is what
you're going to say to him...

15:11.840 --> 15:14.260
"Is that all you've got, you scumbag?"

15:14.260 --> 15:15.260
Huh?

15:15.560 --> 15:19.140
"Your hair's too long!
Get a haircut, seaweed head!"

15:19.140 --> 15:21.900
"Pissant! You're ugly,
and your legs are short!"

15:21.900 --> 15:23.020
"Commit harakiri!"

15:23.020 --> 15:25.110
"You shameless jerk!"

15:25.440 --> 15:26.110
No!

15:26.110 --> 15:27.360
Kotetsu!

15:27.360 --> 15:29.110
That's going a little too far!

15:29.110 --> 15:31.360
Better to put his head
on public display, you think?

15:31.360 --> 15:33.700
No! I can't say those kinds of things!

15:33.950 --> 15:34.950
You're going to say them!

15:34.950 --> 15:35.830
No!

15:35.830 --> 15:37.200
Please say them!

15:37.200 --> 15:38.830
Please!

15:44.130 --> 15:46.380
<i>Even without my saying so...</i>

15:46.380 --> 15:48.460
<i>Tokito was incredible!</i>

15:48.460 --> 15:51.880
<i>Despite being smaller and younger than me.</i>

15:52.470 --> 15:54.470
<i>I've got to train just as hard!</i>

15:54.470 --> 15:56.890
<i>I've got to become stronger, too!</i>

16:06.770 --> 16:08.110
Tanjiro!

16:08.110 --> 16:10.610
If that's enough to kill you,
you're pathetic!

16:10.610 --> 16:11.780
Keep working at it!

16:11.780 --> 16:14.530
I'm going to say it one more time!
Look at me!

16:17.200 --> 16:20.700
You're moving out of habit,
Tanjiro, all right?

16:22.250 --> 16:25.580
You're not deciding how to move
after observing your opponent's moves.

16:25.580 --> 16:27.090
That's why you're no good!

16:27.090 --> 16:28.290
Do you understand?

16:28.290 --> 16:30.000
In other words, you don't have the basics down!

16:30.000 --> 16:33.300
I'm really amazed you've managed to survive
this long in the Demon Slayer Corps!

16:33.300 --> 16:35.390
You're cutting it close
with everything you do!

16:35.390 --> 16:38.600
Well, I'm here to denounce your
every weak point backward and forward!

16:38.600 --> 16:42.770
I'm not giving you any food
until you can do everything I tell you to!

16:44.980 --> 16:46.150
Right.

16:49.770 --> 16:51.190
Tanjiro, you're too slow!

16:51.190 --> 16:52.690
Epic fail!

16:53.070 --> 16:56.030
If that doll wasn't armed
with practice sticks, you'd be dead!

16:56.030 --> 16:57.570
Get a hold of yourself!

16:57.990 --> 16:59.450
This is Day Five!

16:59.450 --> 17:02.660
Starting tomorrow,
I'm going to arm the doll with swords!

17:03.080 --> 17:05.750
No, even the practice sticks could kill me!

17:05.750 --> 17:08.210
I'm going to die!

17:09.670 --> 17:12.090
No food for you today, either!

17:12.090 --> 17:13.670
<i>Ah!</i>

17:13.670 --> 17:16.340
<i>The highly analytical Kotetsu!</i>

17:16.340 --> 17:20.390
<i>But as a swordsmanship instructor,
he was a total amateur.</i>

17:20.390 --> 17:24.230
<i>Since he had no idea about the limits
of a human life,</i>

17:24.230 --> 17:26.390
<i>his training sessions were brutal!</i>

17:26.390 --> 17:27.850
<i>So tyrannical...</i>

17:28.440 --> 17:31.610
<i>he'd withhold food and water from you
if you failed to meet his demands!</i>

17:31.900 --> 17:36.070
<i>After three days or so without water,
a human will seriously die.</i>

17:39.620 --> 17:43.120
<i>Pure tyranny born out of ignorance!</i>

17:44.750 --> 17:48.080
<i>Though I was able to survive,
thanks to some rainfall.</i>

17:50.210 --> 17:52.960
<i>All through these ghastly training sessions...</i>

17:52.960 --> 17:54.550
<i>I went without water...</i>

17:54.550 --> 17:55.800
<i>without food...</i>

17:55.800 --> 17:56.930
<i>without sleep.</i>

18:02.010 --> 18:05.480
<i>I started to cross the River to the Afterlife.</i>

18:06.560 --> 18:10.900
<i>I was walking across a bridge,
feeling indescribably blissful...</i>

18:11.190 --> 18:13.270
<i>only to get dizzy from hunger...</i>

18:13.690 --> 18:15.400
<i>and fall into the river.</i>

18:16.240 --> 18:18.150
<i>It was dark in the water...</i>

18:18.660 --> 18:20.240
<i>and heavy...</i>

18:20.740 --> 18:22.410
<i>but then it felt as though...</i>

18:23.330 --> 18:26.750
<i>I were being massaged
by some warm hands.</i>

18:27.370 --> 18:30.920
<i>I saw something shiny
when I glanced toward the bottom of the river...</i>

18:30.920 --> 18:33.670
<i>so I went to get it,
all while being massaged.</i>

18:35.510 --> 18:36.670
<i>Strangely enough...</i>

18:36.970 --> 18:40.680
<i>I could smell this shimmering stone
even underwater.</i>

18:45.220 --> 18:46.310
<i>What is this?</i>

18:46.310 --> 18:47.560
<i>This smell?</i>

18:48.140 --> 18:50.650
<i>It smells different than the Opening Thread.</i>

18:53.150 --> 18:54.360
<i>Left side of the head!</i>

18:54.900 --> 18:55.780
<i>Neck!</i>

18:56.190 --> 18:57.150
<i>Right side of the chest!</i>

18:57.570 --> 18:58.740
<i>Left side!</i>

18:59.280 --> 19:00.530
<i>Right thigh!</i>

19:00.530 --> 19:02.070
<i>Right shoulder!</i>

19:02.660 --> 19:03.830
<i>Here it comes!</i>

19:12.210 --> 19:14.710
You got one strike in, Tanjiro!

19:14.710 --> 19:17.920
Though it was so feeble,
the doll didn't even flinch!

19:18.210 --> 19:19.670
I'm going to give you some food!

19:21.430 --> 19:23.050
Rice balls and pickled plums!

19:23.050 --> 19:25.680
And I want high-quality gyokuro tea!

19:30.020 --> 19:34.190
Tasty!

19:37.230 --> 19:39.110
<i>All right! All right!</i>

19:39.110 --> 19:40.400
<i>I see how he's going to move!</i>

19:41.110 --> 19:42.990
<i>I can see it way better than before!</i>

19:43.240 --> 19:45.530
<i>I can keep up
now that I have my stamina back!</i>

19:48.500 --> 19:52.170
<i>Now, I can tell by the scent
where he's going to strike!</i>

19:56.590 --> 19:57.670
<i>I can pick up this scent...</i>

19:58.090 --> 20:00.760
<i>sooner than I can see
the Opening Thread!</i>

20:05.680 --> 20:07.180
<i>All right! I'm going for it!</i>

20:07.600 --> 20:09.680
<i>One strike with all my might!</i>

20:10.230 --> 20:11.180
<i>Hey...</i>

20:11.180 --> 20:13.060
<i>But what if it breaks?</i>

20:15.690 --> 20:17.320
Strike!

20:17.730 --> 20:19.110
I don't care if it breaks!

20:19.650 --> 20:22.320
I'll fix it, no matter what!

20:25.110 --> 20:27.660
<i>Tanjiro, you're too nice!</i>

20:28.200 --> 20:30.410
<i>You can't hesitate now!</i>

20:31.290 --> 20:34.370
<i>But that's who you are, Tanjiro...</i>

20:34.370 --> 20:35.920
<i>and I don't want you to die!</i>

20:37.000 --> 20:37.920
<i>I want you...</i>

20:37.920 --> 20:39.920
<i>to become stronger than anyone else!</i>

20:45.010 --> 20:46.140
Ouch!

20:46.720 --> 20:49.140
Tanjiro! Are you okay?

20:49.350 --> 20:50.470
Ow, ow, ow...

20:50.470 --> 20:54.640
S-Sorry... I broke the sword you lent me.

20:54.640 --> 20:56.650
Don't worry about that! It's okay!

20:59.900 --> 21:00.570
Huh?

21:00.570 --> 21:01.480
Hey!

21:05.280 --> 21:06.410
Something came out!

21:06.410 --> 21:09.330
K-Kotetsu! Something came out!
What is that thing?

21:09.330 --> 21:12.000
Hey, hey! I have no idea, either!

21:20.090 --> 21:22.130
What could that be?

21:22.130 --> 21:23.010
At the very least...

21:23.420 --> 21:26.840
it's a sword from over 300 years ago, right?

23:02.900 --> 23:04.980
You look great in that, Nezuko!

23:08.150 --> 23:09.700
You like it, huh?

23:11.160 --> 23:13.950
Now, it's time for a Taisho-era secret!

23:13.950 --> 23:16.160
The swordsmith apprentice, Kotetsu...

23:16.160 --> 23:19.620
His actual face
is such a dead ringer for his mask

23:19.620 --> 23:24.590
that it's been suggested
that he might not need to wear a mask at all.

23:24.880 --> 23:26.590
He's mercilessly blunt,

23:26.590 --> 23:30.090
but I think he may be a sweet kid at heart!

23:31.380 --> 23:35.100
Next, Episode 3,
"A Sword from Over 300 Years Ago."

23:35.470 --> 23:36.600
I'm hot!

23:36.600 --> 23:38.770
Tanjiro! Where are you?

23:38.770 --> 23:39.480
Huh?

23:39.850 --> 23:41.770
We're going to start training now!

23:41.770 --> 23:45.110
If you slack off after one good day,
you'll end up right back where you started!

23:45.110 --> 23:46.570
"Persistence prevails when all else fails!"

23:46.570 --> 23:49.820
"The Grasshopper and the Ant!"
"Slow and steady wins the race!"

23:49.820 --> 23:51.950
Tanjiro! Where are you?

23:52.240 --> 23:52.490
Nezuko, let's get out of here!

23:52.490 --> 23:54.070
Tanjiro! Where are you?
Nezuko, let's get out of here!

23:54.070 --> 23:54.820
Tanjiro! Where are you?
