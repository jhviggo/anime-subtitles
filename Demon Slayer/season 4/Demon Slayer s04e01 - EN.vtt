WEBVTT

00:24.310 --> 00:26.230
What is this place?

00:26.230 --> 00:33.070
It seems this castle fell into disrepair during
the revolution, abandoned and forgotten

00:33.070 --> 00:34.990
because it's in a remote location.

00:34.990 --> 00:40.950
I don't like when
those demons act like a lord.

00:41.740 --> 00:46.750
Are you sure that the villagers
were taken there?

00:46.750 --> 00:47.750
Yes.

00:47.750 --> 00:53.420
We even tracked them into the keep
last night, but we found nothing.

00:53.420 --> 00:56.550
They can't just disappear, you idiot.

00:56.550 --> 00:58.430
You're so easily fooled.

00:58.430 --> 01:00.090
My apologies.

01:00.090 --> 01:04.970
And today,
another woman disappeared.

01:04.970 --> 01:09.020
While we were on the lookout,
they took them right under our noses.

01:09.020 --> 01:12.360
I don't expect anything from you guys.

01:13.320 --> 01:17.900
Apparently, we're not too late.

01:17.900 --> 01:19.280
That bastard!

01:37.910 --> 01:41.630
I should have killed them last night.

02:39.730 --> 02:41.070
Got you!

02:47.780 --> 02:50.000
You guys, get back.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
The Wind Hashira and I
will take it from here.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.080
But...

02:54.080 --> 02:56.340
You guys are in our way.

02:56.340 --> 02:58.000
Just get the hell out of here.

03:01.340 --> 03:05.470
Shinazugawa,
something strange's going on here.

03:05.470 --> 03:08.560
Yeah, I don't like it.

03:08.560 --> 03:12.600
I've never seen so many demons
swarming in one place.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.190
Help me!

03:19.570 --> 03:22.820
Wind Breathing, Second Form:

03:28.200 --> 03:30.540
Claws-Purifying Wind!

03:35.920 --> 03:39.040
Serpent Breathing, Fifth Form:

03:47.220 --> 03:49.680
Slithering Serpent.

03:50.260 --> 03:51.640
That was close.

03:51.640 --> 03:53.520
I didn't ask for your help!

03:55.350 --> 03:59.480
This strength...
They're not ordinary demon hunters.

03:59.480 --> 04:00.440
They're Hashiras!

04:00.440 --> 04:02.190
Help me!

04:02.190 --> 04:03.360
Hey, demon!

04:03.360 --> 04:06.450
Leave that woman and your head here!

04:09.870 --> 04:12.580
They just keep appearing
one after another.

04:12.580 --> 04:14.960
Are you demons or cockroaches?

04:29.470 --> 04:31.350
There are still more?

04:34.430 --> 04:37.640
Where the hell are those demons
coming from?

04:37.640 --> 04:41.020
Save the woman, Shinazugawa.

04:41.020 --> 04:43.150
I got your six.

04:44.990 --> 04:47.360
Well, I'm getting bored, too.

04:47.360 --> 04:49.450
I let you take care of them.

04:52.870 --> 04:55.910
Serpent Breathing, Third Form:

05:02.590 --> 05:04.250
Coil Choke.

05:12.050 --> 05:15.930
Listen, you can't win even if
you gather small fries.

05:15.930 --> 05:18.640
Just give up and die.

05:30.560 --> 05:32.700
Wind Breathing,

05:32.700 --> 05:34.200
Fourth Form:

05:37.370 --> 05:40.040
Rising Dust Storm.

05:41.460 --> 05:43.000
Good grief.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.550
If you want her so badly...

05:45.550 --> 05:47.420
No! What are you going to do?

05:47.420 --> 05:48.670
Catch her!

06:04.690 --> 06:06.530
What?

06:26.750 --> 06:29.210
Stay there, shithead!

06:42.440 --> 06:44.480
What the heck is going on?

06:45.110 --> 06:49.360
Hey, Shinazugawa. What was that?

06:49.860 --> 06:52.610
Where have the demons gone?

06:54.450 --> 06:56.370
How the hell do I know?

07:14.680 --> 07:17.890
You sure you want to get off
at the end of this road?

07:47.710 --> 07:49.000
Miss Kanao!

07:49.000 --> 07:51.670
Good work on completing your mission!

07:51.670 --> 07:53.550
Good work!

08:11.860 --> 08:14.860
Master, I have just returned.

08:16.660 --> 08:21.660
That matter of the Swordsmith Village
was just like I told you the other day.

08:21.660 --> 08:31.450
Tokito, Kanroji, Kamado, and the others
have defeated two Upper Ranks.

08:31.450 --> 08:36.330
Moreover, Nezuko has overcome the sun.

08:36.330 --> 08:41.220
Hence, there will be
major developments to come.

08:41.640 --> 08:42.600
Yes.

08:43.220 --> 08:49.560
Probably, Muzan Kibutsuji will use
his demons to take Nezuko away.

08:51.020 --> 08:55.490
In order to own a demon that
overcomes the sun.

09:01.120 --> 09:08.210
I will attend an urgent Hashira meeting
at the Ubuyashiki residence.

09:08.920 --> 09:14.380
In the meantime,
can I ask you to protect Nezuko?

09:18.260 --> 09:20.220
It's a request.

09:22.260 --> 09:29.140
(Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba
Hashira Training Arc)

09:32.610 --> 09:36.150
I see. They're moving their base.

09:36.150 --> 09:38.650
Are the villagers all right?

09:38.990 --> 09:41.070
I don't know that much
about the details.

09:41.070 --> 09:43.780
The demons might attack at night,

09:43.780 --> 09:46.750
so they're desperately
rebuilding and relocating.

09:46.750 --> 09:48.160
Is that so?

09:48.160 --> 09:52.380
It's miraculous how that was all it took
even though two Upper Ranks attacked.

09:53.880 --> 09:56.840
The enemies were really strong.

10:03.390 --> 10:07.930
The Corps created several "empty villages"
for such occasions.

10:07.930 --> 10:10.440
So we're able to move quickly
if something happens.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.150
I see.

10:12.150 --> 10:16.480
Well, that's because the Master and
his family's predictions are incredible.

10:16.480 --> 10:19.530
Anyway, you've been unconscious
for a week.

10:19.530 --> 10:21.240
Is it okay to eat that much?

10:21.240 --> 10:25.070
Yes! Kanroji said she also eats a lot.

10:25.700 --> 10:29.120
Nah, she seems a bit beyond reason.

10:30.580 --> 10:32.250
Delicious!

10:32.580 --> 10:33.960
Is it true that Love and Mist

10:33.960 --> 10:37.210
slept for two days and were almost
fully recovered by the third day?

10:37.210 --> 10:39.130
It's true! I respect them!

10:39.130 --> 10:41.510
You're getting closer to them, you know?

10:41.510 --> 10:42.880
A bit by bit.

10:43.550 --> 10:46.930
Well, it's fine if you get better soon.

10:46.930 --> 10:48.140
Yes?

10:48.140 --> 10:50.140
I'm glad everyone is alive.

10:50.140 --> 10:51.140
Yes!

10:51.140 --> 10:54.020
Oh, this is what I wanted to ask the most.

10:54.020 --> 10:56.560
I heard your sister has become
something incredible.

10:56.560 --> 10:58.150
Is she all right?

10:58.150 --> 10:59.900
Yes, she is.

11:00.360 --> 11:04.070
She's starting to toddle under the sun.

11:05.870 --> 11:07.160
Isn't that bad?

11:07.160 --> 11:09.620
Seriously, isn't that dangerous?

11:09.620 --> 11:13.870
She's being examined,
but we still don't know anything.

11:13.870 --> 11:18.340
We don't know if she returning back
into a human or evolving as a demon.

11:18.960 --> 11:21.340
Is Lady Kocho looking into it?

11:21.340 --> 11:23.050
Not her, but Lady Tamayo.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.880
Who's Lady Tamayo?

11:27.140 --> 11:29.810
Hey, see? You ate too much!

11:29.810 --> 11:32.270
You should know that
you're still recovering.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.980
That was close.

11:36.190 --> 11:40.780
Your sister has become like that
and things are going to start happening.

11:40.780 --> 11:43.950
Every Corps member has been given
an order to be on alert.

11:43.950 --> 11:47.200
And we're told
the Hashiras are gathering.

11:47.200 --> 11:49.990
What happens from now on, really?

12:06.010 --> 12:08.260
We're the last ones, huh?

12:08.260 --> 12:11.680
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

12:12.140 --> 12:12.390
(Gyomei Himejima, the Stone Hashira)

12:12.390 --> 12:16.810
No problem.
Well done on your mission.
(Gyomei Himejima, the Stone Hashira)

12:16.810 --> 12:16.850
(Gyomei Himejima, the Stone Hashira)

12:17.150 --> 12:18.560
It's nothing.

12:19.940 --> 12:19.980
I heard Kanroji and Tokito
had a fight against the Upper Ranks.

12:19.980 --> 12:24.690
(Sanemi Shinazugawa, the Wind Hashira)
I heard Kanroji and Tokito
had a fight against the Upper Ranks.

12:24.690 --> 12:24.740
Yup. They were strong.
(Sanemi Shinazugawa, the Wind Hashira)

12:24.740 --> 12:26.650
(Mitsuri Kanroji, the Love Hashira)
Yup. They were strong.

12:26.650 --> 12:30.910
I felt like I couldn't do it anymore,
but we all pulled together.
(Mitsuri Kanroji, the Love Hashira)

12:30.910 --> 12:31.200
I felt like I couldn't do it anymore,
but we all pulled together.

12:31.200 --> 12:33.040
Right, Muichiro?

12:33.240 --> 12:33.870
(Muichiro Tokito, the Mist Hashira)

12:33.870 --> 12:35.000
Yeah.
(Muichiro Tokito, the Mist Hashira)

12:35.000 --> 12:36.580
(Muichiro Tokito, the Mist Hashira)

12:37.790 --> 12:39.880
That makes me jealous.

12:39.880 --> 12:43.920
Why haven't I ever encountered
any Upper Rank?

12:44.340 --> 12:44.380
It's like, almost everyone
is running into them.

12:44.380 --> 12:48.970
(Obanai Iguro, the Serpent Hashira)
It's like, almost everyone
is running into them.

12:48.970 --> 12:50.550
Kanroji and Tokito,
how are you afterwards?
(Obanai Iguro, the Serpent Hashira)

12:50.550 --> 12:53.560
Kanroji and Tokito,
how are you afterwards?

12:53.560 --> 12:57.690
Oh! Thanks for asking.
I'm much better now.

12:57.690 --> 13:00.440
Oh, my! He's worried about me!

13:00.440 --> 13:04.650
I'm fine too, although I'm still
not in my best form.

13:04.650 --> 13:09.320
If we lose any more Hashira,
the Corps will be in danger.

13:09.320 --> 13:13.910
Defeating two Upper Ranks without
dying is a tremendous feat.

13:13.910 --> 13:14.370
You two healed unusually fast this time.

13:14.370 --> 13:18.870
(Shinobu Kocho, the Insect Hashira)
You two healed unusually fast this time.

13:18.870 --> 13:21.040
What happened?
(Shinobu Kocho, the Insect Hashira)

13:21.040 --> 13:21.080
I believe the Master will talk
about that matter too.
(Shinobu Kocho, the Insect Hashira)

13:21.080 --> 13:21.460
I believe the Master will talk
about that matter too.

13:21.460 --> 13:25.590
(Giyu Tomioka, the Water Hashira)
I believe the Master will talk
about that matter too.

13:25.590 --> 13:26.460
(Giyu Tomioka, the Water Hashira)

13:31.050 --> 13:33.930
Thank you for waiting so long.

13:33.930 --> 13:36.270
At today's Hashira meeting,

13:36.270 --> 13:42.190
I, Amane Ubuyashiki,
will represent Kagaya Ubuyashiki.

13:42.610 --> 13:47.320
I would also like to apologize
sincerely for the fact that

13:47.320 --> 13:51.360
Master Kagaya is no longer able to
appear before you in the future

13:51.360 --> 13:54.450
due to his declining health.

14:09.880 --> 14:11.510
Understood.

14:11.510 --> 14:19.430
I pray that his flame of life continues
to burn even one day longer.

14:19.430 --> 14:23.100
I also pray that your spirit
remains strong.

14:25.690 --> 14:30.360
My sincere gratitude to all the Hashiras.

14:31.820 --> 14:34.700
As you may have already heard,

14:34.700 --> 14:38.450
now that a demon who can
withstand the sunlight appears,

14:38.450 --> 14:43.500
Muzan Kibutsuji will change
his aim and come for her.

14:43.500 --> 14:47.000
So that he can overcome the sun too.

14:47.380 --> 14:50.840
A large-scale war is near.

14:50.840 --> 14:57.810
During the fight against Upper Rank
Four and Five, Kanroji and Tokito...

14:59.020 --> 15:05.520
I have received reports that you two
manifested a unique pattern of marks.

15:05.520 --> 15:11.530
I would like you both to tell us about
what conditions caused marks to appear.

15:12.740 --> 15:13.820
Marks?

15:15.450 --> 15:17.620
During the Sengoku period,

15:17.620 --> 15:24.460
there were swordsmen of the First Breathing
who almost defeated Muzan Kibutsuji.

15:25.290 --> 15:31.800
All of them manifested marks
similar to a demon crest.

15:33.800 --> 15:38.180
You may have heard such tales,
but the tales are true.

15:38.550 --> 15:40.720
This is the first I've heard of it.

15:40.720 --> 15:43.430
Why was it kept in the dark?

15:43.850 --> 15:50.150
Many people have tormented themselves
over the marks that did not manifest.

15:50.150 --> 15:51.440
That's why.

15:52.280 --> 15:56.610
There are lack of clarity regarding
the legend of the marks.

15:57.450 --> 16:01.450
It could be because it was not
considered important at the time.

16:01.450 --> 16:05.580
Or perhaps, because the Demon Slayer Corps
has been nearly destroyed many times,

16:05.580 --> 16:09.960
the information was not passed down.

16:09.960 --> 16:15.510
Only one thing was left
written down clearly.

16:15.840 --> 16:18.390
"When the marked one appears,

16:18.390 --> 16:23.220
the mark will appear on others around
as well as if in resonance."

16:29.770 --> 16:35.950
That was written down in the journal of
the swordsman of the First Breathing.

16:36.780 --> 16:41.700
The first person in this generation
who did manifest the mark

16:42.160 --> 16:45.450
was not a Hashira.

16:45.960 --> 16:48.330
It was Tanjiro Kamado.

16:48.330 --> 16:51.090
He was the first marked one.

16:51.880 --> 16:52.420
It was like, gwaaah! And then, gaaah!

16:52.420 --> 16:55.800
However, he did not seem to know
how the mark manifested,
It was like, gwaaah! And then, gaaah!

16:55.800 --> 16:58.300
My stomach was like, groooar!
Like that!
However, he did not seem to know
how the mark manifested,

16:58.300 --> 17:00.850
so we put it aside for the time being.
My stomach was like, groooar!
Like that!

17:00.850 --> 17:06.010
And this time, following him,
two Hashiras have had this awakening.

17:07.440 --> 17:11.720
Please teach us how to manifest it,
Kanroji and Tokito.

17:14.470 --> 17:16.070
Oh! Sure!

17:16.070 --> 17:18.150
Lady Amane is so admirable.

17:21.370 --> 17:25.160
Uh, well, so, at that time was...

17:25.160 --> 17:30.170
If I remember,
my body became very light.

17:31.420 --> 17:38.550
Um... Um... And then... It was...

17:41.050 --> 17:43.800
It was like, gwaaah!

17:43.800 --> 17:47.390
And whooom! Then, gaaah!

17:47.390 --> 17:50.140
My heart was ba-dump ba-dump nonstop!

17:50.140 --> 17:52.650
My ears rang so loud!

17:52.650 --> 17:55.270
Crack-crack-crack, like that!

18:06.950 --> 18:09.000
My deepest apologies.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.710
I would get into a hole if there was one.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.340
(Share the same brain cell with Tanjiro)

18:16.420 --> 18:18.340
Okay, it's my turn.

18:20.510 --> 18:24.140
I wasn't aware of any mark
was manifested on me.

18:24.140 --> 18:27.520
But when I think back to that battle,

18:27.520 --> 18:33.150
there are a few unusual things
that come to mind.

18:33.150 --> 18:38.320
If the conditions are met, probably
everyone could manifest the mark.

18:39.360 --> 18:42.570
Now I'm going to tell you
how I've done it.

18:54.420 --> 18:59.960
In that battle, I was poisoned
and couldn't move.

18:59.960 --> 19:02.590
When I tried to slow down
my blood circulation

19:02.590 --> 19:06.140
and the spread of the poison by
using the breathing technique,

19:06.600 --> 19:09.890
I saw the boy who wanted to
save me was nearly killed,

19:10.470 --> 19:12.560
my lost memories returned,

19:13.020 --> 19:17.940
and then I couldn't control my emotions
because I was so angry.

19:17.940 --> 19:22.820
I think my heart rate was
over two hundred per minute.

19:24.450 --> 19:27.580
Even more, my body was burning hot.

19:27.580 --> 19:32.580
My temperature must have reached
over thirty-nine degrees Celsius.

19:33.370 --> 19:37.750
How could you move in such a state?
It could be life-threatening.

19:37.750 --> 19:39.630
You're right.

19:39.630 --> 19:44.010
That's why, it was like being sifted.

19:44.630 --> 19:49.430
I think the difference between those who
manifest the mark and those who don't

19:49.430 --> 19:52.140
is whether you die or not.

19:55.520 --> 19:58.860
A heart rate over
two hundred per minute...

19:58.860 --> 20:02.900
How can you be sure your temperature
was thirty-nine degrees?

20:02.900 --> 20:09.870
Well, I had a fever when
I was being treated at Kocho's place.

20:09.870 --> 20:14.790
The thermometer showed my body
temperature was thirty-nine degrees.

20:14.790 --> 20:19.790
I felt it was the same heat
when the mark manifested.

20:22.340 --> 20:23.760
I didn't realize.

20:25.300 --> 20:28.340
So, it's really that simple.

20:28.340 --> 20:33.350
I envy you for being a simpleton
to call that is simple.

20:34.020 --> 20:35.980
What did you say?

20:35.980 --> 20:37.140
Nothing.

20:40.940 --> 20:45.280
That means we Hashiras
must manifest the mark.

20:45.860 --> 20:47.070
Agreed.

20:47.070 --> 20:49.570
We will do something about it.

20:49.570 --> 20:54.410
Please tell the Master to rest assured.

20:54.410 --> 20:56.620
Thank you.

20:56.620 --> 21:00.170
There is one thing I must tell you

21:00.170 --> 21:03.710
regarding the training to
manifest the mark.

21:03.710 --> 21:05.920
What is it?

21:06.340 --> 21:11.930
Those who have manifested the mark
will have no choice anymore.

21:12.680 --> 21:17.810
Because they, without exception, will—

21:38.960 --> 21:40.170
I understand now.

21:40.670 --> 21:44.710
But in that case,
what would happen to me?

21:44.710 --> 21:46.420
Good Lord.

21:46.760 --> 21:50.180
Since Lady Amane has left,
I have nothing to do here.

21:50.180 --> 21:53.470
Hey, hold on! Don't just leave!

21:53.470 --> 21:58.060
We have to decide what
each of us going to do.

21:58.430 --> 22:00.690
The six of you can talk yourselves.

22:00.690 --> 22:02.730
It has nothing to do with me.

22:02.730 --> 22:05.820
What do you mean by that?

22:05.820 --> 22:09.280
You're not aware enough
that you're a Hashira.

22:09.280 --> 22:14.450
Or what? So you can start
your training as soon as possible?

22:14.450 --> 22:16.870
You want to skip the meeting?

22:20.540 --> 22:22.630
Wait, you bastard!

22:22.630 --> 22:26.500
Explain yourself, Tomioka.

22:26.500 --> 22:29.380
You didn't explain enough.

22:32.380 --> 22:34.760
I'm different from you all.

22:35.390 --> 22:37.520
I don't like it.

22:37.520 --> 22:40.980
You said the same thing before,
Tomioka.

22:40.980 --> 22:43.650
Are you looking down on us?

22:43.650 --> 22:47.400
Please, don't fight! Stay calm, okay?

22:49.570 --> 22:51.070
Come back here!

22:52.110 --> 22:55.620
Ah! No, no! Please, don't!

23:02.370 --> 23:03.830
Sit down.

23:05.250 --> 23:07.460
Let's continue our discussion.

23:07.460 --> 23:09.710
I have a proposal.

23:11.510 --> 23:12.590
Here ya go.

23:12.590 --> 23:15.590
Wow! Thank you very much!

23:15.970 --> 23:18.470
You really eat a lot.

23:19.060 --> 23:22.480
Anyway, where are those three girls
and your sister?

23:22.480 --> 23:24.560
I don't see Aoi either.

23:24.560 --> 23:30.440
There's no member in critical condition,
so they've been playing with Nezuko.

23:30.440 --> 23:33.860
Thanks to them,
she's learning to speak bit by bit.

23:33.860 --> 23:36.160
Oh, I see.

23:36.160 --> 23:38.200
How peaceful.

23:38.200 --> 23:40.410
These dangos are delicious.

23:40.410 --> 23:42.790
Yeah, yeah, I know.

23:42.790 --> 23:48.040
But wouldn't it be a problem
if that Yellow-Head showed up?

23:54.800 --> 23:59.350
Oh, Zenitsu.
Are you done with your mission?

23:59.350 --> 24:01.470
I'm back, Kiyo.

24:01.470 --> 24:06.060
Everyone, Zenitsu is back!

24:09.860 --> 24:13.030
Good work on completing
your mission, Zenitsu.

24:13.030 --> 24:14.900
Good work!

24:14.900 --> 24:20.200
Kiyo, Naho, and Sumi.
You three gathered to welcome me?

24:20.870 --> 24:22.700
This time was really tough too.

24:22.700 --> 24:25.750
I thought, "I was gonna die!"
over and over.

24:25.750 --> 24:30.920
But everyone would be sad if I died,
so I did my best!

24:30.920 --> 24:33.420
I knew it, you'd be lonely
without me, right?

24:33.420 --> 24:34.920
No, we wouldn't.

24:34.920 --> 24:36.220
What?!

24:36.550 --> 24:40.220
But I'm glad you made it back alive.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.260
Uh, thanks.

24:46.640 --> 24:50.060
Oh, Zenitsu. You have returned.

24:50.060 --> 24:51.980
Good work.

24:51.980 --> 24:53.570
Aoi!

24:53.570 --> 24:58.530
Aoi, you must have missed me.
Right? I bet you've been lonely.

24:58.910 --> 25:01.450
Not really.

25:10.920 --> 25:12.880
Wel... Welcome back.

25:18.800 --> 25:20.140
So loud!

25:20.590 --> 25:22.350
Wel... Welcome back.

25:22.350 --> 25:24.350
She's so cute I could die!

25:24.350 --> 25:25.850
Sure, feel free to die!

25:26.850 --> 25:29.440
What happened, Nezuko?
You're talking!

25:29.440 --> 25:32.270
For me? Must be for me, right?
You did great just for me.

25:32.270 --> 25:34.570
I'm very happy!

25:34.570 --> 25:36.030
Please go somewhere else!

25:36.030 --> 25:39.110
Finally, we can get married!

25:39.110 --> 25:40.860
Get away from her!

25:40.860 --> 25:43.370
You looked so lovely
under the moonlight,

25:43.370 --> 25:45.620
but you're also irresistible
in the sunlight!

25:45.620 --> 25:46.790
You're wonderful!

25:46.790 --> 25:49.620
If you marry me, I'll feed you
sushi and eel every day!

25:49.620 --> 25:52.630
You can rest assured
and let's make a family!

25:53.170 --> 25:55.750
Welcome back, Inosuke.

25:59.630 --> 26:02.220
I... nosuke?

26:02.220 --> 26:05.350
Inosuke, welcome back.

26:06.970 --> 26:10.560
Where is he?
I'm gonna go and kill him.

26:10.560 --> 26:12.900
Don't say violent things!

26:12.900 --> 26:15.900
And where that Boar-Head?

26:15.900 --> 26:17.570
If you're looking for Inosuke...

26:17.570 --> 26:20.320
Huh? He was there this morning?

26:20.320 --> 26:24.950
Your sister was being taught nonstop
by that Boar-Head, you know?

26:24.950 --> 26:26.410
Being taught what?

26:26.410 --> 26:27.910
Well, about that...

26:27.910 --> 26:30.910
Inosuke! Inosuke! Inosuke! Inosuke!

26:30.910 --> 26:33.040
Imosuke. Imofuke.

26:33.040 --> 26:34.250
Boss Inosuke!

26:34.250 --> 26:35.750
Bush Imosuke.

26:35.750 --> 26:38.300
Inosuke! Inosuke! Inosuke! Inosuke!

26:38.300 --> 26:41.590
He had been trying to get her
to remember his name.

26:41.590 --> 26:44.510
Oh, I didn't know that happened.

26:44.510 --> 26:47.970
By the way, do you have
any more of these dangos?

26:47.970 --> 26:49.810
You still want more?!

27:00.150 --> 27:02.110
Haganezuka!

27:03.110 --> 27:05.120
Are your injuries okay now?

27:06.240 --> 27:07.490
I'm glad.

27:12.960 --> 27:15.290
You don't look okay!

27:17.170 --> 27:21.170
Oh, my sword. Thank you.

27:23.380 --> 27:25.640
It's Rengoku's sword guard!

27:26.760 --> 27:30.850
Thank you for protecting Kotetsu.

27:31.770 --> 27:33.890
Please have a seat.

27:33.890 --> 27:35.270
Are you all right?

27:40.900 --> 27:42.990
Blah... Bl... Bla...

27:42.990 --> 27:46.160
Do you mean the blade?
Okay, I'll look at it.

27:56.830 --> 27:58.000
Amazing.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.630
The depth of the black color
is different.

28:01.260 --> 28:03.420
The steel is of good quality.

28:03.420 --> 28:07.390
Its previous owner must have been
a very strong swordsman.

28:09.010 --> 28:10.640
The "slay" letter?

28:11.810 --> 28:17.770
The swordsmith who forged it had one goal,
it's a sword to slay all demons.

28:17.770 --> 28:23.490
He didn't engrave his name or anything
but just a single letter.

28:23.490 --> 28:27.200
The ranking system began
after this sword was made,

28:27.200 --> 28:32.160
and only the Hashiras' swords were
engraved with "Slay the Devils".

28:32.160 --> 28:35.250
Is that so?
What an incredible sword.

28:35.250 --> 28:40.540
But wait, I think there wasn't any letter
when I used this in the last battle.

28:42.300 --> 28:46.720
That's because I had only
sharpened it up to the first stage.

28:46.720 --> 28:49.850
And you guys took it from me.

28:49.850 --> 28:52.890
I hadn't cleaned the rust off.

28:52.890 --> 28:54.390
Do you want me to kill you?

28:54.390 --> 28:55.600
I'm sorry!

28:55.600 --> 29:00.020
Even now! I'm still crying because
the pain of my wounds hasn't gone!

29:00.020 --> 29:02.190
It's so hurt it's unbearable!

29:02.190 --> 29:04.610
Thanks to the interruption
while I was sharpening it!

29:04.610 --> 29:07.570
I had to start sharpening all over again!

29:08.990 --> 29:12.410
If we're talking about wounds,
his wounds were more serious.

29:12.410 --> 29:15.370
The bones all through his body
are broken.

29:19.880 --> 29:21.750
I'll kill you!

29:21.750 --> 29:23.210
You didn't hear me?

29:23.210 --> 29:24.880
Listen, Tanjiro!

29:24.880 --> 29:28.550
You will bring me mitarashi dango
until you die!

29:28.550 --> 29:30.840
You understand?! Got it?!

29:30.840 --> 29:33.220
Yes, I will.

29:33.600 --> 29:36.730
Thank you very much and get well soon.

29:37.520 --> 29:40.810
I've heard rumors about him,
but he's truly something.

29:42.150 --> 29:44.940
Actually, he was calmer than usual.

29:44.940 --> 29:46.820
He must really be in pain.

29:46.820 --> 29:48.150
Seriously?

29:48.150 --> 29:50.320
Can you be quieter, man?

29:50.320 --> 29:53.030
Oh, sorry, Genya.

29:53.030 --> 29:54.740
We're done.

29:54.740 --> 29:56.200
Sorry for being so loud—

30:05.380 --> 30:08.970
Inosuke! What are you doing?!
You broke the window!

30:10.130 --> 30:13.550
You fool!
You're gonna get killed by Lady Kocho!

30:15.310 --> 30:16.430
Be quiet!

30:16.430 --> 30:18.480
Boar Rush!

30:19.640 --> 30:22.440
I want a separate room.

30:22.440 --> 30:24.730
Strength! Strength! More strength!

30:24.730 --> 30:27.780
The joint strengthening drill
is about to begin!

30:28.110 --> 30:29.780
Joint strengthening?

30:30.110 --> 30:33.200
The strong guys are gathering
and giving lessons...

30:33.200 --> 30:35.370
Or something like that.

30:35.370 --> 30:37.410
Huh? What's that about?

30:37.410 --> 30:39.330
Dunno!

30:39.330 --> 30:40.830
I see.

30:45.040 --> 30:52.430
I think we've pretty much worked out
our training plan for the Corps members.

30:52.430 --> 30:56.350
Now left are the date and how long.

30:56.350 --> 30:58.930
Let's start in three days.

30:58.930 --> 31:01.640
Can we do it that early?

31:01.640 --> 31:04.440
We're racing against time.

31:04.440 --> 31:09.530
Now that we don't know what
Muzan Kibutsuji will do in the future,

31:09.530 --> 31:12.950
I want us to prepare everything we can.

31:12.950 --> 31:17.080
If the demons become
more active hereafter,

31:17.080 --> 31:21.000
we alone won't be
able to handle them.

31:21.000 --> 31:26.130
But, wouldn't the demons attack
while we're holding the training?

31:26.630 --> 31:32.550
It's assumed that the demons will
focus on capturing Nezuko Kamado.

31:32.550 --> 31:36.050
In fact, since the incident
in the Swordsmith Village,

31:36.050 --> 31:39.470
the appearance of the demons
has decreased significantly.

31:39.470 --> 31:41.060
If that is the case...

31:41.480 --> 31:47.520
Until now, we can hardly train others
than our Tsuguko due to our schedules.

31:47.520 --> 31:49.480
In this short period of time,

31:49.480 --> 31:54.320
We shall use this opportunity
to strengthen the entire Corps.

31:54.990 --> 31:58.080
This is important and urgent.

31:58.080 --> 32:05.580
Yes, it's important,
thus I proposed the "Hashira Training".

32:06.210 --> 32:11.210
Himejima, no need to be wordy.

32:11.210 --> 32:13.470
I concur.

32:13.470 --> 32:15.680
No objection.

32:16.760 --> 32:18.350
Me too.

32:18.350 --> 32:20.680
I also agree.

32:21.310 --> 32:26.020
Are the active Hashiras now
enough to hold the training?

32:26.020 --> 32:30.480
I'm thinking of asking
the retired Hashiras to help us.

32:30.480 --> 32:32.360
Any objections?

32:32.360 --> 32:34.570
Of course, no.

32:34.950 --> 32:36.360
The only thing left is...

32:37.110 --> 32:39.320
Tomioka.

32:45.120 --> 32:49.290
I just got back from a mission,
and now I have to take the training.

32:49.290 --> 32:50.630
I can't stand it.

32:50.630 --> 32:52.920
Are you going now?

32:52.920 --> 32:57.760
Yeah, right. We have to take
the Hashira Training in turns.

32:57.760 --> 33:00.300
Huh? Really? Isn't that great?

33:00.680 --> 33:04.140
It's not great at all. Horrible.
It's hell.

33:04.140 --> 33:06.890
Whoever proposed this
should die already.

33:06.890 --> 33:07.730
Hey!

33:07.730 --> 33:12.980
Sparring with superiors
is a shortcut to improving.

33:13.320 --> 33:18.700
When you face someone stronger,
you absorb it and get stronger yourself.

33:24.740 --> 33:29.330
If you're being so optimistic,
then we're no longer friends from today!

33:29.330 --> 33:30.750
Ouch! Ouch! It hurts!

33:30.750 --> 33:33.380
It's okay for you!
Your bone fracture hasn't healed yet!

33:33.380 --> 33:35.260
You can just go back to sleep
and get warm!

33:35.260 --> 33:37.420
For me? I have to go to train now!

33:37.420 --> 33:39.720
Do you know how I feel?!

33:41.010 --> 33:42.760
I'm sorry!

33:44.930 --> 33:45.850
Zenitsu.

33:45.850 --> 33:47.810
Don't talk to me!

33:47.810 --> 33:49.390
Wait a minute.

33:49.390 --> 33:52.860
I forgot to say thank you.

33:55.190 --> 34:00.070
When I was fighting Upper Rank Four
and almost couldn't move one of my legs,

34:00.070 --> 34:04.330
Thanks to the Thunder Breathing
trick you taught me,

34:04.330 --> 34:06.330
I was able to cut the demon's head.

34:08.000 --> 34:11.830
Of course,
I couldn't do it as fast as you.

34:11.830 --> 34:13.420
Thank you so much.

34:14.000 --> 34:18.870
Sometimes connections with others
can help us get through tight spots.

34:18.870 --> 34:25.390
I'm sure that everything we learn in the
Hashira Training will lead to a better future.

34:30.270 --> 34:35.140
You fool! Don't think
that's going to fix my mood!

34:35.140 --> 34:37.980
Oh, he looks happy. That's good.

34:37.980 --> 34:40.890
See you later, Tanjiro. Get well soon.

34:40.890 --> 34:44.990
Oh jeez, everyone's really helpless
without me.

34:49.830 --> 34:52.790
I'm really thankful, Zenitsu.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.510
So slow! So slow! So slow!
You're all slow!

35:03.220 --> 35:07.390
What the hell are you doing?
You guys are really unbelievable!

35:09.180 --> 35:11.890
First of all,
your basic fitness is non-existent!

35:11.890 --> 35:13.900
This is just simply running!

35:13.900 --> 35:17.690
Faster! Move as if the demons
are chasing you!

35:19.030 --> 35:21.530
Hey, hey, I can't hear your voices!

35:21.530 --> 35:23.150
No need to lick the ground!

35:23.150 --> 35:25.120
Now isn't break time yet!

35:25.120 --> 35:27.330
Run one more lap!

35:27.330 --> 35:28.700
Please, no more.

35:28.700 --> 35:30.250
You guys are total losers.

35:30.250 --> 35:34.040
The training of the active Hashiras
after this will be even harder.

35:34.750 --> 35:38.840
As I expected, Sir Tengen is
more lively when he's on duty.

35:38.840 --> 35:42.550
Well, of course.
And we must do our best to help him.

35:42.550 --> 35:47.260
Since everyone's hungry,
let's make lots, lots of onigiris!

35:47.260 --> 35:48.510
Yeah.

35:57.940 --> 36:01.570
Sir Tengen, lunch is ready!

36:01.900 --> 36:02.900
Thanks!

36:02.900 --> 36:06.070
Hey! Your meals are ready!

36:06.070 --> 36:07.780
I can't.

36:07.780 --> 36:09.870
I don't feel like eating.

36:11.370 --> 36:13.620
You guys are sloppy, really.

36:13.620 --> 36:17.290
Sir Tengen.
Please, don't be so mad at them.

36:17.290 --> 36:22.170
I'd love to, but if I send them to
the next Hashira like this,

36:22.170 --> 36:24.220
I'll be the one to blame.

36:24.220 --> 36:25.720
Here, Sir Tengen.

36:25.720 --> 36:26.300
Thanks.

36:26.300 --> 36:28.720
It's miso soup with lots of salt.

36:31.850 --> 36:35.600
This is nothing to their training.
Believe me.

36:36.730 --> 36:40.690
You're in charge of
basic fitness workouts, correct?

36:40.690 --> 36:43.610
What kind of training do they take
after this?

36:43.610 --> 36:45.490
After my training...

36:45.490 --> 36:48.620
First, Tokito's high-speed
movement training.

36:48.620 --> 36:52.620
He'd do harsh things,
even with his poker face.

36:52.620 --> 36:56.580
Next, you'll be greeted by
Kanroji's hellish flexibility training.

36:56.580 --> 37:00.290
Next comes Iguro's training.
Improving swordsmanship.

37:00.290 --> 37:02.500
I tell you,
the Serpent Hashira is stubborn.

37:02.500 --> 37:04.420
Next, Shinazugawa's training.

37:04.420 --> 37:06.880
I heard it's endless striking training,

37:06.880 --> 37:09.640
but I'm sure as the name implies,
it'll be no end.

37:09.640 --> 37:13.180
The last one is Himejima's
muscle strengthening.

37:13.180 --> 37:15.980
You have to throw away
your humanity for this one.

37:15.980 --> 37:17.730
The Hashiras are also expected to

37:17.730 --> 37:25.320
improve their strength as they have to deal
with the Corps members, one after another.

37:25.320 --> 37:27.530
Isn't that flamboyant?

37:28.410 --> 37:32.080
I wish I had the chance to train
with everything I got as well.

37:33.240 --> 37:35.580
I'll leave it to you, everyone.

37:41.420 --> 37:45.420
This ain't gonna raise my temperature.

37:45.420 --> 37:46.800
You guys are too weak!

37:49.050 --> 37:51.890
Good, keep it up.

37:51.890 --> 37:54.100
Try it a bit wider!

37:55.970 --> 37:59.350
You never know where
the enemy will attack.

38:01.940 --> 38:03.060
Feel it!

38:04.820 --> 38:09.610
With all these openings, you would have
been eaten by demons three times.

38:09.990 --> 38:13.320
In order to maintain mark condition...

38:13.320 --> 38:15.450
Your side is open.

38:19.330 --> 38:21.830
Do your best, everyone.

38:22.460 --> 38:25.500
We're doing this to slay all the demons.

38:25.500 --> 38:28.840
For the Master's sake.

38:28.840 --> 38:32.590
For the Corps members who
have died so far.

38:32.590 --> 38:35.970
For the people who are still alive.

38:36.390 --> 38:39.680
We have to get through this.

38:39.680 --> 38:41.520
Hang in there.

38:49.780 --> 38:51.400
What's the matter?

38:57.660 --> 38:58.660
I'm bleeding!

38:59.120 --> 39:01.500
What are you doing so suddenly?
That's mean!

39:03.790 --> 39:05.500
Hurry, hurry.

39:05.500 --> 39:09.210
It's a letter from the Master.
Read it at once.

39:09.210 --> 39:11.800
A letter for me?

39:11.800 --> 39:14.180
I wonder what it is.

39:17.640 --> 39:22.140
Tomioka doesn't participate
in the Hashira Training?

39:38.580 --> 39:40.330
Master Kagaya,

39:40.330 --> 39:48.040
the Hashiras have begun to train
the Corps members for the upcoming battle.

39:49.340 --> 39:57.220
Your children are carrying your will
and connecting with your feelings.

39:58.510 --> 40:03.940
They are willing to do it for the long-held
ambition of defeating Muzan Kibutsuji.

40:10.150 --> 40:11.530
Amane.

40:13.490 --> 40:14.570
Yes?

40:17.070 --> 40:23.040
Thank you so much for everything
you have done.

40:32.550 --> 40:33.670
It's my pleasure.

41:19.640 --> 41:21.970
Good evening, Tamayo.

41:28.560 --> 41:33.190
It is dangerous to leave
a window open at night.

41:37.570 --> 41:41.280
But still, the moon is beautiful tonight.

41:42.200 --> 41:43.910
It is a pleasure to meet you.

41:43.910 --> 41:48.410
I am the messenger of Kagaya Ubuyashiki.

41:49.960 --> 41:54.340
I admit. You are very good at hiding.

41:54.340 --> 41:59.720
While I was trying to find you,
Ubuyashiki can no longer move.

42:00.430 --> 42:04.180
How did you find this place?

42:04.970 --> 42:07.640
The human network.

42:07.640 --> 42:12.400
I have identified the previous owner of
this house you bought.

42:12.400 --> 42:18.400
And during the day,
I grasp how Yushiro's vision works.

42:18.990 --> 42:24.240
Even though I am trained,
I am just a crow.

42:24.240 --> 42:27.870
No one is wary of me to begin with.

42:27.870 --> 42:33.250
I have no intention of harming you two,
so rest assured.

42:34.130 --> 42:38.010
Then, what do you want?

42:39.670 --> 42:43.970
You are suspicious of me.
It is understandable.

42:43.970 --> 42:51.600
As expected, it is difficult for me
to gain your trust as Tanjiro did.

42:52.100 --> 42:54.560
What are his intentions?

42:54.560 --> 42:58.860
Is Ubuyashiki trying to deceive me?

43:00.150 --> 43:01.740
Where is Yushiro?

43:01.740 --> 43:04.990
There is no need to worry about Yushiro.

43:05.950 --> 43:09.790
Listen, you can hear
his footsteps running.

43:11.330 --> 43:12.540
Now...

43:13.250 --> 43:15.750
I shall tell you my business.

43:17.670 --> 43:19.340
In the Demon Slayer Corps,

43:19.340 --> 43:24.590
there is also a kid who is knowledgeable
about demon body and pharmacology.

43:24.590 --> 43:29.770
We would like you to look into Nezuko's
transformation together with her.

43:31.980 --> 43:36.230
In order to defeat Muzan Kibutsuji,
would you work with us?

43:37.770 --> 43:40.780
We invite you to the Ubuyashiki residence.

43:41.740 --> 43:47.240
I, a demon, am invited to the
Demon Slayer Corps headquarters?

43:50.080 --> 43:53.080
(Episode 1
In Order to Defeat Muzan Kibutsuji)

43:53.080 --> 43:57.040
To you who is ignorant of
what eternity means

43:57.040 --> 44:00.340
It's time to show you the answer

44:00.340 --> 44:06.640
Beyond the endless spiral

44:22.440 --> 44:25.950
The reason why it sounded like an excuse

44:25.950 --> 44:29.490
A weakness that draws in a fleeting future

44:29.490 --> 44:34.620
You mistake it for strength

44:36.000 --> 44:37.920
So detestable, so detestable

44:37.920 --> 44:39.630
So disgraceful, so disgraceful

44:39.630 --> 44:43.050
The heart that is so bleak

44:43.050 --> 44:44.920
So dark, so dark

44:44.920 --> 44:46.880
That it almost hides the moon

44:46.880 --> 44:50.470
If only you weren't here

44:50.470 --> 44:54.060
It sways and sways

44:54.060 --> 44:57.690
Carrying on its intentions
just like a flower

44:57.690 --> 45:01.070
Taking it all away, taking it all away

45:01.070 --> 45:04.570
It tears the heart just like a storm would

45:04.570 --> 45:08.160
To you who is ignorant of
what eternity means

45:08.160 --> 45:11.700
It's time to show you the answer

45:11.700 --> 45:17.080
Beyond the endless spiral

45:17.080 --> 45:21.210
Who awaits there

47:57.700 --> 47:59.700
For every Hashira Training Arc episode,

47:59.700 --> 48:04.000
I'd like to present every Hashira's
Taisho period secret.

48:04.620 --> 48:05.830
Inosuke!

48:07.040 --> 48:09.920
Can you explain what happened
with these broken glasses?

48:09.920 --> 48:11.300
But you know...

48:11.300 --> 48:12.300
Naughty!

48:13.420 --> 48:17.510
Always being positive is
a good part of you,

48:17.510 --> 48:20.060
but there are some things
you shouldn't do.

48:20.060 --> 48:22.270
Let me see your arm.

48:22.270 --> 48:24.100
I'll treat your wound.

48:24.690 --> 48:27.350
Don't ever do that again, understand?

48:31.110 --> 48:36.820
Shinobu is sure strict,
but she's a very considerate person.

48:36.820 --> 48:38.820
Even at the last Hashira meeting...

48:38.820 --> 48:41.160
Oh my oh my oh my...

48:41.160 --> 48:42.450
Kanroji.

48:43.330 --> 48:44.710
Thank you!

48:44.710 --> 48:46.500
You're welcome.

48:47.040 --> 48:50.250
That's all for this Taisho period secret.

48:50.250 --> 48:51.920
Next up on Episode 2:

48:51.920 --> 48:54.590
"The Sorrows of the Water Hashira,
Giyu Tomioka"

48:54.590 --> 48:55.160
(To be continued)
