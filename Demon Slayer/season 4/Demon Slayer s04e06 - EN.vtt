00:04.630 --> 00:08.410
The most important is
the balance of the body,

00:08.720 --> 00:10.910
it's the legs and hips.

00:11.170 --> 00:14.750
Balancing our body with
strong legs and hips

00:14.750 --> 00:19.170
leads to accurate attacks
and solid defense.

00:19.670 --> 00:23.470
First, a training to withstand
under the waterfall.

00:23.470 --> 00:25.430
I'm gonna die!

00:25.800 --> 00:29.250
Next, carry three logs.

00:29.250 --> 00:30.930
So thick.

00:31.240 --> 00:36.170
Lastly, push and move
this boulder one cho.

00:36.730 --> 00:38.440
(One cho is about 109 meters)

00:38.820 --> 00:43.420
My training consists of just
these three simple tasks.

00:43.990 --> 00:47.990
Burning you with fire from below
is dangerous, so we'll skip that.

00:47.990 --> 00:50.080
Uhh... Sorry!

00:50.080 --> 00:52.580
Zenitsu passed out!

00:53.160 --> 00:55.350
Put him in the river.

00:56.040 --> 01:00.010
To you who is ignorant of
what eternity means

01:00.010 --> 01:03.300
It's time to show you the answer

01:03.300 --> 01:09.600
Beyond the endless spiral

01:25.410 --> 01:28.910
The reason why it sounded like an excuse

01:28.910 --> 01:32.450
A weakness that draws in a fleeting future

01:32.450 --> 01:37.580
You mistake it for strength

01:38.960 --> 01:40.880
So detestable, so detestable

01:40.880 --> 01:42.630
So disgraceful, so disgraceful

01:42.630 --> 01:46.000
The heart that is so bleak

01:46.000 --> 01:47.890
So dark, so dark

01:47.890 --> 01:49.850
That it almost hides the moon

01:49.850 --> 01:53.430
If only you weren't here

01:53.430 --> 01:57.020
It sways and sways

01:57.020 --> 02:00.650
Carrying on its intentions
just like a flower

02:00.650 --> 02:04.030
Taking it all away, taking it all away

02:04.030 --> 02:07.530
It tears the heart just like a storm would

02:07.530 --> 02:11.120
To you who is ignorant of
what eternity means

02:11.120 --> 02:14.660
It's time to show you the answer

02:14.660 --> 02:20.040
Beyond the endless spiral

02:20.040 --> 02:24.170
Who awaits there

02:29.280 --> 02:32.000
(Episode 6: The Strongest in
the Demon Slayer Corps)

02:36.760 --> 02:38.960
It's so cold!

02:38.960 --> 02:42.960
The river in winter is way too cold!

02:42.960 --> 02:44.820
I could die!
I feel like throwing up!

02:44.820 --> 02:47.040
- Zenitsu!
- Land! Land!

02:47.040 --> 02:49.440
My inside organs hurt!

02:49.440 --> 02:51.430
They're screaming!
They're saying I'm going to die!

02:54.150 --> 02:55.010
It's no use!

02:55.010 --> 02:58.100
It's too late even if I get out
of the water! I'm gonna freeze to death!

03:02.520 --> 03:05.570
Long time no see, you both.

03:05.860 --> 03:08.320
Here, stick to the rocks.

03:08.320 --> 03:09.950
They're warm.

03:15.030 --> 03:17.420
It's... so warm.

03:17.420 --> 03:19.850
Are rocks this warm?

03:19.850 --> 03:22.960
It feels like being in my mother's arms.

03:24.890 --> 03:27.560
Mommy!

03:28.220 --> 03:30.220
Mommy!

03:32.600 --> 03:35.550
So cold. This is harsh.

03:35.550 --> 03:38.060
Waterfall training is brutal.

03:39.090 --> 03:44.760
Boar Rush. Boar Rush.
Boar Rush. Boar Rush.

03:44.760 --> 03:48.320
- Namu Amida... I can't!
- Boar Rush. Boar Rush.

03:48.730 --> 03:52.260
Even Inosuke is doing his best.
I must not lose.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.830
His chant stopped?

03:58.120 --> 04:00.370
Huh? Inosuke?!

04:00.370 --> 04:02.170
Oh no! This is bad!

04:02.170 --> 04:05.290
Inosuke! Wake up, Inosuke!
Come back alive!

04:05.290 --> 04:07.930
Inosuke, please get up!

04:08.820 --> 04:10.750
You called, Manjiro?

04:10.750 --> 04:13.850
Inosuke!

04:13.850 --> 04:15.850
Boar Rush...

04:16.440 --> 04:18.440
This waterfall...

04:19.940 --> 04:21.850
...is really something else.

04:21.850 --> 04:24.780
Keep chanting Nembutsu
without stopping.

04:25.090 --> 04:27.200
It's to help you stay focused,

04:27.200 --> 04:30.530
but also to signal that
you're still conscious.

04:31.180 --> 04:32.570
Okay.

04:32.570 --> 04:34.040
Namu Amida Butsu.

04:34.690 --> 04:38.280
The water is cold, and it hits hard.

04:38.280 --> 04:40.110
I must not keep quiet.

04:40.110 --> 04:42.040
Nembutsu... Nembutsu...

04:42.390 --> 04:46.570
- Namu Amida Butsu...
- Nembutsu... Nembutsu...

04:46.570 --> 04:51.770
Nembutsu... Nembutsu...

04:52.550 --> 04:54.560
So cold!

04:56.960 --> 05:00.810
Just getting hit by the waterfall
felt really painful.

05:01.090 --> 05:04.760
I never thought water falling from
such a height could be so heavy.

05:04.760 --> 05:07.980
If I relax my body,
it feels like my neck might break.

05:07.980 --> 05:11.450
No, no. You and that Boar Head
are amazing.

05:11.730 --> 05:15.660
It me took until evening to get used to
under the waterfall on my first day.

05:15.660 --> 05:17.450
It's not easy to get
accustomed to the water.

05:17.450 --> 05:21.360
Since I've managed to withstand
being hit by the waterfall,

05:21.360 --> 05:23.980
I'm moving on to carrying the logs.

05:23.980 --> 05:27.460
Wow... You're incredible, Murata.

05:27.460 --> 05:30.480
Well... I've been here for ten days.

05:38.350 --> 05:41.390
That Prayer Beads-Rattling Guy
is amazing.

05:41.390 --> 05:43.960
That's the Stone Hashira,
his name is Himejima.

05:43.960 --> 05:46.400
Don't give him strange nicknames.

05:46.400 --> 05:49.710
I was startled when
the first time I met him.

05:49.710 --> 05:51.780
You eat the bones too, Inosuke?

05:51.780 --> 05:55.440
Yeah. You don't?
They're crunchy and delicious.

05:55.440 --> 05:56.640
Wow!

05:56.640 --> 06:01.340
Among all the people I know,
you eat fish the cleanest.

06:02.200 --> 06:04.920
I'm King of The Mountains after all!
I'm the best at everything!

06:04.920 --> 06:06.590
That's natural!

06:06.590 --> 06:10.050
You still want to eat?
You're already on your tenth.

06:10.430 --> 06:13.900
About that Prayer Beads-Rattling Guy.

06:13.900 --> 06:16.760
Himejima the Stone Hashira, remember?

06:17.140 --> 06:21.930
Without a doubt, he is the strongest
in the Demon Slayer Corps.

06:21.930 --> 06:24.300
Oh, you think so too?

06:24.300 --> 06:26.180
- Huh?
- Is that so?

06:26.180 --> 06:29.440
Himejima smells completely
different from the others.

06:29.440 --> 06:31.870
I wonder if he's already
manifested his mark.

06:31.870 --> 06:34.450
If he did, I wouldn't be surprised.

06:34.450 --> 06:39.490
I can't keep up with the talk of people
who rise in rank in such a short time.

06:39.490 --> 06:41.990
Normally, you wouldn't understand that.

06:41.990 --> 06:44.140
They're on a different level.

06:44.140 --> 06:46.960
Also, Tanjiro's grilled fish is delicious.

06:46.960 --> 06:48.890
I don't believe it.

06:49.760 --> 06:54.070
I bet that Old Guy can't even
move the boulder one cho.

06:54.070 --> 06:56.470
He's just enjoying bullying
the newcomers.

06:56.470 --> 07:01.720
You're wrong. Himejima can push
an even bigger boulder than that.

07:01.720 --> 07:04.450
You believe everything you're told?

07:04.450 --> 07:06.000
You're being deceived.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.310
Of course not.

07:07.770 --> 07:09.860
You have good hearing.

07:09.860 --> 07:12.960
You should be able to tell if
someone's lying or not, right?

07:15.480 --> 07:18.820
Namu Amida Butsu.
Namu Amida Butsu.

07:19.150 --> 07:21.330
Oh, he's here.

07:23.700 --> 07:26.370
Himejima is really amazing!

07:26.370 --> 07:28.710
Can I become like him?

07:28.710 --> 07:32.420
No way in hell!

07:32.770 --> 07:34.150
Are you dumb?!

07:34.150 --> 07:36.830
Hello?! Is your head okay?!

07:37.690 --> 07:39.400
That Old Guy is abnormal!

07:39.400 --> 07:41.250
He's huge like a bear, to begin with!

07:41.250 --> 07:42.700
Well, but...

07:42.700 --> 07:43.650
Shut up!

07:43.650 --> 07:46.630
There's a natural gap between
giants and dwarfs!

07:46.630 --> 07:48.490
You know what I mean!

07:48.490 --> 07:50.690
Now I'm full.

07:50.690 --> 07:52.900
After carrying the logs,
I'm gonna push the boulder.

07:52.900 --> 07:55.080
Dang! Why are you so positive?!

07:55.080 --> 07:56.800
There's no place for me!

07:56.800 --> 07:57.950
Calm down.

07:57.950 --> 07:59.210
Here I go!

07:59.210 --> 08:00.450
Calm down.

08:00.760 --> 08:06.120
- Nembutsu! Nembutsu! Nembutsu!
- Namu Amida Butsu! Namu Amida Butsu!

08:06.120 --> 08:07.000
- Zenitsu!
- Namu Amida Bu—

08:11.140 --> 08:12.780
Zenitsu!

08:12.780 --> 08:15.760
Namu Amida Butsu! Namu Amida Butsu!
Namu Amida Bu—

08:22.320 --> 08:25.140
Waterfall training, complete.

08:37.440 --> 08:40.680
Carrying the logs, complete.

08:42.310 --> 08:45.820
Finally, the last one...

09:08.230 --> 09:09.980
(Four)

09:11.290 --> 09:14.330
I found another one.

09:14.330 --> 09:19.360
Now I've located about sixty percent
of the demon hunters.

09:19.860 --> 09:25.250
But I haven't found the girl
who overcame the sun.

09:25.870 --> 09:32.490
Nakime, you've grown more
than I thought.

09:32.490 --> 09:34.470
How wonderful.

09:45.630 --> 09:52.140
Nakime, you've grown more
than I thought.

09:52.140 --> 09:54.320
How wonderful.

09:54.320 --> 09:56.920
It is an honor.

09:57.490 --> 09:59.720
Next, let's see...

10:00.440 --> 10:02.370
Check around here.

10:02.370 --> 10:04.650
As you wish.

10:20.060 --> 10:22.620
Found more of them.

10:23.490 --> 10:26.450
Keep tailing them.

10:26.450 --> 10:29.090
As you wish.

10:38.870 --> 10:44.210
I will find Nezuko and Ubuyashiki soon.

10:52.990 --> 10:55.740
My feet keep sliding back!

10:56.470 --> 10:58.250
I can't push the boulder!

11:06.650 --> 11:08.480
Ouch...

11:11.150 --> 11:13.030
I guess I'll back to get this fixed.

11:16.070 --> 11:17.560
Good morning!

11:17.560 --> 11:19.810
Oh, Kamado.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.230
We're going to get down off the mountain

11:22.230 --> 11:23.940
We just can't keep up.

11:25.410 --> 11:29.510
Sorry. It pains our hearts to
withdraw from here, but...

11:29.510 --> 11:33.370
But we'll provide backup support
for you from behind

11:34.070 --> 11:36.200
We're counting on you, Kamado.

11:37.600 --> 11:40.570
Okay, then.
I'm counting on you as well.

11:42.210 --> 11:44.380
Huh? You count on us?

11:44.380 --> 11:49.800
If you all support us from behind,
we can focus on fighting the demons.

11:49.800 --> 11:54.220
Let's use the strength of all the Corps
to sever Muzan Kibutsuji's head!

11:55.650 --> 11:58.180
Got it. Leave the rear to us.

11:58.180 --> 11:59.470
Roger that, Kamado.

11:59.470 --> 12:00.730
You can count on us.

12:05.840 --> 12:09.630
And I have my own duty.

12:16.800 --> 12:18.170
Wow!

12:18.170 --> 12:20.350
Tanjiro, you're really good
at making onigiris.

12:20.350 --> 12:22.540
Totally! They're perfectly triangular.

12:22.830 --> 12:27.460
I've put in extra salt because
we've been training so hard.

12:27.460 --> 12:29.550
Thanks for waiting, everyone.

12:29.550 --> 12:30.700
Enjoy!

12:33.810 --> 12:35.800
So delicious!

12:35.800 --> 12:37.800
It really hits the spot.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.720
Yup, it's tasty.

12:39.720 --> 12:42.810
I realized something during this training.

12:42.810 --> 12:46.220
About the reason why most of the
current Hashiras don't have Tsugukos.

12:46.220 --> 12:47.440
And why is that?

12:47.730 --> 12:50.150
I think I figured it out too.

12:50.150 --> 12:53.010
It's too harsh, so everyone runs away.

12:53.010 --> 12:53.900
Yeah.

12:53.900 --> 12:56.700
For example, look at that Blonde Guy.

12:56.990 --> 13:00.600
His spirit broke because got crushed by
the difference in ability with the Hashiras.

13:00.600 --> 13:03.870
The Hashira can handle things
like this as if it's nothing.

13:04.160 --> 13:06.680
They're truly amazing.

13:06.680 --> 13:08.630
I agree.

13:08.950 --> 13:11.790
You're really good at cooking rice,
aren't you?

13:11.790 --> 13:12.920
It's delicious!

13:12.920 --> 13:15.880
True, and good at grilling fish too.

13:15.880 --> 13:18.680
I'm the son of a
charcoal burner after all.

13:18.680 --> 13:20.110
That makes sense!

13:20.110 --> 13:21.810
Cooking is all about
controlling the heat.

13:23.010 --> 13:25.370
Grilled onigiris are also delicious.

13:26.610 --> 13:28.490
Nice job, Tanjiro.

13:28.980 --> 13:31.090
Eat as much as you like.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.130
The taste is even more perfect
thanks to the miso sauce.

13:35.130 --> 13:36.570
It's making me tear up.

13:36.570 --> 13:39.070
I get it.
It's like it was made by Mom.

13:39.070 --> 13:40.990
Yeah, yeah.

13:41.300 --> 13:42.690
Mother!

13:42.690 --> 13:44.450
Mom!

13:45.060 --> 13:46.250
It feels...

13:46.910 --> 13:48.870
...a bit nostalgic.

14:04.770 --> 14:06.520
Wa... Water...

14:09.340 --> 14:11.420
I couldn't do it today either.

14:11.420 --> 14:14.030
It's already the sixth day.
What should I do?

14:14.450 --> 14:17.640
We don't know how long
the demons will stay quiet.

14:17.640 --> 14:19.230
I need to hurry.

14:20.180 --> 14:23.200
Is it because I lack physical strength?

14:23.200 --> 14:26.120
Or is there another breathing method?

14:26.800 --> 14:31.570
I've been training a lot,
but I still can't maintain the mark.

14:32.980 --> 14:36.260
Is the mark on your forehead
getting darker?

14:36.260 --> 14:39.040
Genya?! How are you?

14:39.040 --> 14:42.360
After that incident, I was worried
because I couldn't get in touch with you.

14:42.360 --> 14:44.320
I was on house arrest.

14:44.320 --> 14:46.810
I got scolded by Himejima.

14:47.700 --> 14:52.980
Even though I was told not to meet
my brother, things ended up like that.

14:57.690 --> 14:59.320
I see.

14:59.320 --> 15:01.750
Sorry for getting you involved.

15:01.750 --> 15:03.850
And thanks for protecting me.

15:03.850 --> 15:05.540
No need to.

15:05.540 --> 15:07.960
Anyway, about your mark.

15:07.960 --> 15:10.050
Oh! You said it's getting darker?

15:10.050 --> 15:10.890
Yup.

15:10.890 --> 15:13.480
No one told me.

15:13.480 --> 15:16.760
From people who see you every day,
no wonder they didn't notice it.

15:16.760 --> 15:18.540
Do you have a mirror?

15:18.540 --> 15:19.280
No.

15:19.280 --> 15:21.200
I'll lend you mine later.

15:22.960 --> 15:25.240
Is it really getting darker?

15:25.240 --> 15:27.890
It's great then. I'm glad.

15:27.890 --> 15:29.000
Go die!

15:29.000 --> 15:31.200
Hmph. No, you!

15:31.200 --> 15:34.920
You're training to push the boulder?
I'm doing it too.

15:34.920 --> 15:37.560
But I can't move it at all.

15:37.560 --> 15:39.560
Have you moved it?

15:39.560 --> 15:40.780
Yeah, a bit.

15:40.780 --> 15:41.780
Huh?!

15:42.150 --> 15:44.950
Are you guys doing Repetitive Action?

15:44.950 --> 15:45.700
What?

15:46.850 --> 15:48.700
I see, you aren't.

15:49.100 --> 15:52.090
That's because Himejima
isn't good at teaching.

15:52.090 --> 15:54.710
You have to watch him carefully
and learn his skills from it.

15:55.190 --> 15:58.010
To heighten concentration
to the utmost limit,

15:58.010 --> 16:00.770
you must perform
predetermined actions in advance.

16:00.770 --> 16:03.470
In my case, I chant Nembutsu.

16:03.470 --> 16:05.190
Himejima does the same!

16:05.190 --> 16:07.720
Right! He always mutters,
"Namu Namu", right?

16:08.240 --> 16:09.410
Namu...

16:10.100 --> 16:11.480
Adios!

16:11.480 --> 16:13.100
Don't come again!

16:13.100 --> 16:14.440
See ya!

16:14.440 --> 16:16.720
Thank you, Genya.
I'll try that.

16:16.720 --> 16:18.610
Don't push yourself too hard.

16:19.160 --> 16:23.010
Even if I say that,
he's not the type to listen.

16:25.480 --> 16:27.370
Let's try it once more.

16:37.760 --> 16:39.630
Repetitive Action.

16:39.990 --> 16:42.590
Remember what Genya said.

16:43.570 --> 16:46.640
Doing it will open all of your senses.

16:46.990 --> 16:50.520
According to Himejima, even though
I can't use breathing techniques,

16:50.520 --> 16:54.770
if I use Repetitive Action,
I can move the boulder.

16:54.770 --> 16:58.520
But still, I still have a long way to go.

17:05.020 --> 17:07.410
When they use this technique,

17:08.050 --> 17:10.910
Himejima and Genya recall
memories of anger and pain.

17:11.290 --> 17:14.810
It increases their heart rate
and body temperature.

17:22.470 --> 17:25.230
Damn it. Still can't move it.

17:25.230 --> 17:27.260
Tanjiro!

17:27.550 --> 17:29.660
Hurry up and make dinner!

17:29.660 --> 17:34.320
We already tasted yours,
we won't be able to eat anyone else's.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.400
Is it already dinner time?

17:36.730 --> 17:38.080
I'll be there.

17:38.080 --> 17:39.520
Yo! Our mother!

17:39.520 --> 17:40.810
Our mother!

17:44.620 --> 17:46.070
Welcome back, Genya.

17:46.700 --> 17:48.120
I'll help you.

17:48.120 --> 17:49.370
Thank you.

17:50.820 --> 17:52.120
How was it?

17:52.120 --> 17:54.020
Were you able to do Repetitive Action?

17:55.840 --> 17:58.960
It feels different from Total Concentration.

17:58.960 --> 18:02.510
It's like to stir up emotions.

18:02.510 --> 18:03.730
Yeah.

18:03.730 --> 18:05.880
But I was thinking,

18:05.880 --> 18:11.910
maybe your forehead mark
is in a similar condition.

18:11.910 --> 18:16.850
But, Genya, Himejima and you
don't have marks like mine.

18:16.850 --> 18:19.520
That's true.

18:22.990 --> 18:24.120
Tanjiro.

18:24.900 --> 18:30.430
When do you feel your emotions strongly?

18:30.430 --> 18:32.320
Well...

18:37.600 --> 18:41.290
I don't really understand, maybe I
made you remember something sad.

18:41.290 --> 18:42.730
I'm sorry.

18:45.280 --> 18:47.430
I believe you can do it.

18:47.430 --> 18:48.770
Thank you.

19:00.870 --> 19:03.260
By performing Repetitive Action,

19:03.260 --> 19:07.400
I can instantly heighten my concentration
to the utmost limit at any time.

19:07.870 --> 19:13.660
My Repetitive Action begins with
imagining the faces of my loved ones.

19:14.930 --> 19:20.210
Then, recalling Rengoku's words.

19:20.910 --> 19:22.800
"Set your heart ablaze."

19:37.840 --> 19:44.110
I hope I can manifest this state
of darker mark longer.

19:44.610 --> 19:46.460
Oh! Gonpachiro!

19:46.460 --> 19:51.290
He even starts training
at this hour before dawn.

19:51.290 --> 19:52.970
His stamina might not last a day.

19:53.780 --> 19:56.160
I won't lose to him!

20:06.950 --> 20:09.710
I couldn't do it at first, but...

20:14.000 --> 20:16.810
Now exert my full strength
from Repetitive Action.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.060
Over and over again.

20:19.670 --> 20:22.650
As I repeated them,

20:24.800 --> 20:26.650
my body started to remember.

20:28.570 --> 20:33.200
Remember the process of exerting
full strength from Repetitive Action!

20:36.950 --> 20:38.080
For real?

20:54.800 --> 20:58.010
He did it! Tanjiro pushed the boulder!

20:58.010 --> 21:00.220
Shit! He beat me!

21:00.570 --> 21:02.650
He's a monster.

21:14.970 --> 21:18.720
What is he plotting?

21:19.820 --> 21:24.080
Now, what am I going to do?

21:24.750 --> 21:30.060
What do you look like, Ubuyashiki?

21:37.050 --> 21:41.430
The flame that burns heaven

21:41.430 --> 21:48.480
Truer than the truth

21:48.480 --> 21:52.520
The voice of prayers and
the sounds of shouting

21:52.520 --> 21:59.150
Are fleeting like winged insects

21:59.150 --> 22:03.780
Why do those who devour lives

22:03.780 --> 22:10.750
Beg mercy as if not knowing impurity

22:10.750 --> 22:16.920
Those souls that win through
the darkness can only reach

22:16.920 --> 22:21.720
Obtain that eternity

22:21.720 --> 22:27.430
There's a feeling here that
doesn't know demise

22:27.430 --> 22:32.730
Speak your dream, you strong one

22:32.730 --> 22:38.400
A resound congratulating
tune of eternity

22:38.400 --> 22:44.160
Into the light that governs the sky

22:44.160 --> 22:48.370
In the corner of the world that is messy

22:48.370 --> 22:52.710
A blade of a sword that
still wriggles and resists

22:52.710 --> 22:58.630
Grovels and struggles miserably

23:02.640 --> 23:05.430
This time I'll tell you about Himejima.

23:06.870 --> 23:09.390
What's wrong, Himejima?

23:12.050 --> 23:13.540
What a happy family.

23:13.540 --> 23:14.660
Huh?

23:15.560 --> 23:18.360
It's time for the Taisho period secret.

23:18.360 --> 23:21.140
Himejima cries easily.

23:21.140 --> 23:25.270
It seems he cries just from
seeing litter scattered around.

23:27.790 --> 23:33.290
Namu... Cats are cute.
Namu... Cats are cute.

23:33.290 --> 23:35.150
Look, he cries again.

23:35.790 --> 23:39.840
Next up on Episode 7:
"Gyomei Himejima the Stone Hashira"

23:39.840 --> 23:41.050
(To be continued)
