00:07.000 --> 00:08.500
Lady Tamayo?!

00:11.740 --> 00:14.110
Good evening, Tamayo.

00:15.260 --> 00:19.840
It is dangerous to leave
a window open at night.

00:21.540 --> 00:25.120
But still, the moon is beautiful tonight.

00:26.260 --> 00:27.890
It is a pleasure to meet you.

00:27.890 --> 00:32.490
I am the messenger of Kagaya Ubuyashiki.

00:35.980 --> 00:39.910
You are suspicious of me.
It is understandable.

00:40.250 --> 00:47.170
As expected, it is difficult for me
to gain your trust as Tanjiro did.

00:48.040 --> 00:50.510
What are his intentions?

00:50.510 --> 00:55.170
Is Ubuyashiki trying to deceive me?

00:56.380 --> 00:58.050
Where is Yushiro?

00:58.050 --> 01:01.330
There is no need to worry about Yushiro.

01:01.330 --> 01:05.200
Listen, you can hear
his footsteps running.

01:05.810 --> 01:07.980
Lady Tamayo! Lady Tamayo!

01:08.710 --> 01:12.530
Lady Tamayo!

01:14.410 --> 01:15.820
Now...

01:16.180 --> 01:18.900
I shall tell you my business.

01:18.900 --> 01:20.760
In the Demon Slayer Corps,

01:20.760 --> 01:25.770
there is also a kid who is knowledgeable
about demon body and pharmacology.

01:25.770 --> 01:30.960
We would like you to look into Nezuko's
transformation together with her.

01:33.520 --> 01:37.720
In order to defeat Muzan Kibutsuji,
would you work with us?

01:39.300 --> 01:42.380
We invite you to the Ubuyashiki residence.

01:43.680 --> 01:49.350
I, a demon, am invited to the
Demon Slayer Corps headquarters?

01:50.140 --> 01:53.770
I look forward to hearing
good news from you.

01:58.520 --> 02:00.110
Lady Tamayo!

02:02.960 --> 02:04.380
Lady Tamayo...

02:06.070 --> 02:07.620
Yushiro.

02:07.620 --> 02:11.580
Let's get out of here quickly.
The preparations are ready.

02:11.580 --> 02:13.170
No need.

02:15.050 --> 02:20.710
Now that Nezuko has overcome the sun,
something big has begun to stir.

02:20.710 --> 02:26.510
No, maybe it was already
in motion before that.

02:27.380 --> 02:34.950
The event of that day has finally
culminated unto this day.

02:36.150 --> 02:37.890
And perhaps...

02:37.890 --> 02:40.210
Lady Tamayo, could it be...

02:40.210 --> 02:43.150
It's true that we're moving out
of this place.

02:43.150 --> 02:46.450
But now, it's different from
what we've done.

02:46.450 --> 02:50.900
I'll quickly summarize
the research results so far.

02:50.900 --> 02:53.290
I need your help, Yushiro.

02:54.220 --> 02:58.670
This might be the last time we move.

03:01.670 --> 03:05.180
Let's go to the Demon Slayer
Corps headquarters.

03:05.670 --> 03:07.480
To the Ubuyashiki residence.

03:08.060 --> 03:12.020
To you who is ignorant of
what eternity means

03:12.020 --> 03:15.320
It's time to show you the answer

03:15.320 --> 03:21.610
Beyond the endless spiral

03:37.420 --> 03:40.920
The reason why it sounded like an excuse

03:40.920 --> 03:44.470
A weakness that draws in a fleeting future

03:44.470 --> 03:49.600
You mistake it for strength

03:50.980 --> 03:52.890
So detestable, so detestable

03:52.890 --> 03:54.650
So disgraceful, so disgraceful

03:54.650 --> 03:58.070
The heart that is so bleak

03:58.070 --> 03:59.900
So dark, so dark

03:59.900 --> 04:01.860
That it almost hides the moon

04:01.860 --> 04:05.450
If only you weren't here

04:05.450 --> 04:09.080
It sways and sways

04:09.080 --> 04:12.650
Carrying on its intentions
just like a flower

04:12.650 --> 04:16.080
Taking it all away, taking it all away

04:16.080 --> 04:19.550
It tears the heart just like a storm would

04:19.550 --> 04:23.130
To you who is ignorant of
what eternity means

04:23.130 --> 04:26.680
It's time to show you the answer

04:26.680 --> 04:32.060
Beyond the endless spiral

04:32.060 --> 04:36.190
Who awaits there

04:41.110 --> 04:44.110
(Episode 2: The Sorrows of
the Water Hashira, Giyu Tomioka)

04:47.840 --> 04:49.500
Master Ubuyashiki...

04:51.220 --> 04:55.270
Tanjiro, how are your injuries?

04:57.000 --> 05:02.350
How unfortunate.
Now I'm unable to move.

05:04.260 --> 05:07.130
Actually, I want to have
a chat with Giyu,

05:07.860 --> 05:10.330
but I can't.

05:12.040 --> 05:14.900
Because now is an important time,

05:14.900 --> 05:19.730
we must unite together and do our best.

05:21.120 --> 05:25.260
Would you please talk to Giyu?

05:26.830 --> 05:34.690
I hope you will talk to Giyu patiently,
who always ends up alone,

05:34.690 --> 05:39.350
so that he can look forward.

05:41.980 --> 05:43.460
Giyu...

05:45.050 --> 05:45.950
All right!

05:50.340 --> 05:51.520
Huh?

05:51.520 --> 05:55.270
Where are you going this early, Tanjiro?

05:55.270 --> 05:56.420
Aoi.

05:56.420 --> 05:59.400
To take the Hashira Training,
by any chance?

05:59.400 --> 06:03.240
Before that, there's someone
I have to meet.

06:04.270 --> 06:06.570
If so, that would be okay.

06:08.110 --> 06:09.240
Aoi!

06:09.240 --> 06:10.620
Yes? What is it?

06:10.620 --> 06:14.260
If you don't mind,
I have a question for you.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.470
Sure.

06:18.400 --> 06:21.670
Let's say, there's someone
who is always alone.

06:21.670 --> 06:28.820
How to convey to this person
that he is not alone?

06:29.840 --> 06:33.000
Well, I don't really know myself.

06:33.000 --> 06:38.100
Let me ask this first, you want to
cheer that person up, right?

06:38.960 --> 06:43.230
If it's me, I'd like to be left alone.

06:44.670 --> 06:46.760
Are you going now?

06:46.760 --> 06:48.280
Uh, yes.

06:48.280 --> 06:50.170
Please wait a minute.

06:53.430 --> 06:56.000
Is it only one person you want to meet?

06:56.000 --> 06:57.110
Yes.

07:03.230 --> 07:05.400
This is difficult.

07:07.620 --> 07:11.180
I've prepared simple onigiris.

07:11.480 --> 07:14.560
It's for you and for the person
you want to meet.

07:14.850 --> 07:17.680
No matter what,
you have to eat properly first,

07:17.680 --> 07:20.810
so that you can keep
your mind and body healthy.

07:21.180 --> 07:24.360
Aoi, thank you!

07:24.360 --> 07:25.750
I'm going!

07:33.980 --> 07:35.820
Excuse me!

07:35.820 --> 07:37.810
Tomioka!

07:37.810 --> 07:39.980
Hello!

07:39.980 --> 07:42.500
Pardon me!

07:42.500 --> 07:45.970
Giyu! It's me!

07:45.970 --> 07:47.800
Are you inside?

07:48.380 --> 07:51.090
It's me, Tanjiro Kamado!

07:51.090 --> 07:53.170
Hello!

07:54.070 --> 07:55.850
I'm coming in!

07:57.130 --> 07:58.930
Coming in?

07:58.930 --> 08:01.600
No. It must be he's leaving.

08:02.200 --> 08:04.110
I must have misheard.

08:13.760 --> 08:17.740
That's the story, and everyone's
already taking the training.

08:17.740 --> 08:19.170
I know.

08:19.170 --> 08:21.750
Oh, you knew? Good.

08:23.410 --> 08:25.000
So close.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.210
I'll be allowed to return to active
in seven days.

08:28.210 --> 08:30.250
Can I join your training?

08:30.250 --> 08:31.560
No.

08:31.560 --> 08:33.130
Why not?

08:33.450 --> 08:38.810
You smell a bit angry.
What are you angry about?

08:38.810 --> 08:42.820
I'm angry that you didn't
master Water Breathing.

08:43.470 --> 08:47.940
You were supposed to be
the Water Hashira.

08:47.940 --> 08:50.450
I'm sorry about that.

08:50.450 --> 08:53.530
But I have talked to Mr. Urokodaki.

08:53.530 --> 08:59.950
He said it isn't unusual to change the breathing
style or to create a new breathing derivation.

09:00.260 --> 09:03.880
Especially Water Breathing,
its techniques are close to basics,

09:03.880 --> 09:06.210
so many derivatives
were created from it.

09:06.210 --> 09:08.840
That's not what I meant.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.180
Since there's currently no Water Hashira,

09:11.180 --> 09:15.970
someone must become the
Water Hashira as soon as possible.

09:15.970 --> 09:20.220
There's no Water Hashira?
You're the one, aren't you?

09:21.180 --> 09:24.240
I'm not the Water Hashira.

09:30.330 --> 09:31.320
Leave.

09:37.050 --> 09:41.620
"I hope you will talk to Giyu patiently."

09:42.620 --> 09:43.960
All right!

09:45.320 --> 09:46.830
Giyu!

09:46.830 --> 09:51.090
I have onigiris.
Wanna eat it together?

09:51.090 --> 09:55.340
They say you'll become calmer
when you're full.

09:56.280 --> 09:59.000
I'll put it here.

10:11.900 --> 10:14.690
Giyu, you're back.

10:15.180 --> 10:18.700
So you ate the onigiris?
I'm glad.

10:21.450 --> 10:23.040
Giyu!

10:27.390 --> 10:30.540
Giyu! Are you on a mission, Giyu?

10:30.540 --> 10:34.290
Are you on a mission, Giyu?
Is it patrolling?

10:34.290 --> 10:38.010
It seems the demons haven't
appeared that much recently.

10:39.110 --> 10:42.100
No demons here.
That's good.

10:42.100 --> 10:44.640
Come on, train me.

10:45.280 --> 10:48.630
Giyu! Will you hold a training session?

10:48.630 --> 10:50.150
Please!

10:50.150 --> 10:54.280
Everyone's waiting! Giyu!

10:54.280 --> 10:55.150
Giyu.

10:55.150 --> 10:55.900
Giyu!

10:55.900 --> 10:56.780
Giyu...

10:56.780 --> 10:59.120
Giyu!

10:59.780 --> 11:00.800
(Lavatory)

11:00.800 --> 11:02.530
Giyu!
(Lavatory)

11:06.470 --> 11:10.220
Will this continue for the rest
of my life?

11:10.960 --> 11:15.210
Will he stop haunting me
if I talk to him?

11:20.230 --> 11:24.930
To be truth,
I didn't pass the Final Selection.

11:25.840 --> 11:30.060
Wasn't Final Selection a test at the
mountain with wisteria flowers?

11:30.890 --> 11:32.480
That's right.

11:32.480 --> 11:38.820
That year, there was a boy whose family
was killed by demons, just like me.

11:39.180 --> 11:40.630
His name was Sabito.

11:40.630 --> 11:45.130
I took the selection together with him,
a boy with peach-colored hair.

11:56.860 --> 12:00.110
Sabito and Giyu...

12:01.740 --> 12:04.100
We were 13 years old.

12:04.100 --> 12:09.440
We quickly became friends because
we were the same age and were alone.

12:09.440 --> 12:14.860
Sabito was a kind boy who
had a strong sense of justice.

12:20.870 --> 12:25.720
The only one who died in the
selection that year was Sabito.

12:27.580 --> 12:32.260
He almost defeated all the demons
on that mountain single-handedly.

12:34.490 --> 12:38.140
But everyone passed except him.

12:40.260 --> 12:46.690
I was injured and dazed by
the first demon that attacked me.

12:50.020 --> 12:54.530
Even then, Sabito saved me.

12:54.530 --> 12:58.780
Water Breathing, Fourth Form:
Striking Tide.

13:13.570 --> 13:20.260
Sabito entrusted me to another boy and
went towards the voice calling for help.

13:26.220 --> 13:30.770
The next thing I knew,
the selection was over.

13:31.500 --> 13:36.280
Somehow I survived seven days
and passed the selection.

13:36.600 --> 13:40.720
Can you really say that someone who
hadn't defeated a single demon

13:40.720 --> 13:44.820
and had only been saved
actually "passed"?

13:49.800 --> 13:53.050
I'm not worthy of becoming
the Water Hashira.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.620
In the first place,

13:55.630 --> 13:59.650
I can't stand shoulder to shoulder with
the other Hashiras on equal terms.

14:01.110 --> 14:03.210
I'm different from them.

14:03.990 --> 14:07.850
Properly speaking, I have no place
in the Demon Slayer Corps.

14:09.670 --> 14:13.990
Ask another Hashira to train you.
That would be best.

14:15.030 --> 14:17.000
The mark won't appear on me.

14:17.600 --> 14:21.030
Although Sabito might have.

14:22.620 --> 14:26.470
Don't bother with me.
You're just wasting your time.

14:31.480 --> 14:37.630
I'm sure Giyu wishes that
he himself should've died.

14:38.550 --> 14:44.070
I know how painful it is to have
someone you care about die before you,

14:44.950 --> 14:47.860
and you wish they had lived
instead of you.

14:47.860 --> 14:51.810
Especially if they died protecting you.

14:52.430 --> 14:54.530
It feels like being torn apart.

14:57.150 --> 15:02.030
Sabito was the boy who
trained me on Mount Sagiri.

15:02.390 --> 15:04.660
It was a mysterious experience.

15:04.660 --> 15:09.570
They were supposedly already dead,
but they helped me.

15:10.860 --> 15:12.290
I see.

15:12.290 --> 15:15.810
Sabito took the Final Selection
together with Giyu.

15:16.990 --> 15:20.920
If he were still alive,
he would be the same age as Giyu.

15:21.370 --> 15:24.270
That's incredible, really.

15:24.270 --> 15:27.510
He saved everyone at the Final Selection.

15:28.180 --> 15:30.050
I couldn't do that.

15:30.050 --> 15:32.940
I was too busy defending myself.

15:32.940 --> 15:37.940
If he had lived, he would definitely
have been a great swordsman.

15:39.770 --> 15:45.820
It must be another reason why Giyu
thinks he should have died instead.

15:46.300 --> 15:50.330
I know it very well.
Because I thought the same thing.

15:50.870 --> 15:52.330
Rengoku was...

15:53.100 --> 15:57.710
...an incredible person who
protected us at the cost of his life.

15:58.170 --> 16:00.710
He was kinder and stronger
than anyone else.

16:01.560 --> 16:03.220
It was a splendid way of his life.

16:05.110 --> 16:06.550
Until the end he was amazing.

16:09.980 --> 16:14.480
I thought it might've been better
if I'd died instead of Rengoku.

16:15.350 --> 16:19.540
Because I believe that Rengoku might've
been able to defeat Muzan someday.

16:20.540 --> 16:21.780
However...

16:21.780 --> 16:23.760
He said he believed in you,

16:23.760 --> 16:27.030
so just think about how you're
going to measure up to that!

16:27.030 --> 16:29.550
Yeah. That's right.

16:30.100 --> 16:31.160
That's it.

16:31.160 --> 16:34.290
But what should I say to Giyu?

16:34.910 --> 16:37.370
No matter how pathetic
or humiliated you feel,

16:37.370 --> 16:39.420
you still have to go on living.

16:39.420 --> 16:41.670
Even though he doesn't admit it,

16:41.670 --> 16:47.090
Giyu must have beaten himself up and
trained so hard until became a Hashira,

16:47.090 --> 16:50.010
and how much pain he has gone through.

16:50.760 --> 16:55.770
I don't have the right to criticize because
I don't know anything about him, but...

16:55.770 --> 16:59.390
But there's one thing I must ask
no matter what.

16:59.390 --> 17:01.520
Gi... Giyu.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.880
He won't stop.

17:04.640 --> 17:06.140
Giyu...

17:06.140 --> 17:12.210
Don't you want to carry on what
Sabito entrusted you?

17:24.550 --> 17:26.760
Sa... Sabito?

17:26.760 --> 17:30.010
Don't you ever say that you wish
you had died again!

17:30.010 --> 17:34.520
If you do, we're done.
I stop being your friend.

17:34.520 --> 17:37.880
Your sister was going to
get married the next day,

17:37.880 --> 17:42.190
but she chose to hide and protect you from
a demon although she knew the risk.

17:42.190 --> 17:46.440
You're her brother, no one else!
Don't disrespect her death!

17:46.440 --> 17:49.990
You have to stay alive.

17:49.990 --> 17:53.370
For your sister who sacrificed
her life to save yours

17:53.370 --> 17:55.310
and to give you a future,

17:55.310 --> 17:57.120
you have to carry on,

17:57.470 --> 17:58.530
Giyu.

17:59.430 --> 18:00.680
That hurt.

18:01.630 --> 18:06.530
Suddenly I remember clearly the
shock and pain caused by his slap.

18:08.570 --> 18:10.630
Why did I forget...

18:11.780 --> 18:14.100
...that exchange with Sabito?

18:15.020 --> 18:16.680
Isn't that something important?

18:23.020 --> 18:25.190
I didn't want to remember it.

18:25.820 --> 18:28.220
Because my tears would never stop.

18:35.750 --> 18:37.270
If I remember it,

18:37.270 --> 18:40.960
I would become so sad
that I couldn't do anything.

18:42.140 --> 18:43.880
Tsutako...

18:43.880 --> 18:45.110
Sabito...

18:46.570 --> 18:48.200
I'm sorry I'm so immature.

18:50.660 --> 18:54.250
This is bad.
Now he's not moving at all.

18:54.250 --> 18:57.190
What should I do?
Did I say something bad?

18:57.190 --> 19:00.430
Giyu already seemed pretty depressed.

19:00.430 --> 19:02.630
Did I add salt to injury?

19:03.400 --> 19:06.980
I know! Maybe we could have
an eating contest.

19:06.980 --> 19:12.610
Maybe if I win, he has to cheer
himself up and train me.

19:12.610 --> 19:17.620
I can't ask for sparring because I don't
have permission to return to active.

19:17.620 --> 19:21.390
Since Giyu is a quiet type, we don't
need to talk during an eating contest.

19:21.390 --> 19:22.870
What a great idea!

19:23.370 --> 19:26.840
Tanjiro, sorry for the late response.
I will participate—

19:26.840 --> 19:30.340
Giyu, wanna have a soba eating contest?

19:31.480 --> 19:32.620
But why?

19:39.050 --> 19:44.060
So, about the training,
I haven't heard anything from Kocho.

19:44.060 --> 19:46.860
Have you heard anything from her?

19:48.170 --> 19:49.730
From Shinobu, huh?

19:50.580 --> 19:52.240
Neither I have.

19:53.100 --> 19:54.990
I wonder what is the training.

19:55.800 --> 19:58.530
Calm down. It's all right.

20:00.390 --> 20:03.790
Sis, help me to calm down.

20:04.620 --> 20:07.920
Only immatures can't control
their emotions.

20:08.650 --> 20:10.530
Only immatures...

20:16.490 --> 20:19.430
Master, you're back.

20:19.930 --> 20:24.630
I will be going to take
the Wind Hashira's training.

20:24.630 --> 20:26.060
I see.

20:26.060 --> 20:30.940
Can I take your training after
I take Stone Hashira's training?

20:31.690 --> 20:36.610
I will not be able to participate in
the Hashira Training this time.

20:37.450 --> 20:39.530
But... But why?

20:41.290 --> 20:43.780
Kanao, come here.

20:45.590 --> 20:46.870
Okay.

20:50.130 --> 20:53.010
Um... Well...

20:53.560 --> 20:57.640
I want to train with you more, Master.

21:01.410 --> 21:07.210
Now you're getting better at expressing
what's in your mind, Kanao.

21:07.210 --> 21:09.480
It's a good sign.

21:09.960 --> 21:12.820
I think now is the right time.

21:15.520 --> 21:21.220
I will tell you about the demon
who killed my sister Kanae.

21:22.880 --> 21:29.260
And I shall tell you how to kill
that demon.

21:36.290 --> 21:40.660
The flame that burns heaven

21:40.670 --> 21:47.570
Truer than the truth

21:47.570 --> 21:51.750
The voice of prayers and
the sounds of shouting

21:51.750 --> 21:58.300
Are fleeting like winged insects

21:58.300 --> 22:03.010
Why do those who devour lives

22:03.010 --> 22:10.030
Beg mercy as if not knowing impurity

22:10.030 --> 22:16.140
Those souls that win through
the darkness can only reach

22:16.140 --> 22:20.800
Obtain that eternity

22:20.800 --> 22:26.670
There's a feeling here that
doesn't know demise

22:26.670 --> 22:31.810
Speak your dream, you strong one

22:31.810 --> 22:37.590
A resound congratulating
tune of eternity

22:37.600 --> 22:43.230
Into the light that governs the sky

22:43.230 --> 22:47.510
In the corner of the world that is messy

22:47.510 --> 22:51.780
A blade of a sword that
still wriggles and resists

22:51.780 --> 22:57.860
Grovels and struggles miserably

23:01.700 --> 23:04.290
This time I'll tell you about Giyu.

23:04.290 --> 23:06.230
I won't eat more soba.

23:06.230 --> 23:08.950
Yeah, me too. I'm already full.

23:09.310 --> 23:11.930
And here is the Taisho period secret.

23:11.930 --> 23:13.650
It's about Giyu's haori.

23:13.650 --> 23:16.400
As you can see,
half of it is a memento of Sabito.

23:16.400 --> 23:21.860
And half of it is a memento of his sister
Tsutako, who was killed by a demon.

23:21.860 --> 23:24.970
Giyu is a compassionate person,
after all.

23:24.970 --> 23:27.920
Tanjiro, do you want to eat
simmered salmon with daikon?

23:27.920 --> 23:29.470
Are you sure?

23:29.470 --> 23:31.600
No eating contest this time.

23:31.600 --> 23:33.480
I'm glad to accompany you!

23:33.480 --> 23:34.450
But before that!

23:34.450 --> 23:35.730
Next up on Episode 3:

23:35.730 --> 23:38.940
"Tanjiro is Fully Recovered and
Taking the Hashira Training!"

23:38.940 --> 23:40.110
(To be continued)
