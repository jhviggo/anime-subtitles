WEBVTT

00:12.730 --> 00:13.900
For real?

00:29.490 --> 00:30.580
He...

00:30.580 --> 00:33.770
He did it!
Tanjiro pushed the boulder!

00:33.770 --> 00:36.000
Shit! He beat me!

00:38.290 --> 00:40.430
It's just getting started.

00:40.430 --> 00:44.030
If I let up for a moment,
my strength will give out.

00:45.500 --> 00:48.950
I have to keep pushing the boulder
as long as I can.

00:49.760 --> 00:52.690
Don't just arms, use legs and hips.

00:52.690 --> 00:54.470
Push with legs and hips!

00:54.470 --> 00:58.110
The lower body has more muscle mass
than the upper body.

01:07.280 --> 01:09.450
Tempura! Tempura!

01:09.450 --> 01:12.080
Boar Rush!

01:22.140 --> 01:25.140
Even Inosuke moved the boulder.

01:25.140 --> 01:26.670
This sucks!

01:26.670 --> 01:28.750
The one left is me.

01:28.750 --> 01:30.370
This is the worst!

01:33.780 --> 01:36.650
Chuntaro? What's wrong?

01:36.650 --> 01:41.600
I still can't push the boulder,
so I can't move to the next training.

01:41.600 --> 01:43.690
Don't rush me.

01:44.530 --> 01:46.320
It hurts! What's your problem?!

01:48.570 --> 01:52.220
Huh? What? A letter for me?

01:53.030 --> 01:57.000
To you who is ignorant of
what eternity means

01:57.000 --> 02:00.290
It's time to show you the answer

02:00.290 --> 02:06.590
Beyond the endless spiral

02:22.400 --> 02:25.900
The reason why it sounded like an excuse

02:25.900 --> 02:29.450
A weakness that draws in a fleeting future

02:29.450 --> 02:34.570
You mistake it for strength

02:35.950 --> 02:37.870
So detestable, so detestable

02:37.870 --> 02:39.620
So disgraceful, so disgraceful

02:39.620 --> 02:43.000
The heart that is so bleak

02:43.000 --> 02:44.880
So dark, so dark

02:44.880 --> 02:46.840
That it almost hides the moon

02:46.840 --> 02:50.420
If only you weren't here

02:50.420 --> 02:54.010
It sways and sways

02:54.010 --> 02:57.640
Carrying on its intentions
just like a flower

02:57.640 --> 03:01.020
Taking it all away, taking it all away

03:01.020 --> 03:04.520
It tears the heart just like a storm would

03:04.520 --> 03:08.110
To you who is ignorant of
what eternity means

03:08.110 --> 03:11.650
It's time to show you the answer

03:11.650 --> 03:17.030
Beyond the endless spiral

03:17.030 --> 03:21.160
Who awaits there

03:26.420 --> 03:28.970
(Episode 7: Gyomei Himejima
the Stone Hashira)

03:50.170 --> 03:53.800
I moved it... one cho.

03:54.820 --> 04:02.710
And that ends... Himejima's... training.

04:05.160 --> 04:06.220
Huh?

04:07.050 --> 04:08.300
Wait, what?

04:08.980 --> 04:12.100
I... I'm dehydrated.

04:12.100 --> 04:17.330
I sweated like a waterfall
but didn't drink any water.

04:19.440 --> 04:26.150
Zen... Zenitsu, Inosuke, Murata...

04:27.130 --> 04:29.650
I think I'm gonna die here...

04:29.650 --> 04:32.790
Someone... help...

04:37.900 --> 04:39.680
Himejima?

04:39.680 --> 04:41.450
I'm saved.

04:41.450 --> 04:43.490
Namu Amida Butsu.

04:44.090 --> 04:46.280
Namu Amida Butsu.

04:46.960 --> 04:48.990
Namu Amida Butsu.

04:48.990 --> 04:51.060
Huh? Did I die?

04:51.990 --> 04:54.040
Oh! I'm alive.

04:54.040 --> 04:56.710
Th... Thank you.

04:59.400 --> 05:02.390
You have completed the boulder training.

05:03.060 --> 05:07.010
Along with your righteous
actions in the village,

05:07.640 --> 05:10.130
I acknowledge you.

05:12.310 --> 05:13.130
In the village?

05:13.130 --> 05:16.600
Water... That's enough.

05:18.980 --> 05:21.700
In the Swordsmith Village,

05:21.700 --> 05:27.460
you prioritized saving the villagers
over the life of your demon sister.

05:27.460 --> 05:30.210
Oh, about that...

05:30.210 --> 05:32.500
Do not be ashamed.

05:32.500 --> 05:35.080
You are an exemplary swordsman.

05:36.010 --> 05:39.730
You should be proud of
your right action.

05:42.890 --> 05:45.360
No. You're wrong.

05:45.360 --> 05:49.490
It was Nezuko who made
that decision, not me.

05:49.790 --> 05:54.740
I couldn't decide and almost
let the villagers get killed.

05:55.550 --> 05:57.770
I don't deserve your acknowledgment.

06:09.260 --> 06:13.390
Children are pure, innocent, and weak.

06:13.390 --> 06:18.590
They lie and commit mischief
without hesitation.

06:18.590 --> 06:21.010
They are the embodiment of
selfish desires.

06:22.170 --> 06:26.800
However, this child is different.

06:27.960 --> 06:33.170
No matter the circumstances,
I always want to take the right path,

06:33.170 --> 06:35.220
but I don't know what lies ahead.

06:35.950 --> 06:38.390
It's just that someone
has always helped me,

06:38.390 --> 06:41.840
and that's why I haven't made
any mistakes so far.

06:42.580 --> 06:46.040
It was really dangerous at that time.

06:50.170 --> 06:54.550
So please, don't acknowledge me
that easily!

06:54.550 --> 06:56.300
(Hard-Headed Boy)

06:57.160 --> 06:59.610
Thank you for the water.

06:59.610 --> 07:02.210
And thank you for your training
until today.

07:02.210 --> 07:03.860
I have learned a lot.

07:05.380 --> 07:07.740
Now my doubts are gone.

07:07.740 --> 07:12.760
No matter what anyone says,
I will always acknowledge you,

07:12.760 --> 07:15.200
Tanjiro Kamado.

07:15.200 --> 07:18.180
Huh? I don't understand.

07:18.180 --> 07:20.200
But why?

07:20.810 --> 07:27.720
I used to raise orphans at a temple.

07:29.460 --> 07:32.150
Kazunori, you took so long.

07:32.150 --> 07:35.720
Sorry, I really needed to pee.

07:36.520 --> 07:40.220
Sensei, today's meal is such a luxury.

07:40.220 --> 07:44.460
Yes, I met a dried fish peddler today.

07:45.090 --> 07:48.820
He gave me the leftovers for free.

07:49.480 --> 07:52.460
Let's be thankful for the kind person.

07:52.460 --> 07:57.370
Also, we should thank Ryotaro and Asami,
who are on kitchen duty.

07:57.370 --> 07:59.020
Yeah, thank us!

07:59.020 --> 08:01.080
Hey, Ryotaro!

08:04.490 --> 08:05.780
Sayo?

08:09.000 --> 08:10.720
What is the matter?

08:10.720 --> 08:14.250
You can have my fish.

08:14.250 --> 08:19.010
You're so thin. Please eat more.

08:21.400 --> 08:25.270
I see. What a kind child you are.

08:25.270 --> 08:27.280
While I appreciate your concern,

08:27.280 --> 08:32.080
I am used to rigorous training
and can endure hunger.

08:32.730 --> 08:35.650
You should eat it yourself, Sayo.

08:35.650 --> 08:36.600
Okay.

08:38.070 --> 08:41.630
Even so, I will not be outmatched
by you all in strength.

08:41.630 --> 08:43.690
Then I'll take it!

08:43.690 --> 08:47.410
No! It's only for Sensei!

08:55.590 --> 08:57.400
Thanks for the meal.

08:57.400 --> 08:59.340
Thanks for the meal!

08:59.980 --> 09:03.600
Even though not bound by blood,

09:03.630 --> 09:04.080
Be careful not to spill while you eat.

09:04.080 --> 09:05.320
we lived together harmoniously,
helping one another like a family.
Be careful not to spill while you eat.

09:05.320 --> 09:06.900
Eat slowly.
we lived together harmoniously,
helping one another like a family.

09:06.900 --> 09:08.930
we lived together harmoniously,
helping one another like a family.

09:08.930 --> 09:10.000
Bones!
we lived together harmoniously,
helping one another like a family.

09:10.000 --> 09:10.920
Hey, hey, be careful.
we lived together harmoniously,
helping one another like a family.

09:10.920 --> 09:11.630
Hey, hey, be careful.

09:12.190 --> 09:17.690
I always wanted to live my life that way.

09:19.490 --> 09:22.260
However, one night...

09:31.750 --> 09:33.910
There was a child who
did not follow the rules

09:33.910 --> 09:37.220
and did not return to
the temple by nightfall.

09:37.220 --> 09:39.520
He encountered a demon.

09:39.520 --> 09:41.760
To save himself,

09:41.760 --> 09:48.600
he told the demon to devour me and
the eight other children at the temple.

09:50.600 --> 09:53.420
Good night!

10:00.340 --> 10:07.500
In the region where I lived, legends
about the threat of demons ran deep.

10:07.500 --> 10:12.430
We always burned wisteria flower
incense for protection every night.

10:14.490 --> 10:19.590
That child extinguished the incense...

10:20.260 --> 10:24.370
...and invited the demon
into the temple.

10:36.280 --> 10:38.510
Who is it?

10:42.500 --> 10:44.980
Four children were killed immediately.

10:45.700 --> 10:49.530
I tried to protect the remaining four,

10:49.530 --> 10:51.960
but the three of them...

10:52.540 --> 10:55.690
...did not listen to me.

11:02.800 --> 11:05.380
They ran without relying on me,

11:06.050 --> 11:08.870
and were killed by their throats slit.

11:10.140 --> 11:13.730
At that time, I did not eat much
because we lack of food.

11:13.730 --> 11:17.880
I was thin and weak-willed.

11:18.710 --> 11:21.730
I had never raised my voice.

11:22.400 --> 11:26.130
Furthermore, being a blind adult,

11:26.130 --> 11:31.240
the children must have judged
that I was useless.

11:31.910 --> 11:35.000
You're... blind?

11:35.000 --> 11:41.500
Only Sayo, the youngest,
listened to me.

11:42.390 --> 11:46.510
Sayo alone hid behind me.

11:49.260 --> 11:50.770
I...

11:51.680 --> 11:56.690
I chose to fight, determined to
protect Sayo at all costs.

12:30.890 --> 12:35.590
The feeling of hitting
a living being was like hell.

12:36.550 --> 12:41.480
I will never forget
that sickening sensation.

12:41.650 --> 12:47.620
The first time I swung punches
with all my strength.

12:47.620 --> 12:50.740
Even I was terrified by
its power myself.

12:51.300 --> 12:53.350
Had not I been attacked by a demon,

12:53.350 --> 12:58.740
I would have lived my entire life
without knowing how strong I was.

12:59.370 --> 13:06.000
I kept smashing the demon's head
until dawn.

13:06.710 --> 13:13.860
That night, I lost so much,
I was wounded,

13:13.860 --> 13:17.390
and risked my life to protect Sayo.

13:17.860 --> 13:22.900
Guess what she said when
people came to help?

13:23.390 --> 13:25.790
"That person is a monster."

13:25.790 --> 13:30.400
"Everyone was killed by that person."

13:31.150 --> 13:32.640
Oh my God...

13:33.240 --> 13:36.880
She must have been terrified and
confused by what had happened.

13:36.880 --> 13:41.790
She was just a four-year-old child.
It's understandable.

13:41.790 --> 13:44.630
Children are like that.

13:45.780 --> 13:52.610
But even so, I wanted Sayo to
show me some appreciation.

13:53.220 --> 13:59.720
I wanted her to thank me
for fighting for her.

14:01.950 --> 14:06.070
Those words would have saved me.

14:06.780 --> 14:11.700
But children are always
preoccupied with themselves.

14:12.200 --> 14:15.670
The demon's corpse turned to
dust and vanished,

14:15.670 --> 14:19.360
leaving only the children's bodies.

14:20.190 --> 14:24.380
I was imprisoned for murder.

14:25.210 --> 14:28.210
Had it not been for
the Master's intervention,

14:28.210 --> 14:30.960
I would have been executed.

14:30.960 --> 14:36.080
Since then, I have become
a deeply distrustful person.

14:36.830 --> 14:40.160
Of course, I even doubted you.

14:40.160 --> 14:43.640
No matter how good a person
appears to be,

14:43.640 --> 14:46.360
their true nature is revealed
in dire situations.

14:46.980 --> 14:52.870
But you did not run away, you did
not look away, you did not lie.

14:52.870 --> 14:55.150
You were honest and earnest.

14:55.990 --> 14:58.540
It might seem simple,

14:58.540 --> 15:02.490
but few can maintain such qualities
in any circumstance.

15:03.530 --> 15:06.500
You are a special child.

15:06.500 --> 15:12.020
I can say this after having seen many
people with the eyes of my heart.

15:12.020 --> 15:14.270
So I am certain.

15:20.860 --> 15:25.340
Everyone shares uneasiness
about the future.

15:25.340 --> 15:31.840
To ensure you do not lose your way,
I will help you from now on.

15:37.920 --> 15:39.700
I'll do my best.

15:39.700 --> 15:41.750
Thank you.

16:00.970 --> 16:04.000
You finished your training with me.

16:05.210 --> 16:07.550
You have done well.

16:23.570 --> 16:27.760
Despite everything,
Himejima is a kind person.

16:29.080 --> 16:33.440
Because I don't have talent,
he wouldn't make me his Tsuguko,

16:33.440 --> 16:37.840
but he knew that I ate a demon
and made me his apprentice.

16:38.900 --> 16:43.800
He introduced me to Kocho
to get my body examined.

16:43.800 --> 16:46.170
Oh, that's the story, I see.

16:46.170 --> 16:49.120
Kocho gave me such a nasty look.

16:49.120 --> 16:51.410
Every time we meet, I get a lecture.

16:54.160 --> 16:57.830
Inosuke! That's Zenitsu's portion,
so you can't have it!

16:57.830 --> 17:01.560
Huh?! If he's not here,
it means he doesn't need it.

17:01.560 --> 17:05.210
He's probably got an upset stomach
or something.

17:05.210 --> 17:09.930
Well, I think it's more likely that
he'll get hungry later.

17:10.680 --> 17:15.340
Ah, geez, you're always worrying
about other people.

17:15.340 --> 17:19.990
You look pretty stubborn,
so I thought she'd lecture you too.

17:19.990 --> 17:23.100
But in the end,
she didn't complain much.

17:23.100 --> 17:28.660
If I couldn't use breathing techniques,
probably I'd be the same as you.

17:28.660 --> 17:31.260
Is your body okay though?

17:31.260 --> 17:35.600
I'm sure that Shinobu is worried
about your condition.

17:35.600 --> 17:37.260
Do you think so?

17:37.260 --> 17:39.040
I bet, yeah.

17:39.040 --> 17:42.180
After having a meal,
I'm going to see Giyu.

17:42.180 --> 17:43.760
Want to go together?

17:43.760 --> 17:48.320
Even if I wanna, I can't.
I haven't moved the boulder one cho.

17:48.320 --> 17:50.830
I'm almost there!

17:50.830 --> 17:53.510
It's because I can't use
breathing techniques.

17:55.180 --> 17:59.100
You can't use breathing techniques?
What a small fry!

17:59.100 --> 18:02.110
- You are the small fry!
- The heck, Bastard!

18:02.110 --> 18:03.690
- Damn you!
- Come're!

18:03.690 --> 18:05.110
Both of you, stop fighting!

18:06.180 --> 18:07.360
Get off me!

18:10.140 --> 18:13.860
I was thinking we could talk along
the way if we go together.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.240
About what?

18:15.240 --> 18:19.500
It's about your brother,
the Wind Hashira.

18:20.820 --> 18:22.500
You know, actually, he's...

18:33.880 --> 18:37.250
Oh, Zenitsu! You're here.

18:37.890 --> 18:40.030
Have you moved the boulder?

18:41.050 --> 18:43.270
No, not yet.

18:43.820 --> 18:45.280
I see.

18:45.280 --> 18:48.370
I'm moving on to the next training.

18:48.370 --> 18:49.730
Are you all right?

18:49.730 --> 18:53.830
I'm worried because you haven't
been talking much lately.

18:54.550 --> 18:55.860
Is that so?

18:56.470 --> 18:57.680
Good for you.

18:58.400 --> 18:59.530
And good luck.

19:01.440 --> 19:02.810
I...

19:04.870 --> 19:10.180
I've just come to understand clearly
what I need to do, what I must do.

19:11.340 --> 19:13.470
What happened?

19:14.120 --> 19:15.950
If there's anything I can help—

19:15.950 --> 19:17.350
Tanjiro.

19:18.950 --> 19:21.430
Just do what you need to do.

19:22.480 --> 19:26.730
But... But I'm worried.

19:34.900 --> 19:37.640
You're really a good guy.

19:38.290 --> 19:39.600
Thank you.

19:42.460 --> 19:43.720
But still...

19:47.420 --> 19:51.720
This is something that
I absolutely must do myself.

20:06.510 --> 20:09.730
Is Zenitsu going to be all right?

20:12.450 --> 20:17.500
And Nezuko... Is it really okay to
leave her behind for so long?

20:19.980 --> 20:22.170
I wonder if she's feeling lonely.

20:23.460 --> 20:27.620
Huh? Uh... I'm here...

20:27.620 --> 20:31.570
This should be the area
where Giyu is, right?

20:57.620 --> 20:59.240
So fast!

21:00.910 --> 21:05.830
Wind Breathing, First Form:
Dust Whirlwind Cutter!

21:05.830 --> 21:07.080
But...

21:11.350 --> 21:12.550
I can see them.

21:12.990 --> 21:14.840
I can follow their movements.

21:19.760 --> 21:21.880
Come on! What's the deal?

21:21.880 --> 21:25.640
Didn't you say that
you're different from us?

21:25.640 --> 21:28.040
I'm different from you all.

21:28.040 --> 21:31.520
Uh oh, that's not what he meant.

21:32.050 --> 21:33.280
Water Breathing,

21:34.170 --> 21:37.450
Fourth Form: Striking Tide.

21:37.450 --> 21:39.160
Too slow!

21:41.700 --> 21:44.870
Seventh Form: Drop Ripple Thrust.

21:44.870 --> 21:47.580
Fifth Form: Cold Mountain Wind!

21:53.380 --> 21:57.360
All right, then how about we fight to
the death with our bare hands next?

21:57.360 --> 21:59.220
Wait! Wait! Wait!

21:59.220 --> 22:01.290
Hold on a second!

22:01.290 --> 22:03.310
You can't fight to the death!

22:03.310 --> 22:05.620
Shut up!

22:05.620 --> 22:08.180
Weren't you ordered to
stay away from me?

22:08.180 --> 22:11.810
And you dare enough to sneak on us
since earlier, you scum!

22:11.810 --> 22:14.110
Are you fighting over ohagi?

22:14.110 --> 22:18.570
If so, I can make enough
to fill you up.

22:18.570 --> 22:21.620
You've got to be kidding me!

22:22.330 --> 22:25.040
Huh? No, no, I'm serious!

22:25.040 --> 22:28.250
You love ohagi, don't you?

22:28.250 --> 22:28.520
When I was training at your place,

22:28.520 --> 22:31.220
You bastards! Go back and start over
from the Final Selection!
When I was training at your place,

22:31.220 --> 22:32.580
there was always a faint smell of
mochi and sweet red bean paste.
You bastards! Go back and start over
from the Final Selection!

22:32.580 --> 22:35.100
there was always a faint smell of
mochi and sweet red bean paste.

22:35.100 --> 22:37.060
What a nice smell.

22:39.760 --> 22:43.720
Every time you came back to train us,
I smelled the fragrance of green tea and ohagi.

22:43.720 --> 22:44.970
So I was convinced.

22:46.520 --> 22:51.270
Shinazugawa... You like ohagi?

22:51.270 --> 22:53.890
Ohagi is delicious, right?

22:53.890 --> 22:56.520
Do you prefer it coarse or fine?

22:56.520 --> 22:59.650
I, too, like ohagis made by
my grandmother.

23:08.970 --> 23:11.000
Huh? What the...

23:11.000 --> 23:12.750
Giyu?!

23:13.400 --> 23:17.590
Shinazugawa got angry and
went somewhere else.

23:17.590 --> 23:19.390
I see.

23:19.390 --> 23:22.130
Why were you fighting?

23:22.130 --> 23:25.710
We weren't.
It was part of the Hashira Training.

23:25.710 --> 23:29.140
The Hashiras are sparring
with each other.

23:29.140 --> 23:31.390
Is that so?

23:31.390 --> 23:35.230
Oh! That's why you were
using wooden swords.

23:35.230 --> 23:37.150
Right, I get it now.

23:37.150 --> 23:39.310
Sorry, I interrupted your training.

23:39.310 --> 23:41.790
No, you didn't.

23:41.790 --> 23:44.310
I wasn't able to speak well,

23:44.310 --> 23:47.730
and Shinazugawa was angry
the whole time.

23:47.730 --> 23:51.210
But at least I learned
what his favorite food is.

23:52.040 --> 23:58.180
Next time, I'll keep an ohagi in my pocket
and give it to him when I see him.

23:58.180 --> 24:00.740
Oh! That's a great idea.

24:01.350 --> 24:04.550
I'm sure we can get along that way.

24:04.550 --> 24:06.180
I'll do that too!

24:06.180 --> 24:08.450
Don't do that, you fools.

24:14.440 --> 24:18.190
Where the hell are those guys
slacking off?

24:18.190 --> 24:23.200
Of all times, both Iguro and
Tokito are absent.

24:23.640 --> 24:28.450
Just training with those failures
will make me rusty.

24:28.450 --> 24:30.620
Are you fighting over ohagi?

24:31.580 --> 24:36.630
Tanjiro Kamado.
If that bastard hadn't interfered...

24:37.420 --> 24:39.130
Damn it!

24:39.540 --> 24:41.930
What's with that kid?

24:41.930 --> 24:45.630
He's totally nuts!

25:06.910 --> 25:10.160
The heck is this?

25:20.450 --> 25:22.730
We've been infiltrated.

26:37.000 --> 26:41.380
The flame that burns heaven

26:41.380 --> 26:48.420
Truer than the truth

26:48.420 --> 26:52.470
The voice of prayers and
the sounds of shouting

26:52.470 --> 26:59.100
Are fleeting like winged insects

26:59.100 --> 27:03.730
Why do those who devour lives

27:03.730 --> 27:10.700
Beg mercy as if not knowing impurity

27:10.700 --> 27:16.870
Those souls that win through
the darkness can only reach

27:16.870 --> 27:21.670
Obtain that eternity

27:21.670 --> 27:27.380
There's a feeling here that
doesn't know demise

27:27.380 --> 27:32.680
Speak your dream, you strong one

27:32.680 --> 27:38.350
A resound congratulating
tune of eternity

27:38.350 --> 27:44.100
Into the light that governs the sky

27:44.100 --> 27:48.320
In the corner of the world that is messy

27:48.320 --> 27:52.660
A blade of a sword that
still wriggles and resists

27:52.660 --> 27:58.580
Grovels and struggles miserably

28:04.870 --> 28:15.440
A stain from a worm being smashed
doesn't go away

28:15.440 --> 28:26.920
The only feeling left behind
doesn't ever disappear

28:26.920 --> 28:32.600
It snowslides to the bottom of the end

28:32.600 --> 28:39.810
The world roars at the end of
a frozen future

28:39.810 --> 28:41.200
The lives

28:41.200 --> 28:42.620
The feelings

28:42.620 --> 28:50.540
Live on through an infinite time

28:56.640 --> 29:02.430
Destroy this demise,
burn this destiny

29:02.430 --> 29:07.520
Scatter those powerless ones

29:07.520 --> 29:10.600
Hold eternity down

29:10.600 --> 29:13.400
The dreams of lives

29:13.400 --> 29:19.350
In the light eventually fill the sky

29:27.250 --> 29:33.010
Bow your head and yield the way

29:33.010 --> 29:40.510
Disturb the world

30:46.750 --> 30:49.870
Ah, you have arrived.

30:53.770 --> 30:56.100
This is our first meeting, isn't it?

30:58.180 --> 31:01.530
Muzan Kibutsuji.

31:03.900 --> 31:11.020
What a hideous look you have,
Ubuyashiki.

31:16.650 --> 31:19.820
This time I'll tell you
about Shinazugawa.

31:19.820 --> 31:21.580
What's this about?

31:21.580 --> 31:24.680
What's your business, Kamado?

31:24.680 --> 31:27.370
Well, it's not like I have a business...

31:27.370 --> 31:30.210
If you don't, then get lost!

31:33.370 --> 31:36.020
Let's start our Taisho period secret.

31:36.020 --> 31:39.440
Shinazugawa's hobby is raising
rhinoceros beetles.

31:39.440 --> 31:41.900
And his favorite food is ohagi.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.520
Ohagi?!

31:44.520 --> 31:47.520
Again with the ohagi talk?!

31:48.640 --> 31:51.810
Next up on the last episode:
"Hashiras, Assemble"

31:51.810 --> 31:53.570
Come back here!

31:53.570 --> 31:55.030
(To be continued)
