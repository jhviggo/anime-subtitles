00:06.760 --> 00:08.380
You guys are slow!

00:08.380 --> 00:10.880
Still too slow!
Give it your all!

00:10.880 --> 00:12.630
The sun will set soon!

00:14.760 --> 00:17.720
Swing your arms more
and put your feet forward!

00:18.170 --> 00:19.340
Okay!

00:25.560 --> 00:28.270
Raise your voice more!

00:28.270 --> 00:32.230
To you who is ignorant of
what eternity means

00:32.230 --> 00:35.530
It's time to show you the answer

00:35.530 --> 00:41.830
Beyond the endless spiral

00:57.630 --> 01:01.140
The reason why it sounded like an excuse

01:01.140 --> 01:04.680
A weakness that draws in a fleeting future

01:04.680 --> 01:09.810
You mistake it for strength

01:11.190 --> 01:13.110
So detestable, so detestable

01:13.110 --> 01:14.860
So disgraceful, so disgraceful

01:14.860 --> 01:18.240
The heart that is so bleak

01:18.240 --> 01:20.110
So dark, so dark

01:20.110 --> 01:22.070
That it almost hides the moon

01:22.070 --> 01:25.660
If only you weren't here

01:25.660 --> 01:29.240
It sways and sways

01:29.240 --> 01:32.880
Carrying on its intentions
just like a flower

01:32.880 --> 01:36.240
Taking it all away, taking it all away

01:36.240 --> 01:39.760
It tears the heart just like a storm would

01:39.760 --> 01:43.350
To you who is ignorant of
what eternity means

01:43.350 --> 01:46.890
It's time to show you the answer

01:46.890 --> 01:52.270
Beyond the endless spiral

01:52.270 --> 01:56.400
Who awaits there

02:01.260 --> 02:04.270
(Episode 3: Tanjiro is Fully Recovered
and Taking the Hashira Training!)

02:04.290 --> 02:06.630
One! Two!

02:06.630 --> 02:08.950
Without improving your basic fitness,

02:08.950 --> 02:11.050
you won't be able to move on
to the next stage!

02:11.050 --> 02:12.710
Perfect the basics!

02:12.710 --> 02:13.550
The fundamentals!

02:18.050 --> 02:19.630
If you're this weak,

02:19.630 --> 02:25.310
there's no way you'll be able to
take Shinazugawa and Kanroji's training.

02:25.310 --> 02:26.750
How sloppy.

02:27.310 --> 02:29.670
Forgive me!

02:29.670 --> 02:31.310
Hell...

02:31.310 --> 02:33.560
This is hell.

02:33.560 --> 02:36.060
Even if we get out of here,
another hell is waiting.

02:36.060 --> 02:38.200
Stand up!
Get yourselves together!

02:38.200 --> 02:39.310
Geez...

02:39.310 --> 02:41.740
Uzui!

02:41.740 --> 02:44.910
Well, if it isn't Kamado!

02:44.910 --> 02:47.040
Long time no see!

02:47.910 --> 02:48.900
Likewise.

02:49.520 --> 02:51.060
It's been a while.

02:51.060 --> 02:53.840
I'm glad to see you doing well.

02:54.830 --> 02:57.760
Even if you say so,
look at my state now.

03:00.100 --> 03:03.510
I heard you fought against
the Upper Ranks again.

03:03.510 --> 03:06.440
Lucky you, your body is
still completely intact.

03:06.440 --> 03:09.730
Thanks to you too,
I managed to survive.

03:09.730 --> 03:10.600
You're welcome.

03:10.600 --> 03:14.810
And here, it's time to wake up
that sluggish body of yours!

03:14.810 --> 03:17.130
Yes! I'll do my best!

03:42.530 --> 03:44.010
Oh my!

03:44.010 --> 03:45.560
Heya!

03:45.560 --> 03:46.840
Tanjiro!

03:46.840 --> 03:48.390
Finally, you came.

03:48.390 --> 03:50.650
How have you been, everyone?

03:51.000 --> 03:53.190
Thank you for the last mission.

03:53.190 --> 03:55.570
No need to be so formal.

03:55.570 --> 03:57.740
We're the ones who are grateful.

03:57.740 --> 03:59.650
Your face looks better.

03:59.650 --> 04:01.850
Yup! You've got the face of a man.

04:02.530 --> 04:05.210
You guys need to eat more!

04:06.040 --> 04:09.170
If you don't eat, the afternoon
training will be even harder!

04:10.120 --> 04:14.710
I'll increase the amount of training
for whoever leaves food.

04:14.710 --> 04:16.590
We'll finish the food!

04:17.750 --> 04:19.090
Please give me too.

04:19.090 --> 04:20.130
Here you go!

04:20.130 --> 04:21.800
Eat a lot, okay?

04:21.800 --> 04:24.050
Thank you. I'll eat!

04:24.680 --> 04:29.470
If you don't finish your food,
Sir Tengen will give you extra training!

04:32.360 --> 04:35.420
You have a night patrol duty
tonight, right?

04:35.420 --> 04:36.440
Yeah.

04:36.440 --> 04:37.820
Wanna switch with me?

04:37.820 --> 04:39.640
No way.

04:39.640 --> 04:41.140
If you have night patrol duty,

04:41.140 --> 04:44.260
you're allowed not to take
training in the morning.

04:51.430 --> 04:53.070
Geez...

05:02.880 --> 05:06.640
The demons really haven't
been appearing lately.

05:06.640 --> 05:10.140
Even so, the nights are still
kinda scary though.

05:10.140 --> 05:14.740
I heard the demons are searching
for that Nezuko girl.

05:15.400 --> 05:17.750
It's just speculation.

05:18.650 --> 05:22.380
Because nobody has asked
those demons directly.

05:22.380 --> 05:24.820
Well, that's true, but...

05:24.820 --> 05:29.120
I hope they just stay shut
and disappear like this.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.330
It won't be that easy.

05:31.330 --> 05:35.580
The demon slaying has been
continuing for a thousand years.

05:39.410 --> 05:42.300
Hey, where are you?

05:54.810 --> 05:58.500
They might be appearing
in the back alleys like this.

05:58.500 --> 06:00.570
Don't screw around!

06:00.570 --> 06:02.240
Sorry, sorry.

06:10.480 --> 06:14.530
Don't do that again.
Let's do the patrol properly.

06:14.530 --> 06:15.790
Yeah.

06:27.180 --> 06:28.760
(Four)

06:37.690 --> 06:40.620
All right!
Let's do the next training!

06:40.620 --> 06:42.030
Pair up, a team of two!

06:43.570 --> 06:45.080
Let's go!

06:46.930 --> 06:48.950
So fast!

06:50.620 --> 06:53.950
Come on! Show me what you've got!

07:05.730 --> 07:10.510
Do we need to have that much stamina
to fight the Upper Rank Demons?

07:15.420 --> 07:18.850
The Upper Ranks must
be really strong, huh?

07:18.850 --> 07:21.430
Yeah, they're unbelievably strong.

07:21.430 --> 07:23.190
How was it?

07:23.950 --> 07:25.980
Let me think.

07:25.980 --> 07:29.200
Before I knew it, whump!
I was already on the ground.

07:29.200 --> 07:33.100
I wasn't dead yet and I could react,
but when I stood up again...

07:33.100 --> 07:35.420
And bam! I got attacked again.

07:35.420 --> 07:37.210
Then, it's like, bwooosh!

07:37.500 --> 07:39.870
When my brains didn't get any oxygen...

07:39.870 --> 07:42.340
I know, I know, enough.

07:42.340 --> 07:46.830
There are worlds that we ordinary
people just can't understand.

07:50.590 --> 07:53.100
All right!
It's the last training for today!

07:53.760 --> 07:55.600
Let's see...

07:56.450 --> 07:58.120
Today, it will be that mountain!

07:58.120 --> 08:00.100
Run around that mountain once
and come back!

08:00.100 --> 08:01.100
What?!

08:01.100 --> 08:03.910
Keep dawdling and
you won't get any dinner!

08:05.480 --> 08:08.490
Come on! Run! Get up quickly!

08:08.490 --> 08:11.390
Getting tired just from this
won't make you better!

08:13.700 --> 08:17.210
Sir Tengen seems cruel on the outside.

08:17.210 --> 08:20.210
But he's actually gentle on the inside.

08:20.210 --> 08:25.700
The other day, he didn't even eat
until the last member returned.

08:25.700 --> 08:28.680
In the end, he went all the way to
the mountain to pick up that member.

08:30.710 --> 08:33.110
I can hear it all, you know?

08:34.510 --> 08:40.140
No way I'd crush the Corps members
entrusted to me by the Master.

08:40.140 --> 08:41.740
Right, right.

08:43.040 --> 08:44.500
Well then, I'm going too.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.790
Good. Go and come back pronto.

08:52.320 --> 08:57.260
Those who became Hashiras are
actually kind-hearted deep down.

09:00.370 --> 09:03.420
Mister, give me one more!

09:03.420 --> 09:04.790
All right!

09:05.200 --> 09:07.740
I'm almost at my limit.

09:07.740 --> 09:09.550
But if I don't win this,

09:09.980 --> 09:12.930
I can't keep my promise to the Master.

09:14.680 --> 09:18.010
In order to make Giyu cooperate
with everyone,

09:18.010 --> 09:20.090
I have to do my best.

09:21.550 --> 09:22.890
I order one more.

09:23.680 --> 09:25.020
All right!

09:26.000 --> 09:31.110
You said I have to participate
in the training if I lose.

09:31.110 --> 09:33.780
Does that mean, if I win,
I don't have to participate?

09:35.500 --> 09:37.580
Uh, well...

09:37.580 --> 09:39.200
Here you go.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.570
You too.

09:41.270 --> 09:44.150
Mister, give him one more.

09:44.150 --> 09:45.240
All right!

09:47.330 --> 09:50.880
This is my last portion.

09:50.880 --> 09:56.720
In other words, if you can finish
the next extra portion, you'll win.

09:57.390 --> 10:00.710
With that, I will participate
in the Hashira Training,

10:00.710 --> 10:03.000
and you'll be satisfied, right?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.150
Yes! Glad to hear that!

10:05.730 --> 10:08.120
Then, finish your portions.

10:08.120 --> 10:09.280
I will!

10:10.570 --> 10:14.490
Giyu should be able to eat more, but...

10:16.300 --> 10:20.250
But even so, this is tough.

10:20.250 --> 10:22.330
Really tough!

10:39.800 --> 10:41.620
I'm late.

10:42.370 --> 10:44.960
I also just arrived a moment ago.

10:44.960 --> 10:48.040
So, how's your training
with the members?

10:48.420 --> 10:53.610
I don't think they will be useful when
fighting against the Upper Ranks.

10:55.950 --> 10:58.800
Same here.

10:59.150 --> 11:03.750
Still, nurturing the Corps members
is the Master's will.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.100
Yeah.

11:05.880 --> 11:09.230
Why did you call me at this hour?

11:10.760 --> 11:13.610
I've always been wondering.

11:14.920 --> 11:17.380
That matter in that castle?

11:20.290 --> 11:23.370
We believed that we cornered
those demons.

11:23.370 --> 11:28.060
However, all of them managed to
disappear somewhere.

11:31.240 --> 11:36.780
All those demons,
gone in an instant without a trace.

11:36.780 --> 11:38.210
Yeah.

11:38.740 --> 11:41.810
I've been thinking about it ever since.

11:41.810 --> 11:44.970
What lies beyond that door?

11:45.330 --> 11:50.850
Is it the demons' hideout that
we don't know about?

11:50.850 --> 11:52.980
Hideout, huh?

11:52.980 --> 11:56.170
I've investigated that castle
several times,

11:56.170 --> 11:58.500
but I couldn't find anything.

11:59.110 --> 12:04.550
Right around that time, the demons
in the city suddenly disappeared.

12:04.550 --> 12:08.490
So it's true their target is
Kamado's sister.

12:08.970 --> 12:11.530
There's no doubt.

12:11.530 --> 12:15.500
Something big might be about to start.

12:17.600 --> 12:22.410
No matter what is it, I'll end it all.

12:23.800 --> 12:29.050
For the Demon Slayer Corps,
perhaps this is an omen of misfortune.

12:31.230 --> 12:35.580
Training the slayers keeps
my mind distracted.

12:36.200 --> 12:39.330
When I calmly read the situation,

12:39.330 --> 12:43.130
I can't help but be conscious
of what lies ahead.

12:44.370 --> 12:46.630
This calm could be...

12:48.910 --> 12:52.750
...the calm before the storm.

12:53.230 --> 12:56.290
It's pointless to say whatever it is.

12:57.250 --> 13:00.600
I have a suggestion for you

13:02.050 --> 13:04.840
I have one as well.

13:04.840 --> 13:07.140
Let me say it first.

13:09.430 --> 13:11.630
Fight me!

13:12.270 --> 13:14.260
What a coincidence.

13:14.260 --> 13:17.220
I was about to say that too.

13:21.400 --> 13:22.970
I'll put it here.

13:22.970 --> 13:25.660
Thanks, Tanjiro.

13:26.060 --> 13:27.660
Drink it.

13:27.660 --> 13:29.870
It's high-grade Gyokuro green tea.

13:29.870 --> 13:31.730
Good for relieving fatigue.

13:31.730 --> 13:33.160
I see.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.050
Thank you very much.

13:38.070 --> 13:39.840
It's delicious.

13:39.840 --> 13:44.470
Tanjiro, we wanted to thank you again for
saving us at the Entertainment District.

13:44.470 --> 13:45.780
Thank you.

13:45.780 --> 13:46.440
Eh?

13:46.440 --> 13:48.130
We're really grateful.

13:48.130 --> 13:52.350
Don't be.
It wasn't my strength alone.

13:52.930 --> 13:58.270
You, your sister, the boar boy,
the yellow-head boy...

13:58.270 --> 13:59.980
And of course, Sir Tengen.

14:00.460 --> 14:05.070
If we were less even one person,
we wouldn't be able to see the sun again.

14:06.780 --> 14:09.390
I didn't think Sir Tengen
and the three of us

14:09.390 --> 14:12.310
could come back alive together.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.630
It was truly a miracle.

14:15.870 --> 14:17.280
Hinatsuru.

14:17.280 --> 14:22.050
I'm sure that Sir Tengen actually
still wants to fight.

14:22.370 --> 14:25.800
He often talks in sleep
in the middle of the night.

14:26.420 --> 14:29.920
He's been blaming himself
for withdrawing.

14:30.800 --> 14:35.150
Tanjiro, make sure to defeat
Muzan Kibutsuji.

14:36.350 --> 14:38.810
Yes, I will.

14:44.320 --> 14:47.150
Listen up carefully, all of you!

14:47.150 --> 14:52.030
We're canceling the usual long-distance
run around the mountain for today.

14:52.030 --> 14:56.290
Instead, we'll have a special training
session based on real combat.

14:57.790 --> 15:00.130
Let's head into the mountain!

15:02.920 --> 15:05.780
We always fight demons at night.

15:06.300 --> 15:11.300
That's why we have to improve
our skills to fight in the dark.

15:11.300 --> 15:16.630
Strain your eyes in the darkness,
and sense what you can't see.

15:16.630 --> 15:19.800
I'll be a demon from now on.

15:19.800 --> 15:22.280
A demon who will eat you.

15:23.060 --> 15:25.630
Try to survive against me.

15:26.570 --> 15:28.410
And for you, Kamado.

15:28.410 --> 15:33.000
Your role is to defeat me while
protecting your comrades.

15:45.670 --> 15:48.360
Hey, he's coming! He's close!

16:01.690 --> 16:03.020
I can't see anything!

16:03.570 --> 16:06.080
I expect nothing less from Uzui,
a former ninja.

16:06.080 --> 16:08.250
I can't track his presence by scent.

16:08.900 --> 16:11.820
Where? Where's Uzui?

16:25.170 --> 16:26.840
Uzui!

16:26.840 --> 16:29.170
It... It's impossible.

16:29.170 --> 16:32.050
We can't fight a Hashira.

16:35.230 --> 16:38.010
Are you going to say that too
when fighting a demon?

16:43.600 --> 16:48.770
Uzui, a former Hashira, can see through
any half-baked movements completely!

16:48.770 --> 16:51.950
Gather! Stay close to me!

16:51.950 --> 16:55.170
Back-to-back, and don't leave
any openings!

16:56.510 --> 16:57.660
Slow! You guys are slow!

16:57.660 --> 16:58.530
So slow!

17:03.750 --> 17:06.250
Way to go, Kamado.

17:06.250 --> 17:08.530
This much strength
even though one-handed.

17:08.530 --> 17:10.300
Uzui's really amazing.

17:13.120 --> 17:15.890
Come on! Strike me more!

17:15.890 --> 17:16.960
Okay!

17:21.390 --> 17:23.890
Incredible...

17:24.520 --> 17:27.770
He's going toe-to-toe
with a former Hashira!

17:32.490 --> 17:37.950
So this is the fighting between those who
have survived battles against Upper Ranks.

17:41.550 --> 17:45.280
You've gotten stronger, Kamado.

18:00.030 --> 18:01.220
Everyone!

18:05.310 --> 18:08.250
Finally, it's getting interesting!

18:08.850 --> 18:10.060
Come at me!

18:26.370 --> 18:30.340
You got beaten up against
me who has retired.

18:32.220 --> 18:35.480
Geez, not even pretending to be tough?

18:35.490 --> 18:37.340
We just can't.

18:37.690 --> 18:41.350
Fighting a former Hashira is too much.

18:41.350 --> 18:46.210
Hey, hey, I didn't train you guys
to scare you.

18:46.210 --> 18:47.670
I know!

18:48.350 --> 18:54.860
But I have hope that Hashiras and Kamado can
defeat Upper Ranks or even Muzan Kibutsuji!

18:54.860 --> 18:56.010
Me too.

18:56.010 --> 18:56.720
I agree!

18:56.720 --> 18:57.860
Same here!

18:57.860 --> 19:03.890
We'll do our best so that someday
we can support them, even if just a little!

19:03.890 --> 19:06.370
I'll train and become strong!

19:06.370 --> 19:08.740
We'll become strong!

19:08.740 --> 19:10.290
You guys...

19:23.640 --> 19:28.640
One! Two! One! Two! One! Two!

19:28.640 --> 19:32.600
They will become tougher
in their own way.

19:33.150 --> 19:35.690
You have nothing left to do here.

19:35.690 --> 19:37.240
You can go.

19:37.240 --> 19:38.220
Got it.

19:39.150 --> 19:41.800
Sure, we defeated Upper Ranks.

19:41.800 --> 19:48.880
But nothing's gonna end until
we defeat Muzan Kibutsuji.

19:56.540 --> 19:57.790
I leave it to you.

19:58.760 --> 20:01.390
Okay. I'll definitely defeat him.

20:08.050 --> 20:11.480
Tanjiro, do your best in the next site.

20:12.860 --> 20:16.750
May we meet again in the next
training place, everyone!

20:17.730 --> 20:19.850
Kamado! We trust you!

20:19.850 --> 20:22.330
We'll catch up with you later!

20:24.100 --> 20:26.930
I'm going, and thank you.

20:26.930 --> 20:29.230
Yeah, stay well.

20:33.120 --> 20:34.600
Good luck!

20:34.600 --> 20:36.060
Take care!

20:36.060 --> 20:37.560
See you later!

20:49.900 --> 20:53.490
We've arrived! We've arrived!

20:55.180 --> 20:56.910
Work hard.

21:01.250 --> 21:03.010
I can't take it anymore.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.090
What are you saying?

21:06.090 --> 21:10.370
If you can't do this, you'll get
eaten by demons in no time.

21:11.680 --> 21:13.050
Tokito.

21:24.700 --> 21:29.570
Imagine this is a real combat,
you already died three times.

21:36.330 --> 21:40.710
The flame that burns heaven

21:40.710 --> 21:47.740
Truer than the truth

21:47.740 --> 21:51.790
The voice of prayers and
the sounds of shouting

21:51.790 --> 21:58.420
Are fleeting like winged insects

21:58.420 --> 22:03.050
Why do those who devour lives

22:03.050 --> 22:10.010
Beg mercy as if not knowing impurity

22:10.010 --> 22:16.180
Those souls that win through
the darkness can only reach

22:16.180 --> 22:20.980
Obtain that eternity

22:20.980 --> 22:26.710
There's a feeling here that
doesn't know demise

22:26.710 --> 22:31.890
Speak your dream, you strong one

22:31.890 --> 22:37.680
A resound congratulating
tune of eternity

22:37.680 --> 22:43.420
Into the light that governs the sky

22:43.420 --> 22:47.640
In the corner of the world that is messy

22:47.640 --> 22:51.930
A blade of a sword that
still wriggles and resists

22:51.930 --> 22:57.890
Grovels and struggles miserably

23:02.080 --> 23:04.940
This time I'll tell you about Uzui.

23:04.940 --> 23:07.550
I'm already retired as a Hashira.

23:07.550 --> 23:10.110
If you're gonna introduce me to them,
do it as flamboyantly as possible.

23:10.110 --> 23:10.920
Okay!

23:11.250 --> 23:13.840
Let's start the Taisho period secret.

23:13.840 --> 23:15.710
His hobby is looking for
hidden hot springs.

23:15.710 --> 23:19.300
Apparently, he healed his wounds there after
the battle at the Entertainment District.

23:19.630 --> 23:21.320
So plain.

23:21.320 --> 23:25.160
At least say something like, "He soaked
with his three lovely wives."

23:25.160 --> 23:27.560
I see. I learned something new.

23:27.560 --> 23:31.480
Because I love them more
than anyone in the world!

23:31.480 --> 23:33.440
Sir Tengen!

23:34.260 --> 23:36.350
What a wonderful family.

23:36.350 --> 23:39.150
Next up on Episode 4:
"It Makes You Smile"

23:39.150 --> 23:40.320
(To be continued)
