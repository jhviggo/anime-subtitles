00:03.200 --> 00:06.010
Tanjiro! Long time no see!

00:06.010 --> 00:08.200
Welcome to my mansion!

00:08.200 --> 00:09.870
It's been a while!

00:09.870 --> 00:11.830
Glad to see you looking well!

00:11.830 --> 00:13.710
You too, Tanjiro.

00:13.710 --> 00:16.410
I'll brew some black tea at three!

00:16.410 --> 00:19.770
I'll make pancakes too!
And smear a lot of butter!

00:19.770 --> 00:24.720
Buttah? Pankehki?
And I barely know black tea.

00:24.720 --> 00:30.220
Sweets! Bread! Pancakes!

00:30.800 --> 00:33.110
Here you go!

00:35.600 --> 00:37.450
Enjoy, Tanjiro.

00:37.450 --> 00:40.070
Is there any right way to eat it properly?

00:40.490 --> 00:42.400
Like this...

00:43.300 --> 00:45.660
Tanjiro, say "ahh".

00:46.490 --> 00:47.520
Okay.

00:52.070 --> 00:54.420
How is it, Tanjiro?

00:55.170 --> 00:57.630
It's so delicious,
my cheeks are going to fall off.

00:57.630 --> 01:00.000
It's super duper tasty, right?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.420
Yes, totally!

01:01.420 --> 01:05.310
Tanjiro, after you eat,
could you change into this?

01:05.920 --> 01:09.890
To you who is ignorant of
what eternity means

01:09.890 --> 01:13.180
It's time to show you the answer

01:13.180 --> 01:19.470
Beyond the endless spiral

01:35.290 --> 01:38.790
The reason why it sounded like an excuse

01:38.790 --> 01:42.340
A weakness that draws in a fleeting future

01:42.340 --> 01:47.470
You mistake it for strength

01:48.840 --> 01:50.760
So detestable, so detestable

01:50.760 --> 01:52.510
So disgraceful, so disgraceful

01:52.510 --> 01:55.890
The heart that is so bleak

01:55.890 --> 01:57.770
So dark, so dark

01:57.770 --> 01:59.730
That it almost hides the moon

01:59.730 --> 02:03.320
If only you weren't here

02:03.320 --> 02:06.900
It sways and sways

02:06.900 --> 02:10.530
Carrying on its intentions
just like a flower

02:10.530 --> 02:13.910
Taking it all away, taking it all away

02:13.910 --> 02:17.410
It tears the heart just like a storm would

02:17.410 --> 02:21.000
To you who is ignorant of
what eternity means

02:21.000 --> 02:24.550
It's time to show you the answer

02:24.550 --> 02:29.930
Beyond the endless spiral

02:29.930 --> 02:34.050
Who awaits there

02:41.570 --> 02:42.890
Ossu!

02:42.890 --> 02:46.140
All right, everyone, move in sync!

02:46.140 --> 02:48.310
Reach out your hands!

02:48.310 --> 02:50.480
Jump high!

02:51.070 --> 02:53.380
Now, do a quick spin!

02:57.820 --> 03:02.640
To enhance the sharpness of your techniques,
flexibility training is very important.

03:03.240 --> 03:06.490
Let's stretch, stretch,
and stretch some more!

03:08.320 --> 03:10.500
No, no, not like that!

03:10.950 --> 03:13.750
Could you step aside?
I'll show you an example.

03:16.260 --> 03:17.900
Ready?

03:21.460 --> 03:22.680
Keep it up!

03:23.430 --> 03:26.500
It's more brute-force training
than stretching.

03:26.500 --> 03:27.330
Come here!

03:27.330 --> 03:28.260
Huh?

03:28.260 --> 03:30.550
Tanjiro, you do it as well.

03:30.550 --> 03:31.890
What?!

03:32.330 --> 03:34.030
Are you ready?

03:34.030 --> 03:35.400
Let's start!

03:35.400 --> 03:37.480
Flexibility training...

03:38.070 --> 03:39.480
...is hell!

03:46.580 --> 03:51.760
Tanjiro Kamado,
I've been waiting for you.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.710
(Episode 5: I Even Ate a Demon)

03:59.120 --> 04:00.080
I'm looking forward—

04:00.080 --> 04:01.900
Shut up or I'll kill you.

04:01.900 --> 04:02.670
Huh?

04:03.150 --> 04:06.880
Kanroji told me about you.

04:06.880 --> 04:12.180
It seems you had quite a fun time
training with her.

04:12.180 --> 04:13.350
Huh?

04:14.640 --> 04:17.520
Enjoyable training, indeed.

04:17.520 --> 04:20.480
You got a letter from Lady Kanroji.

04:23.200 --> 04:25.840
How are you, Iguro?

04:25.840 --> 04:30.120
Today, I had tea with Tanjiro
after training.

04:30.740 --> 04:36.190
Tanjiro's cheeks almost fall off when
he eats or drinks something sweet.

04:36.190 --> 04:37.960
He's so cute.

04:39.520 --> 04:42.540
Kamado...

04:44.900 --> 04:49.180
I won't go easy on you as Kanroji did.

04:49.590 --> 04:53.180
I just arrived and he totally hates me.

04:53.490 --> 04:56.190
I've prepared your training.

05:03.650 --> 05:09.530
You have to swing your swords
while avoiding these obstacles.

05:10.210 --> 05:12.660
It's to improve your swordsmanship.

05:13.210 --> 05:16.770
I see, and this place...

05:17.780 --> 05:19.270
Is this an execution chamber?

05:20.250 --> 05:24.920
Did these people who are tied up
commit any crimes?

05:24.920 --> 05:27.470
Well, yeah.

05:27.890 --> 05:29.400
The crime of being weak.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.160
The crime of not learning.

05:31.160 --> 05:33.180
The crime of wasting my time.

05:33.180 --> 05:34.840
The crime of irritating me.

05:34.840 --> 05:36.730
They did those crimes.

05:37.130 --> 05:39.840
Oh dear, this is gonna be bad.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.630
You'll use this.

05:43.070 --> 05:46.570
I'll show you how to do it once.

05:56.760 --> 05:58.240
That's all.

05:59.190 --> 06:04.090
He can swing his sword accurately
between the members at that speed.

06:04.740 --> 06:06.590
Your turn.

06:09.260 --> 06:10.950
Don't hit me.

06:11.510 --> 06:13.260
- Don't hit me.
- Don't hit me.

06:14.010 --> 06:16.470
- Don't hit me. Don't hit me.
- Don't hit me. Don't hit me.

06:16.470 --> 06:18.520
Please don't hit us!

06:20.370 --> 06:21.870
Do it quickly!

06:21.870 --> 06:23.020
Okay!

06:34.780 --> 06:36.790
Ridiculous.

06:36.790 --> 06:39.490
How can you say that a training?

06:42.610 --> 06:44.920
I'll spar with you.

06:45.770 --> 06:47.670
Attack me.

06:48.250 --> 06:49.730
Attack...

06:50.490 --> 06:51.800
Got it!

06:53.800 --> 06:55.390
Don't hit me!

06:59.730 --> 07:01.730
You're hesitating.

07:03.880 --> 07:06.400
This won't do anything.

07:08.760 --> 07:09.900
Here I go.

07:10.650 --> 07:12.400
Even in tight spaces,

07:12.730 --> 07:14.410
I have to strike precisely.

07:16.210 --> 07:17.580
Slow.

07:18.850 --> 07:20.030
This is no good.

07:20.030 --> 07:23.290
When dealing with Iguro, I must not
concerned with the Corps members.

07:23.930 --> 07:27.280
Get up. Let's start over.

07:28.920 --> 07:31.920
A dreadful training begins.

07:32.340 --> 07:36.430
Even though I'm using wooden swords,
getting hit will still cause injury.

07:36.430 --> 07:36.440
Iguro's attacks come between
these poor Corps members.

07:36.440 --> 07:41.180
Don't hit me...
Iguro's attacks come between
these poor Corps members.

07:41.180 --> 07:43.140
This is really bad!
Don't hit me...

07:43.140 --> 07:47.940
Because his swordsmanship
bends in unusual ways!
Don't hit me...

07:47.940 --> 07:47.950
Don't hit me...

07:50.020 --> 07:51.650
Slow.

07:52.060 --> 07:56.910
He's using the same wooden sword,
so why is it able to bend?

07:57.510 --> 08:00.990
His attacks slither through narrow gaps.

08:01.460 --> 08:03.080
Just like a snake.

08:03.490 --> 08:05.040
Furthermore,

08:05.040 --> 08:10.550
I can hear their inner voices when
I aim at the gaps between them.

08:10.550 --> 08:13.550
Please! Please! Please!
Please don't hit me!

08:13.880 --> 08:16.510
They're pleading not to hit them.

08:16.510 --> 08:20.060
This is truly mentally taxing to hear.

08:21.170 --> 08:23.390
Don't hesitate, you trash.

08:23.850 --> 08:27.970
My hands are trembling with
tension I'd never felt before.

08:27.970 --> 08:32.490
If I can't swing my sword precisely,
it'll be a disaster.

08:33.730 --> 08:35.530
Oh no! Sorry!

08:44.130 --> 08:49.370
Kamado, how can you still do it
after all that training with the Hashira?

08:54.220 --> 08:59.140
I don't want to cause trouble...
for everyone.

09:03.300 --> 09:05.800
I guess, we have to do it as well.

09:06.340 --> 09:08.100
You're right.

09:14.740 --> 09:18.000
I bet this is going to sting the wounds.

09:19.240 --> 09:21.240
It's definitely gonna hurt.

09:22.210 --> 09:23.880
Ready, guys?

09:23.880 --> 09:25.020
Okay, let's soak in.

09:25.020 --> 09:26.240
Yeah.

09:26.240 --> 09:28.310
All together...

09:28.310 --> 09:30.020
One, two, and...

09:34.840 --> 09:37.010
It stings!

09:37.570 --> 09:39.510
(Day Two)

09:41.930 --> 09:43.600
Slow.

09:44.130 --> 09:47.410
There's no point in training
if you're that slow.

09:47.410 --> 09:48.330
Understood!

09:51.970 --> 09:54.690
Why would you slow down your stride?

09:57.440 --> 10:00.200
It stings!

10:00.760 --> 10:02.950
(Day Three)

10:03.400 --> 10:04.530
Slow.

10:05.250 --> 10:06.160
Slow!

10:07.110 --> 10:08.910
Too slow!

10:10.280 --> 10:14.620
Damn it. It stings...

10:16.720 --> 10:19.930
(Day Four)

10:20.340 --> 10:23.300
What's the matter?
Are you just running, slowpoke?

10:27.930 --> 10:31.440
I have to focus only on
my sparring with Iguro.

10:31.800 --> 10:32.880
In real combat,

10:32.880 --> 10:35.800
if your sword gets caught in
a tree or a rock, it could be fatal.

10:36.320 --> 10:41.170
It's the same as swinging the sword
while avoiding obstacles.

10:52.330 --> 10:56.880
Now my swordsmanship's able to strike
more precisely than ever before.

11:03.510 --> 11:05.720
Dodge Iguro's attacks...

11:08.180 --> 11:11.020
...so I can attack him back!

11:16.860 --> 11:18.070
My attack hit him.

11:21.270 --> 11:24.570
When my attack cut
the hem of Iguro's haori,

11:25.450 --> 11:28.110
he said my training was over.

11:29.720 --> 11:31.750
Thank you very much!

11:32.050 --> 11:33.780
Get the hell out of here.

11:33.780 --> 11:36.370
Just die already, you piece of trash.

11:36.370 --> 11:39.630
Stop talking too friendly with Kanroji.

11:40.010 --> 11:43.650
It's sad to be hated until the end.

11:43.650 --> 11:44.970
But why?

11:48.340 --> 11:49.970
Umm...

11:49.970 --> 11:52.770
Was Shinazugawa's dojo this way?

11:52.770 --> 11:53.860
You're wrong!

11:53.860 --> 11:56.980
Turn right at that corner,
you bird-brain!

11:57.360 --> 11:59.480
I see. Turn right there.

12:03.940 --> 12:05.450
Zenitsu?!

12:05.450 --> 12:10.060
He... Help me escape, Tanjiro!
Tanjiro, I beg you!

12:10.060 --> 12:11.950
Escape from what?

12:11.950 --> 12:14.480
I can't stand on my feet anymore!
It's impossible!

12:14.480 --> 12:16.880
I... I've finally managed to
escape this far!

12:17.300 --> 12:21.460
I crawled over the walls and
disappeared like a gecko!

12:21.460 --> 12:25.090
My life is in danger!
I'm gonna get killed!

12:32.310 --> 12:37.810
Choose one.
Back to training or get killed by me.

12:37.810 --> 12:41.540
No! Have mercy!

12:41.540 --> 12:43.150
Calm down.

12:43.150 --> 12:46.150
Nah... No! Nuoooh!

12:46.150 --> 12:47.300
Shut up!

12:49.970 --> 12:51.120
Carry him

12:51.120 --> 12:52.740
Oh, okay.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.630
Sorry, Zenitsu.

12:55.630 --> 12:57.870
Let's do our best together.

12:59.180 --> 13:00.740
Long time no see.

13:00.740 --> 13:03.320
I'll join your training today.

13:03.320 --> 13:05.040
I'm looking forward to it!

13:07.090 --> 13:09.200
Don't get carried away.

13:10.250 --> 13:13.890
Listen, I don't acknowledge you.

13:13.890 --> 13:15.770
That's totally fine.

13:15.770 --> 13:18.470
I don't acknowledge you either.

13:18.470 --> 13:20.520
You stabbed Nezuko, after all.

13:28.790 --> 13:31.270
He's got the nerve.

13:49.020 --> 13:51.130
Shinazugawa's training was so harsh,

13:51.130 --> 13:54.710
that I understand why Zenitsu
became like that.

13:54.710 --> 13:59.800
It was a simple striking training where
we could attack Shinazugawa.

14:00.140 --> 14:01.640
We vomited...

14:03.040 --> 14:05.640
...and passed out.

14:06.060 --> 14:08.810
It continued without rest, to boot.

14:09.470 --> 14:12.420
Even Iguro gave us breaks.

14:14.240 --> 14:19.020
When Zenitsu woke up, he blamed me
as if I had killed his parents.

14:19.020 --> 14:20.990
You dumb!

14:20.990 --> 14:23.040
Ouchie... Sorry.

14:24.120 --> 14:27.580
Shinazugawa was especially hard on me.

14:27.580 --> 14:29.640
If I let my guard down
for even a second,

14:29.640 --> 14:32.780
I'll get seriously injured and
end up back in recovery.

14:34.460 --> 14:37.210
This is too much for a first day.

14:38.840 --> 14:41.470
I'm a mess and covered in vomit.

14:41.800 --> 14:44.010
I'm about to lose confidence.

14:44.010 --> 14:46.190
Wait, Big Bro!

14:46.190 --> 14:47.720
Genya's voice?

14:49.750 --> 14:52.100
I want to speak with you.

14:52.990 --> 14:55.280
Quit bothering me.

14:55.280 --> 14:58.330
I don't have a brother.

15:00.850 --> 15:04.730
If you don't knock it off, I'll kill you.

15:11.670 --> 15:14.580
It's so different from the sibling
quarrels in my family.

15:14.970 --> 15:17.070
Wanna give up?

15:17.070 --> 15:19.590
Please don't, Big Bro!

15:20.310 --> 15:24.090
Don't talk all friendly to me!

15:26.460 --> 15:31.810
And from what I've seen,
you have no talent.

15:31.810 --> 15:34.160
Just quit the Demon Slayer Corps.

15:34.160 --> 15:38.930
Someone who can't use breathing techniques
shouldn't call himself a swordsman.

15:38.930 --> 15:40.360
But I...

15:43.130 --> 15:45.660
Wait, Big Bro!

15:45.660 --> 15:49.420
I've always wanted to apologize to you.

15:49.420 --> 15:52.160
Do your best, Genya.
You can do it.

15:52.740 --> 15:56.960
I don't care, seriously. Get lost.

15:59.930 --> 16:02.710
But I...

16:03.140 --> 16:05.060
I even ate a demon...

16:06.680 --> 16:08.640
...to fight until this point.

16:13.960 --> 16:15.460
What?

16:16.880 --> 16:18.790
What did you say?

16:20.790 --> 16:24.580
You said, you ate...

16:31.690 --> 16:33.750
...a demon?

16:36.480 --> 16:37.250
He disappea—

16:37.250 --> 16:38.000
Genya!

16:46.510 --> 16:49.930
How many more days
is this gonna continue?

16:55.310 --> 16:57.110
He's back! He's back!

16:57.110 --> 16:59.010
That heartless man is back!

16:59.010 --> 17:01.550
Get down! Pretend to be passed out!

17:04.460 --> 17:06.900
Huh? Tanjiro?

17:06.900 --> 17:09.900
Eh? He's gonna kill you, Tanjiro!

17:09.900 --> 17:12.620
Why did you destroy the building?

17:13.100 --> 17:14.710
Please stop!

17:19.550 --> 17:23.130
What is this twisted and ominous sound?

17:29.300 --> 17:31.100
That dude is on a rampage, right?!

17:31.100 --> 17:33.970
Are we gonna get beaten
outside the training?!

17:34.370 --> 17:37.600
What are you doing?
Do you want to kill Genya?!

17:38.340 --> 17:41.040
Of course not.

17:41.040 --> 17:45.440
Killing him would be easy,
but it's against the Corps' rules.

17:45.940 --> 17:48.800
I'll make him unable to recover.

17:48.800 --> 17:54.450
However, I'll forgive him if
he quits the Corps right now.

17:54.450 --> 17:56.040
You must be joking!

17:56.040 --> 17:58.690
You don't have the right to do that!

17:58.690 --> 18:00.580
You can't force him to quit!

18:00.920 --> 18:03.860
Didn't you say earlier that
you don't have a brother?

18:03.860 --> 18:06.880
Then, don't interfere with
whatever Genya chooses!

18:06.880 --> 18:11.840
Whether he has talent or not,
he decided to risk his life to fight demons!

18:11.840 --> 18:16.180
If you say you're not his older brother,
I won't let you interfere with Genya!

18:16.590 --> 18:19.760
Without Genya, we wouldn't have
defeated the Upper Ranks Demons!

18:20.810 --> 18:24.560
I won't let you hurt him beyond recovery!

18:25.990 --> 18:27.490
You're done?

18:29.180 --> 18:32.660
Then, I'll make you beyond recovery first!

18:36.400 --> 18:38.870
Okay... here he comes.

18:43.260 --> 18:44.500
Tanjiro!

18:45.640 --> 18:46.750
This brat...

18:47.770 --> 18:49.280
...stopped my punch.

18:53.060 --> 18:55.550
He kicked him!

18:57.580 --> 19:01.140
Zenitsu! Please get Genya out of here!

19:01.140 --> 19:03.160
Hey! You stupid!

19:03.160 --> 19:05.070
Moron! Don't say my name!
You fool!

19:05.070 --> 19:07.150
Give a better signal!

19:07.150 --> 19:08.320
Tanjiro!

19:13.360 --> 19:16.280
His kick cut my ear even if
it just grazed a little.

19:16.870 --> 19:20.020
You've got some nerve!

19:20.600 --> 19:22.290
Since you want to die,

19:22.290 --> 19:25.290
so I'll kill you like you want!

19:25.290 --> 19:28.660
Wait, Big Bro!
Tanjiro has nothing to do with this!

19:28.660 --> 19:30.130
Let's escape!

19:30.720 --> 19:32.670
Who are you? Let go of me!

19:32.670 --> 19:34.860
It's best to separate people
who are arguing!

19:34.860 --> 19:36.140
You have to get some distance!

19:36.480 --> 19:39.810
That guy's your older brother?
He's a total freak!

19:39.810 --> 19:41.060
I pity you.

19:41.600 --> 19:44.060
Don't insult my brother!

19:44.060 --> 19:46.060
I'm on your side!

19:46.060 --> 19:48.060
Die, Brat!

19:50.180 --> 19:54.320
After that, the situation
became a just big mess.

19:54.900 --> 19:57.770
The brawl continued until nearly evening.

19:58.660 --> 20:01.220
Fool! Moron!

20:01.220 --> 20:01.250
I received an official scolding
from the top brass.

20:01.250 --> 20:04.420
Now you understand why
I called you a bird-brain?
I received an official scolding
from the top brass.

20:04.420 --> 20:04.450
Not only my training with
the Wind Hashira was suspended,
Now you understand why
I called you a bird-brain?

20:04.450 --> 20:07.280
Not only my training with
the Wind Hashira was suspended,

20:07.280 --> 20:09.980
I've been ordered to refrain
from approaching him.

20:13.290 --> 20:15.110
At the end of the day,

20:16.270 --> 20:20.660
I was unable to reconcile
the Shinazugawa brothers

20:23.930 --> 20:27.550
I didn't mean for this to happen.

20:27.550 --> 20:29.890
The mark isn't clear.

20:29.890 --> 20:32.900
The training isn't bearing fruit.

20:32.900 --> 20:34.720
Actually, it is.

20:34.720 --> 20:37.250
You can even toe-to-toe
with that Wind Dude.

20:37.250 --> 20:38.660
You're amazing.

20:38.660 --> 20:40.120
Is that so?

20:40.120 --> 20:42.960
Anyway, why is the Stone Hashira's
house so deep in the mountains?!

20:42.960 --> 20:44.220
This is just so stupid!

20:44.220 --> 20:46.160
I think we're almost there.

20:47.190 --> 20:48.960
What's wrong, Zenitsu?

20:48.960 --> 20:51.040
I can hear something.

20:51.760 --> 20:53.120
This way.

20:56.250 --> 20:57.640
This place...

20:57.640 --> 20:59.050
A waterfall!

21:01.660 --> 21:02.810
Someone's there.

21:05.430 --> 21:11.190
Nyo-Ze-Ga-Mon Ichi-Ji-Butsu-Zai
Sha-Ei-Koku Gi-Ju-Gi...

21:14.050 --> 21:17.450
If you clear your heart and mind,

21:18.140 --> 21:20.950
even fire feels cool.

21:25.370 --> 21:28.980
Welcome to my training ground.

21:35.930 --> 21:40.310
The flame that burns heaven

21:40.310 --> 21:47.350
Truer than the truth

21:47.350 --> 21:51.400
The voice of prayers and
the sounds of shouting

21:51.400 --> 21:58.030
Are fleeting like winged insects

21:58.030 --> 22:02.660
Why do those who devour lives

22:02.660 --> 22:09.630
Beg mercy as if not knowing impurity

22:09.630 --> 22:15.800
Those souls that win through
the darkness can only reach

22:15.800 --> 22:20.600
Obtain that eternity

22:20.600 --> 22:26.310
There's a feeling here that
doesn't know demise

22:26.310 --> 22:31.610
Speak your dream, you strong one

22:31.610 --> 22:37.280
A resound congratulating
tune of eternity

22:37.280 --> 22:43.030
Into the light that governs the sky

22:43.030 --> 22:47.250
In the corner of the world that is messy

22:47.250 --> 22:51.590
A blade of a sword that
still wriggles and resists

22:51.590 --> 22:57.510
Grovels and struggles miserably

23:01.650 --> 23:04.210
This time I'll tell you about Iguro.

23:04.210 --> 23:06.040
You're still here?

23:06.040 --> 23:08.700
Don't tell me you're here
to bother Kanroji again.

23:08.700 --> 23:12.020
No, it's not!
But it's the Taisho period secret.

23:12.020 --> 23:14.900
Hmph, just get on with it.

23:15.250 --> 23:18.030
Here we go, the Taisho period secret.

23:18.030 --> 23:21.910
The name of the snake Iguro carries
is Kaburamaru.

23:21.910 --> 23:25.920
Apparently, his eyes have
different colors from birth.

23:25.920 --> 23:28.500
Finished? Then get lost.

23:28.500 --> 23:30.540
Don't get too close to Kanroji.

23:30.540 --> 23:31.920
Well, but...

23:31.920 --> 23:34.920
Planning to get close to her?

23:35.870 --> 23:38.680
Next up on Episode 6:
"The Strongest in the Demon Slayer Corps"

23:38.680 --> 23:39.930
(To be continued)
