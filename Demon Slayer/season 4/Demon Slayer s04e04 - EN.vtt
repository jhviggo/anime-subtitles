WEBVTT

00:00.500 --> 00:03.590
We've arrived! We've arrived!

00:04.210 --> 00:05.860
Work hard.

00:10.070 --> 00:11.740
I can't take it anymore.

00:13.340 --> 00:14.890
What are you saying?

00:14.890 --> 00:19.130
If you can't do this, you'll get
eaten by demons in no time.

00:20.560 --> 00:21.930
Tokito.

00:33.510 --> 00:38.430
Imagine this is a real combat,
you already died three times.

00:39.130 --> 00:43.090
To you who is ignorant of
what eternity means

00:43.090 --> 00:46.380
It's time to show you the answer

00:46.380 --> 00:52.680
Beyond the endless spiral

01:08.490 --> 01:11.990
The reason why it sounded like an excuse

01:11.990 --> 01:15.540
A weakness that draws in a fleeting future

01:15.540 --> 01:20.670
You mistake it for strength

01:22.040 --> 01:23.960
So detestable, so detestable

01:23.960 --> 01:25.710
So disgraceful, so disgraceful

01:25.710 --> 01:29.080
The heart that is so bleak

01:29.080 --> 01:30.970
So dark, so dark

01:30.970 --> 01:32.930
That it almost hides the moon

01:32.930 --> 01:36.520
If only you weren't here

01:36.520 --> 01:40.100
It sways and sways

01:40.100 --> 01:43.730
Carrying on its intentions
just like a flower

01:43.730 --> 01:47.110
Taking it all away, taking it all away

01:47.110 --> 01:50.610
It tears the heart just like a storm would

01:50.610 --> 01:54.200
To you who is ignorant of
what eternity means

01:54.200 --> 01:57.750
It's time to show you the answer

01:57.750 --> 02:03.130
Beyond the endless spiral

02:03.130 --> 02:07.260
Who awaits there

02:12.550 --> 02:15.080
(Episode 4: "It Makes You Smile")

02:15.700 --> 02:18.320
Even if you get hit, move quickly.

02:18.320 --> 02:20.340
Get back to your stance immediately.

02:28.590 --> 02:31.430
Keep up with me.

02:41.250 --> 02:43.750
You died again.

02:44.400 --> 02:48.700
Remember, don't stop even if
someone gets killed.

02:53.140 --> 02:55.970
Once you stop, you'll also get killed.

03:00.720 --> 03:03.340
Tanjiro! I've been waiting for you.

03:03.840 --> 03:05.640
You seem well.

03:06.340 --> 03:09.120
Hmph! You guys are useless!

03:09.120 --> 03:11.720
I hope you get eaten by demons and die!

03:12.390 --> 03:13.750
This crow again.

03:13.750 --> 03:16.350
What are you looking at?
You small fries!

03:16.350 --> 03:22.110
It's Tokito's Kasugai Crow.
She's rude as always.

03:22.110 --> 03:23.520
You're annoying.

03:23.520 --> 03:24.670
Shoo-shoo!

03:24.670 --> 03:27.110
Huh?! Shut up!

03:27.110 --> 03:28.630
I'll peck your eyeballs out!

03:28.630 --> 03:31.450
Oh, Tokito, long time no see.

03:31.450 --> 03:33.990
I look forward to training with you.

03:34.510 --> 03:37.400
Likewise, Tanjiro.

03:37.400 --> 03:39.540
Follow me for a moment.

03:39.540 --> 03:42.290
Be mindful and save the water!

03:42.290 --> 03:43.850
You're annoying!

03:43.850 --> 03:44.680
What?!

03:46.580 --> 03:47.970
I'm coming in.

03:48.790 --> 03:50.970
If it isn't Sir Tokito.

03:51.500 --> 03:52.930
Kanamori?

03:53.560 --> 03:56.430
Oh! You're here too, Tanjiro?

03:56.970 --> 04:00.760
Looks like you've now recovered.
It's good to see you.

04:00.760 --> 04:02.910
Yes, thank you.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.910
But why are you here?

04:04.910 --> 04:07.530
It was me who called him.

04:10.490 --> 04:13.120
Tanjiro, can you hold this for me?

04:18.100 --> 04:21.740
Step back a bit and
point the blade this way.

04:22.730 --> 04:23.790
Like this?

04:25.140 --> 04:27.280
Keep at it.

04:36.840 --> 04:38.030
How is it?

04:39.810 --> 04:42.190
It's so sharp!

04:42.720 --> 04:46.190
That's the reason why
I called Kanamori here.

04:46.580 --> 04:49.230
So, you're here to...

04:49.230 --> 04:53.820
Right. I'm staying permanently
to take care of his sword.

04:54.190 --> 04:59.560
I want my sword always in the best
condition for upcoming battles.

04:59.560 --> 05:04.960
When I told the Master that,
he said I could do as I pleased.

05:05.790 --> 05:07.630
The Master...

05:08.210 --> 05:12.690
And he even provided a place
specifically for sharpening swords.

05:13.630 --> 05:18.170
I wish he would pay attention to
his own health.

05:19.680 --> 05:23.580
He always prioritizes us the most.

05:24.590 --> 05:27.030
We can't thank him enough.

05:36.550 --> 05:37.950
Too many openings.

05:37.950 --> 05:39.620
Pick up your wooden sword.

05:51.960 --> 05:57.100
Do you think you can defeat your opponent
if you attack based on emotions?

05:57.100 --> 06:00.810
If anything, you'd be like
a moth flying into the fire.

06:01.820 --> 06:04.560
There are no do-overs in a fight
against the demons.

06:05.190 --> 06:10.360
Even if you win nine times and lose once,
that one loss costs you your life.

06:10.690 --> 06:16.320
You must hone every single move
to survive.

06:18.960 --> 06:21.330
Let's call it for today.

06:24.960 --> 06:26.170
Are you okay?

06:26.170 --> 06:27.980
You hurt?

06:29.280 --> 06:35.340
Hey, Kamado. Can you ask him
to ease up on the training a bit?

06:35.920 --> 06:39.090
At this rate, we'll collapse before
we even get to fight any demons.

06:40.670 --> 06:46.290
But I think Tokito is the one
having it the hardest.

06:46.290 --> 06:51.230
You see, he's been training us
alone this whole time.

06:51.230 --> 06:52.310
Make sense.

06:52.310 --> 06:53.730
Right?

06:56.990 --> 06:58.750
Need a hand towel?

06:59.320 --> 07:00.490
Thank you.

07:00.490 --> 07:04.270
If only he could soften the way he speaks.

07:04.270 --> 07:06.520
His words cut really deep.

07:06.520 --> 07:08.210
Yeah, totally.

07:08.560 --> 07:13.710
Actually, I feel his tone has softened
compared to before.

07:13.710 --> 07:14.970
For real?

07:14.970 --> 07:16.470
It's over for us.

07:19.340 --> 07:20.680
Tokito?

07:21.360 --> 07:22.910
Where is he going?

07:24.090 --> 07:26.850
He always goes out somewhere at night.

07:27.330 --> 07:30.030
Maybe he's having dinner?

08:12.370 --> 08:15.040
(Four)

08:34.930 --> 08:38.520
Wind Breathing, Fourth Form:

08:39.640 --> 08:41.890
Rising Dust Storm!

08:42.440 --> 08:45.360
Serpent Breathing, Fifth Form:

08:45.760 --> 08:47.860
Slithering Serpent.

08:53.310 --> 08:54.570
We're evenly matched.

08:54.570 --> 08:56.750
Seems so.

08:58.660 --> 09:01.040
Let me join too.

09:01.840 --> 09:03.400
Tokito?

09:04.040 --> 09:07.640
You come all the way out here every day.

09:07.640 --> 09:10.550
Is your training during the day
doing fine?

09:10.880 --> 09:14.240
The training might be enough
for the other members,

09:14.240 --> 09:16.680
but not for me.

09:16.680 --> 09:18.660
Understandable.

09:18.660 --> 09:23.520
For us, this is the real Hashira Training.

09:23.860 --> 09:27.020
That's it. It's unfair
only the two of you get to do it.

09:27.870 --> 09:31.460
All right, in honor of your coming,

09:31.460 --> 09:36.250
Shinazugawa and I
will take you on together.

09:36.840 --> 09:38.030
Let's get started.

09:38.390 --> 09:41.040
Both of you against me?
How unfair.

09:41.830 --> 09:44.580
Anytime, I'm ready!

10:01.560 --> 10:04.180
Good! Beat them both!

10:04.530 --> 10:06.660
You're the best!

10:06.660 --> 10:08.100
Shut up!

10:11.980 --> 10:14.270
Today's training really hit hard.

10:14.900 --> 10:18.740
If I let my guard down even a little,
I might get seriously injured.

10:19.140 --> 10:23.360
Otherwise, there's no point in training.

10:23.360 --> 10:25.990
During the day,
sparring with the other members.

10:25.990 --> 10:29.260
And at night,
a real combat training with you guys.

10:30.260 --> 10:32.210
Not bad.

10:32.840 --> 10:36.840
Tokito, how's your training today?

10:37.700 --> 10:40.550
Tanjiro came to my place today.

10:41.180 --> 10:45.430
That guy, huh?
So he's still hanging in there.

10:45.750 --> 10:48.460
His wounds seem to be healing.

10:48.460 --> 10:53.400
Maybe he'll be fully recovered by the time
he comes to your place, Iguro.

10:54.020 --> 10:55.890
I see.

10:55.890 --> 11:00.570
That means I can go all out
to train him, then?

11:01.240 --> 11:03.770
Even if he's gotten a bit stronger,

11:03.770 --> 11:08.370
I'll show him that he's still
nowhere near Hashira's level.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.380
That sounds fun.

11:12.570 --> 11:15.360
Do your best, Tanjiro.

11:21.540 --> 11:23.760
There, you died.

11:25.900 --> 11:28.430
You stopped moving.

11:30.780 --> 11:33.200
There, you also died.

11:39.330 --> 11:42.870
It seems there's not enough tension.

11:43.420 --> 11:46.990
How about using real swords?

11:48.750 --> 11:50.870
Bring the real swords.

11:50.870 --> 11:52.460
O... Okay!

11:57.630 --> 12:00.170
Let's begin.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.220
But...

12:03.630 --> 12:04.830
Take your stance.

12:05.850 --> 12:08.470
I can't... I can't do it.

12:09.230 --> 12:10.340
Come on.

12:31.370 --> 12:32.550
Tokito, if you continueâ€”

12:32.550 --> 12:33.670
I'm sorry!

12:46.490 --> 12:50.890
You didn't attack recklessly.
Consider that's a progress.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.920
I understand.

12:54.920 --> 12:56.760
Compared to you,

12:56.760 --> 13:00.240
I can't possibly comprehend
how hard to fight in a battle.

13:00.240 --> 13:03.960
I know that you go somewhere
every night

13:03.960 --> 13:07.660
and return covered in bruises
beneath your clothes.

13:08.070 --> 13:11.830
I saw you cooling your wounds at dawn.

13:12.830 --> 13:16.580
We'll work harder, so...

13:19.090 --> 13:22.120
You're doing good in your own way.

13:22.120 --> 13:25.360
But that doesn't guarantee victory.

13:26.320 --> 13:30.500
I don't want you guys to
be killed by demons.

13:32.170 --> 13:35.600
I want all of you to live long
if possible.

13:35.600 --> 13:38.020
That's what I really hope.

13:39.020 --> 13:40.590
Tokito...

13:45.900 --> 13:49.490
Good, Tanjiro.
You're faster than before.

13:55.310 --> 14:00.050
Make your muscles' transition between
tense and relaxed even smoother.

14:02.240 --> 14:03.310
Good!

14:06.680 --> 14:08.260
Yes, like that!

14:10.110 --> 14:13.270
If you do so,
your stamina will last longer.

14:26.100 --> 14:29.620
The movement of your legs and hips
flows perfectly.

14:30.350 --> 14:34.200
You can go to the next Hashira, Tanjiro.

14:34.200 --> 14:36.430
Eh? Really?

14:36.430 --> 14:37.540
Yes.

14:37.540 --> 14:39.710
I've only been here for five days.

14:39.710 --> 14:43.470
Because you're doing all
exactly I told you.

14:45.470 --> 14:48.100
That means, we also...

14:48.100 --> 14:50.470
We've been two weeks here.

14:50.900 --> 14:54.730
What are you talking about?
You guys are still not doing well.

14:54.730 --> 14:56.340
After practicing swinging the sword,

14:56.340 --> 14:59.980
you guys need to train in striking
until the practice dummy breaks.

15:02.890 --> 15:04.980
What a difference in treatment.

15:08.610 --> 15:10.120
Tokito!

15:11.460 --> 15:14.450
Let's have a paper airplane
flying competition!

15:15.030 --> 15:17.710
Why so sudden?

15:17.710 --> 15:19.460
Ta-da!

15:19.780 --> 15:23.550
I heard you like paper airplanes.

15:23.550 --> 15:26.460
If that's the case,
I can give it a shot too.

15:26.990 --> 15:29.820
Sir Tokito's hobby, huh?

15:29.820 --> 15:31.950
Let me think.

15:31.950 --> 15:37.020
Well, if there's one,
it'd be making paper airplanes.

15:37.020 --> 15:38.850
Paper airplanes?

15:38.850 --> 15:42.150
Yes, I have plenty of them over there.

15:44.540 --> 15:50.360
If I win, you must be kinder
towards the other members.

15:50.360 --> 15:52.160
How about that?

15:54.890 --> 15:57.200
Yeah, sure.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.920
I won't lose.

15:58.920 --> 16:01.090
You can't against me.

16:01.830 --> 16:04.740
You're a good guy.

16:08.420 --> 16:09.620
Are you sure?

16:09.620 --> 16:14.050
It's my win if mine can fly longer
once out of ten tries?

16:14.340 --> 16:18.560
Yeah. Though you'll never win
against me anyway.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.730
If it's once out of ten...

16:20.730 --> 16:22.850
Do you accept it or not?

16:22.850 --> 16:24.730
Of course, I accept!

16:24.730 --> 16:29.580
Then, throw it at the same time
on my signal!

16:29.580 --> 16:32.740
One! Two! Three!

16:33.390 --> 16:34.620
Throw!

16:36.260 --> 16:37.290
Huh?

16:37.290 --> 16:39.620
It's Sir Tokito's victory!

16:39.940 --> 16:41.350
You can do it, Kamado!

16:41.350 --> 16:43.040
You still have a chance!

16:43.040 --> 16:43.980
Throw!

16:46.530 --> 16:48.800
It's Sir Tokito's victory!

16:48.800 --> 16:49.770
Throw!

16:51.720 --> 16:54.800
It's... It's Sir Tokito's victory.

16:54.800 --> 16:55.800
Throw!

16:59.550 --> 17:02.140
It's Sir Tokito's victory.

17:02.140 --> 17:06.390
Argh! One more chance.

17:06.390 --> 17:08.320
Don't give up, Tanjiro!

17:08.320 --> 17:12.280
Yeah, I only need to win it once.

17:14.970 --> 17:16.500
I lost.

17:16.500 --> 17:17.780
(Defeat)

17:18.190 --> 17:21.500
I told you, didn't I?
You can't win.

17:22.530 --> 17:25.760
I thought I could win at least once.

17:25.760 --> 17:27.040
Hashira!

17:27.380 --> 17:29.650
May I join the challenge as well?

17:29.650 --> 17:31.750
I'm good with throwing paper airplanes.

17:31.750 --> 17:34.930
Me too!
I've been the best in my village before.

17:34.930 --> 17:38.860
Hey, I won first place in my town's
paper airplane contest!

17:38.860 --> 17:39.920
Let's do it then!

17:39.920 --> 17:41.170
I'm in!

17:41.170 --> 17:43.230
Someone, get us lots of paper!

17:51.900 --> 17:54.450
Can I see it for a bit?

18:00.620 --> 18:02.290
This time, I'd win.

18:03.790 --> 18:05.510
What are you doing, Ugly?!

18:05.510 --> 18:06.930
Look at you, you small fry!

18:06.930 --> 18:08.090
You're annoying!

18:08.090 --> 18:10.020
I'm not!

18:11.400 --> 18:13.130
Are you ready, everyone?

18:13.130 --> 18:14.680
Yeah!

18:16.100 --> 18:18.250
Let's throw!

19:21.750 --> 19:26.580
It's probably true that Muzan Kibutsuji
is targeting Nezuko

19:26.580 --> 19:28.620
because she has overcome the sun.

19:28.620 --> 19:31.790
Also, we rarely encounter demons
these days.

19:32.190 --> 19:36.300
Thanks to that, we can focus on
the Hashira Training.

19:36.820 --> 19:39.830
I was worried about being
separated from Nezuko.

19:39.830 --> 19:44.180
But if I bring her to my mission,
that would play right into enemy hands.

19:44.180 --> 19:45.820
It's too dangerous.

19:47.180 --> 19:50.880
It's also possible that Kibutsuji is
gathering his demons to capture Nezuko,

19:50.880 --> 19:54.070
so that he can end up hiding.

19:55.360 --> 19:58.530
I'll train hard,
become stronger than ever,

19:58.530 --> 20:00.240
and go to get Nezuko later.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.940
You're always so positive, Tanjiro.

20:12.980 --> 20:19.280
Because right now, Nezuko has
someone I really trust with her.

20:25.810 --> 20:27.120
Tanjiro.

20:29.060 --> 20:32.750
We must defeat Kibutsuji together
with everyone.

20:46.080 --> 20:50.460
The flame that burns heaven

20:50.460 --> 20:57.510
Truer than the truth

20:57.510 --> 21:01.550
The voice of prayers and
the sounds of shouting

21:01.550 --> 21:08.180
Are fleeting like winged insects

21:08.180 --> 21:12.810
Why do those who devour lives

21:12.810 --> 21:19.780
Beg mercy as if not knowing impurity

21:19.780 --> 21:25.950
Those souls that win through
the darkness can only reach

21:25.950 --> 21:30.750
Obtain that eternity

21:30.750 --> 21:36.460
There's a feeling here that
doesn't know demise

21:36.460 --> 21:41.680
Speak your dream, you strong one

21:41.680 --> 21:47.430
A resound congratulating
tune of eternity

21:47.430 --> 21:53.190
Into the light that governs the sky

21:53.190 --> 21:57.400
In the corner of the world that is messy

21:57.400 --> 22:01.700
A blade of a sword that
still wriggles and resists

22:01.700 --> 22:07.660
Grovels and struggles miserably

22:13.540 --> 22:16.400
Tanjiro! Long time no see!

22:16.400 --> 22:18.540
Welcome to my mansion!

22:18.540 --> 22:20.240
It's been a while!

22:20.240 --> 22:22.160
Glad to see you looking well!

22:22.160 --> 22:24.050
You too, Tanjiro.

22:24.450 --> 22:26.700
Do you keep bees?

22:27.740 --> 22:30.220
I smell the sweet scent of honey.

22:30.220 --> 22:32.370
Oh! You knew?

22:32.370 --> 22:34.350
That's right!

22:34.350 --> 22:40.790
Honeycomb on bread is
super duper delicious!

22:40.790 --> 22:42.940
And smear a lot of butter too!

22:43.360 --> 22:45.900
I'll brew some black tea at three!

22:45.900 --> 22:48.990
I'll make pancakes too!
So look forward to it!

22:49.360 --> 22:54.500
Buttah? Pankehki?
And I barely know black tea.

22:54.500 --> 23:00.000
Sweets! Bread! Pancakes!

23:01.720 --> 23:04.400
This time I'll tell you about Tokito.

23:04.400 --> 23:08.820
I'm looking forward to it because I feel
I haven't remembered everything.

23:09.410 --> 23:12.400
Here we go, the Taisho period secret.

23:12.400 --> 23:14.270
Since before he joined the Corps,

23:14.270 --> 23:19.800
he had nerves of steel that he could
sleep through storms and lightning.

23:19.800 --> 23:22.790
It sounds like I'm some kind
of insensitive person.

23:22.790 --> 23:25.930
And you never lost your appetite either.

23:25.930 --> 23:30.590
But while I had lost my memories,
my personality was like my brother's.

23:30.590 --> 23:33.940
That made me happy
as if he was protecting me.

23:33.940 --> 23:35.700
Tokito...

23:35.700 --> 23:38.950
Next up on Episode 5:
"I Even Ate a Demon..."

23:38.950 --> 23:40.050
(To be continued)
