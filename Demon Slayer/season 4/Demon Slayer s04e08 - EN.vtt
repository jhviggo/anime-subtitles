WEBVTT

02:40.747 --> 02:42.977
This is our first meeting, isn't it?

02:44.177 --> 02:47.357
Muzan Kibutsuji.

02:48.570 --> 02:55.560
What a hideous look you have,
Ubuyashiki.

03:06.144 --> 03:09.981
(The Last Episode: Hashiras, Assemble)

03:16.238 --> 03:21.508
Finally, you have come to me.

03:22.178 --> 03:30.478
And now, you are standing before me,
Muzan Kibutsuji.

03:31.158 --> 03:35.808
The demon that my family,
the Demon Slayer Corps...

03:36.588 --> 03:42.238
...has been pursuing for
a thousand years.

03:43.588 --> 03:51.858
Amane, what does he look like?

03:52.898 --> 03:57.448
He appears to be a man in
his mid to late twenties.

03:58.478 --> 04:01.848
However, his eyes are
a deep plum color,

04:02.478 --> 04:07.148
and his pupils are elongated
like a cat's.

04:08.438 --> 04:10.248
Is that so?

04:10.248 --> 04:17.168
Right, I knew you would come.

04:17.168 --> 04:28.198
Because I was certain you must be terribly
angry at me, at the Ubuyashiki family.

04:28.938 --> 04:37.328
I knew you would come
to kill me personally.

04:38.908 --> 04:44.098
I'm utterly disappointed, Ubuyashiki.

04:44.098 --> 04:46.718
Without knowing its place,

04:46.718 --> 04:52.778
the head of a family that has interfered
with me for a thousand years

04:52.778 --> 04:55.438
now is in such a pitiful state.

04:55.908 --> 05:00.398
Disgraceful.
Absolutely disgraceful.

05:00.398 --> 05:05.868
You already reek of death, Ubuyashiki.

05:10.528 --> 05:12.438
I suppose you are right.

05:13.118 --> 05:22.218
A half year ago, a doctor told me
that I would die within a few days.

05:29.838 --> 05:34.958
And yet, I am still alive.

05:35.968 --> 05:41.818
Even that doctor was at a loss for words.

05:43.188 --> 05:50.728
It is purely because of my unwavering
determination to defeat you...

05:51.508 --> 05:53.248
Muzan.

05:53.978 --> 05:58.028
That fleeting dream of yours
ends tonight.

05:58.028 --> 06:01.758
I'm going to kill you now.

06:03.638 --> 06:08.768
You might not know this,

06:09.518 --> 06:14.698
but you and I share the same bloodline.

06:16.628 --> 06:23.248
However, since you were born
over a thousand years ago,

06:24.178 --> 06:29.438
so we are no longer closely related.

06:32.078 --> 06:35.198
I feel nothing after hearing that.

06:35.198 --> 06:38.048
What are you trying to say?

06:39.618 --> 06:46.458
Because the family gave birth to
a monster like you,

06:47.368 --> 06:52.848
my family was cursed.

06:56.498 --> 07:04.208
Every child born into my family
was frail and died young.

07:05.878 --> 07:09.048
When my family was
on the brink of extinction,

07:09.878 --> 07:13.428
we received advice from a priest.

07:14.768 --> 07:18.668
He said that our bloodline
gave birth to a demon.

07:19.748 --> 07:25.458
He advised us to dedicate ourselves
to defeating that being.

07:26.208 --> 07:30.478
If we did so, our family would survive.

07:31.798 --> 07:36.718
For generations, we began to take
wives from families of priests,

07:37.458 --> 07:40.768
and our children became
less likely to die early.

07:41.468 --> 07:48.878
But even so, no one in my family
has lived beyond thirty years.

07:50.528 --> 07:54.238
Your nonsense has reached its peak.

07:54.238 --> 07:56.218
It makes me want to vomit.

07:56.218 --> 08:00.618
Has your illness spread to your brain?

08:00.618 --> 08:04.928
There's no causal connection
between those events.

08:05.438 --> 08:07.008
You know what?

08:07.548 --> 08:11.888
I haven't faced any divine retribution.

08:11.888 --> 08:18.188
Despite killing hundreds, even thousands
of people, I remain unpunished.

08:18.188 --> 08:24.068
Over these thousand years,
I have never seen any God or Buddha.

08:25.758 --> 08:31.488
Is that how you perceive things?

08:33.668 --> 08:40.378
But I have my own way of thinking.

08:41.398 --> 08:45.968
Muzan, what is your dream?

08:47.928 --> 08:50.298
For the last thousand years,

08:50.678 --> 08:56.238
what kind of dreams
have you been dreaming?

08:58.178 --> 09:00.828
It's a strange feeling.

09:00.828 --> 09:05.678
Even with the very source of the Demon
Slayer Corps' nuisance right before me,

09:05.678 --> 09:08.198
I don't feel hatred.

09:08.198 --> 09:09.448
On the contrary...

10:02.808 --> 10:07.778
This strange sense of nostalgia
and feeling of relief...

10:07.778 --> 10:09.828
It's disgusting.

10:11.138 --> 10:16.038
There are only four people
in this mansion.

10:16.038 --> 10:20.368
Ubuyashiki, his wife,
and his two children.

10:21.148 --> 10:23.518
No guards, nothing.

10:25.838 --> 10:28.818
Shall I guess, Muzan?

10:30.918 --> 10:36.658
I know what is on your mind.

10:37.748 --> 10:41.738
You are dreaming of eternity.

10:43.198 --> 10:47.358
You are dreaming of immortality.

10:49.018 --> 10:51.338
That's right.

10:51.338 --> 10:57.808
And that dream will soon come true,
once I acquire Nezuko.

10:58.818 --> 11:03.388
Your dream will not come true, Muzan.

11:03.388 --> 11:08.688
You seem quite confident
in hiding Nezuko.

11:08.688 --> 11:15.568
However, unlike you,
I have all the time in the world.

11:15.948 --> 11:20.238
You are mistaken.

11:21.958 --> 11:23.598
What?

11:25.418 --> 11:31.418
I know what eternity truly is.

11:33.958 --> 11:39.308
Eternity is the feelings of people.

11:42.308 --> 11:46.558
It is the feelings of people
that are eternal...

11:47.638 --> 11:49.558
...and immortal.

11:51.388 --> 11:53.008
Ridiculous.

11:53.008 --> 11:56.528
I'm sick of your nonsense.

11:57.598 --> 11:59.698
For a thousand years,

12:00.988 --> 12:03.858
the Demon Slayer Corps
has never disappeared.

12:05.248 --> 12:09.038
Countless unfortunate children have died,

12:09.858 --> 12:13.208
but they have never ceased to exist.

12:14.338 --> 12:16.798
That fact alone proves that...

12:17.518 --> 12:26.658
...the feelings of people,
which you call ridiculous, are immortal.

12:34.558 --> 12:38.908
The feeling of not forgiving those...

12:39.568 --> 12:45.488
...who have taken the lives of
loved ones unjustly...

12:49.888 --> 12:51.518
...is eternal.

12:53.678 --> 12:59.098
No one has ever forgiven you.

13:01.318 --> 13:05.738
Not even once in these thousand years.

13:09.508 --> 13:13.228
Let me tell you, Muzan.

13:15.798 --> 13:23.708
You have stepped on the tiger's tail and
provoked the dragon's wrath countless times.

13:25.648 --> 13:36.128
You awakened them that should
have remained dormant.

13:37.128 --> 13:43.218
They are always watching you,

13:44.118 --> 13:46.968
and determined never to let you escape.

13:50.098 --> 13:56.478
Even if you kill me, the Demon Slayer
Corps will remain unfazed.

13:57.878 --> 14:02.608
I myself am not that important.

14:04.028 --> 14:13.738
You can never understand
the feelings and the bonds of people.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.238
Muzan.

14:17.938 --> 14:20.238
Because you...

14:21.328 --> 14:23.258
All of you demons...

14:24.078 --> 14:30.018
If you die, all the demons will perish,
won't they?

14:34.018 --> 14:36.408
The air just wavered.

14:38.178 --> 14:39.778
Did I hit the mark?

14:41.058 --> 14:42.398
Shut up.

14:43.638 --> 14:46.818
Okay, very well.

14:47.718 --> 14:51.178
I have said what I wanted to say
to you for so long.

14:52.468 --> 14:56.658
But may I say one last thing?

14:58.688 --> 15:04.228
Although I said I am not that important,

15:05.938 --> 15:10.108
my death will not be meaningless.

15:11.698 --> 15:16.398
I am fortunate to be respected
by the Demon Slayer Corps,

15:17.128 --> 15:23.108
especially, the Hashiras
who are fond of me.

15:23.938 --> 15:33.618
In other words, my death will only bolster
their morale even more than before.

15:38.278 --> 15:41.258
Are you done talking?

15:41.748 --> 15:42.768
Yes.

15:43.728 --> 15:49.558
To be honest, I never expected you
to listen this long.

15:50.838 --> 15:54.598
Thank you, Muzan.

15:58.158 --> 16:01.158
Emergency summons!

16:01.158 --> 16:04.698
An attack on Ubuyashiki residence!

16:04.998 --> 16:06.358
Master!

16:09.418 --> 16:11.828
Must go faster! I have to hurry!

16:14.078 --> 16:15.708
Master!

16:27.978 --> 16:29.408
Please make it in time!

16:43.006 --> 16:48.486
We should assign at least two Hashiras
to guard the Master.

16:48.486 --> 16:52.006
Can't you do anything about that,
Himejima?

16:53.286 --> 16:54.756
It is impossible.

16:55.376 --> 17:00.886
Since I became a Hashira at nineteen,
I have been asking that for eight years,

17:00.886 --> 17:03.836
but he refuses to listen.

17:04.646 --> 17:07.676
He insists that the Hashiras
are too precious

17:07.676 --> 17:13.086
and should not be used for
his personal protection alone.

17:13.756 --> 17:15.796
It is quite troubling.

17:17.216 --> 17:24.856
I heard that none of the heads of the
Ubuyashiki family have ever had guards.

17:30.576 --> 17:38.486
Master!

17:40.766 --> 17:41.936
Almost there!

17:43.246 --> 17:44.666
It's the mansion!

17:44.666 --> 17:46.856
It's all right! I'll make it in time!

17:46.856 --> 17:47.746
I'll makeâ€”

19:09.456 --> 19:10.606
Explosives!

19:10.606 --> 19:15.126
And the overwhelming stench of
burning blood and flesh!

19:43.036 --> 19:47.536
Ubuyashiki!

19:48.596 --> 19:51.676
The look on his face!

19:51.676 --> 19:55.436
Even with a serene, Buddha-like smile,

19:55.436 --> 20:00.686
he blew himself, along with his wife
and children to pieces with explosives.

20:01.826 --> 20:05.556
I was mistaken.

20:06.026 --> 20:12.966
I measured that man, Ubuyashiki,
as an ordinary human,

20:12.966 --> 20:17.726
but he was completely beyond the pale.

20:19.176 --> 20:25.946
I expected some kind of trap,
but not to this extent.

20:26.586 --> 20:34.446
The explosives were filled with tiny
caltrops to increase their lethality.

20:35.756 --> 20:40.336
They were designed to delay
my regeneration as much as possible.

20:40.336 --> 20:43.556
Which means, there's more to come.

20:43.556 --> 20:47.386
Ubuyashiki must have another plan
in motion after this.

20:47.826 --> 20:50.666
I sense people gathering here.

20:50.666 --> 20:52.516
Probably the Hashiras.

20:52.516 --> 20:56.436
But not them, it's something else.

20:56.436 --> 21:01.656
That cunning man used himself as bait.

21:02.176 --> 21:10.666
His rage and hatred toward me coiled
darkly in his heart like a serpent.

21:11.006 --> 21:18.266
Hiding such murderous intent so well
at such a young age is astonishing.

21:18.266 --> 21:22.676
Were his wife and children
aware of this plan?

21:22.676 --> 21:26.426
No, I must not think about that now.

21:26.426 --> 21:31.216
Stay calm.
My body will soon regenerate.

21:41.246 --> 21:43.196
Seeds of flesh?

21:43.196 --> 21:45.036
A Blood Demon Art!

21:55.246 --> 21:57.266
I got caught.

21:57.266 --> 22:00.206
Whose Blood Demon Art is this?

22:00.206 --> 22:04.596
The thorns branched out within my flesh,
and it's hard to remove.

22:05.716 --> 22:07.756
No problem.

22:07.756 --> 22:09.776
There aren't that many.

22:09.776 --> 22:13.066
I just need to absorb them.

22:23.996 --> 22:27.616
Tamayo?! Why are you here?

22:27.616 --> 22:30.543
This Blood Demon Art of thorns

22:30.544 --> 22:34.536
belongs to the person
you turned into a demon in Asakusa.

22:35.586 --> 22:39.136
She approached me using
a Demon Blood Art of concealment.

22:39.136 --> 22:42.296
What is her goal?
What has she done?

22:42.296 --> 22:45.796
Why is this woman here?

22:48.126 --> 22:53.666
So you absorbed my fist, Muzan.

22:54.346 --> 22:58.416
What do you think was inside my fist?

22:59.186 --> 23:02.246
It's a medicine to turn demons
back into humans.

23:02.976 --> 23:06.446
How is it?
Do you feel it taking effect?

23:06.446 --> 23:09.866
No way such medicine exists!

23:10.226 --> 23:12.436
I completed it.

23:12.436 --> 23:15.496
The situation has greatly changed.

23:15.496 --> 23:18.556
I couldn't have done it alone.

23:20.666 --> 23:25.626
You're quite a persistent woman,
aren't you, Tamayo?

23:25.626 --> 23:28.176
What an unreasonable grudge.

23:28.956 --> 23:32.936
Who killed your husband and your child?

23:32.936 --> 23:36.156
Was it me? No.

23:36.156 --> 23:38.826
It was none other than yourself.

23:38.826 --> 23:41.186
You killed and ate them.

23:42.376 --> 23:48.716
Had I known that,
I would never have become a demon.

23:49.406 --> 23:52.476
I said I didn't want to die
from my illness.

23:52.476 --> 23:56.576
It's because I wanted to see
my child grow up!

23:56.906 --> 24:00.796
After that, you continued to
kill many humans.

24:00.796 --> 24:04.016
Was that just my imagination?

24:04.016 --> 24:08.926
You looked like you were
enjoying eating them.

24:08.926 --> 24:10.216
Yes, I did!

24:10.216 --> 24:13.756
I killed many in my desperation!

24:14.216 --> 24:20.266
And to atone for those sins,
I will die here with you!

24:20.766 --> 24:23.686
Himejima! Now it's your turn!

24:37.376 --> 24:42.246
Namu Amida Butsu!

24:54.956 --> 24:57.316
The first time I met him,

24:57.316 --> 25:02.296
the Master was fourteen,
and I was eighteen.

25:02.296 --> 25:09.786
From his demeanor, it was hard to believe
that he was four years younger than me.

25:11.606 --> 25:17.376
I know that you fought to protect others.

25:18.716 --> 25:21.266
You are not a murderer.

25:27.226 --> 25:34.606
He always offered exactly the words
people yearned to hear in that moment.

25:37.126 --> 25:44.356
His solemnity never wavered from
the time we met until his death.

25:46.756 --> 25:52.416
Within five days, Muzan will come.

25:54.136 --> 26:03.226
Use me as bait and
take Muzan's head for me.

26:04.946 --> 26:08.866
Why do you think he will come?

26:10.666 --> 26:15.536
It is just intuition. No reason.

26:16.916 --> 26:19.271
In addition to that distinctive voice,

26:19.276 --> 26:24.646
the Ubuyashiki family had an
extraordinary sense of intuition.

26:25.896 --> 26:30.996
Some called it foresight.
The ability to see the future.

26:30.996 --> 26:37.076
This gift allowed them to amass great
wealth and avoid numerous crises.

26:39.156 --> 26:48.966
The other children would never agree
to use me as bait.

26:50.336 --> 26:55.116
I can only entrust this to you, Gyomei.

26:57.576 --> 27:01.936
Understood.
If that is your wish, Master.

27:06.496 --> 27:08.246
Thank you.

27:10.796 --> 27:22.046
I just hope that no more of
my precious children have to die.

27:27.836 --> 27:31.366
Just as the Master predicted.

27:31.366 --> 27:33.666
This Muzan... This Man...

27:34.786 --> 27:37.176
He doesn't die even if
you cut off his head.

27:38.446 --> 27:45.696
I suppose the only thing that
can destroy Muzan is sunlight.

27:46.636 --> 27:51.911
If cutting off his head
does not kill him,

27:51.916 --> 27:56.246
your fight will be a battle of
endurance until sunrise.

27:59.106 --> 28:02.486
Moreover, the speed of his
body's regeneration is fast.

28:02.486 --> 28:06.786
Judging by the sound, it far surpasses
any demon I have faced before.

28:09.206 --> 28:14.206
Even after he was blasted by Master
and weakened by our collaborator,

28:14.886 --> 28:18.086
he still retains this much strength.

28:18.666 --> 28:21.166
We must keep this monster restrained

28:21.166 --> 28:24.486
in a place where the sunlight
can reach him until dawn.

28:27.246 --> 28:29.386
Black Blood Brambles!

28:31.676 --> 28:36.856
Stone Breathing, Third Form:
Stone Skin!

28:52.126 --> 28:54.876
Was it you?!

28:54.876 --> 29:01.796
What did you do to the Master?!

29:07.636 --> 29:09.096
Master!

29:09.906 --> 29:11.266
Master!

29:26.196 --> 29:28.336
The Hashiras have assembled.

29:28.336 --> 29:31.656
The Master's strategy is brilliant!

29:43.266 --> 29:45.756
It is Muzan!

29:46.086 --> 29:48.216
Muzan Kibutsuji is here!

29:48.216 --> 29:50.766
He won't die even if you cut off his head!

29:52.496 --> 29:53.896
He's...

29:54.226 --> 29:55.056
So that's...

29:55.056 --> 29:56.646
That man is...

29:57.376 --> 29:58.476
That bastard...

29:58.476 --> 29:59.606
It's Kibutsuji...

30:00.756 --> 30:02.486
Muzan!

30:02.486 --> 30:05.116
Mist Breathing, Fourth Form!

30:05.116 --> 30:07.326
Insect Breathing, Butterfly Dance!

30:07.326 --> 30:09.866
Serpent Breathing, First Form!

30:09.866 --> 30:12.246
Love Breathing, Fifth Form!

30:12.246 --> 30:14.876
Water Breathing, Third Form!

30:14.876 --> 30:17.496
Wind Breathing, Seventh Form!

30:17.496 --> 30:19.706
Hinokami Kagura:

30:21.056 --> 30:22.886
Sunflower Thrust!

31:36.246 --> 31:38.696
What the heck is happening?!

31:40.476 --> 31:42.246
Hold on tight!

32:31.876 --> 32:33.426
Tanjiro!

32:44.066 --> 32:47.706
Do you think you've got me cornered?

32:47.706 --> 32:51.446
You are all now going to Hell!

32:51.446 --> 32:53.906
You demon hunters are an eyesore!

32:54.626 --> 32:58.156
Tonight, I'm going to slaughter
every last one of you!

33:02.206 --> 33:04.946
You're the one who's going to Hell,
Muzan!

33:04.946 --> 33:07.206
I won't let you escape!

33:07.916 --> 33:14.886
Do it if you can!
Tanjiro Kamado!

33:16.786 --> 33:18.976
I'll defeat you for sure!

33:19.426 --> 33:21.976
Muzan Kibutsuji!

34:27.246 --> 34:30.876
To you who is ignorant of
what eternity means

34:30.876 --> 34:34.316
It's time to show you the answer

34:34.316 --> 34:40.586
Beyond the endless spiral

34:56.246 --> 34:59.926
The reason why it sounded like an excuse

34:59.926 --> 35:03.486
A weakness that draws in a fleeting future

35:03.486 --> 35:09.126
You mistake it for strength

35:09.866 --> 35:11.786
So detestable, so detestable

35:11.786 --> 35:13.546
So disgraceful, so disgraceful

35:13.546 --> 35:17.066
The heart that is so bleak

35:17.066 --> 35:18.796
So dark, so dark

35:18.796 --> 35:20.616
That it almost hides the moon

35:20.616 --> 35:24.436
If only you weren't here

35:24.436 --> 35:27.996
It sways and sways

35:27.996 --> 35:31.596
Carrying on its intentions
just like a flower

35:31.596 --> 35:35.076
Taking it all away, taking it all away

35:35.076 --> 35:38.426
It tears the heart just like a storm would

35:38.426 --> 35:42.036
To you who is ignorant of
what eternity means

35:42.036 --> 35:45.516
It's time to show you the answer

35:45.516 --> 35:50.986
Beyond the endless spiral

35:50.986 --> 35:55.056
Who awaits there

35:56.806 --> 36:00.516
I swallowed the fate
that has befallen upon me

36:00.516 --> 36:03.946
I memorized all the names
that I carry on

36:03.946 --> 36:09.816
With these burning feelings,
strong enough to inflame the heart

36:10.286 --> 36:12.166
So detestable, so detestable

36:12.166 --> 36:13.926
So disgraceful, so disgraceful

36:13.926 --> 36:17.436
To the point it divides the world

36:17.436 --> 36:19.296
Rage, rage

36:19.296 --> 36:21.096
A burning heart

36:21.096 --> 36:24.836
If only you weren't here

36:24.836 --> 36:28.456
It sways and sways

36:28.456 --> 36:31.986
Carrying on its intentions
just like a flower

36:31.986 --> 36:35.516
Taking it all away, taking it all away

36:35.516 --> 36:38.846
It tears the heart just like a storm would

36:38.846 --> 36:42.476
To you who is ignorant of
what eternity means

36:42.476 --> 36:45.976
It's time to show you the answer

36:45.976 --> 36:52.036
Beyond the endless spiral

36:53.196 --> 36:56.876
The result of lending an ear
to a wailing ghost

36:56.876 --> 37:00.426
All things reside within me
leading to my end

37:00.426 --> 37:07.596
The weak one who entrusts
the infinity to others

37:07.596 --> 37:11.176
The glow of life is timeless

37:11.176 --> 37:14.666
The blinks of prayers in the setting sun

37:14.666 --> 37:18.216
A thousand nights harbored
within yourself

37:18.216 --> 37:22.236
These thoughts are imposed

37:23.396 --> 37:27.016
It withers and withers

37:27.016 --> 37:30.616
It tears a flower in the infinite night

37:30.616 --> 37:34.186
It carries on, it carries on

37:34.186 --> 37:37.806
It plants seeds in the storm

37:37.806 --> 37:41.336
It sways and sways

37:41.336 --> 37:44.886
Carrying on its intentions
just like a flower

37:44.886 --> 37:48.476
Taking it all away, taking it all away

37:48.476 --> 37:51.786
It tears the heart just like a storm would

37:51.786 --> 37:55.356
To you who is ignorant of
what eternity means

37:55.356 --> 37:58.736
It's time to show you the answer

37:58.736 --> 38:04.316
Beyond the endless spiral

38:04.316 --> 38:10.696
Who awaits there

38:34.310 --> 38:37.980
(Demon Slayer: Hashira Training Arc)
(The End)

38:40.068 --> 38:42.821
This time I'll tell you about Kanroji.

38:42.821 --> 38:46.199
What's this?
Telling about me?

38:46.199 --> 38:48.743
Kanroji is very attractive.

38:50.537 --> 38:52.330
She is a pretty lady.

38:53.832 --> 38:57.502
But I believe you already know that.

38:57.502 --> 39:00.630
That's why we're doing
Taisho period secret.

39:00.630 --> 39:04.175
Kanroji was Rengoku's Tsuguko.

39:04.175 --> 39:07.470
His training was so harsh,
so that everyone ran away.

39:07.470 --> 39:11.016
But Kanroji didn't give up that easily.

39:11.016 --> 39:17.856
Even though his training was harsh,
he was serious and full of passion.

39:17.856 --> 39:19.566
I can imagine that.

39:20.150 --> 39:24.654
If we're going to introduce every Hashira,
we should include Rengoku as well.

39:24.654 --> 39:26.531
You're right!

39:26.907 --> 39:29.367
Taisho period secret, again.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.995
Rengoku was a cool big brother.

39:31.995 --> 39:36.791
He trained and taught me a lot of things,
he also pampered me.

39:36.791 --> 39:40.420
Besides, he used to eat a lot!

39:40.420 --> 39:46.301
You know, the two of us ate
a big pot of sweet potato rice!

39:46.301 --> 39:47.552
<i>Wasshoi!</i>

39:47.552 --> 39:49.304
<i>Was.. shoi!</i>

39:49.304 --> 39:51.598
It's a really wonderful memory.

39:51.598 --> 39:55.894
Wow! I wish I could have had
sweet potato rice together with him.

39:56.770 --> 39:59.689
That's nostalgic.
I remember it too.

40:04.653 --> 40:07.614
Finally, the time to fight
Muzan Kibutsuji has come.

40:08.281 --> 40:09.616
I'm counting on you guys.

40:13.203 --> 40:16.581
Just now, Rengoku was there, right?

40:16.581 --> 40:17.958
Yes.

40:17.958 --> 40:20.126
It's not a dream, right?

40:20.126 --> 40:21.378
Surely not.

40:22.545 --> 40:23.713
Tanjiro!

40:23.713 --> 40:24.631
Yes!

40:24.631 --> 40:27.384
We must defeat Kibutsuji!

40:27.384 --> 40:29.219
Yes, we will!

40:30.053 --> 40:31.304
Definitely!
