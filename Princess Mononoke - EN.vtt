00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.350
In ancient times,
the land lay covered in forests,

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:32.740
where, from ages long past,
dwelt the spirits of the gods.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.050
Yakul!

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:42.970
Ashitaka!

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.730
The wise woman wants everybody back
to the village at once.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.060
We just came from Ji-san.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.730
Ji-san?

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.310
Yes, in the forest.
Something's wrong.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.480
-The birds have gone.
-The animals too.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.240
I'll go check with Ji-san.
You three hurry back home.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.150
Something's there.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.330
Ji-san, did you see it too?

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.830
I did. It isn't human.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.750
The wise woman's calling everybody
back to the village.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.290
There. Look.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.910
It's some kind of demon!

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.660
A demon?

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.850
Run, Yakul!

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.170
It's headed for the village.
I've got to stop it.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:16.710
<i>Ashitaka!</i>

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.550
That thing is cursed!
Don't let it touch you!

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:22.760
Yakul!

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.070
Calm your fury, O mighty Lord!

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.950
Whatever you may be, god or demon,
please leave us in peace!

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.470
-The monster!
-Come on!

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.390
Go back!

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.520
Leave our village alone!

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.520
Stop! Please!

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.030
Get up!

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.130
-He killed it!
-Ashitaka!

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.670
-Fetch the wise woman!
-Don't put the fire out yet.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.470
Ashitaka!

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.550
Kaya, don't touch it.
This wound is evil.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.640
Ashitaka is hurt!
Where is the wise woman?

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.440
You must keep away from him, all of you.
Everyone, stay back.

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.020
What shall we do?

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.520
Take this and pour it
over his wound, child, slowly.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:45.360
All right.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.920
O nameless god
of rage and hate,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.880
I bow before you.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.510
Where you have fallen we will raise
a mound and perform rites.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.390
Pass on in peace
and bear us no hatred.

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:18.310
Disgusting little creatures,

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:23.230
soon all of you will feel my hate
and suffer as I have suffered.

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:05.770
I'm afraid this is very bad.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.780
The stones tell me the boar god
came from far to the west.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.950
He had some kind of poison inside him,
driving him mad, a poisonous hatred

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:20.080
that consumed his heart and flesh...
and turned him into a demon monster.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.370
Prince Ashitaka?

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:23.500
Yes?

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.170
Show everyone your right arm.

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:35.640
Hii-sama!

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:41.930
My prince, are you prepared to learn
what fate the stones have foretold you?

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:42.850
Yes,

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:45.650
I was prepared the very moment
that I let my arrow fly.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:52.240
The infection will spread,
cause you great pain and kill you.

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:59.160
Is there no way we can stop it?

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.580
The prince got that wound by defending
our village and saving our lives!

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.910
Do we just sit here
and watch him die?

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.210
You cannot alter
your fate, my prince.

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:12.710
However, you can rise
to meet it, if you choose.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.300
Look at this.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.300
This iron ball was found
in the boar's body.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:25.390
It shattered his bones
and burned its way deep inside him.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.360
This is what turned him into a demon.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:34.240
There is evil at work in the land
to the west, Prince Ashitaka.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:39.070
It's your fate to go there and see what
you can see with eyes unclouded by hate.

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:43.240
You may find a way to lift the curse.
You understand?

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:44.080
Yes.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.170
We are the last of the Emishi.

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:52.340
It's 500 years since the emperor
destroyed our tribe...

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:56.170
and drove the remnants
of our people to the east.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:00.010
Some managed to survive here
for all these years,

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:04.810
but our tribe's blood has grown thinner
and weaker with each generation.

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:10.400
Now our last prince must cut his hair
and leave us, never to return?

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.730
Sometimes I think the gods
are laughing at us.

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:33.960
Our laws forbid us
from watching you go, Ashitaka. Farewell.

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:05.080
Ashitaka!

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.370
Kaya, what are you doing here?
You know it's forbidden.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.250
Do you think I care about that?

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.870
I came to give you this
so you won't forget your little sister.

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.630
Your crystal dagger.
Kaya, I can't take this.

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.680
Please, keep it with you,
brother, to protect you.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:26.350
Please, I want you to have it,
so you won't... forget.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.680
Kaya, you know
I could never forget you.

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:00.480
A battle?

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.200
Move in!

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:15.000
Look! Up there, on the hill!

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.120
His head is mine!

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:28.970
Stop!

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:38.850
My arm! What's happening to me?

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.480
Hurry! Stop him before he gets away!

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.070
Let me pass! I'm warning you!

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:01.500
A demon.

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:16.680
The mark is getting bigger.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:30.780
Are you selling soup
or donkey piss?

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:36.950
There he is now.

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:44.630
Will this be enough?

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:46.880
What are you trying to pull?
This isn't money.

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:49.260
Give me back my rice, you little thief.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.300
Excuse me, but might I inspect that?

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:58.770
But this is a lump of pure gold,
you silly woman!

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:04.520
If it's money you want, I'll pay for the
rice and take this nugget off your hands.

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:08.820
My good people, is there a money changer
who could tell us how much this is worth?

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.070
No? All right.

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:14.490
Now, I'm just a monk,
but I'd say three bags of rice at least.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:16.910
That's right, maybe even more.

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:18.250
Hey, wait a minute.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.040
Give me my gold!

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:24.420
Hey! You can't just rush off now.

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:28.210
Don't you even think of thanking me.
It was my pleasure.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.800
In fact, I should be thanking you, really.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:35.050
You see, I was caught in that battle.
I saw what you did to those samurai.

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:39.770
You fight like a demon.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:47.230
I see you noticed we're being followed.
That's what we get for waving gold.

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:51.030
They'll wait till we're asleep,
then slit our throats.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:55.740
What to you say we give 'em a little
demonstration of how fast we can run?

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:09.250
So the demon monster
turned out to be a giant boar.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:14.800
I followed its trail westward
through the mountains, but then--

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:16.470
You lost it. That's life.

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:18.260
See this place here?

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:24.770
When I came here last, a few years back,
this was a lovely little village.

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:29.270
But then there must have been
a flood or a landslide. Everybody's dead.

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:34.570
These days, there are
angry ghosts all around us,

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:39.080
dead from wars,
sickness, starvation. And nobody cares.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:43.410
So you say you're under a curse?
So what? So's the whole damn world.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.580
Ah, this is good!

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:53.170
I was wrong to fight in that village.
Two men are dead because of me.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.010
<i>Samurai thugs.</i>
<i>You win some, you lose some.</i>

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:58.970
Hand me your bowl.

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:00.390
My point is, everybody dies.

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:03.100
Some now, some later.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.850
Beautiful bowl.
I've seen one other like it.

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:10.400
Have you ever heard of the Emishi people?

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:13.940
They're said to ride red elks.

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:17.610
They also use stone arrowheads
just like you.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.540
Of course, they were all
wiped out 500 years ago.

00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:30.790
Don't worry.
I won't tell anyone where you're from.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.340
Anyway, I've got
much bigger fish to fry.

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:37.510
Have you ever come across
anything like this before?

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:43.020
Never have.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:49.020
It was inside the giant boar.
I'm sure it was that ball that killed him.

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:02.080
There's a place high in the mountains
far to the west of here.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.080
It's where
the Forest Spirit dwells,

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.250
and it's very dangerous for humans.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:07.920
To enter there is certain death.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.540
The Forest Spirit?

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:11.790
I've been told the beasts there
are all giants,

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.670
just as they were in the dawn of time.

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:50.580
See ya there, my friend.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.080
The sooner we get this rice home,
the sooner we eat. Let's move!

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.580
Coming this way!

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:29.910
Wolves!

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:41.010
Don't let the oxen panic! Stay calm!
Take up your positions!

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.050
Keep your powder dry.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.550
Make sure you wait for them
to come within range!

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.940
Ready! And fire!

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.880
Second round! Fire!

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.840
That was it?
They weren't so big.

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:27.100
They're just pups.
Wait till you see their mother.

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:35.270
It's Moro!

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:43.150
Come on.

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:58.250
We killed her!

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:01.710
You forget she is a god.
It will take more than that.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.430
She certainly did some damage.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.930
We move out now.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.770
What about the men
she pushed over the cliff?

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:16.690
They're dead.
Let's get the living home.

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:38.170
He's still breathing.

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.420
Hang on.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:46.690
My name is Ashitaka! I have travelled
far from lands to the east.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:50.450
Are you ancient gods, and have I come
to the realm of the Forest Spirit?

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.050
Go away.

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:30.990
A kodama! I never thought
I'd see one of them here.

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.870
Easy there. You don't want
to make your injuries worse, do you?

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:45.170
He's a tree spirit. He brings good luck.
It's a sign this forest is healthy.

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:47.340
But they'll lead their lord
and master right to us.

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.800
Who do you mean?
Those wolves I just saw?

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.890
No, I mean a real monster,
like a huge enormous deer.

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:57.720
Where did it go?

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:07.320
If Yakul's not afraid, then we have
nothing to worry about here.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:12.610
Would you be kind enough to grant us
passage through your forest, little one?

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:26.250
Sir, I really think
we should turn around now.

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:29.050
No humans have ever made it
through these woods alive.

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:31.340
There's a lovely trail
back across the river.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.130
The current's too swift
for us to get across,

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:37.850
and your friend's injuries
are very bad.

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:46.650
Hey, little fellow, are you showing us
the way or just getting us more lost?

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:05.330
Please, sir, I'm really pretty sure
they're not trying to help us get home.

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.250
My God!
There's thousands of them.

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:31.110
Look at that. That must be their mother,
a fine old tree.

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:14.570
The tracks of those wolves
and the girl with them.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.650
This place must be
where the four of them live.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:22.030
Sir, I think we took a wrong turn.
This is a place for gods and demons.

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.160
I think we're safe.
We'll rest a bit.

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:37.260
More tracks?

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:47.600
Whatever made these
made them recently.

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.700
Sir! What's going on?

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:20.030
What just happened there?
You went white as a sheet all of a sudden.

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:22.860
Here.

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:24.610
Did you see anything just then?

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:26.910
-Like what?
-Forget it.

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.910
Hang on just a little longer.
You're almost home.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.830
Thank you.

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:41.010
It's gone,

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:46.850
That's strange.
Suddenly he doesn't feel heavy at all.

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:49.850
My arm!
It doesn't hurt!

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:53.730
It's healed!
No, it's still broken.

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:03.700
Sir, you were right. We made it
back home just like you said!

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:37.190
It's a fortress.

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:39.440
It's Lady Eboshi's Irontown.

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:42.530
We make iron here
from the ore in the sand.

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:44.320
Hey!

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:47.360
Hey!

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:51.410
-Someone's come out of the woods.
-Is it the Wolf Girl?

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:55.710
Look! It's me!
Kohroku, the ox driver!

00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:59.710
-It's Kohroku! He's alive!
-Kohroku's alive!

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:02.130
It's true! Kohroku's still alive!

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:03.710
Let's go see!

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:08.470
I'm trying to tally these accounts here,
so shut up!

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:11.300
Haven't you heard?
Kohroku's come back from the dead!

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:12.470
What?

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:26.320
This is unbelievable.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:29.410
-Where are the others, Kohroku?
-Yes, is my son with you?

00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:31.490
I'm afraid we're the only ones
who made it.

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:37.000
It's never the guards that die.

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:38.460
Stand aside.

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:42.500
That man in the weird costume, sir?
Who do you think it could be?

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:44.130
He's obviously an outsider.

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:51.340
This stranger saved our lives. He carried
the rifleman all the way back here.

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:53.220
You should be grateful to him.

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:57.100
Hey, watch the arm.

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:01.150
Sir. Hold it right there.

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.740
I'm very grateful for you bringing
these men back to us, stranger,

00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:18.330
but something doesn't smell right.

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:22.000
You got back almost as fast as we did

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:25.300
and through the forbidden forest
with two badly injured men

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:27.710
-and you want me to believe--
-Kohroku! You're alive!

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:29.420
Toki!

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:33.970
That's just great!

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:36.890
How are you gonna drive the ox
now, all banged up and mangled?

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:38.310
But...

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:42.190
You scared me half to death.
I wish the wolves had eaten you.

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:44.520
Then maybe
I could have found a real husband!

00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:47.400
Sweetness, can we discuss this later?

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:50.400
Toki, save your sweet nothings
for some other time.

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:53.990
And as for you, Gonza,
a fine captain of the guard you are,

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:57.790
always strutting and throwing
your weight around once the danger's over.

00:31:57.870 --> 00:31:59.870
You never do a lick
of work around here.

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:01.920
That's unfair and untrue.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.460
Thanks, stranger. My husband's an idiot,
but I'm glad he's safe and sound.

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:09.630
Oh, good. I was starting to think I'd done
something wrong by bringing him back home.

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:17.760
Say, why don't you take the mask off?
I bet you're really handsome.

00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:19.100
Gonza?

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:24.270
Bring the stranger to me later.
I would like to thank him personally.

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:25.400
Kohroku.

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:29.940
I'm happy you're back, and I apologize.

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:33.700
Milady, you really shouldn't
tell him things like that.

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:35.410
If you're too nice to him,
he'll walk all over you.

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:37.990
I hope you'll forgive me, too, Toki.

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.410
I was responsible.
I should never have let it happen.

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:43.410
That's all right. Milady,
if you hadn't been there,

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.380
the wolves would have eaten everyone.

00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:48.710
-So true!
-No mistake!

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:52.130
Get some rest, traveller.
I will see you this evening.

00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:59.220
Hey! You're not handsome,
you're gorgeous!

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:30.090
Here! You know, they had to fight off
wolves to get this rice through.

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:31.710
Just dish it out!

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:35.010
There he is!

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:36.630
Where is he?

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:39.010
Toki was right.

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:41.100
-He is handsome.
-But he's so young!

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:43.890
That never stopped you before.

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:46.810
Quiet out there!
We lost some good men today.

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:49.110
Yeah, there's lots
of gorgeous men in here, honey!

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:51.190
I've seen cattle
that looked better.

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:56.150
Listen, stranger, come over to our place?
You don't want to stay in this old barn.

00:33:56.780 --> 00:34:00.870
Look, woman! We risked our lives to bring
you the rice, so watch your mouth.

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:04.160
And who made the iron that paid
for that rice? Tell me that.

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:06.660
Yeah, we're pumping those bellows
while you pigs are in bed.

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:10.630
Actually, if it's not too much trouble,
I would like to see where you work.

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:11.710
You would?

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:13.960
We'll have to work in make-up tonight.

00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:15.760
Lend me your lipstick.

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:19.720
-Don't forget now.
-We'll be waiting for you.

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:24.020
It's best not to pay them
any mind, you know.

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:27.690
Lady Eboshi spoils them rotten.
That's why they're like that.

00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:30.020
They say that happy women
make a happy village.

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:33.730
Happy? Ha!
Those kind of women workin' here?

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:36.740
Women like that--It's a disgrace.
They defile the iron.

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:39.700
Lady Eboshi goes around
buying the contract

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:41.410
of every brothel girl she can find.

00:34:41.490 --> 00:34:43.580
Milady has a kind heart, that's all.

00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:45.620
You got rice
on your chin, old man.

00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:49.830
It's true. Everything here has turned
upside-down since she showed up.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:52.840
That's right. She's not even afraid
of the gods, that woman.

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:55.760
You should have seen the way she dealt
with Nago. Am I right?

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:56.920
Who's Nago?

00:34:57.010 --> 00:35:00.760
"Who's Nago?" The gigantic boar god.
He used to rule this whole forest.

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:03.810
We couldn't even get near the mountains
with him around.

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:07.140
Nothing to do but sit around
on our backsides for months.

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:11.020
See, the iron in the sand
under this town had all been dug out.

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:14.400
Then we tried to get at the iron
under the mountain,

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.280
but Nago wasn't gonna stand for that.

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:20.280
Before we could dig for the iron,
we had to clear away the forest,

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:22.320
and that's what made the boar angry.

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:40.760
He's feeling no pain.

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:46.760
Then one day Lady Eboshi came along
with her warriors and her rifles.

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:15.880
Young man, what's wrong?

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:21.300
Is something
hurting your arm?

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:24.430
No, I was just thinking
about the boar god.

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:28.140
I was thinking how he must
have died filled with hate.

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:37.150
Forgive me
for keeping you waiting, stranger.

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:38.860
That's good iron.

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.990
We were running behind
with tomorrow's shipment.

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:46.950
Let's have a rest.
You may tell the others.

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:48.200
Yes, ma'am.

00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:52.210
Some think you're a spy for the Wolf Girl
or for Lord Asano and his samurai.

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:56.380
There are a lot of people out there
with their eyes on this iron.

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:58.460
Why are you here,
if you don't mind my asking?

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.840
I believe
you'll recognize this.

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.640
It shattered the bones
of a giant boar,

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.810
rotted his flesh
and turned him into a monster.

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:16.440
I fought with him, and for that
I was cursed with this mark on my arm,

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:18.360
and soon it will kill me.

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:22.320
Where is it you come from? I've never
seen a red elk like that before.

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:26.570
I have come a very long way.
I can't tell you more than that.

00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:30.700
Answer milady's question
or I'll cut you in half!

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.660
What do you plan to do?
What exactly are you here for?

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.540
To see with eyes
unclouded by hate.

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:40.380
"Eyes unclouded"?

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:46.550
That explains it.

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:49.050
Come. I'll show you all my secrets.

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:50.350
Is that wise, milady?

00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:52.390
Gonza, take over for me.

00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:56.250
This is my garden. None
of the townspeople dare to come here.

00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:59.210
Follow me if you wish
to learn my secret.

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:08.840
Good evening.

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.730
We've only just finished it, milady.

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:21.520
It's still too heavy.

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:24.190
Perhaps if you didn't hold it
so delicately?

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:27.230
Milady, if we make them
any lighter, they'll fall apart.

00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:32.160
They're not for me.
They're for the other women here.

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:34.530
That'll be something to see.

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:38.370
This is the latest rifle
that I've asked these people to design.

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:40.580
The ones we brought here
have turned out to be too heavy.

00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:44.590
These will kill forest monsters and pierce
the thickest samurai armour.

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:48.960
You better watch out there, young man.
Lady Eboshi wants to rule the world.

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:53.090
I'm sorry to have to push you all so hard.
I'll have wine sent down later.

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:54.760
That'll be nice.

00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:00.430
First you transform the boar into a demon.
Now you're making even deadlier weapons!

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:03.730
How much more hatred and pain
do you think we need?

00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:06.860
Yes, I'm the one who shot the boar,

00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:09.820
and I'm sorry that you suffer.
I truly am.

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:13.740
That brainless pig. I'm the one
he should have put a curse on, not you.

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:34.470
Does that right hand of yours
wish to kill me now, Ashitaka?

00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:37.470
If it would lift the curse,
I'd let it tear you apart,

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:40.060
but even that wouldn't end
the killing now, would it?

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:43.190
No, it wouldn't. It would have to kill
all of us to be at peace.

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:48.020
Milady, Osa has something to say.

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:53.240
Forgive me, milady. You must not
make light of the boy's strength.

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:58.120
Young man, like you,
I know what rage feels like...

00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:01.790
and grief and helplessness.

00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:06.750
But you must not take
your revenge on Lady Eboshi.

00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:12.840
She is the only one who saw us
as human beings. We are lepers.

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:16.340
The world hates and fears us,

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:21.060
but she took us in and washed
our rotting flesh and bandaged us.

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:25.060
Osa?

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:28.810
Life is suffering. It is hard.

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:33.610
The world is cursed, but still,
you find reasons to keep living.

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:36.360
I'm sorry.
I'm making no sense.

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:57.590
They just keep coming back.

00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:00.970
Every night they're out there
planting trees,

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:03.020
trying to turn the mountain
into a forest again.

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:06.480
Stay here. Help me kill
the Forest Spirit, Ashitaka.

00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:09.860
You would do that?
Kill the very heart of the forest?

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.020
Without that ancient god,
the animals here

00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:14.440
would be nothing
but dumb beasts once more.

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:18.450
When the forest has been cleared
and the wolves wiped out,

00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:20.320
this desolate place
will be the richest land in the world,

00:42:20.410 --> 00:42:21.910
and Princess Mononoke
will become human.

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:24.120
Princess Mononoke?

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:28.040
Princess of the spirits of ghouls,
beasts and ancient gods.

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:30.460
The wolf stole her soul,
and now she lives to kill me.

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:39.760
The legends say the blood of the Great
Forest's Spirit can heal anything.

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:45.270
Perhaps it could cure my poor lepers.
Might even be able to lift your curse.

00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:49.270
Milady!
How does the action feel to you?

00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:52.860
Smooth as silk, the perfect thing
for ruling the world.

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:54.940
It's still too heavy for the girls.

00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:56.650
All right.

00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:25.680
Well, look who's here.

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:28.100
Evening. All right if I work
the bellows for a while?

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:30.020
Well, I guess so.

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:34.440
Excuse me. May I try it?

00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:37.940
It's okay.
Might as well let him try.

00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:52.460
When you get tired,
I'll take over for you.

00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:54.460
Well, that won't be long.

00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:57.710
Better keep
that kimono shut tight, girl.

00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:00.920
I'm impressed, but you'll
never keep that pace up.

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:03.300
It's hard work, isn't it?

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:06.060
You bet, and our shifts
are four days long.

00:44:06.850 --> 00:44:08.640
You must lead hard lives here.

00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:13.350
Yeah, I suppose. But it sure beats
working a brothel in the city?

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:17.190
Here we get to eat as much as we want,
and the men don't bother us!

00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:19.110
I see.

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:05.740
-No!
-But you can't leave tomorrow.

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:07.070
Can't you stay a little longer?

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:08.830
You can stay and work here.

00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:12.040
Thanks, but there's someone
I have to find out there in the forest.

00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:19.750
She's here.

00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:27.140
The wolves are coming.

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:08.510
Stop!

00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:10.470
Wait! I don't want to fight you.
I'm a friend.

00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:17.270
Hurry! She's after Lady Eboshi!

00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:19.100
Somebody cut her off!

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:30.280
Keep stoking those fires!

00:46:30.370 --> 00:46:32.620
Riflemen to the stockade.
We've got her right where we want her.

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.910
A weapon for every man!
Everyone defends Irontown!

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:38.790
Toki, she's on the roof.

00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:41.670
Now, don't get excited.
Keep those bellows working.

00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:43.420
Whatever happens,
we can't let those fires go out.

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:48.260
-Is she alone?
-Yes. We have her cornered.

00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:50.550
You know she means
to kill you this time.

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:53.010
We'll see about that.
Come on.

00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:05.530
Can you hear me, Princess of Beasts?
If it's me you want, here I am.

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:09.150
If you seek revenge
for all the animals we've killed,

00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:14.160
well, there are two women down
here whom I'd like you to meet.

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:16.330
They want revenge
for husbands killed by your wolves.

00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:18.960
Come on out, you little witch!
My husband's dead because of you!

00:47:29.090 --> 00:47:30.840
There she is!

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:37.140
Everybody out of the way!
Riflemen, get ready to fire!

00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:45.440
It's a trap. No! Wait!

00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:49.440
Princess of the wolf gods!
Don't go down there!

00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:50.650
Go back to the forest!

00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:57.120
Don't throw your life away!

00:47:57.870 --> 00:47:59.160
Shall I stop him?

00:47:59.250 --> 00:48:01.500
Leave him be.
Let him do what he likes.

00:48:22.310 --> 00:48:24.560
She's down! We got her!

00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:26.150
Stay back.

00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:29.070
Cut off a wolf's head,
and it still has the power to bite.

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:32.990
-Take aim where she falls.
-Right.

00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:52.970
Open fire.

00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:03.600
Stay back!

00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:13.240
Wake up.

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:20.370
No!

00:49:39.890 --> 00:49:42.770
-Skin her!
-Kill her, milady! Kill her!

00:49:42.850 --> 00:49:44.060
Kill her!

00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:49.980
Are you all right, sir?
Can I help you?

00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:01.790
Get away from me!
Begone!

00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:10.630
Traitor! You're a spy
for the wolves, aren't you?

00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:14.590
Stay back!

00:50:18.970 --> 00:50:20.100
Step aside.

00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:39.030
What do you think you're doing, boy?

00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:40.950
The girl's life is now mine.

00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:44.910
I'm sure she'll make
a lovely wife for you.

00:50:45.370 --> 00:50:48.500
There's a demon inside of you.
It's inside both of you.

00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:55.510
Look, everyone!

00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:59.090
This is what hatred looks like. This is
what it does when it catches hold of you.

00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:01.970
It's eating me alive,
and very soon now it will kill me!

00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:04.970
Fear and anger
only make it grow faster.

00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:08.060
I'm getting a little bored
of this curse of yours, Ashitaka.

00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:09.850
Let me just cut the damn thing off!

00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:16.570
Lady Eboshi!

00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:21.070
Someone come here
and take her from me.

00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:25.120
Milady!

00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:29.920
Don't worry. She's just stunned.
She'll be all right.

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:37.010
As for me, I'm leaving,
and I'm taking the Wolf Girl!

00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:41.010
No, you're not!
Nobody treats my Lady Eboshi like that!

00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:45.390
Move and I fire!

00:51:57.690 --> 00:51:59.190
Kiyo, what are you doing?

00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:05.950
How can he still be walking?

00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:15.000
-Is she all right?
-Yes, milady's safe, sir.

00:52:15.090 --> 00:52:19.170
Someone bring me my gun!
Riflemen to the square now, on the double!

00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:20.880
They're not getting
out of here alive!

00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:24.050
Toki, come here.

00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:31.020
What? What's happened?

00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:47.740
Sir, I can't let you pass.

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:50.790
The gate's been ordered shut.
It can't be opened.

00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:55.790
Turn back, please.

00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:59.130
We're grateful. You brought those men
back to us. We don't want to hurt you.

00:52:59.210 --> 00:53:00.010
Please!

00:53:00.670 --> 00:53:02.760
I walked in
through this gate this morning.

00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:04.720
Now I'm going to leave the same way.

00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:09.010
Don't be a fool.
It takes ten men to open this gate.

00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:19.070
Stop it! You'll kill yourself.

00:53:28.490 --> 00:53:29.660
It's opening.

00:53:36.670 --> 00:53:38.500
Out of the way!

00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:43.720
The wolves are attacking!

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:44.880
Flint!

00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:47.890
She's all right!
Your princess is safe with me!

00:53:50.850 --> 00:53:52.180
Stay and I will bring her!

00:53:52.270 --> 00:53:53.680
Come on, Yakul.

00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:00.110
You have my thanks.

00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:08.370
Good luck, stranger.

00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:32.600
Stop it!

00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:36.060
Leave him! He's mine!

00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:51.200
His own people shot him.
He's dying.

00:54:54.910 --> 00:54:58.210
Why did you stop me from killing her?
Tell me while you're still alive.

00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:02.710
I didn't want them to kill you.
That's why.

00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:06.970
I'm not afraid to die. I'd do anything
to get you humans out of my forest.

00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:10.470
I knew that
from the first moment I saw you.

00:55:10.590 --> 00:55:14.010
And I'm not afraid of you!
I should kill you for saving her!

00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:21.230
That woman is evil. There's no one
who can stop me from killing her.

00:55:22.690 --> 00:55:23.690
No. Live.

00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:26.400
That's enough!
I'm not listening to you anymore!

00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:30.820
You're beautiful.

00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:37.910
What is it, San?
Want me to crunch his face off?

00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:51.260
The ape tribe.

00:55:52.590 --> 00:55:57.020
Apes, how dare you show
such disrespect to the wolf clan.

00:55:57.970 --> 00:56:00.190
This is our forest.

00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:02.400
The human, give him to us.

00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:05.900
Give us the human and go.

00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:08.320
You go before my fangs find you.

00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:10.400
We will not go.

00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:12.780
We will eat the human.

00:56:12.910 --> 00:56:14.320
We will eat the human.

00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:16.490
Yes, let us eat the man creature.

00:56:16.580 --> 00:56:20.790
Are you crazy? Just what happened to make
the ape tribe change this way?

00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:23.290
Since when do apes
eat the flesh of a man?

00:56:23.830 --> 00:56:28.250
If we eat the human,
we will steal his strength,

00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:31.800
and we will drive the other humans away.
Give us the man creature.

00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:36.430
Stop this. You know you can't possess
the humans' strength by eating them.

00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:39.060
All that'll do is make you
into something else,

00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:40.560
something even worse than human.

00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:45.020
We plant trees. Humans tear them up.

00:56:45.110 --> 00:56:48.190
The forest does not come back.

00:56:48.270 --> 00:56:50.110
If we kill the humans,
we will save the forest.

00:56:50.690 --> 00:56:54.780
You mustn't give up. We'll find a way.
The Forest Spirit is with us.

00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:57.080
Keep planting trees
and someday we'll beat them.

00:56:57.620 --> 00:57:01.620
The Forest Spirit will not fight.
We will all die.

00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:05.080
Wolf Girl does not care.
She is human.

00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:10.260
Enough! I'll bite
your head off, you chattering ape.

00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:14.720
Stop!

00:57:23.350 --> 00:57:25.100
Don't worry about them.
It's all right.

00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:29.320
You two go on ahead now.
I'll stay here and deal with the human.

00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:31.900
What about the elk?
Can we eat him?

00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:38.200
No, you may not. Go home!

00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:48.040
Come over here.
Don't worry. I'm a friend.

00:57:48.670 --> 00:57:51.750
Don't be shy. I won't hurt you.
I need you to help me carry him.

00:59:47.330 --> 00:59:51.290
You're very wise. You know better
than to set foot on this island, huh?

00:59:52.830 --> 00:59:54.340
I smell like a human.

01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:07.100
You can go wherever you want to.
You're free now.

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:41.190
There he is.
Come and see. Hurry.

01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:44.860
It's the Nightwalker.

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:46.860
Quick, you idiots.

01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:50.830
He's the reason we've been sitting around
in these stinking animal skins, you know.

01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:53.540
But sir, we can't.
It's a sin to look at it.

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:57.040
And you call yourself
the greatest hunter in the West.

01:01:57.130 --> 01:01:59.920
Look. We've got a letter
of pardon from the emperor,

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.800
forgiving us for cutting off the head
of the Great Forest Spirit.

01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:11.430
The legends tell us
that when day becomes night,

01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:14.270
the Forest Spirit
turns into the Nightwalker,

01:02:14.350 --> 01:02:16.600
and at sunrise,
it changes back.

01:02:16.810 --> 01:02:18.810
Look! See there?
It's happening.

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:42.650
Take a look, Master Jigo.

01:03:42.730 --> 01:03:44.520
What is it?

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:46.820
Over there.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.330
Look. There must be hundreds of them.

01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:04.840
Those boars are not from this region.

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:07.300
They must've been traveling
for months to get here.

01:04:15.050 --> 01:04:17.010
That one's Okkoto!

01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:19.810
Can't be. They say he died 100 years ago.

01:04:19.890 --> 01:04:21.940
It's him, all right.
I know those old tusks.

01:04:22.730 --> 01:04:25.190
And it looks like he brought
along his whole tribe.

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:30.320
He's seen us!
Let's get out of here!

01:04:43.710 --> 01:04:45.920
Come on, you cowards!
Move! Quickly!

01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:41.060
The bullet wound's gone.

01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:52.610
Yakul.

01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:20.390
You're awake. You should thank Yakul.
He hasn't left your side this whole time.

01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:24.140
How'd you know his name's Yakul?

01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:27.190
He told me, and he told me about you--

01:06:27.270 --> 01:06:30.270
about your village,
your people and your forest.

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:34.740
The Forest Spirit brought you back
to life again. He wants you to live.

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:40.030
I had the strangest dream.
There was a golden creature.

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:41.330
Eat this.

01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:47.830
Chew.

01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:21.260
We are here to kill the humans
and save the forest.

01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:23.300
Why are there humans here, Moro?

01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:25.850
Humans are everywhere
these days.

01:08:25.930 --> 01:08:31.560
Go back to your own mountain. Kill them
there. The girl is San, my daughter.

01:08:32.230 --> 01:08:35.770
We will kill them here.
We will save this forest.

01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:38.280
What is that other human
doing here?

01:08:39.030 --> 01:08:41.700
He was shot, and then
the Great Spirit healed his wound.

01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:42.950
This man is not our enemy!

01:08:43.530 --> 01:08:48.540
The Forest Spirit saved him?
Saved the life of that loathsome runt?

01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:52.460
Why didn't he save Nago?

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:55.960
Is he not the guardian of the forest? Why?

01:08:56.540 --> 01:09:00.300
The Forest Spirit gives life
and takes life away.

01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:04.090
Life and death are his alone,
or have you boars forgotten that?

01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:08.760
You lie! You must have begged
the Forest Spirit to spare his life!

01:09:08.850 --> 01:09:10.890
But you did not beg
for Nago, did you?

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:15.690
Nago was afraid to die.
Now I, too,

01:09:15.810 --> 01:09:19.980
carry within my breast
a poisoned human bullet.

01:09:20.070 --> 01:09:24.530
Nago fled, and the darkness took him.
I remain and contemplate my death.

01:09:24.610 --> 01:09:26.490
Mother! Please ask
the Forest Spirit to save you.

01:09:26.570 --> 01:09:29.830
I have lived long enough, San.

01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:33.250
Soon the Forest Spirit
will let me rest forever.

01:09:33.710 --> 01:09:36.460
All these years you defended
the Forest Spirit! He must save you!

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.590
You are not fooling us.

01:09:38.670 --> 01:09:42.090
Nago was beautiful and strong.
He would not have run from anything.

01:09:42.670 --> 01:09:45.300
You wolves must have eaten him!

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:48.680
Quiet! Watch what you say,
you filthy pig!

01:09:48.970 --> 01:09:51.810
Gods of the mountain,
please listen to me.

01:09:52.730 --> 01:09:55.600
Nago died far from here,
and I was the one who killed him.

01:09:56.270 --> 01:10:00.230
He had become some kind of demon.
One day he attacked our village.

01:10:00.690 --> 01:10:04.320
If you want proof,
look at my hand where he touched me.

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:14.330
I came here to beg the Forest Spirit
to lift Nago's curse from me.

01:10:15.210 --> 01:10:18.830
He healed the bullet wound in my side,
but the demon mark remains.

01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:24.840
First it will tear my soul apart,
and then it will kill me.

01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:33.220
Okkoto, finally,
a boar who will listen to reason.

01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:39.060
No, Lord Okkoto, wait!

01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:41.270
Please, you mustn't eat him.

01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:47.700
You are Moro's human child, aren't you?
I have heard of you.

01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:50.700
You're blind.

01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:54.200
Stand back.
I will not eat him.

01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:55.700
It's all right, San.

01:10:56.540 --> 01:11:00.420
My Lord Okkoto, what I said
about Nago's death was the truth.

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:17.180
I believe you,
and I thank you for it, young one.

01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:23.650
I am only grieved and ashamed
that a demon has come from our tribe.

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:29.030
O mighty Lord, is there a way
to lift Nago's curse from me?

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:35.790
Leave this forest... for the next time
we meet I will have to kill you.

01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:40.750
You cannot win against the humans.
Their guns will destroy you all.

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:46.380
Look on my tribe, Moro.
We grow small, and we grow stupid.

01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:48.760
We will soon be nothing
but squealing game

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:52.510
that the humans
hunt for their meat.

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:57.470
You'd risk everything on one last battle?
That's just what the humans want.

01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:01.480
I do not ask for the help
of the wolf tribe.

01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:08.400
Even if every one of us dies, it will be
a battle the humans will never forget.

01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:35.350
The Forest Spirit.

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:53.910
Come on! Keep your oxen together!
Hurry!

01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:59.160
Get ready now.
Little bit closer.

01:13:00.330 --> 01:13:01.540
Fire!

01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:08.960
Reload! Fire!

01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:17.140
Ready--

01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:27.690
Well, I see somebody is going to have
to go play the peacemaker.

01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:30.480
Take our riflemen
and hide behind the cliffs.

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:54.090
-There they are!
-Where?

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:00.560
The hunters are ready, sir.

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:02.600
Excellent.
Well done, my boy.

01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:06.480
Go and spread the word.
We'll be moving out presently.

01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:12.570
Greetings, Jigo.

01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:14.820
I've got the emperor
breathing down my neck,

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:17.320
and you're busy playing war
with Lord Asano.

01:14:17.950 --> 01:14:21.490
And you'd have nothing to do with him
being here, now, would you?

01:14:21.870 --> 01:14:24.710
Of course not.
Whatever made you think that?

01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:27.120
He'll call a truce
if I give him half my iron.

01:14:27.210 --> 01:14:29.000
Is that right?
Well, he's a greedy bastard, isn't he?

01:14:29.790 --> 01:14:32.630
But all the same, you might as well
let him have his iron.

01:14:32.710 --> 01:14:35.630
Listen, the boars are gathering
for battle. You know what that means.

01:14:36.510 --> 01:14:38.720
You made a promise.
Get me the head of the Forest Spirit,

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:42.600
then we can come back
and destroy Lord Asano together.

01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:46.270
Watch out, milady!
There's a horseman coming! Get in!

01:14:51.570 --> 01:14:54.570
Well, speak of the devil,
a messenger from Lord Asano.

01:14:54.650 --> 01:14:56.780
We have guests.
Mind your manners, ladies.

01:14:56.860 --> 01:14:58.030
Yes, ma'am.

01:15:00.370 --> 01:15:02.080
Welcome back, milady!

01:15:04.830 --> 01:15:07.000
Whoa! Wait!
Won't you even talk to the man?

01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:15.630
Lady Eboshi, mistress of Irontown! I bring
a message to you from my Lord Asano.

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:19.680
You have fought valiantly and well.

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:21.600
Now, open your gates
that we may speak with you.

01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:24.600
Hmph! We can hear you
just fine from down there.

01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:27.560
Milady took this mountain away
from the gods, the boars and beasts!

01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:29.900
And now that it's worth something,
you want it!

01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:31.440
Well, you won't get it!

01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:34.190
You ladies need to be taught some respect!

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:35.780
Respect? What's that?

01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:39.660
We haven't had any respect
since the day we were born!

01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:43.370
You want some of our iron?
Here ya go!

01:15:51.330 --> 01:15:54.000
They are really something.

01:15:54.090 --> 01:15:57.090
They'll fight forest gods or samurai.
It doesn't matter to them.

01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:01.220
They're an amazing bunch, your girls.
They were wasted in the brothels.

01:16:03.050 --> 01:16:04.970
Impressive for a piece of paper.

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:08.850
Well, you know, it's gotten me
all the best hunters and trappers around.

01:16:08.930 --> 01:16:11.940
Remember, my dear lady,
we're after a god, not just a beast.

01:16:13.770 --> 01:16:15.150
Yes, milady, what is it?

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:17.860
Do you have any idea
who this paper has come from?

01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:20.030
From the emperor himself.

01:16:20.110 --> 01:16:22.450
-The emperor?
-Who's he?

01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:24.990
-The <i>Mikado</i>.
-The <i>Mikado</i>?

01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:28.290
Okay, you got me there.

01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:30.160
-Thank you.
-Yes, milady.

01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:34.540
Every day that we cut trees
and dig for iron,

01:16:34.630 --> 01:16:36.250
the forest and its creatures grow weaker.

01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:38.420
My way,
there is no loss of life, Jigo.

01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:41.720
Listen, you owe me
and I've come to collect.

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:45.760
When you needed riflemen, I sent them,
and without them, you lose Irontown.

01:16:45.850 --> 01:16:48.850
I'm sorry.
Did that sound like a threat?

01:16:48.930 --> 01:16:51.390
Don't tell me
the emperor believes...

01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:53.940
that wives' tale about the Great Spirit's
head granting immortality.

01:16:54.100 --> 01:16:58.190
I'm sure I don't know what the emperor
believes. I'm just a humble monk.

01:16:58.280 --> 01:16:59.740
I'm just trying to get by.

01:17:00.990 --> 01:17:02.530
I keep my promises.

01:17:02.610 --> 01:17:06.990
We have fought the boars before. They're
easier to kill than Moro and her cubs.

01:17:07.950 --> 01:17:11.750
So you can call out that shady bunch
you've got hidden under the cliff, Jigo.

01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:16.540
So I've been found out.

01:17:16.630 --> 01:17:19.000
Just one more thing, milady.

01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:21.510
Did a stranger come through here,
by any chance?

01:17:22.170 --> 01:17:25.010
He's a young man
riding a great big red elk.

01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:26.930
Came and went.

01:17:46.490 --> 01:17:48.410
A bad-looking bunch,
if you ask me.

01:17:48.490 --> 01:17:50.490
Those men are
no ordinary hunters.

01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:52.370
-They're killers.
-Killers?

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:55.120
Milady, at least let
some of us go with you.

01:17:55.210 --> 01:17:56.880
Yes, you can't trust these men.
They're strangers.

01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:00.300
What if it goes wrong
and we're stuck here? We can't help you.

01:18:00.380 --> 01:18:02.130
You said yourself we're better shots
than the men are.

01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:06.010
That's precisely why I want
you all here in Irontown.

01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:09.390
I can deal with forest gods.
It's humans I'm worried about.

01:18:10.510 --> 01:18:13.850
Once the Forest Spirit is dead,
we don't know what will happen.

01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:16.520
Will Jigo be satisfied
with the creature's head

01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:18.270
or will he be after my ironworks as well?

01:18:19.190 --> 01:18:20.980
Jigo's riflemen may turn on us.

01:18:21.070 --> 01:18:22.860
If that happens, I'll need
every one of you here to fight them.

01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:27.360
Remember, you can't trust men.

01:18:27.910 --> 01:18:32.080
Don't worry about her ladyship.
I'll be right at her side, protecting her.

01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:34.500
-That's what we're afraid of.
-What?

01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:37.040
Even if you were a woman,
you'd still be an idiot!

01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:48.400
Do you suffer?

01:19:50.570 --> 01:19:54.240
You know, you could always jump, boy.
End it all.

01:19:54.330 --> 01:19:57.620
As soon as your strength returns,
the mark will spread and destroy you.

01:19:58.790 --> 01:20:01.250
It feels like I must've been asleep
for weeks.

01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:04.590
I had a dream that San
was by my side, nursing me.

01:20:05.130 --> 01:20:08.260
I was hoping you'd cry out in your sleep.

01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:11.590
Then I would have bitten
your head off to silence you.

01:20:11.970 --> 01:20:13.680
It's a beautiful forest.

01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:15.640
Are Okkoto
and the boars on the move yet?

01:20:16.180 --> 01:20:18.390
Yes, the boars are marching.

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:23.150
The trees cry out as they die,
but you cannot hear them.

01:20:24.190 --> 01:20:29.070
I listen to the forest's pain and feel
the ache of the bullet in my chest,

01:20:29.150 --> 01:20:31.570
and I dream of the day

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:35.200
when I will finally crunch
that gun woman's head in my jaws.

01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:39.330
Moro, why can't the humans
and the forest live together?

01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:41.250
Why can't we stop
this fighting now?

01:20:41.370 --> 01:20:43.920
The humans are gathering
for the final battle.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.590
The flames of their guns
will burn us all.

01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:50.090
And what happens to San?
What's your plan, to let her die with you?

01:20:50.260 --> 01:20:54.140
Typical. Selfish.
You think like a human.

01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:57.220
San is my daughter.
She is of the wolf tribe.

01:20:57.310 --> 01:21:00.640
When the forest dies, so does she.

01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:03.350
You must set her free!
She's not a wolf! She's human!

01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:05.440
Silence, boy.

01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:08.530
How dare you speak
to a god like that?

01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:12.740
I caught her human parents
defiling my forest.

01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:15.370
They threw their baby
at my feet as they ran away.

01:21:15.530 --> 01:21:18.790
Instead of eating her,
I raised her as my own.

01:21:18.870 --> 01:21:22.410
Now, my poor, ugly, beautiful daughter
is neither human nor wolf.

01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:25.040
How could you help her?

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:29.750
I don't know, but at least
we might find a way to live.

01:21:32.050 --> 01:21:36.930
How? Will you join forces with San
and fight the humans?

01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:40.430
No. All that would do
is cause more hatred.

01:21:40.970 --> 01:21:45.440
There is nothing
you can do, boy.

01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:48.690
Soon the demon mark
will spread and kill you.

01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:51.150
Leave this place at sunrise.
Return and I shall kill you.

01:22:05.330 --> 01:22:06.420
You're feeling all right?

01:22:09.170 --> 01:22:11.920
I'm fine, thanks to you
and the Forest Spirit.

01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:15.690
Yakul, sorry if I worried you.

01:23:20.530 --> 01:23:22.830
I guess my legs are still
pretty weak?

01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:57.150
It's so quiet. I wonder
where the little kodama went.

01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:06.580
I can smell the ironworks.

01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:17.340
Thanks for showing us the way!
I have another favour to ask!

01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:21.430
Will you please give this
to San for me?

01:24:29.980 --> 01:24:31.350
Let's go.

01:25:02.590 --> 01:25:04.970
It stinks,
and it burns my eyes.

01:25:05.050 --> 01:25:09.810
That's what they want. They're trying
to kill our sense of smell.

01:25:09.890 --> 01:25:10.930
It's that damn woman again.

01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:22.200
She knows we're out here.

01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:25.570
-It's a trap and a stupid one.
-What?

01:25:26.030 --> 01:25:30.160
They're trying to lure
the boars out of the forest.

01:25:30.250 --> 01:25:32.040
The humans are planning something.

01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:35.170
Then we have to find Okkoto
while there's still time to stop him

01:25:35.250 --> 01:25:36.130
or they'll be killed!

01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:39.340
Okkoto is too stubborn.
He won't listen. None of them will.

01:25:39.420 --> 01:25:43.930
They may even know it's a trap.

01:25:44.010 --> 01:25:46.640
The boars are a proud race.

01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:51.350
The last one left alive
will still be charging blindly forward.

01:25:56.310 --> 01:25:57.810
Why chop the trees down?

01:25:57.900 --> 01:25:59.770
To make them angry,
which makes them stupid.

01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:04.900
Mother, I have to go.
Okkoto's blind.

01:26:04.990 --> 01:26:07.660
I must be his eyes.

01:26:07.740 --> 01:26:09.280
You understand?

01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:11.950
Do as you must.

01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:16.250
You know that boy wanted to share
his life with you.

01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:18.500
I hate him!
I hate all humans!

01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:32.930
From Ashitaka for me?

01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:37.690
Pretty.

01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:40.230
You two, stay with San.

01:26:40.730 --> 01:26:43.030
I must go to the Forest Spirit.

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:44.150
Let's go.

01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:09.090
The Moro tribe has come to fight with you.
Where can I find Lord Okkoto?

01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:13.510
Thank you.

01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:40.520
It's coming from Irontown.

01:28:46.230 --> 01:28:47.440
Let's go!

01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:52.360
Who goes there?

01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:53.660
Samurai again.

01:28:55.950 --> 01:28:56.740
Halt, I said!

01:28:57.790 --> 01:28:59.330
Out of the way!

01:29:15.890 --> 01:29:17.390
What the devil
was that thing?

01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:23.900
Don't waste your arrows.
He's knocking them away.

01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:26.270
-He's a dead man anyway.
-Cease fire!

01:29:50.590 --> 01:29:51.710
Toki, come and look.

01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:53.380
It can't be. It's Ashitaka.

01:29:53.470 --> 01:29:54.470
So it's not a ghost.

01:29:55.130 --> 01:29:56.800
Ashitaka!

01:29:56.890 --> 01:29:57.930
Toki!

01:29:58.390 --> 01:29:59.680
Are you all right?

01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:01.140
We're all right.

01:30:01.310 --> 01:30:05.770
Lord Asano's samurai thought they'd try
and ambush us while our men were away.

01:30:05.850 --> 01:30:09.360
-Thought we'd just roll over.
-But we showed them!

01:30:09.570 --> 01:30:10.400
Where's Lady Eboshi?

01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:15.110
She took every able-bodied man
and went to kill the Forest Spirit.

01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:17.200
We're cut off here. Can't
get a message to Lady Eboshi.

01:30:17.370 --> 01:30:20.700
The Forest Spirit.
That explains the explosions.

01:30:21.330 --> 01:30:23.410
Hey, sir, I've still
got your bow and arrows!

01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:26.040
Aren't you gonna tell him
you've got his cloak and saddle too?

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:27.710
-I do?
-You're useless.

01:30:28.290 --> 01:30:29.960
Many thanks, Kohroku!

01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:32.710
I'll try and bring you some help!
Can you hold out?

01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:36.260
Don't worry! We can always pour
hot iron on them.

01:30:36.340 --> 01:30:37.840
Bring back Lady Eboshi!

01:30:37.930 --> 01:30:40.010
And don't take too long!

01:30:45.140 --> 01:30:46.350
I missed.

01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:48.400
They're bringing boats
across the river!

01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:52.440
Go and get Lady Eboshi.
We'll hold them off as long as we can!

01:30:54.110 --> 01:30:56.070
I'll be back! I promise!

01:30:58.910 --> 01:31:01.120
Be careful!

01:31:04.330 --> 01:31:05.750
Get him!
Stop that man!

01:31:15.670 --> 01:31:17.680
Looks like they'll try
to cut us off. Run, Yakul.

01:32:00.890 --> 01:32:02.640
Burning animal flesh.

01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:10.020
Yakul!

01:32:48.890 --> 01:32:50.020
Stay back!

01:33:02.780 --> 01:33:04.780
Show me your wound.

01:33:06.660 --> 01:33:09.290
You'll have to stay here. Wait for me.
I'll come back for you.

01:33:12.210 --> 01:33:13.750
I said, stay!

01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:26.260
We're almost there,
my friend.

01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:11.970
Who goes there?

01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:16.060
My orders are no outsiders
permitted here.

01:34:16.900 --> 01:34:18.770
All right, but I've just come
from Irontown.

01:34:19.150 --> 01:34:21.610
I have a message for Lady Eboshi.
Tell me where she is.

01:34:22.030 --> 01:34:24.070
The Eboshi woman's not here.

01:34:24.150 --> 01:34:25.860
Give me the message.
I'll make sure she gets it.

01:34:26.490 --> 01:34:28.700
I must speak with her.
Now where is she?

01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:32.540
It's really you?
You're still alive, lad?

01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:34.960
It looks like you men
had a worse time than I did.

01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:36.920
We've been burying
our friends all day.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.170
It was horrible.

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:40.840
-Irontown has come under attack.
-What?

01:34:41.550 --> 01:34:44.510
The women and the lepers
have fallen back to the inner wall.

01:34:44.590 --> 01:34:45.800
We haven't got a lot of time.

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:47.220
Those samurai bastards.

01:34:47.300 --> 01:34:49.720
Asano must've just been waiting
for us to leave Irontown.

01:34:50.180 --> 01:34:51.930
Now I must find Lady Eboshi.

01:34:52.010 --> 01:34:54.770
She's off hunting down
the Forest Spirit.

01:34:54.850 --> 01:34:56.730
Then someone's got
to stop her. Call her back.

01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:59.730
If you're all done,
I want you out of here.

01:34:59.810 --> 01:35:00.820
The rest of you, keep digging!

01:35:00.980 --> 01:35:02.610
Wait! What about Irontown?

01:35:02.690 --> 01:35:04.440
That's right! It's our home!

01:35:04.820 --> 01:35:07.110
What do they expect us to do,
abandon Irontown?

01:35:07.860 --> 01:35:09.820
You heard the boy!
We haven't a moment to lose.

01:35:09.910 --> 01:35:11.580
Send a message to Lady Eboshi!

01:35:11.660 --> 01:35:14.830
No messenger would have
a chance of finding her!

01:35:14.950 --> 01:35:17.830
Then send out a hunter!
What else are they good for?

01:35:18.420 --> 01:35:21.130
Lady Eboshi
is just being used by Jigo.

01:35:21.790 --> 01:35:25.050
When you fought with the boars,
were there any wolves with them?

01:35:25.130 --> 01:35:27.430
Did you see San,
the Wolf Girl?

01:35:27.510 --> 01:35:31.010
I have no idea. It was pitch black
when the animals came at us.

01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:33.100
She was there.
I saw her.

01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:36.350
I was right in the front line.
I saw everything, everything.

01:35:36.430 --> 01:35:38.770
-What happened?
-I'm not sure!

01:35:38.850 --> 01:35:41.730
Everything started happening so fast.
It was like a nightmare.

01:35:41.810 --> 01:35:45.110
Jigo's troops put us in front
as bait to lure the boars in.

01:35:45.190 --> 01:35:47.320
They didn't tell us
about the land mines under our feet...

01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:49.610
or the grenades
coming in on top of us.

01:36:43.130 --> 01:36:44.670
Where's San?

01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:51.470
Take it easy.
I'm trying to get you out.

01:36:55.010 --> 01:36:58.310
There's a wolf over here!

01:36:58.640 --> 01:36:59.980
Hey! Hurry!

01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:05.400
Young master!

01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:07.690
What do you think you're doing?

01:37:08.730 --> 01:37:12.400
I have got to find Lady Eboshi.
This wolf's gonna help me find her.

01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:15.450
You're on their side,
aren't you, boy?

01:37:15.910 --> 01:37:17.330
Stand aside!

01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:21.660
What's more important? The head
of the Forest Spirit or saving your town?

01:37:22.540 --> 01:37:23.540
Those darts are poison.

01:37:29.710 --> 01:37:31.010
That's enough now!

01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:39.640
I'm not gonna slave any longer!

01:37:40.430 --> 01:37:42.980
Heave.

01:37:49.900 --> 01:37:51.360
Look out!

01:38:02.910 --> 01:38:06.080
After you've come through the swamp,
take cover by the lake until we get there.

01:38:06.460 --> 01:38:09.170
Be careful.
Those riflemen with milady belong to Jigo.

01:38:09.710 --> 01:38:12.880
Here. Take these. Where I'm going,
they won't be of any use.

01:38:15.010 --> 01:38:18.140
You go with them, Yakul.
Look after him!

01:38:21.810 --> 01:38:23.980
Find San!
That's where we'll find Eboshi!

01:38:35.900 --> 01:38:39.330
Come on. Keep moving.
Straight ahead. Today we finish this.

01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:43.290
Sir.

01:38:43.370 --> 01:38:45.330
Yes? Have you spotted them?

01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:47.670
Okkoto's badly wounded.

01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:50.380
He and the Wolf Girl are making their way
to the realm of the Forest Spirit.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:54.420
So they're going to beg him
for his help, are they? Keep after them,

01:38:55.010 --> 01:38:57.640
but stay out of sight or you'll scare
the Forest Spirit away.

01:38:57.720 --> 01:38:59.850
Yes, sir. I understand.

01:39:00.970 --> 01:39:03.720
That was boar's blood
painted on his face, wasn't it?

01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:06.850
A little trade secret.
Don't want to smell human.

01:39:14.900 --> 01:39:18.410
We're almost at the pool
of the Forest Spirit.

01:39:36.130 --> 01:39:37.340
What was that?

01:39:40.390 --> 01:39:43.310
Lord Okkoto, something's wrong.
We have to keep moving.

01:39:44.350 --> 01:39:45.850
Something's out there.

01:39:45.930 --> 01:39:48.980
What? With so much blood
in the air, I can't smell it.

01:39:54.190 --> 01:39:54.900
I should have known it was you!

01:39:55.070 --> 01:39:57.030
You did this!

01:39:57.110 --> 01:39:59.200
Because of you, the forest will die!

01:39:59.910 --> 01:40:00.950
You're wrong!

01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:03.660
We've all been fighting to save it!
This is the thanks you give us?

01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:05.910
You bring bad things!

01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:08.660
Bad things coming,
neither human nor animal.

01:40:09.250 --> 01:40:11.790
What do you mean,
"neither human nor animal"?

01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:20.300
-They're coming!
-It's the end for us!

01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:40.820
They're warriors.

01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:45.830
They've come back.

01:40:47.410 --> 01:40:53.080
My warriors! They have come back to me
from the land of the dead.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:02.220
Forward, my warriors!
Forward to the pool of the Forest Spirit!

01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:12.440
No, Lord Okkoto!
Your warriors haven't come back to you.

01:41:17.860 --> 01:41:20.360
Those are humans wearing the skins
of your warriors to hide their scent!

01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:21.820
It's a trick!

01:41:24.490 --> 01:41:28.290
It's just a human trick to get us
to lead them to the Forest Spirit!

01:41:32.750 --> 01:41:34.670
Come out, Forest Spirit!

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.750
If you are truly master here,

01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:40.630
give my warriors the power
to slay the humans and be victorious!

01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:44.640
Stop, Lord Okkoto, please!
You've got to listen!

01:41:45.430 --> 01:41:48.640
San, they're all around us.
Okkoto's done for. Leave him!

01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:51.640
No! I won't let him turn
into a demon like Nago did!

01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:56.150
Tell mother that the humans are setting
a trap for the Forest Spirit.

01:41:56.650 --> 01:41:59.150
She'll know what to do.

01:42:00.900 --> 01:42:03.200
You'll have to hurry,
or it could mean the end of all of us!

01:42:04.610 --> 01:42:05.860
Go on now.

01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:26.890
Stay back or you die!

01:42:26.970 --> 01:42:30.260
And then this whole forest
will see just what you are!

01:42:41.150 --> 01:42:42.690
Ashitaka?

01:42:49.030 --> 01:42:50.080
Get back!

01:42:57.210 --> 01:43:01.550
I burn!
There are flames growing inside of me.

01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:04.380
You must fight it!

01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:07.800
Don't let yourself become a demon!

01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:11.260
Lord Okkoto!

01:43:14.270 --> 01:43:15.020
What is it?

01:43:18.850 --> 01:43:19.860
Is it San?

01:43:19.940 --> 01:43:21.650
-She's in danger.
-Let's go.

01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:51.600
I'm on fire.

01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:01.650
No!

01:44:01.730 --> 01:44:04.900
I don't want to become a demon!
Please stop, Okkoto!

01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:17.910
You're too slow! Get on!

01:44:32.260 --> 01:44:33.930
A wolf!

01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:37.520
Eboshi!

01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:46.110
You keep going!

01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:49.570
Eboshi!
I have something to say!

01:44:49.740 --> 01:44:51.030
Hold your fire!

01:44:51.110 --> 01:44:52.110
What is it you want?

01:44:52.950 --> 01:44:55.620
Lord Asano's samurai
have attacked Irontown!

01:44:55.700 --> 01:44:57.620
The women are outnumbered!
They can't hold them off for long!

01:44:58.120 --> 01:44:59.410
Forget about the Forest Spirit!

01:45:00.330 --> 01:45:04.170
Your men are already heading back,
but they need you to lead them!

01:45:04.750 --> 01:45:06.750
What proof is there this isn't a lie?

01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:10.670
Lie? Don't be ridiculous!
What reason do I have to lie?

01:45:11.260 --> 01:45:14.800
So we don't kill the forest gods.
Now you want us to kill samurai instead.

01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:19.470
No! What I want is for the humans
and the forest to live in peace!

01:45:22.020 --> 01:45:23.650
Just whose side is he on anyway?

01:45:23.730 --> 01:45:24.900
Shouldn't we go back?

01:45:25.650 --> 01:45:30.900
The women are on their own now.
They can take care of themselves.

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:35.990
There's the pool.
The creature must be somewhere nearby.

01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:39.540
It's the moment of truth, boys,
so keep your eyes peeled.

01:45:40.580 --> 01:45:42.210
Why do we need
that woman, sir?

01:45:42.290 --> 01:45:45.830
When you're going to kill a god,
let someone else do your dirty work.

01:46:12.650 --> 01:46:14.450
Moro, what happened to you?

01:46:14.530 --> 01:46:17.320
San! It's me, Ashitaka!

01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:19.530
San!

01:46:27.170 --> 01:46:28.250
Ashitaka!

01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:36.890
Okkoto?

01:46:45.140 --> 01:46:46.190
Leave, boy.

01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:50.020
Fight me and the Forest Spirit
will never come.

01:46:54.610 --> 01:46:57.530
Lord Okkoto, calm your fury!

01:47:01.620 --> 01:47:05.460
O mighty Lord, let me have the girl!
I beg of you! Please, let her go!

01:47:06.250 --> 01:47:09.330
San! Are you there?
It's me! Ashitaka!

01:47:15.590 --> 01:47:16.590
San!

01:47:23.930 --> 01:47:25.560
Kill him!

01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:32.150
Stop him!
He'll ruin everything!

01:47:56.760 --> 01:47:57.590
San!

01:48:00.180 --> 01:48:01.550
San!

01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:05.890
Ashitaka!

01:48:09.940 --> 01:48:11.230
San!

01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:12.440
Ashitaka!

01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:23.990
And here I was saving
the last of my strength

01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:26.580
to bite off that damn woman's head.
But I must save San.

01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:28.710
Close ranks!

01:48:46.260 --> 01:48:48.770
Don't touch him.

01:48:48.850 --> 01:48:50.690
He's no longer a god.

01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:01.910
You can't even speak,
can you?

01:49:03.070 --> 01:49:07.620
Well done, men. Now, fall back
and get the wounded out of here.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.540
Ooh, what a revolting spectacle.

01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:21.010
It's him.

01:49:33.650 --> 01:49:35.770
Give me back my daughter, demon.

01:49:58.380 --> 01:49:59.670
Ashitaka,

01:49:59.750 --> 01:50:02.130
can you save the girl you love?

01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:13.390
The Forest Spirit.

01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:25.570
Eboshi! Hold your fire!

01:50:39.460 --> 01:50:43.170
Eboshi!
Your enemy's not the Forest Spirit.

01:50:44.470 --> 01:50:45.510
But that should have killed it.

01:50:45.590 --> 01:50:47.010
He's a god.
It'll take more than one shot.

01:50:57.150 --> 01:50:57.900
San!

01:51:08.110 --> 01:51:09.370
Don't die.

01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:39.400
I don't get it. The Great Forest Spirit
took their lives away.

01:51:59.670 --> 01:52:01.670
Quick! He's starting to change.

01:52:01.750 --> 01:52:03.340
Now watch closely, everyone.

01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:06.050
I'm going to show you
how to kill a god,

01:52:06.210 --> 01:52:08.760
a god of life and death.

01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:11.470
The trick is not to fear him.

01:52:27.900 --> 01:52:29.570
No! Stop!

01:52:32.570 --> 01:52:33.580
Eboshi!

01:52:45.750 --> 01:52:48.470
You will die!

01:52:58.430 --> 01:53:00.810
She did it! Quickly!
Go get the head!

01:53:39.970 --> 01:53:42.810
Quick, Jigo!
Bring me that box of yours!

01:53:43.350 --> 01:53:46.400
The porters are all dead!
Hurry! Hurry!

01:53:47.980 --> 01:53:51.570
Be careful not to touch the spirit's body!
It'll suck the life out of you!

01:53:55.570 --> 01:53:57.830
Here it is!
One head, as promised!

01:54:06.420 --> 01:54:08.040
Milady!

01:54:08.130 --> 01:54:10.550
I told you.
A wolf's head can still bite.

01:54:11.050 --> 01:54:14.720
Come on!
We got to get out of here.

01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:15.840
It's coming, sir!

01:54:19.140 --> 01:54:20.850
Run!

01:54:37.530 --> 01:54:38.740
Gonza, we've got
to get to the island!

01:54:38.910 --> 01:54:40.200
Island? I can't swim!

01:54:40.290 --> 01:54:42.000
Then walk along the bottom.

01:55:10.150 --> 01:55:12.360
Give her to me!
I'll cut her throat!

01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:15.610
Your claim has been avenged.
Your mother saw to that. Here.

01:55:16.110 --> 01:55:17.160
Lady Eboshi.

01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:18.530
Help me.

01:55:22.490 --> 01:55:24.450
Don't waste your sympathy.

01:55:25.250 --> 01:55:27.420
I promised Toki
that I'd bring you back to Irontown.

01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:36.590
He's searching for his head.
We can't stay here.

01:55:36.670 --> 01:55:37.720
San,

01:55:38.260 --> 01:55:39.340
you have got to help us.

01:55:39.430 --> 01:55:42.060
No! You're on their side!
You always were!

01:55:42.140 --> 01:55:44.100
Take that damn woman
and just go away!

01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:49.270
Never!
I hate all of you humans!

01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:53.780
Yes, I'm human, San,
and so are you.

01:55:53.940 --> 01:55:56.820
Stop it!
I'm a wolf, you hear?

01:55:57.700 --> 01:55:59.700
-San?
-Stay back!

01:56:05.910 --> 01:56:08.830
I'm sorry.
I tried to stop it.

01:56:16.090 --> 01:56:20.010
It's over. Everything's over.
The forest is dead.

01:56:29.350 --> 01:56:33.770
Nothing is over. The two of us are
still alive. Now, will you help me, San?

01:56:59.300 --> 01:57:01.590
Hey, wait! Come back! Help us!

01:57:02.260 --> 01:57:04.550
A little crisis and they panic.

01:57:08.140 --> 01:57:09.680
Whoa! What are you doing?

01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:16.900
Look! The head is moving!

01:57:20.110 --> 01:57:21.950
It's calling him to us!

01:58:05.490 --> 01:58:07.450
-It shouldn't jam anymore.
-Thanks.

01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:11.250
-It's awfully quiet.
-Asano is waiting for sunrise.

01:58:12.410 --> 01:58:15.540
I wonder if that young man
ever found Lady Eboshi.

01:58:15.750 --> 01:58:18.000
Don't worry about him.
He found her, all right.

01:58:18.090 --> 01:58:20.710
They'll be marching
over that hill any minute now.

01:58:23.090 --> 01:58:25.590
Big dope. Don't ask me why I love him.

01:58:25.680 --> 01:58:30.060
-Hey, Kohroku!
-Let him sleep, Toki, while he can.

01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:43.360
-What's that?
-I don't know, but I don't like it.

01:58:55.370 --> 01:58:56.500
It's the Nightwalker!

01:59:10.850 --> 01:59:13.100
Everybody, hold your positions!

01:59:13.640 --> 01:59:16.230
-Toki, it's coming right at us.
-Run! We've gotta go!

01:59:17.020 --> 01:59:20.440
No! We promised Lady Eboshi
we would defend Irontown!

01:59:27.240 --> 01:59:28.820
Look! Over there!
He's come back!

01:59:34.200 --> 01:59:35.200
Get everyone out!

01:59:36.080 --> 01:59:38.830
The Great Spirit's head's been cut off,
and he wants it back!

01:59:39.540 --> 01:59:41.590
If that black ooze touches you,
you're dead!

01:59:42.250 --> 01:59:44.840
Run for the lake!
The water will slow it down!

01:59:45.720 --> 01:59:49.010
Lady Eboshi and the men
are on their way from the other side.

01:59:49.430 --> 01:59:53.470
I'm gonna try to return his head
before he kills us all. Hurry!

01:59:54.100 --> 01:59:56.350
-What are we gonna do now?
-It'll kill us all!

01:59:56.430 --> 01:59:58.560
-We'll never get out now!
-That's enough!

01:59:59.060 --> 02:00:00.940
Get everyone
down to the lake and stay calm.

02:00:01.020 --> 02:00:03.150
We can carry the sick and the wounded.

02:00:13.160 --> 02:00:14.660
Not that way! Stop!

02:00:31.180 --> 02:00:33.010
Oh! There it goes!

02:00:38.890 --> 02:00:39.940
We're done for!

02:00:40.020 --> 02:00:42.360
Once the forge burns,
it'll be the end of Irontown.

02:00:43.230 --> 02:00:46.650
We're still alive, Kohroku.
We'll manage somehow. Now, let's go.

02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:06.460
There they are!

02:01:18.680 --> 02:01:19.640
Go!

02:01:20.690 --> 02:01:21.980
Stop right there!

02:01:22.730 --> 02:01:25.770
Oh, you're both alive.
Oh, how nice.

02:01:26.570 --> 02:01:29.280
I'm giving the creature its head back.
Put the box down and back away.

02:01:30.030 --> 02:01:32.410
Give the head back now?
Come on, boy. Don't be silly.

02:01:32.780 --> 02:01:34.700
Now, when the sun's
about to come up?

02:01:34.780 --> 02:01:38.370
Look! He's a brainless,
swollen, life-sucking god of death.

02:01:38.450 --> 02:01:39.790
At sunrise he'll vanish.

02:01:40.330 --> 02:01:42.160
Sir, it's coming!
We've gotta get out of here!

02:01:42.540 --> 02:01:45.210
Look, everybody wants everything.
That's the way the world is.

02:01:45.290 --> 02:01:47.170
But I might actually get it.

02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:49.010
Don't force me to kill you.

02:01:50.760 --> 02:01:54.430
You make it sound so very easy.
You really ought to... relax!

02:02:01.060 --> 02:02:02.230
Get going!

02:02:21.750 --> 02:02:22.620
Ashitaka!

02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:24.370
I got it!

02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:31.840
This is bad.

02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:36.720
Master, we're surrounded!

02:02:37.430 --> 02:02:40.010
-Come on, sun! Rise!
-Open the box!

02:02:40.100 --> 02:02:42.140
Don't you see?
It's too late for that now!

02:02:42.810 --> 02:02:45.140
Why are you wasting
your breath talking to him?

02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:47.100
Human hands must return it!

02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:51.110
Don't say I didn't warn you.

02:03:06.040 --> 02:03:07.330
Forest Spirit!

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:09.340
We give you back your head!

02:03:10.210 --> 02:03:12.000
Take it and be at peace!

02:03:22.010 --> 02:03:24.850
Uh, well, that got
his attention, all right.

02:03:56.170 --> 02:03:57.300
Well, I think it's over.

02:03:57.380 --> 02:03:58.590
It's the men.

02:04:11.730 --> 02:04:15.070
-Milady! You're here!
-Her ladyship has been injured.

02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:45.640
Look! It's falling on Irontown!

02:04:51.850 --> 02:04:53.610
Hang on tight, everybody!
Don't let go!

02:06:00.710 --> 02:06:04.260
I didn't know the Forest Spirit
made the flowers grow.

02:06:35.710 --> 02:06:37.500
San. San, look.

02:07:08.030 --> 02:07:11.040
Even if all the trees return,
it won't be his forest anymore.

02:07:11.950 --> 02:07:13.660
The Great Forest Spirit is dead now.

02:07:14.500 --> 02:07:17.630
Never. He's life itself.
He's not dead, San.

02:07:18.040 --> 02:07:20.710
He's here right now,
trying to tell us something,

02:07:21.210 --> 02:07:22.670
that it's time
for us both to live.

02:07:31.390 --> 02:07:33.060
Ashitaka, you mean so much to me,

02:07:33.140 --> 02:07:35.310
but I can't forgive the humans
for what they've done.

02:07:35.560 --> 02:07:39.150
I understand. You'll live in the forest,
and I'll go help them rebuild Irontown.

02:07:40.150 --> 02:07:41.150
I'll always be near.

02:07:42.070 --> 02:07:44.780
Yakul and I will come and visit you...
whenever we can, all right?

02:07:56.330 --> 02:08:00.580
Amazing. The wolves and that crazy
little Wolf Girl helped save us all.

02:08:01.630 --> 02:08:04.920
Ashitaka. Can someone find him?
I need to thank him.

02:08:05.630 --> 02:08:09.640
We're going to start all over again.
This time we'll build a better town.

02:08:10.390 --> 02:08:13.890
Well, I give up!
You can't win against fools!

02:13:17.690 --> 02:13:24.620
THE END
