00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.970
I can't hang out with you anymore.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.220
Huh?

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.720
I... I did something
that can't be undone. Again.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.470
Now just calm down and tell me why. Okay?

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.680
But... I don't want to be a bother...

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.520
Idiot. Who cares about that now?
If there's anything I can do, I'll do it!

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.770
Senpai...

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.100
Did you just say you'd do <i>anything</i>?

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.140
Well, that's not--

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.220
What's with that face?

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.640
I discovered I hadn't even <i>touched </i>that report
I had for homework over summer break!

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.930
What?

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.850
Same screw-up as last year!

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.810
Why do college students still
get summer homework, anyway?

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.350
Now my mom's mad,
my little brother's teasing me--it's awful!

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.520
Hey! Why'd you close the door?!

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.970
--If you want me to hang out with you
this summer, help me with my report!

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.310
--Shut up! Do it yourself!
--If you want me to hang out with you
this summer, help me with my report!

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.020
Oh, c'mon! Please? Senpai!

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.970
--Senpai! Open up! Senpai!
--She really is hopeless.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.600
That's Hana, all right.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.930
It's not funny.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.520
She's getting more comfortable by the day.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.180
I'm telling you; she must have been
hiding her claws way back when.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.680
Meow.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.390
I see...

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.100
Oh, boss, let me handle the heavy stuff.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.140
Please. This is nothing.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.350
Boss!

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.930
Threw out your back, huh?
That hasn't happened in a while.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.680
W-We'll close for today.
I'll get to the chiropractor.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.810
I guess we have no choice.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.180
Who has a driver's license?

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.060
--I do.
--I'm making an appointment at the clinic.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.310
Could you take Dad there in our car?

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.810
Hana, you and I will close up.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.520
--Got it.
--Got it.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.180
<i>Or</i>...

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.600
<i>I </i>could be manager for a day.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.770
And I'll come back to find
my café's been hijacked. Close it.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.430
Thanks for cleaning up.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.890
Here. It's on the house.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.640
Yay! Thank you!

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.140
How's it compare to Dad's?

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.020
It's good!

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:19.430
I like the depth of flavor in his coffee,
but I like the fresh taste of yours, too.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.220
Will you inherit the café one day?

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.890
Inherit it? Yeah, I'd like that.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.520
Or... <i>take </i>it, maybe?

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.310
Why reword it to sound so threatening?

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.770
It won't be happening anytime soon, though.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.520
There's so much I still need
to be able to run a business.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.470
A driver's license, for one thing.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.020
A driver's license, for one thing.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.180
Thank goodness Sakurai was around today.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.810
Thank goodness Sakurai was around today.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.810
He's always been like that:
surly but accommodating.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.770
Don't be afraid to use him.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.270
He's not a <i>tool</i>, Hana--

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.270
Huh?

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.770
What's wrong?

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.720
Nothing.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.350
What were you two like in high school, anyway?

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.310
Eh?

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.430
You were in the swim club together, right?

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.770
Did you flirt--er,
hang out then like you do now?

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:22.810
Oh, we actually started hanging out
a little after we started college.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.180
Huh! That's a tad surprising.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.140
We only saw each other
for club business in high school.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.310
Even the first time we met--

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.350
Let's see... it was...

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.520
The swim club?

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.770
I'm not much of a swimmer...

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.890
No, no--you'd be a manager!

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.520
You're not in any club, are you?
We can both join!

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.850
I know some cute third-years
there from middle school. C'mon!

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.100
I don't know...

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.470
Please! I'm too chicken to go alone!

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.220
What the heck?

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.600
We have two first-year
managers joining us today.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.020
Look after them, all right?

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.140
Calm down! Ugh, pathetic!

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.520
As you can see, we're a pretty big bunch.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.640
It won't be easy, but do your best.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.890
Okay!

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.930
Uh-huh.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.680
This third-year manager will show you the ropes.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.350
Thanks!

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.020
Sure thing.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:24.770
Welcome!

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.180
Thanks for having us.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.430
Let me explain what you'll be doing.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.520
Mornin'!

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.270
Ah, Sakurai.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.890
Sorry I'm late. I was cleanin' up.

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.100
We've got two new first-year managers today.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.520
Yeah? That's somethin'.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.270
N-Nice to meet y--

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.470
Hey. I'm Sakurai. Second-year.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.720
I'm gonna go warm up.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.560
Good luck!

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.350
S-So scary! Those eyes--too fierce!

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.140
We <i>have </i>upperclassmen like that?!

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.390
It's my first day, and I'm ready to quit!

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.680
He's so frightening! Just... yikes!

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.640
Hana?

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.640
So, yeah, that first impression was the pits.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:18.060
Huh! His eyes never
really bothered me all that much.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:22.720
But as you know, he's a serious,
earnest person at heart.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.640
Attaboy, Sakurai! That's a new record!

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.560
Thanks!

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.850
These're heavy. I got this.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.810
Thank you, Sakurai.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:37.180
Go for a new record! You can do it, Senpai!

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.020
Aren't you hungry?

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:45.470
He's just so awkward
and prone to misunderstandings...

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:49.930
I realized right away
that he wasn't scary at all.

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:53.890
And so you got friendlier
and friendlier with Sakurai.

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:57.270
You even started to talk like him.

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:00.640
Huh?

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:05.930
Eh? I mean, you haven't
been talking slangy with me.

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:06.770
Huh?

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:12.390
Wait, what? Do you only talk
like that when Sakurai's around?

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:20.520
I-I'll be on my way!
That's enough remin... reminiscin'!

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:24.560
Oh! I'm sorry! I must have touched a nerve!

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.390
Hadn't you noticed?

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.270
Goodbye! I'll be...

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:31.930
...seein' ya!

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.520
Did I just dig up a landmine?

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:41.100
Or the greatest treasure around?

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:47.680
Either way, I've <i>got </i>to get her to talk!

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:52.140
I've been thinking:

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:56.310
What's Senpai like when he's drunk?

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:03.810
I realized I've never
actually seen him like that.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.890
Does he cry? Laugh?
Get combative? I can't picture it.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:13.140
Hmm... Usually you reveal
whatever you've been holding back.

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:16.890
Personally, I'd like him
to be a strip-naked drunk!

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.140
That's personal, all right.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:24.470
Sakurai can hold his liquor,
so he might not get drunk at all.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:28.430
Sak's no lightweight, but he <i>does </i>get drunk.

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:32.600
He just knows his limits and sticks to them.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:38.640
Aha! So one of Senpai's rare
friends has seen him drunk!

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.930
"Rare friends"? Jeez...

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:45.140
So what was he like?
How much does he have to put away?

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:49.100
Hey, are you trying to go
after Sak while he's asleep?

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:53.600
No. I hate that <i>he's </i>seen
<i>my </i>booze-related screw-ups.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.560
I'm trying to drag him down with me.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.850
I mean, I think you had it coming...

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:04.720
C'mon, please! This is the perfect time
for scheming, with Senpai off work!

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:10.020
I guess you can't cause <i>too </i>much trouble.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.720
But she could cause some <i>fun</i>.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.100
Hooray! Thanks a ton!

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.680
We'll need to set up a drinking party.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.680
What's a good time?

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:24.640
Given how it went with you last time,
Ami, I think I'll go it alone.

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:31.140
Oh, no! Hana's mad at me!

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:36.470
Whatever did you do to make
Hana shut you out, daughter of mine?

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.930
Hey, you're here! Come on in.

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:45.310
H-Hey there...

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:48.600
Why'd you want to come over
to drink all of a sudden?

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.140
Don't tell me...

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:52.720
I-I finished my report, okay?

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.810
Oh, you did? Well, that's good.

00:10:55.810 --> 00:11:02.520
Let's go all-out today!
I'll handle the cooking, see?

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.770
The going-home's the hard part with Sak,
so he rarely drinks when he's out.

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.680
Which means he'll lower
his guard if he's at home.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.520
Phase 1: check!

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.810
Wow... You really are a great cook, Uzaki.

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:20.060
Go on, eat up!

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.060
Don't mind if I do.

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:26.020
Who knew you could make chili shrimp at home?

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.270
Yum! You're a real pro!

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:34.270
Now <i>that </i>is an exaggeration.

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:40.390
Put out spicy snacks with
a lot of flavor to keep him drinking.

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:41.810
And then...

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:42.020
And then...

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:45.060
I rented some DVDs, Senpai. Wanna watch?

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.680
We've got five different killer-shark flicks!

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.600
Ooh!

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:55.020
Distract him from his drinking
so he won't think about how much he's having.

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:57.520
Phases 2 and 3: check!

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:04.850
And since Sak tends to match
or beat whoever he's with,

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:07.890
if <i>you're </i>drinking,
he'll naturally keep drinking, too.

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:11.020
Pretend you're drinking... just pretend...

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.640
Here, Senpai. Have some more!

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:15.390
Thanks!

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:23.850
Now for the main event, Senpai!

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:27.270
Now for the main event, Senpai!

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:29.470
When Sak's drunk, he's useless.

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.470
Useless?

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:36.850
He can hold a conversation of sorts,
but his judgment is way off.

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:41.020
And he starts looking
really sloppy, too. Sloppy Sak.

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.140
Oho!

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:44.350
That's pretty useless, all right!

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:45.970
<i>You </i>seem happy.

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:50.770
In that state, Sak can't lie--and
forget trying to be cool.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:55.060
His mental defenses are zero!

00:12:55.060 --> 00:13:00.270
He's big on minding his limits because
he doesn't want to show that side to anyone.

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:07.270
You sure do look like
you're feeling no pain, Senpai.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.890
Cut that out...

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.680
I'd never even dreamed
of this level of vulnerability!

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:18.020
Uzaki...

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.640
What's up?

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:25.180
Y'know... thanks... for all your cooking.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.600
Oh, is that where you're going?

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:36.180
Though I'd be happier if you could give me
your honest opinions <i>without </i>the alcohol.

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:40.060
Can't do that... too shy.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.970
So you've been holding back?

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:48.100
Well, here's your chance to come out
with allll the stuff you couldn't say before!

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:51.270
Love...

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:06.770
...your cooking...

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:27.810
I stopped by to see how it was going.

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:34.520
Good thing I told Uzaki
to leave the door unlocked.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.220
Hey, Sak, you okay?

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:41.470
Itsuhito? What are you...

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:42.930
Don't worry about that.

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:46.140
Look, I laid out your futon. Get in there.

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:47.930
'Kay...

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:55.140
You should be under covers, too, Uzaki.

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:06.140
Sleep easy. I'll lock up.

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:09.350
Yeah... thanks...

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:14.220
Sweet dreams.

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:17.720
Something...

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:21.890
...is weird about this...

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:24.310
--But what?
--But what?

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:48.140
--Why is she in my futon?
--Why is he in my futon?

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:54.020
Hmm. I see.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:58.560
So neither of you remember
anything about last night.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.100
Right...

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:05.720
You didn't have to come in
on your day off, you know.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:09.520
I had my suspicions and <i>gave </i>them today off.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:14.270
W-Well, why don't you try remembering
things in order, one by one?

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:16.350
--One by one?
--One by one?

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:21.560
I definitely remember making dinner...

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:24.560
And eating and drinking while we watched movies.

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:29.270
A crazed shark slammed
into the hero of the third movie,

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:31.720
who then got reincarnated into some other world.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.520
I was like, "He's crazy strong!"

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.430
I <i>think </i>that's all I can remember...

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.770
What kind of movie is <i>that</i>?

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:45.020
After that... I enjoyed Senpai's
pitiful tipsiness for a while.

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:45.850
Hey!

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:48.020
I get the sense it was <i>extremely </i>amusing.

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:49.060
<i>Hey</i>!

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:52.390
And when I woke up,
we were in the same futon somehow.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.270
Apologies. Could you say that again?

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:02.810
We're listening closely this time.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:05.720
Talk about an obvious bribe!

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.140
You heard me the first time!

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:13.930
When I woke up, Uzaki was beside me.

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.180
Did they do it?!

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:16.640
Shinichi!

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:21.140
We didn't do <i>anything</i>!
I really can't remember at all!

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:25.520
If you don't remember,
you can't be <i>sure </i>you didn't do anything.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.100
Right?

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:30.560
These two really are a pain at times like this.

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:34.850
W-Well, I was there, and I'm saying
nothing happened! Isn't that enough?

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:39.430
Two young people and nothing happened?!
<i>That's </i>the problem here!

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:41.220
You're <i>mad </i>at me?!

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:46.390
Tell them, Uzaki!
You were up longer than me, right?

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:49.890
I'm trying to remember...

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:54.930
It's all so fuzzy. I can't say for sure that I--

00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.770
Love...

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:03.600
Why are you grinning?!

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.770
Was I?

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:11.140
You don't actually remember
anything from last night, do you?

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.310
Something definitely happened.

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:18.270
Something good. And yet...

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:22.930
All we can do is imagine whatever
marvelous event it could have been!

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:26.810
I should have joined them--even
if I had to force my way in!

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:30.180
Why is my daughter like this?

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:33.680
Please let me tag along next time!

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.970
Uh, yeah, sure.

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:37.770
At your place again!

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:39.180
What for?

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.600
Buy a guest futon, would you?

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.350
How about you go <i>home</i>?

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:48.310
Hey, how about we do it again today?
Two nights in a row!

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:49.350
Huh?

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:52.890
What are you talking about?
Classes start again tomorrow.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.390
Huh?

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:58.310
"Huh" nothing.

00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:01.600
Aha. I see. Huh.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.850
So that means...

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:06.770
Summer break... is over?

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:08.060
That's right.

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:11.100
She's acting like it's the end of the world.

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.930
Did you seriously just realize this?

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:19.270
Then I guess... I'll just be
sleeping until winter break...

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:24.390
Is hanging out the only
thing you ever think about?

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:34.060
Hana! Time to wake up!

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.310
Okay...

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.220
Morning...

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:02.350
Mom, Hana's looking even more dopey than usual.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.470
Shut it, Kiri.

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:06.890
Here.

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:10.470
Strong coffee for
your first day back at college.

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:12.100
Perk up a little, would you?

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:13.720
Yeah...

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:17.680
Some college student.
What an aggravating big sis.

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:20.640
See you later.

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:30.020
Huh?

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.970
Good morning, Senpai!

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:39.310
Oh, Uzaki. Morning.

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:44.350
You actually came to campus.
I was sure you'd whine and moan about it again.

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:47.640
Who do you think I am?

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:53.600
Although I'm still feeling about
90 percent of that end-of-summer shock.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.520
You're not over it at all!

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.930
We didn't hang out <i>nearly </i>enough!

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:03.470
If it were always summer,
I could hang out with you <i>so much more</i>.

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:05.060
Don't be stupid.

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:08.140
Harsh!

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:12.270
Senpai! You need to
consider a woman's feelings--

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:15.600
It doesn't have to be summer.
We can hang out whenever.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.810
We'll always be together.

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:26.970
Huh? What is it, Uzaki?

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.470
Wait! No--no, wait!

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:39.680
What I <i>meant </i>was that we still have
plenty of time before we graduate!

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.140
Not... whatever you were thinking!

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:47.850
Oh? And whatever <i>was </i>I thinking, hmm?

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:49.060
Damn you...

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:54.720
If you want to hang out with me so badly,
I guess I'll have to oblige!

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.560
You can thank me now, Senpai!

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:01.850
Argh! You know what you are?

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:04.680
Annoying as <i>hell</i>!

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.060
Annoying as <i>hell</i>!

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:09.310
C'mon, Senpai--let's go hang out!
