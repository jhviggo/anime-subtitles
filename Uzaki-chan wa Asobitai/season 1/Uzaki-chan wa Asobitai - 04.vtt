00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.020
Sakurai, we'll be taking a family trip
to a hot spring over Golden Week.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.560
You'll have that time off.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.390
Why not take advantage of all those
public holidays and go somewhere yourself?

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.020
Huh...

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.100
That's what she suggested, anyway.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.810
But I've been playing video games
for 72 hours straight since then.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.720
Oh, so this is the last of them?

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.970
Here goes!

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.390
That unnecessary rhythmic flourish...

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.930
Hi there, Senpai!

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.520
I <i>knew</i> it.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.220
Are you free today?
I mean, you totally are, right?

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.310
This popping over unannounced is a bit much.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.970
Well, you're off work, and I figured
a loner like you would be home gaming

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.850
instead of going anywhere.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.770
And I was right!

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.640
I'm speechless.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.770
So instead I stopped by to hang out
with you, my senior and my friend!

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.060
Great news, right?

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.020
Knock off that weirdly
superior tone--it's infuriating.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.060
And so...

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.310
Wanna play Doramon Go?

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.390
That's still a game!

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.220
There's a big spawning event during Golden Week.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.520
Let's catch 'em all--together!

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.270
I have the app.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.350
Buuut?

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.350
But I was too embarrassed to play alone.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.680
Right? Man, I can read you like a book!

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.220
Why'd you turn it off?!

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.770
We can play together!

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.600
Talk about a major drag.
Then again, it <i>is</i> a holiday week...

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.770
C'mon, Senpai...

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.220
I'm about to die of boredom,
so sure--count me in.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.680
Hooray!

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.020
I found a Lousy Cat!

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.390
Check this out, Senpai!

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.770
Eh?

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.720
Your face looks awful.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.470
Too much gaming.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.350
It's one thing to be all scowly,
but walking around with that face?

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.770
Someone's gonna report you.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.060
Will you stop backing away like that?

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.310
Sheesh.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.140
Hey, you sure are catching a lot!

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.270
And all Gorillas.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.180
They keep popping up.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.600
Ugh, my eyes hurt. Can't look at the screen.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.350
Oh! Then let's go buy you some glasses!

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.520
Welcome.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.470
Hey, is that Ami?

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.350
Oh, my!

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.470
Fancy running into you two!

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.810
I see. So your eyes hurt
from playing games too much.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.720
If this keeps up,
he'll be Doramon Go-ing to lockup.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.310
I'll give <i>you</i> "lockup."

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.220
So you played games the entire time
we were at the hot spring, Sakurai?

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.600
Sorry.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.310
And he'd probably <i>still</i> be holed up
playing games if <i>I</i> hadn't come along!

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.180
I can't deny that.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.640
Hey, I know!

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.350
Since she's here and all, why don't
you ask Ami to be your glassistant?

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.270
My glassistant?

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.100
Is there something you're looking for?

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.560
Yeah, the loner indoorsman
game-addict here needs those things:

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.100
Computer glasses!

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.060
Oh, the ones that cut down
on blue light from LCD displays.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.270
These are supposed to keep
your eyes from getting tired.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.350
I've always wanted a pair myself!

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:23.020
Hmm. Might be good for long gaming sessions.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.720
Huh! The lenses are a faint yellow.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.560
So they're like thin sunglasses, eh?

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.640
You look good in glasses, Senpai!

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.850
Yes! You do!

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.220
Eh?

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.270
How about these?

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.350
Hmm?

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.140
Oh, nice! Should we try some others?

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.470
Totally!

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:44.230
Ooh, which ones?

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.680
How about these?

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.770
Like I'm some kind of toy.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.970
Those are <i>perfect</i> !

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.140
R-Really?

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.390
Yes! They hide your glare-mug
so you look like a normal person!

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.060
Who says I have a glare-mug?!

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.520
You should probably wear
those at work and school, too!

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.970
Oh, shut up.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.720
Then how about these?

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.470
Where'd you find <i>those</i> ?

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.140
Do <i>you</i> have to play around with me, too, Ami?

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.930
Oh, wow, that is too much. Can I take a picture?

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.470
No, you can't!

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.470
Look this way... no, don't.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.390
I keep laughing... my phone's shaking!

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.850
Knock it off!

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:28.810
Dammit...

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.220
Try, uh, try these on next, Senpai!

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.220
You're laughing already!

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.770
They work with your natural fierce expression
to make you look like a mafioso!

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.060
Like you'd assassinate someone
with a long piece of wire!

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.680
Or like you're dominating
some criminal underworld!

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.270
Oh!

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.720
Throw on a white coat,
and you could be a mad scientist!

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.640
Want to?

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.020
I do <i>not</i> !

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.180
What shelf were these on? I'm putting them back!

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.020
Just once, Senpai--just one time!

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.020
Brush your hair back with
those little round glasses on!

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.430
Just once, I swear!

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.140
You'll turn into an
embarrassingly tropey character!

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.560
What is it you <i>want</i> from me?

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.930
Sorry, sorry! Try this last pair on.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.640
These were a serious choice.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.470
Okay?

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:24.390
Uh... okay.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.890
Now make a fist.

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:31.520
Raise your arm.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.890
Open your mouth a little.

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:37.020
Ayyyyy-oh!

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.470
Oh, man, that was funny!

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.560
You'd better pick out
your own glasses there, Hana.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.600
Hey, right!

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.140
What'll it be?

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.110
Gee, which ones?

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.430
These are nice.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:56.390
I do like a pink frame...

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.560
But it's gotta be red!

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.390
Ooh, yeah!

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:06.470
Check it out, Sakurai.
Doesn't Hana look good in glasses?

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.220
Whaddya think?

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.180
You look dumber, strangely enough.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:21.350
"Strangely enough"?!

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:24.720
Hey, I was complimenting you earlier!

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.100
Then you called me a mafioso!
That makes it a wash, you big dummy!

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.970
Picky, picky!
That's what you are--you know that?

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:35.060
<i>You're</i> the one who has to
watch what she says and does!

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:38.140
Well, <i>you're</i> the one who's always angry!

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.520
Shut up! You asked for it, moron!

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.600
Only a moron calls someone a moron, moron!

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.680
You just said it yourself, moron!

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.750
Moron!

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.850
Well, you said it first, moron! Moron! Moron!

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:51.850
Are they all right?

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:55.020
Uh-huh. They're always like that.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:04.060
I missed out on getting glasses,
and it's all your fault.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.680
Ooh! Got a Lousy Cat Dandy!

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.640
<i>You</i> just <i>had</i> to start something.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.180
Another Gorilla.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:15.890
Don't dump the blame on me
just 'cause you're older.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.810
That's power harassment.

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.850
Hey, I got a Lousy Cat Genius this time!

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:25.970
Clearly it's <i>your</i> fault, because <i>you</i> started it.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.640
Nothing but Gorillas.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.020
See, <i>your</i> problem is--

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.810
Thanks.

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.720
Uh... yeah.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.310
Nechst Station. Nechst Station.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.560
Lot of people getting on.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:52.020
But with this game, the more people
around you, the higher the monster spawn rate.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.770
See? A Lousy Cat Cyborg!

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:56.810
Still Gorillas here.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.850
Just how much do you like gorillas?

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:02.850
I don't. <i>They</i> like <i>me</i> .

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:06.100
Well, as long as we get where we're going.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.430
Andenechst Station.

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:15.020
Andefallo-Wing Station.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.520
Now it's crazy crowded.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:20.930
Oh, right--there's a soccer match
at a nearby stadium.

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:22.520
That explains it.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:27.220
Pardon me, huh-huh.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.270
S-Something incredibly soft...

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:38.270
I-I'm sorry.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.470
It's okay. Can't really help it in all this.

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:45.890
This is bad--and at this rate,
it'll get <i>really</i> bad!

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:47.850
I can't budge!

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:50.680
Am I just going to have to grin and bear it?

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:56.020
Calm down. Get a hold of yourself!

00:10:56.020 --> 00:11:00.560
Think of something else
and pull yourself together!

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.140
S-Senpai?

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.350
It's n-nothing.

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:06.890
What's <i>that</i> doing here?!

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:09.180
Gotta get my mind on something else, pronto...

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:12.430
Senpai?

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:15.770
I am <i>fine</i> . I'm fine.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.770
There are traps everywhere I turn!

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:21.970
I see nothing. I hear nothing.

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:24.770
I turn my consciousness inward.

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:28.560
What's wrong with him?
He got so quiet all of a sudden.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.220
Oh--his eyelashes are really long.

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:33.100
His face is <i>so close</i> !

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:36.600
Picture it--now! A clear blue sky!

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:41.060
This is like one of those
wall-pound things, huh? Ha ha...

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.720
A vast field, stretching
as far as the eye can see!

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:48.560
Isn't your arm tired? Don't overdo it.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.970
Crystal-clear, unclouded water,
its surface like a mirror!

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:55.430
Say something...

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:59.220
I can do this. I can make it through!

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:08.180
With my eyes closed and my ears dulled,
my other senses are heighten--

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.560
Hey, uh, Senpai... Thanks for earli--

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.810
Eh?

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.680
Senpai!

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.470
Is he out cold--on his feet?

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:31.890
The door is closing.

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:33.970
Hey! This is our stop!

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:37.640
Senpai? Senpai!

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:44.180
Now... Now what?

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:54.220
Where am I?

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.270
Wait--what time is it?

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:57.770
Oh.

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:01.430
I got a ton of calls from Uzaki.

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:04.930
And... one of these.

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:12.220
So <i>that's</i> what happened during...

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:14.430
...during Golden Week?

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:16.270
Yes.

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:18.890
No laughing.

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:20.350
And?

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:21.680
And nothing.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.350
I blacked out before it got to that point.

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:25.180
What?

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:30.390
If <i>she</i> made me feel that way,
I figured I'd be better off unconscious!

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:32.430
I see.

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:36.060
Wait, can he just turn his
consciousness off and on at will?

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.970
What is he, a ninja? Spooky.

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:42.890
Well, don't worry too much about it.

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:46.850
You're young--you should be more carefree.

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:51.850
I mean, I'm sure my Ami
is hanging out with boys.

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:54.060
With boys?

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:55.470
No, not at all.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:57.310
See? Not at all!

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:59.470
Not at all? Really?

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:00.720
Yes, really.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.470
What?!

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:03.930
I'm sorry.

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:05.850
Why are you apologizing?

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:08.350
Huh!

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:14.100
To think something so hilar--er,
terrible happened to you afterward!

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.060
You were going to say "hilarious"!

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.350
That was unfortunate.

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:20.430
Yeah, well.

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:22.810
Follow up with Hana.

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:27.060
After all, she's the one who invited you along.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.720
Yeah... I guess you're right.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:45.680
I don't know what's going on,
but I'm not going to engage. Too much trouble.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:49.060
Listen to this, Senpai.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.310
<i>She's</i> engaging <i>me</i>.

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:53.470
Did something happen?

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:56.060
I was looking at the calendar when it hit me.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.020
Yeah?

00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:00.270
There are no holidays in June.

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:02.890
And <i>that's</i> why you're so down?!

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:05.350
You've still got weekends off.

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:10.220
But the more and longer breaks
the better, don't you think?

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:11.720
Greedy much?

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.720
A three-day break really winds you up!

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:18.310
Besides, I get depressed thinking
about this weather sticking around

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:20.220
for another month.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:24.020
Sure. But after the rainy
season comes summer break.

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:26.220
But not before exams.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:31.930
I wanna go have fun!

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:36.430
Let's do that, then.

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:38.930
How about next weekend?

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:40.140
You mean it?!

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.720
Don't startle me!

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.640
<i>You</i> startled <i>me</i>!

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:46.680
This same old loner of a senior,
suggesting we go somewhere?

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:50.680
Hell must be frozen over! Completely frozen over!
And now I know why it's raining!

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.560
Because <i>you</i> say such weird stuff! Ugh!

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.060
Calm down!

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.020
I can't make heads or tails
of this mixed-up conversation!

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:00.350
If it doesn't work for you, then never mind.

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:01.470
I'll go!

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:03.890
Well... good.

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:07.470
So... is there someplace you had in mind?

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:12.020
I know: How about an outing by train?

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:20.020
Senpai, your face is all red.

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:22.770
It's nothing. No trains.

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:25.770
Then do you mind if I just
throw something together?

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:27.680
Please do.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:31.930
Got it! I can't wait!

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:33.770
That's one frightening laugh.

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:36.850
Still, it's not every day that <i>you</i> invite <i>me</i> .

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:43.180
Yeah, well, I felt bad for what
happened over Golden Week.

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:44.520
Senpai...

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:49.720
And when I told Ami,
she said I should follow up with you.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.520
Huh? Are you mad?

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.220
I'm not mad.

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.970
You totally are.

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:58.430
Not in the slightest.

00:16:58.430 --> 00:16:59.720
Oh, come on.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.770
Look, if I were mad, it'd be a big deal!

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:04.930
What the hell?

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:15.020
It's pouring. Forget going out in this.

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.770
I hope she's still home...

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:27.390
I was just about to call you.

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:31.770
I figured if it was gonna rain anyway,
I may as well play games at your place.

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:37.180
I thought I'd cook, so I did a little shopping,
and it started raining harder...

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:40.180
By the time I left the supermarket,
it was a total disaster.

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:43.020
I appreciate the sentiment,
but don't go overboard.

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:47.640
Can I borrow your shower?
Oh... and a change of clothes.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:51.020
Aw, I shouldn't have worn my favorite shirt.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.720
Care to join me?

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.310
Go already!

00:17:57.970 --> 00:17:59.390
Honestly.

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:05.850
Whoa! I'm soaked clear through to my undies!

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:08.350
Ugh! TMI!

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:17.060
This shirt is <i>ginormous</i> !

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:20.680
I'll just get lunch started
before we start playing.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.310
Hey, uh, thanks.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.560
Ta-da!

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:28.970
You don't have any good cookware,
so I'm giving you my old pot.

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:33.270
That's incredibly nice of you. I appreciate it.

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:35.100
First...

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.720
Need help?

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:41.270
You're no cook. How about washing these veggies?

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.020
Yeah, sure.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.020
You're awfully obedient today, Senpai.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:52.270
It's just that everything's been
going wrong for you today, so...

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:56.100
It's fine--I'm a good cook.

00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:01.270
You said you couldn't taste the porridge
I made for you when you were sick,

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:03.680
so there's a little score-settling in the mix.

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.810
I'm really sorry I said that.

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:11.220
My cooking will have your
unsophisticated palate <i>moaning</i> !

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:14.350
Again, you've gone a step too far.

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.430
What game do you want to play?

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:23.850
Oh! You downloaded Meowcraft! Let's play that!

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:30.060
Let's work together to build
something totally out-there!

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:34.100
This is too perfect a way for
a college student to waste a day off.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:42.020
Ah, whatever.

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:44.180
Ready to be a useless college student?

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:47.270
I mean, you've been one all along.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:48.680
Back off!

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:15.100
Phew! That was fun!

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:22.560
I guess it was asking too much
to finish our build in one day.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.720
It <i>did</i> get torn down a few times.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.720
We can just work on it
the next time you're over.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:31.600
The... next time?

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.810
Hmm?

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:36.220
Yeah!

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.560
Enough with the scary laugh!

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:48.930
Put the curry pot in
the fridge just like that, 'kay?

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:51.520
Will do.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.810
It'll taste even better after sitting overnight.

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:58.600
You know, I've heard that. Is it true?

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:02.020
Let it sit overnight and the roux
soaks into the meat and veggies,

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:06.930
which release their umami components--amino
acids, sugars--into the roux!

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:12.140
That's how you get a richer
umami flavor all through the curry.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.140
I'm sorry I asked.

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:14.520
I'm looking forward to it.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.350
Good!

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:19.430
Though today's was already plenty good.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.140
Senpai?

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:32.310
You said "the next time"... How about tomorrow?

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:37.890
Oh, to pick up where we left off today?
Sure. God knows I'm free.

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:39.390
Hooray!

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:45.970
Then let's hang out again, okay?

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:47.140
Yep.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:52.680
Um... wait--what?

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:57.020
Sorry. I seem to have
left my pass at your place.

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:01.350
You're <i>so</i> disorganized.

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:41.020
"Episode 5: I Want to Meddle
in My Friend's Business!"
