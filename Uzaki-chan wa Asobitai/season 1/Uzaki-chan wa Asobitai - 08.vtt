WEBVTT

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.840
H-Hey, Uzaki.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.460
Senpai...

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.800
I'm really sorry for all the trouble
I caused the other day.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.960
Oh, uh, don't sweat it.
There was a lot of alcohol involved.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.630
Liquid courage, eh?

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:26.880
Is he a cheater?

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.210
They're the worst.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.630
Please accept this.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:32.670
What the--?!

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.090
Um... I haven't gotten paid at work yet,
so this is from my mom,

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.550
humiliatingly enough.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.550
Compensation?

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.420
So he's freeloading!

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.960
Off her mother, too?!

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.090
No, no, it's fine! It was cheap anyway,
and old and worn out!

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.420
I-If this isn't enough,
could I ask you to wait until payday?

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.590
Extortion?

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.630
Maybe he's yakuza!

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.800
C-Call the police!

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.760
Look, I'm totally fine with it, really!

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.590
But... you caught me in
such a compromising position...

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.260
A compromising position?!

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.090
Phrasing, <i>please</i> !

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.550
With everything that happened,
this truly is the only thing I can do, Senpai!

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.300
All you did was get my futon a little dirty!

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.760
It was bound to happen--it was your first time!

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.010
<i>What</i> ?!

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.670
All right, fine!

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.170
I'll take your money. Now forget everything!
Like it never happened!

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.260
It's over! Okay?

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.340
A soiled futon...

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.210
Her first time...

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.260
Like it never happened...

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.090
Men are scum.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.960
And <i>my</i> phrasing, too!

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.460
Thank you very much. Please come again!

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.340
Now, then...

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.840
Looks like things have
settled down for now, Dad.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.460
Right. Let's take a little break, daughter.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.130
There!

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.420
Oh, that's right, Sakurai--how
did Hana's birthday turn out?

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.590
We couldn't give you much in the way of advice,
but I hope she was happy, at least.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.550
Whoa. Looks like we touched a nerve.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.420
That Uzaki...

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.510
She said she wanted to go drinking with me.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.510
So she dragged me to a pub and... we drank.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.130
And then she... no,
we both drank a little too much.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.210
Before I knew it, we had missed the last train.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.300
Go on.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.590
Maybe it was because we were both tipsy...

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.420
Long story short, she wound up
spending the night at my place.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.550
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.550
And then...

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.760
And then?

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.630
A-And then...

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.300
Forgive me. She <i>is</i> a woman, for all that.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.210
It's not my place to say any more.

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.090
A grown man, crying?

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.800
What on earth did she <i>do</i> ?

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.710
Sure, I had fun at the beach
with the whole gang,

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.760
but there's something about
being alone on a swaying ship--

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.880
What's this? Suddenly I'm sensing
something about to happen in my absence!

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.550
Dammit! I shouldn't have come alone!

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.340
Sir, please!

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.460
I'm coming! Wait for me!

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.130
Sir!

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.960
And so, Hana's been out of sorts
ever since her birthday?

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.920
That's right. I've told her time
and time again not to sweat it.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:47.420
Mmm. She must think
she's done something unforgivable.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.880
No way. That'd be way out of character for her.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:59.210
I don't know. Hana makes sure
that line doesn't get crossed.

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:04.380
Sakurai, you've never had
a <i>truly</i> bad time of it, have you?

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.460
Now that you mention it...

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.760
That's a turn-off, all right!

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.130
Nope! Nuh-uh! No can do!

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.340
Woohoo! Got your phone!

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:21.420
Now that you mention it...
I didn't... <i>not</i> not... I guess?

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.550
You seem conflicted.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:28.210
So Hana's expressions
of love were really razor-thin...

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.960
Be that as it may!

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.170
He's done pondering!

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.960
I'm glad Uzaki's being quiet,

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.630
but something's... not right.
She's hard to talk to now.

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.460
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.010
She's been through plenty herself--

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.710
she could put on a happy face
like she always has before.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.090
Why isn't she?

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.130
Here, Sakurai. Use this.

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.130
What is it?

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.380
You know the fireworks festival nearby?

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.460
The neighborhood association
gave us that voucher to use at the stalls.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.760
<i>You</i> are going to invite Hana!

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.340
Huh? Why would I do that?

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.210
You want to patch things up, don't you?

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.130
Well, I mean, it's not like we're arguing or--

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:19.800
Silence, boy!

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.210
A-Ami?

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:27.170
Even though direct involvement
goes against my principles...

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:30.130
Look: you are <i>going</i> !

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:34.130
And if you say, "Your smile is
like a chrysanthemum firework,"

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:38.840
or "You're beautiful from every angle,
too, just like those fireworks"--

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.920
compliment the living daylights out
of her with that nauseating stuff

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.260
and her mood <i>will</i> improve!

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.130
She's easy like that.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:50.090
Wait--I'm supposed to say <i>that</i> ?

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.960
It touches a father's heart, seeing his daughter

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:57.010
speak of men and women
despite her utter lack of experience...

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:59.760
It'll give you an excuse to ask her to come.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:04.090
I'm not sure she'd go for it
right now if you offered to pay.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.380
Thanks.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.210
Hey! Uzaki!

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:38.090
Sorry for the wait. There's just so many people!

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:42.380
No, no, it's fine. I just got here myself.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.340
Oh, okay.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:50.800
Senpai... thank you very much
for inviting me today.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.130
It's no use. This thing just will not die.

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:55.760
Seriously, don't worry about it!

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.880
Hey, I'm hungry. Want to hit the stalls
before the show begins?

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:35.920
That was delicious. Thank you, Senpai!

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.170
Don't mention it.

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.380
I had that voucher, remember.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.050
I'll have to thank the café owner.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.760
Senpai?

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.050
Oh, uh, it's nothing.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:54.960
Still no dice, huh?

00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:00.010
At a glance, we're <i>acting</i> all cheery,
but that awkwardness is still there.

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:02.420
If she were her usual self...

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:05.550
Let's go goldfish-dipping, Senpai!
Goldfish-dipping!

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:09.420
I'm gonna get my loner senpai a roommate!

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:13.550
When I picture you telling
a goldfish "I'm home"...

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.210
That is <i>hilarious</i> !

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:25.090
Yeah, no. I have to do
something to lift her spirits.

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:28.460
But <i>what</i> ?

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.510
Compliment the living daylights out
of her with that nauseating stuff

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:34.300
and her mood <i>will</i> improve!

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.140
Uzaki!

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.420
Yes?

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.510
I meant to tell you...

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:47.550
Um, that yukata you're wearing is amazing.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:50.460
Oh, Mom helped me put it on.

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.340
It's nice. Really suits you!

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.420
Huh?!

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.670
You... you think so?

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.170
Bingo! That's the ticket!

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.510
Yeah, it looks <i>great</i> on you, all right!

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:02.420
Thank you so much!

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:03.550
And those geta sandals!

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:06.090
Oh, I bought them to go with this yukata.

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:08.210
Well, they go <i>perfectly</i> !

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:11.590
And your flower hairpin is just so summery!

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:13.760
I chose that for this yukata, too!

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.210
And your hair--you styled it differently today!

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:18.260
It looks fantastic!

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:18.800
So does that!

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.340
That's where I keep my wallet and my phone!

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:23.550
I bet you could fit a <i>ton</i> in there!

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.510
Well, you know, I <i>did</i> put
in a lot of effort for today!

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:34.380
And look--I may have managed
to charm my dead-inside senpai!

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.590
Y-Yeah! You're absolutely
outstanding today, Uzaki, no lie!

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:43.630
Am I? I am, right?

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:46.880
I worked really hard, so you better be grateful!

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.130
If I'd missed this chance,
you would go your entire <i>life</i>

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:53.420
and never hang out with a girl in a yukata!

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:58.340
Just suck it up. This is miles better
than meek-and-mild Uzaki!

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:03.340
Yeah, and with you looking so cute and all,
we'd better have some fun!

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:04.630
"Cu"--

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:09.170
"Cute"?! Do <i>you</i> really think I'm cute, Senpai?

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:11.380
Yikes--it just slipped out!

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.510
No... here's my chance.

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:16.210
You <i>are</i> cute! I'm so glad I invited you!

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:18.420
And thanks so much for coming!

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:23.210
You're beautiful! A knockout!
You're cute! <i>So</i> cute!

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:26.260
And, uh, you're... you're... you're <i>cute</i> !

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:31.880
Cute! Yeah, cute!

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.130
That couple's flirting.

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:29.670
He sure is desperate.

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:31.880
He's got a weak vocabulary, too.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.760
Th-That's enough!

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.880
Had enough, my darling junior?

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.840
That's too many compliments! I <i>get</i> it, okay?!

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.510
Whoa, watch it!

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:43.170
Ugh, Senpai! Why, you... you...

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:46.130
Calm down, Uzaki! Sorry--I'm sorry!

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:47.800
Argh!

00:12:58.050 --> 00:12:59.630
Se...

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:01.550
Senpai!

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:21.090
I swallowed some water...

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:30.760
Hey.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.170
Practicing by yourself again?

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:42.340
Oh, Sakurai- <i>senpai</i> .
I thought you'd already left.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.510
I forgot something.

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:47.380
Didn't I tell you not
to practice alone? It's dangerous.

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:49.460
Um, well, about that!

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.880
You've shown me how a few times now,

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.300
and I'm always watching
everyone's practices like a coach--

00:13:55.300 --> 00:14:01.210
I thought maybe by now... I'd be a good swimmer.

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:04.340
But it looks like I'm not
where I thought I would be.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:08.050
I'm sorry. And after
everything you taught me, too.

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:11.630
I see.

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:12.760
Huh?

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.840
Uh, Senpai?

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:24.460
He's still a tiny bit frightening.
Especially in this dim light.

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:29.630
Maybe there's a little more I can do.

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:31.920
All right. I'll give it my all!

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:44.300
Aw, why can't I swim better?

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:51.670
Senpai?

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:02.090
Wow, he's really good. No wonder he's a starter.

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:15.840
Amazing. His movements are so intense,
yet he's so quiet--unlike me.

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.960
Stay calm. Relax your body.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:19.710
Huh?

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:22.210
Maintain correct form
as you slice through the water.

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:25.460
You'll be fine. Human beings generally float.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.800
Oh, um, right! I'll give it a try!

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:50.170
What's up?

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:54.300
Nothing. Just... I haven't gotten any better.

00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:58.510
Huh?

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:05.170
The fireworks festival is today.

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:08.880
Is it, now?

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:12.210
Hang on a sec.

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:14.050
Senpai?

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.380
Uzaki. Here.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.050
Huh? Er...

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:26.670
Aren't you hungry?

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:29.800
Well, I <i>did</i> do all that swimming...

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.210
Thanks.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.420
It's good.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.550
You're almost there. Keep it up.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:54.920
I feel like I should apologize, Sakurai- <i>senpai</i> .

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.670
You went over it with me so many times.

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:59.590
Uzaki?

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:01.260
Listen, I--

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.840
--Gorgeous!
--So beautiful!

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:12.260
Senpai!

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:13.760
Whoa!

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.920
Look! Just look at that!

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.840
So pretty... and so <i>big</i> !

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:25.920
Wow...

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.050
Senpai?

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:46.010
Mmm... Uza--

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.550
Oh, thank goodness. You're awake!

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:52.840
Y-Yeah...

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:56.210
Am I--on Uzaki's lap? Why? How?!

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:01.380
Did I... pass out?

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.550
Not for very long at all.

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:07.920
The fireworks show hasn't even started yet.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.760
Oh...

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:13.050
Hey, no getting up!

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:16.590
The person who helped me carry you
said that even if you're awake,

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:19.760
you ought to stay lying down for a while.

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.960
R-Right...

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:29.380
Maybe it's because my line of sight is
blocked... but damn, something smells <i>great</i> .

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.760
Senpai...

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.170
Yeah?

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:35.960
I'm so sorry. A thousand times sorry.

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:40.460
It's fine, really.
Besides, this was an accident.

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:44.840
I got pretty carried away myself.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.090
Yeah, but...

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:50.550
Don't sweat it, truly. I'm begging you.

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:53.340
Okay. Understood.

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:58.420
Man. She'd only just bounced back--and now this.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:03.090
Not that I can see it,
but I bet she's making that face again.

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:07.460
That's right--the same face
she made back then, too.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:12.670
It's like Ami and the café owner said:
she's thinking about appearances.

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:19.460
But when <i>she</i> does that?
It's only natural things would feel a little off.

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:22.210
Listen, Uzaki...

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:25.210
When you started at our college last year?

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:30.210
Honestly, I didn't think much
about you becoming my junior again.

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:34.380
But you know...

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:39.510
You started getting really
buddy-buddy with me last spring.

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:42.960
To tell you the truth,
you seriously got on my nerves.

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:47.460
Still...

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:52.260
I thought back on everything
that's happened so far.

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.630
You tagged along everywhere I went,

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:58.800
sometimes even infringing
on the spaces I used for relaxation.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:03.260
But we hung out together,
going to the beach and the cat café,

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.760
even reaching the point where
the two of us could go drinking.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:12.380
And going to see the fireworks,
like we are today...

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:18.460
Until last year, I'd never done
so much or gone to so many places.

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.710
I could do without all the noise...

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:25.550
but when it comes down to it, it was pretty fun.

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:27.300
And what's more...

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:32.420
I hate to say it,
but it's probably thanks to you

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:38.170
that I've gotten used to that kind of thing.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:43.800
So, uh, what I'm saying is... don't be so down.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.920
It messes things up.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.630
Senpai...

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:53.630
There's still some summer break left.
Let's go somewhere again.

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:55.420
If you're okay with that.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.800
Well... Well, if you insist!

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:05.510
I'll keep you company on
your loner summer break!

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:08.710
Good. I hope you will.

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:15.210
Hey, it's started.

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:16.760
It sure has.

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:25.760
Can you see the fireworks, Senpai?

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.170
Just barely.

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:28.670
Just barely?

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:31.050
Never mind.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.800
What a show!

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.760
Keep it up!

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:41.340
I can't see a thing.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:48.300
Nah--I'm fine right here.

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:49.840
Senpai?

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:50.840
Yeah?

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:55.510
Where are you going tomorrow?
Wherever it is, I'll come with you.

00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:00.960
Right. What <i>should</i> we do tomorrow, huh?
