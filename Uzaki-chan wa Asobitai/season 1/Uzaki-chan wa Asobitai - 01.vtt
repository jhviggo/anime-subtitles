00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.670
Now there's a sight
that makes it feel like spring.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.460
Sakurai- <i>senpai</i> !

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.840
Huh?

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.710
Uzaki... right?

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.840
Hana Uzaki! I'll be your junior again here.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.550
Here's to a great year!

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.840
Huh? You don't swim here in college?

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.710
Nope. They don't even have a swim club.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.210
And you worked so hard at it in high school...

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.510
Ah, there's plenty of stuff to do in college.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.300
Senpai...

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.460
Y-Yep, there sure is.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.840
Or so I thought.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.840
Oh, Senpai!

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.960
What the...

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.840
What in the...

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.840
What in the what?

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.840
<i>What</i> in the <i>what</i> ?!

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.050
I kinda thought this year
would turn out like that...

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.340
Senpai!

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.260
Whoops! Overshot you!

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.460
Uzaki... right?

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.010
All alone again today, huh?
I guess I'll have to hang out with you!

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.010
Your college loner lifestyle ends today!

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.760
What's for lunch?

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.510
Mmm... the dining hall, I guess.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.010
Hey, can we come, too?

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:38.590
Canceled, huh? Now my afternoon is wide open.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.880
Senpai!

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.670
No work today, either. What to do...

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.550
Eek!

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.050
That <i>glare</i> !

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.510
S-Scary...

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.510
Senpai!

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.380
Maybe I'll just bum around on my own for once.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:03.710
Can't get any quiet time once <i>she</i> horns on in.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:03.710
Senpai, Senpai, Senpai, Senpai!

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.340
It's like I always tell you:
quit yelling so <i>lou</i> --

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.590
I kept calling you,
but you just weren't hearing me!

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.710
So! Where ya headed, Senpai?

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.460
What the hell are you doing, Uzaki, you idiot?!

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.090
Oh, going out for lunch today?

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.170
Aw, too bad. My friends and I already ate.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.460
But if you insist, I could watch <i>you</i> eat.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.010
I've got no classes this afternoon.
I'm just going for a stroll.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.380
Later.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.340
Uzaki... why are you following me?

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.050
Yikes, that face!

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.380
As it turns out,
I'm suddenly free this afternoon, too.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.590
Given half the chance,
I know you'll do the old loner thing.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.630
And two has gotta be <i>way</i> more fun than one!

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.460
Mind your own business.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.010
Besides, I've told you a million times
that I find quiet time alone more relaxing.

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.050
Here we go again. Being a loner is no fun!

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.340
Stop calling me that.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.590
That's right: you're not
a loner--'cause <i>I'm</i> with you!

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.960
Quit tagging along, you damn pest!

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.880
Feeling self-conscious?

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.340
I am not!

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.550
So where are we going?

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:24.420
Not telling.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.840
Karaoke? Bowling?

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:26.800
Not telling.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.670
Aw, tell me!

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:29.590
No.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.010
Ugh! Why are you being so cold today?

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.380
It's my mood.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.260
Your <i>mood</i> ?!

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.800
What's the deal? You hung out with me before!

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.670
Huh?

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.920
Treating me according to your moods...

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:50.300
Isn't it sooo convenient that you get
with me only when you feel like it?!

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.300
Watch your phrasing when there's people around!

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.840
Enemy of womankind.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:56.880
Utter trash.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.590
Scum.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.590
Okay, fine! Come along, then!

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.170
Hooray!

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.630
Hey, once we're done, let's get some food, huh?

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.340
I'll gladly go with you to dinner!

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.920
I'm not paying.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.590
Aw, cheapskate.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.760
Are you trying to sponge off me?

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.880
Wait, were you going to see
a movie by yourself today?

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.760
Huh? That's right.

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:35.260
Solo movies!

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.420
What's so funny?

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.130
Solo movies!

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:45.840
That's a prime loner move, right up there
with solo BBQ and solo sushi-go-round!

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.340
Shut up for once, would you?

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.960
You're going to make enemies
in all sorts of places.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.880
At least talk a little more quietly!

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.010
Listen, this is the "people are people" era.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:02.460
We all want to find time in our busy days
to see the movies we want the <i>way</i> we want.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:03.590
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:07.300
Shouldn't we all spend
our leisure time however we please?

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.260
Don't laugh at other people's hobbies
judged by your standards.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:11.800
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:18.260
Plenty of people watch movies as a hobby.
They don't declare when and with whom.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.630
That's how it is.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.510
I see.

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:24.260
Spoken like a true loner!

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.670
Can I wallop her--just once?

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:31.800
Anyone can go to the movies
alone whenever they feel like it.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.260
The scheduling alone is a hassle
with more people in the mix.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.170
I see.

00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:42.460
But you can't loudly talk spoilers with
your friends afterward when you go alone!

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:48.590
That's like one of the worst possible
things you can do as a human being!

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:51.800
It's okay. I get it.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:56.630
You're determined to soldier
on alone despite your loneliness.

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:59.050
Don't give me that affectionate look!

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.960
Honestly. I knew I shouldn't have brought you.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:06.300
I was planning to follow you
all sneaky-like anyway.

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:12.380
What's your deal? Is that your idea of fun?

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.960
Huh?

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:19.460
It'd be funny if I spotted you going
into some weird store or something!

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:24.090
I know I'd laugh myself silly
if I saw you buying dirty DVDs!

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:28.210
Ow! Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:31.960
Senpai, I--Senpai--Senpai! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle!

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.340
College students are <i>adults</i> !

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:38.130
No mocking people's hobbies
or digging into their private lives!

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:40.760
Sorry! I'm sorry!

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:41.800
Sheesh.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:46.630
I haven't even been able to pick
a movie with you all up in my business.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:50.050
You came without a movie in mind?

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:52.510
It was a last-minute thing.

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:56.510
Besides, choosing at the theater
is one of the thrills of solo movies.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.840
Oh, is it, now?

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:12.260
Uzaki.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:13.420
Yes?

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.550
If there's something you want to see, I'll pay.

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:18.300
Huh? Really? What about your solo movie?

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.710
It's not like I <i>have</i> to go solo.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:25.010
And with you here,
I can watch something different.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:28.170
I figure my points will cover the two of us.

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:33.670
Seriously?! Well, if you say
so--I'll let you treat me! Thanks!

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:35.760
Let's see...

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:40.880
This one! What a bargain:
heroes as far as the eye can see!

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:45.760
Ooh, that's a great one. I saw it once,
but I was thinking about seeing it again.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.670
Huh!

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:51.340
Two college students, please.
I'll use my points.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:54.050
Certainly. One moment.

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:58.760
She has her moments,
but she's still so smackable.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.340
She seems happy.
I guess I can do this much for her.

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:06.840
By the way, Senpai...

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:13.170
You've seen enough solo movies
to pay for someone else's ticket!

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:16.050
That's a turn-off, all right!

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.760
You would say that <i>after</i> I've paid, dammit!

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.090
You're, like, a pro-level loner!

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:26.670
Huh? Uh, wait--Senpai?

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:31.960
Kidding! Sorry! I'm sorry! Yow! Stop! Stop!

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:31.960
Will that couple <i>ever</i> shut up?!

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:37.880
That was great!

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.090
Yeah. A good film's always worth a rewatch.

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:44.420
All those points you banked
by going to the movies alone--gone!

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.420
That's your standard for "great"?!

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:49.760
So much for being nice.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:54.630
Hey, can we stop by the electronics store?
I need new earbuds.

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:56.510
Yeah, sure.

00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:59.840
See, it's that kind of thing.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:00.960
Huh?

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:07.460
What is it about this shop that makes me think,

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.590
"Since I'm here, I should buy something"?

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:12.340
Hey, nice.

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:14.420
Senpai!

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:15.510
Yeah?

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:17.760
Over here! This way!

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:20.960
What about your earbuds?

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.920
C'mon, the next seat's open!

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.130
Will you <i>listen</i> ?

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:28.460
Ah, might not be so bad after a movie.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:32.300
That's right! It's great. It works!

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.760
Oh, this is nice. Real nice.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.130
Right?

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:40.010
Though with me, it's always
my shoulders more than my back.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:41.590
Shoulders?

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:45.760
Wha--where did <i>that</i> come from?

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:51.710
Oh, sorry... I can't help
but make noise during a massage...

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:55.420
My, uh, my shoulders have always been tight--

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:59.550
Well, um... i-if you keep on doing that...

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:04.670
I would buy this in a second
if I had the money...

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:10.550
It... It just... It feels sooo good...

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.590
Let's go, shall we?!

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.960
That wasn't even five minutes!

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:25.170
Shut up! Save... Save that for home!

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:26.840
Save what?

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:33.550
Jeez, this dummy... making all
those weird noises in a public place...

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:35.340
Hey, Senpai!

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:35.340
What now?

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:43.590
Ten minutes of standing on this,
and it's like getting a full workout!

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:48.800
Well? You try!

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:53.960
Oh, my God! You're such an <i>idiot</i> !

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:59.380
Whoa! Check it out!

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.210
What is it this time?

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:04.090
Look: it's VR! VR!

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:06.550
Huh! So this is virtual reality...

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:08.510
Would you like to try?

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:10.800
Yes! I sure would!

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:24.260
My view goes with me when I turn!
VR is amazing! This is really cool, Senpai!

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.420
Okay, okay. Just keep your voice down.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.210
My weapon! No! Not this one!
Ammo! I'm outta ammo!

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:33.210
Hey, is there anyone behind you?

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:35.170
Huh? Behind me?!

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:37.170
Here they come! Look at 'em all!

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.510
Your reactions are the best.

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:44.260
They should put you in a commer--

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:51.710
They got me! Wow, VR is awesome!

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:53.550
Er, are you all right?

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:55.590
I'm fine.

00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:59.710
What is it, Senpai?

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:02.300
Um, would your boyfriend like a turn?

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:04.170
I'm not her boyfriend.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.710
But... okay.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.340
Something not so dangerous.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.460
These ocean graphics are something else!

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:22.260
Hey, you look like a regular person with
those goggles. They hide your bad-guy face!

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.510
Shut it, dimwit.

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:26.670
Whoa! That's huge! A giant shark!

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.340
Wait, is it coming this way?

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.130
Huh? Is it?!

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:34.960
I-It's biting me! It's totally biting me! Yow!

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.800
You're way too scared!

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.340
You're one to talk!

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:40.590
Let me go! Hey!

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:46.170
I'm gonna get this disgraceful display
on video and tease you about it later!

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:49.010
Uh, miss? Don't get too close to the player...

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:51.050
Just so <i>huge</i> !

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:53.710
Hmm? What's this?

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:55.800
A jellyfish? Octopus? Sunfish?!

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.550
It's so big. And soft! And kind of frightening!

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:05.210
I never thought much of VR, but it's amazing!

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:08.510
So powerful--and it even reproduces touch!

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:09.800
Are you all right?

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.170
Yeah, it's okay. I'm fine.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.340
You said that VR made you want
to do something physical--

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.340
now you're swinging that bat all excited
and racking up a pile of strikes!

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:31.590
Focus!

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:33.170
Will you <i>shut up</i> ?

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:37.300
Here comes the next one! You can do it!
Knock it out of the park! Home run!

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.760
That's <i>enough</i> out of--

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:43.840
That <i>so</i> didn't fly straight!

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:46.760
Dammit.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:50.170
You said you did this before.
You totally didn't!

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:52.880
You really tick me off, dammit.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.710
I played for <i>one year</i> in junior high.

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:58.050
Ooh! I wanna try, too!

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:00.210
Here's my card. There's still some on there.

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:01.670
Thanks!

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:06.090
Don't stand too close or the ball will hit you.

00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:07.130
Got it!

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:09.630
If I hit a home run, dinner's on you!

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:11.760
Eyes forward! You want to get hurt?

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:15.340
Okay... plant the feet...

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:17.550
Swivel the hips...

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.920
Like the real deal.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.960
Huh? Wait--did--

00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:29.090
Did you stretch?

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:37.590
Oh.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:42.460
It... It hurts...

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:42.460
Are you <i>nuts</i> ,
whipping out a full swing like that?!

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.300
Lay down this instant!

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:45.960
I heard a pop...

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.460
Yeah, I'll say!

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:52.010
I copied you... and look where it got me...

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:55.210
A novice can't just start
putting their hips into a swing!

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:57.590
Of <i>course</i> you're gonna hurt yourself, dummy!

00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:01.130
This pain is all your fault...

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:03.300
How so?!

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:08.630
Just go home and get some sleep.
And see a doctor tomorrow.

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:11.960
A doctor, you say?

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.420
Let's get dinner!

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:15.840
Do you ever give up?!

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:20.380
Let's eat!

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:26.670
You can walk fine on your own,
so it's probably nothing serious.

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:29.710
If it still hurts tomorrow, see a doctor.

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:32.710
And you really should head
home now and go to sleep.

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:35.010
I'll be fine.

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:36.710
Yummy yum yum.

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:39.170
You don't get a lot of exercise, do you?

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:42.800
That injury is proof
you haven't been very active.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.920
What did you expect? I'm just starting out!

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:52.630
Beginners need to warm up, at least.
Back injuries are a big deal.

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.050
Fine.

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:56.960
You realize that would never have happened

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.920
if you hadn't elbowed
your way into tagging alo--

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:03.170
Huh? My chicken...

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:04.420
Hey.

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.170
Why are <i>you</i> eating it?

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:08.260
Huh?

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.210
Did you eat them <i>all</i> ?!

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:12.300
Eh?

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.590
W-We're not sharing?

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:19.260
We are <i>not</i> , you idiot! And how is
it sharing when <i>you</i> eat them <i>all</i> ?!

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:24.710
Keep it!

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:29.710
Temper, temper! Your poor girlfriend!

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:31.760
She's not my girlfriend...

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.590
Another order of chicken, please.

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:35.710
Coming right up!

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:41.210
Your chicken's so good,
my chopsticks just kept going!

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:42.760
Good one, miss!

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.380
Talk about a sunny personality.

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:48.130
Here you go--on the house. Eat up!

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:49.550
Wow! Are you sure?

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:51.510
Oh, no, we couldn't!

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:54.260
Go on--it's fine!

00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:58.590
Delish!

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:01.880
Honestly.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.840
It's rude not to accept this kindness, Senpai!

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.920
Oh, uh... I guess you're right.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:10.840
Okay, don't mind if I--

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.960
Why do you eat <i>everything</i> ?!

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.340
Sorry! I didn't mean to!

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:20.170
Here's your chicken.

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:25.210
<i>Again</i> ?!

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:37.800
Senpai!

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:39.420
Good morning!

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:40.590
Hey.

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:43.460
I had fun yesterday!

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.630
What? All you did was hurt your back.

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:51.550
Huh? C'mon, it was fun going for
a whole day without being a loner, right?

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:55.960
I made it clear from the very beginning
that I intended to spend the day alone.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.840
Oh, look at you, pretending you're not happy.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.550
Watch it.

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:06.420
I've never been to a batting cage with
my girlfriends before, either. That was new!

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:11.300
Teach me how to swing, okay?
Next time I wanna really send it flying!

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.800
Hey, how 'bout we go again today?

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.670
I have work.

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:19.260
Aw. Next time, then!

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:22.170
"Next time," huh?

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:28.840
This idiot really doesn't let a
little pain get in the way of having fun.

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:32.130
I don't know when she got like this...

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:38.670
Like this? Or like this?

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:43.300
Well, I won't be bored.
I can put up with her a little, I guess.

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.840
Yeah, next time.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.300
Uh, Senpai?

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:48.460
Hmm?

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:52.510
After that <i>thing</i> we did yesterday?
My back still hurts!

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:54.380
It's all your fault, you know.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:56.920
<i>Phrasing</i> !

00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:02.010
It even hurts to walk!
Carry me! C'mon--it's <i>your</i> fault!

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:04.880
Shut up!

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.920
Next time we'll meet the café owner!
