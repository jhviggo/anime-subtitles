WEBVTT

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.940
Let's get going!

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.860
Where to first?

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.780
Well, let's see.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.690
We're in Tottori, so...

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.190
No Starbucks, just Sandbox!

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.190
Crab rich, cash poor!

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.360
Welcome to Tottori Prefecture!

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.280
What's with that guy, Senpai?

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.440
Don't you know, dummy? Why, he's...

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.070
No 7-Elevens? Still heaven!
No 7-Elevens? Still heaven!

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.650
He's a big shot.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.360
We should probably hit the sand dunes first.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.530
Says here we can paraglide--or go sandboarding!

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.610
You like the more active stuff, huh?

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:41.570
Oh, yeah.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.650
All solo activities, I notice.
You're going full loner here in Tottori, too!

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.900
And <i>you</i> still don't know when to zip it.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.780
So how are we gonna get there?

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.780
We'll take a bus or something.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.190
Yoohoo!

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.230
Yo!

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.280
Itsuhito!

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.690
Ami!

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.320
So you're both here, too!

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.030
Dad gave me a summer break. And then...

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.690
I was thinking of taking
a trip when she ran into me

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.820
and suggested meeting up with you two here.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.400
Huh! I feel bad, you guys renting a car and all.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.860
Nah, it's totally fine.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.030
You're so thoughtful, Sakaki!

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.030
Your personality's a little iffy,
but you sure are thoughtful!

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.900
That personality, though...

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.150
Please, enough with the compliments!

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.900
Those weren't compliments.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.190
It's definitely more convenient
to travel by car. See?

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.190
It's a lot <i>broader</i> than I imagined.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.070
Right? A rental car is a must
if you want real freedom.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.280
Spoken like a seasoned traveler.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.690
You know me!

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.110
So went our story.
But our trip here serves another purpose.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.190
That's right: Hana and Sakurai,
vacationing alone together...

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.860
I view their relationship as hands-off,
and even <i>I</i> couldn't stay away!

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.530
We've been watching over them thus far.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.530
We have a duty to see
this trip through to its end!

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.230
And we get front-row seats! What a treat!

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.730
Not to mention a trip to Tottori.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.190
Pure happenstance, but amusing nonetheless.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.280
These two still don't know the <i>real</i> Tottori!

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.530
Hey, a 7-Eleven!

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.360
Hey, yeah! So they <i>do</i> have them.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.360
When you see them in person,
they really are spectacular.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.320
Aren't they? What a sight!

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.650
The Tottori Sand Dunes
measure 2.4 km north to south

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.820
and 16 km east to west.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.900
They're the largest
accessible sand dunes in Japan.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.230
The dune in front there is called
the Horse's Back; it's about 50 meters high.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.570
It's quite popular:
you can see the entirety of the dunes

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.690
and take in views of
the Japan Sea from its peak.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.980
Wow, nice!

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.570
All right, Senpai! Race you to the ocean!

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.610
You're on!

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.730
If I win, you owe me a <i>nashi</i> pear ice cream!

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.280
And if <i>I</i> win, <i>you</i> owe <i>me</i>
a sand-dune coffee ice cream!

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.110
Okay, here goes.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.480
Get set...

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.730
Go!

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.570
The sand's really grabbing my feet.
This is <i>tough</i> !

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:12.900
Hey, hey!

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:13.860
Wha--

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.150
Hey! What is <i>that</i> ?

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.980
A sandboard, just like you were
talking about! I reserved one!

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.280
That's not fair!

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.320
Ha! A contest begins well before it starts!

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.110
Catch you on the flip side!

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.780
Dammit!

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.530
You'll never catch up to me, Sen... pai?

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.150
Hold it right there!

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.400
I win.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:01.070
A competition...
against this... beautiful backdrop...

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.690
Have you no <i>soul</i> ?

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:08.780
I admire your nerve, whining
about losing under the circumstances.

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.480
Still...

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:16.030
It really is beautiful.
Makes our race seem like small potatoes.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.480
So I don't owe you?

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.110
No--you do.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.030
Excuse me!

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.280
Could you please take our picture?

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.820
Oh, sure.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.440
Thank you!

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.030
Tottori!

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.530
Thank you very much!

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.440
Oh, Atsy-pie, you look <i>so cool</i> in that shot!

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.690
And <i>you</i> are just <i>too cute</i> , Miho-Miho!

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.320
Sh-Shall we?

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.400
I can't walk...

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.530
Oh, all right.

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.280
I still have some strength left.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.780
It's so round!

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:13.940
This is Japan's oldest circular school building,
originally a primary school.

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.110
Now dilapidated, it was due to be torn down,

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:21.360
but the many citizens who wanted it
to remain spurred officials into action,

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.360
and the building was reborn as a museum!

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.980
Now it has various local specialties on display.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.150
Regional specialties, eh?

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.900
Like <i>nashi</i> pears?

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.230
Can't forget Matsuba snow crabs...

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.280
Figurines!

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.940
And Nendoroids, too!

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:54.150
Tottori is the Manga Prefecture,
the birthplace of many manga artists--

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:57.820
and home to a figurine factory as well!

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:03.280
In other words, manga and figurines
are indeed local Tottori specialties!

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.440
I'm starting to get that feeling, yes.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.070
Really packs an irresistible punch.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.070
Oh, these are adorable!

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:12.900
Senpai, buy these for me as a souvenir!

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.690
<i>Four</i> of them?

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:18.530
They look like four sisters--and
I want the full set!

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:21.650
Oh! Different versions! Double or nothing!

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:23.940
Double-- <i>nothing</i> !

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.150
Tottori!

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:33.530
A rabbit!

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:36.150
And that "Mistress Himiko!" person.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.610
Ōkuninushi-no-Mikoto.

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.900
Also known as Ōnamuji-no-Kami.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:44.530
Ōkuninushi-no-Mikoto,
famously of "The White Hare of Inaba,"

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:47.480
in enshrined here at Hakuto Shrine.

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:54.690
Because the deity healed a hare
whose fur had been torn off by a shark,

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:59.320
the shrine is revered for its benefits
to those with skin diseases and injuries.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.230
Senpai, look! Rabbit cakes!

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.650
Wow, those look tasty!

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:10.980
Er, Uzaki? Who's this?

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.610
The shop clerk.

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:14.730
Would you mind paying, please?

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:16.730
Much obliged, Senpai!

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:18.780
Now it's <i>my</i> treat?!

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.150
Soft and chewy and oh so delish!

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:26.190
Good for you.

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:29.030
Oh, don't be so angry. Here!

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.820
There's enough for you, too.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.110
All right. Here goes.

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.190
Ack! He's gonna gobble me up!

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.860
Ugh! Curse you humans!

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:44.690
Nooo!

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:47.900
Will you shut up? I can't eat like this!

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.980
You're not gonna eat that?

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.900
Well! Don't mind if I do!

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.230
Half! In one bite!

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:59.860
Mmm-mmm- <i>mmm</i> ! One more bite!

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:01.940
As if!

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.480
You're wide open!

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.280
Inattention is the greatest foe.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.480
Look here...

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.030
Isn't it just so delicious?

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.110
Mmm, it sure is!

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.150
Okay: say "ah"!

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.820
Aw, you ate half of it!

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:30.400
You have to <i>notice</i> these things
<i>before</i> you go off on a roll!

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.070
Right...

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:33.440
Quit looking at my mouth!

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.860
Is this it?

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:45.320
Yes. Any minute now and they
should tweak to the truth about Tottori.

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:53.230
May our travels end without a hitch.

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:56.070
May Senpai's loner ways be healed.

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:58.150
I'm not a loner!

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:02.570
Hey, they have fortunes, Senpai!
Let's see who wins!

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:04.860
It's not a competition.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.690
But sure.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.110
Ha! "Middling Luck"--this <i>has</i> to be a winner!

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:19.650
Nice try! Mine is "Great Luck"--"Great Luck"!

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:21.730
Looks like I win!

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:28.400
How's it feel to be all smug about
middling luck and then <i>lose</i> , huh? Huh?

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.940
I have no words.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.730
Now then! What's it say?

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:37.940
"Hobbies: A gamer is best.
Personality: Preferably a loner.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.690
Age: One year older.

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:44.320
Direction: Right in front of"...

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.650
Huh?

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.730
What kind of fortunes <i>are</i> these?!

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:52.070
Huh?

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.280
Don't tell me... is this shrine...

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:04.820
"Hakuto Shrine couples." "Search."

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.360
Hmph. It seems you've finally arrived.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.480
You've reached the truth of Hakuto Shrine--

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:15.030
indeed, that of Tottori itself.

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:16.860
You <i>knew</i> ?

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:19.030
We didn't do all that touring for nothing.

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:25.320
That myth has linked Hakuto Jinja
to healing skin conditions and injuries.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.150
But <i>that</i> is just a cover!

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:32.440
That same hare arranged a match between
Ōkuninushi-no-Mikoto and Yagamihime.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:35.070
And based on this, Japan's first love story,

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:39.110
Hakuto is a <i>matchmaking</i>
shrine--rivaling the shrine at Izumo!

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.860
And Tottori is home to two <i>more</i> sites,

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:46.190
both veritable meccas for lovers
on a par with Hakuto Shrine here.

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:48.360
Do you see what I'm saying?

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:51.480
No way...

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:56.400
That's right: to say that
"Tottori tourists" equals "couples in love"

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.940
is no exaggeration!

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.860
That's where you two,
a man and a woman, came to visit.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:06.570
And <i>this</i> is how everyone else saw you!

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:09.030
"I'm not too heavy, am I, darling?"

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:13.780
"You're lighter than
a Tottori dune beetle, my honey!"

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.690
"Mementos of my Tottori trip with you, darling!"

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.650
"I'll take everything on the shelf!"

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:24.110
"Oh, darling, rabbit cakes
taste best ears first."

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:27.690
"I'm a tail-first kind of guy, my honey!"

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:29.570
You have <i>got</i> to be <i>kidding</i> me!

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:33.360
But people totally did think you were a couple.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.360
Ha ha! Sak and Hana, sittin' in a tree!

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.150
Damn you...

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.150
K-I-S-S-I-N-G!

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:44.230
What are you <i>talking</i> about?
Me and Senpai, all lovey-dovey? Yeah, right!

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:46.070
Oh, come off it already!

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:49.820
Why does everything have
to be about love with you, anyway?

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:53.110
Is that all there is?
Are you some kind of love fiend?

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:55.440
You really are hopeless.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:06.280
At 1,700 meters tall, Daisen is the
highest mountain in the Chugoku region.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:12.360
It's a destination for all seasons with
autumn color and snowy winter landscapes.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.690
And it's another spot for lovers.

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:16.230
Not that again...

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.280
That has nothing to do with us!

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.440
C'mon, Senpai. Here's the lift.

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:27.030
A couple's seat! Isn't that wonderful?

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:29.360
They must be really in love!

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:32.780
Sak and Hana, sittin' in a tree!

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:36.820
Please, go ahead.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.190
Oh! You must play for the other team!

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:40.190
Oho!

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:41.900
<i>What</i> "other team"?!

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:44.150
You're dragging <i>me</i> into this?

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.900
I just want to enjoy my Tottori trip!

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.610
It really isn't like that with--

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:11.480
Uzaki!

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.730
Eeyeah?!

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.900
We came here to hang out in Tottori--that's all.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:18.940
To visit the dunes, eat <i>nashi</i> and Matsuba crabs,

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:22.610
and have fun with all
the <i>Conan</i> and <i>Kitaro</i> stuff!

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:23.900
Right?

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:25.860
Uh... yeah.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:30.030
All right! So let's forget
the others and enjoy ourselves!

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:31.440
Senpai...

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.860
We'll show <i>them</i> !

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.650
Right on!

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:41.980
Dammit, Tottori, read the <i>room</i> !

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.650
Tottori!

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:54.820
With 850 years of history,
Misasa is a world-class radium hot spring

00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:01.400
and home to many types of hot-spring treatments.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:07.820
It's said that any malady will be cured
after your third morning at this hot spring,

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:13.400
hence the name: written with
the characters "three" and "morning."

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.690
See you later.

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:16.400
Yep.

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:22.940
Phew, I'm beat.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.480
We did a ton of running around today.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:30.690
Are you sure about this? After finally
getting to share a room with Sakurai?

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:35.820
Just kidding.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:38.820
What are you doing? That was your chance!

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:42.780
I told you, it's not like that.

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:44.860
Hey.

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.530
It <i>will</i> be.

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:49.690
Itsuhito...

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:53.400
Look, you're wrong, okay?

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.730
Senpai! Let's go to the steam bath--

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.860
Don't you dare!

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:13.070
At Misasa Hot Spring, the waters are
for soaking, drinking, and breathing in.

00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:19.360
Inhaling the mist at this steam bath
will cure what ails you from the inside out.

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:23.440
I bet it'll heal your mean face
if you inhale enough of it.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.940
Really? I better get breathing, then.

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.570
Hey. Rude.

00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:30.400
Pretty half-hearted comeback there, Sakurai.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.320
It's so hot, that's all he can manage.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.860
Wow, you're sweating buckets.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:40.530
It's never-ending.

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:43.480
Can I have your towel, Senpai?

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.900
Just how sweaty <i>are</i> you?

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:50.440
It's pouring out of me. Your towel...

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:56.730
Senpai, you're all damp and sticky!

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:59.650
That's <i>your</i> fault! Get off me!

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.610
That tickles!

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:07.190
Sorry--you're going to have to deal with it!

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:12.730
Yow! Not there!

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:12.730
Please! Save that for
the privacy of your room!

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:15.110
Eh?

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:24.940
Ah, this feels great!

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:27.070
Especially after sweating so much.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:32.400
I was soaking wet!
Senpai wouldn't give me his towel.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.610
He is <i>so</i> inconsiderate!

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:36.900
Who are you calling inconsiderate?

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:40.280
Are you eavesdropping on us? Pervert!

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.780
Oh, shut up.

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:47.900
All that sweating must have
flushed the badness out of you.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.650
Now go live an orderly life.

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:52.940
"Badness"? What "badness"?

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:56.780
<i>You're</i> the villain-faced loner introvert!

00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:01.190
If only you'd sweated
out your annoyingness, too.

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:03.530
And at a hot spring, no less.

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:06.070
What an unsexy conversation.

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:09.570
All right--fine!

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:11.690
Let's see which one of us is worse!

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:14.030
Oh, you are <i>on</i> !

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.030
Gotcha.

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.320
They're just not going in...

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:45.070
All right: I've got the hang of it.
I can win this.

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:49.400
You can put those
extra balls in this box, Senpai.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.320
Hey, thanks.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:52.940
Sure thing.

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:54.570
Now then...

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:55.440
Hey!

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.400
Tch.

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:02.780
Hurry up, Senpai!

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:04.980
Wait up, will you?

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:07.980
Make it snappy or you're gonna lose!

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:09.860
This is tyranny!

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:13.110
So nothing changed, after all that.

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:17.900
That's all right.
They're tasty enough just as they are.

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:21.400
Are they, though?

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.860
A frog! What's this for?

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:25.980
What, indeed?

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.190
A matchmaking <i>kajika</i> frog?

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:33.530
"Rub to make your dream match come true."

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.280
I guess they <i>are</i> pretty tasty.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.150
Right?

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:42.570
Thanks for the feast.

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:50.030
We <i>have</i> to finish with this place!

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:53.780
Check out all these <i>yōkai</i> , Senpai!

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:56.730
There are some I know and some I've never seen.

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:01.070
There are 177 bronze statues of <i>yōkai</i>

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:06.320
over 800 meters of this street,
which leads to Sakaiminato Station.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:09.530
177 of them? Amazing!

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:11.320
What's this, Senpai?

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.280
A dragon?

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:16.690
Let's see... Nope! It's a <i>shiro-uneri</i> !

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:18.940
<i>Shiro... uneri</i> ?

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:21.190
Okay, next! What's this?

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:22.440
A crayfish?

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.980
Bzzt! An <i>amikiri</i> !

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:27.190
These are tough. What's the next one?

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:28.860
Right here!

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:29.730
A yeti!

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:35.610
<i>Keukegen</i> ! What's this "yeti" stuff?
That's not even Japanese--whoa!

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:38.480
Dammit. You try this next one. Here.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.110
Wait: this is--aw!

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:42.440
<i>Rokuro-Kubi</i> ! It's <i>Rokuro-Kubi</i> !

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.480
<i>I</i> knew <i>that</i> one!

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:47.650
Okay, moving on!

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.820
Yep, this is the place.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:56.280
The Mizuki Shigeru Museum is a must-see.

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:41.110
Hey, there's my name for once.
