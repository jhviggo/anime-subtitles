WEBVTT

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.890
Look, Senpai--the ocean!

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.600
I mean, obviously.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.970
Right?

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.810
Ocean! Ocean! Ocean!

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.930
It's so hot...

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.430
"Beach Barn"
"Watermelon Piñatas 2,000 Yen"

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.720
Niiice.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.600
The beach in summer makes everyone open up.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.310
What are these four doing there?

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.720
It all began one afternoon a week earlier,

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.600
right here in this café.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.180
All right, folks: here comes
<i>Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!</i>

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.020
Ready? Go!

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.600
And so,

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.020
this is our new part-timer: Hana Uzaki.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.310
Glad to be part of the team!

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.890
What's the big idea?

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.930
You were so gung-ho on me quitting
so I could get some peace!

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.180
Aw, don't be a hater. We'll have fun!

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.180
Although I'm here in part because
I wanted to see that hater face of yours.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.310
Damn you!

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.270
With summer break around the corner and all,
I wanted a little more spending money.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.390
I asked the owner and got his immediate okay!

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.850
I thought it'd be fun,
so I figured I'd hire her.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.270
<i>That's</i> your reason?!

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.060
Now, Sakurai, you may not like Hana,

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.970
but she <i>is</i> the one who
came to me looking for a job.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.390
Wouldn't it be wrong for you to try to stop her?

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.140
B-But...

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.850
Well, just show her the ropes for now.
One learns by teaching, you know.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.140
All right.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.390
You sure about this, Senpai?
Think you can teach me?

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.140
Listen, you...

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.850
When a customer comes in,
show them to their seat.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.310
Regulars often head to their
favorite spot before you take them there.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.720
I'm a practice customer.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.810
Here: ice water and a hand towel.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.600
This is the first thing
we bring to each new customer.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.060
Wait till you see they're seated,
then bring these out.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:10.430
Please let me know when you're ready to order.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.350
Careful not to make a menu-reading
customer feel rushed or pressured.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.520
Then you take their order.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.390
That's how it usually goes. Next we'll--

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:21.680
Ooh! Senpai!

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.560
Huh? What is it?

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.060
Where are all the jokes?

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.680
There aren't any! What exactly did you expect?!

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.930
This act is going on forever!
You gotta toss in a little joke or three.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.390
<i>What</i> act?! We're not putting on a skit here!

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.390
So serious!

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:42.060
Of <i>course</i> ! You're getting
paid for this--take it seriously!

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.890
So serious!

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.140
Hey, it's <i>your</i> café, Mr. Employer!

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.930
We've been showing her how
it's done since before you arrived.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.970
This right here was all about winding you up!

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.810
What the hell?!

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.680
Thank you very much!

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.140
Hey, are you going anywhere over summer break?

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.270
Hmm? Nowhere in particular.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.100
I've been looking forward
to this game that's coming out--

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.060
I plan to hole up at home as much as possible.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.720
What?!

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.140
You do that all year long!

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.350
You're gonna waste your
precious summer break on <i>games</i> ?!

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.930
Oh, man... this is shaping up
to be the best summer ever!

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.390
Th-This athletic shut-in is just hopeless.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.600
I've got to do something!

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.810
Then let's go to the beach! Or a pool!

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:30.810
Eh?

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.890
Then it's settled! A done deal!

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:38.100
You haven't done any swimming since
you graduated high school, have you?

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.720
Now that you mention it... no.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.470
Huh!

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.850
Heard you were working together
and came by to see for myself.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.350
Huh?

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.640
Now <i>this</i> looks like a fun conversation!

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.640
It's so hot...

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.560
Hey, Ami!

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.850
Over here!

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.890
Hey, Hana!

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.350
Here, here! Over this way!

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.390
What a terrible sight.
Those things are <i>weapons</i> .

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:38.970
We rented an umbrella and
set out a beach blanket! C'mon!

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.810
Thanks!

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.970
I wish the bossman could have come, too.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.020
Not after he threw out his back.

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.140
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow...

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:55.270
Oh, Sakaki? He came a little earlier,
said he was gonna check out our lodging.

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.560
Right.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.060
I'll handle transportation and lodging.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.390
Huh? You sure, Itsuhito?

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.100
Hooray! Let's all go together!

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.390
Beach! Beach! Beach!

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.390
Hey! Where do you get off--

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:12.270
I know how you feel, but... it's <i>them</i> .

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.310
Can you in good conscience send them off?

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.390
Just the two of them--no regrets?

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:23.100
So now it's up to me to watch over those two.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:27.890
Oh? Where's Sakurai? Wasn't he with you?

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:31.180
Senpai? He's...

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.020
...there!

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.100
That's <i>far</i> ! How did he wind up out there?!

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.890
He got so hyped up gazing at the water,

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:42.640
then went running into it full tilt
like he just couldn't take it anymore!

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.270
That jerk will stop at nothing
to get his alone time.

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.720
I've never swum in the ocean before--

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.720
the waves make it
a little different than a pool.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:54.890
And fun!

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.770
Hardcore much?!

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:02.140
Listen, Sakurai, you don't need goggles
at the beach--let alone a swim cap!

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.470
You're not a lifeguard!

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.020
Oh, really?

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.470
See? It's like I told you.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:12.430
The whole swim-club look turns
people off, so let's skip it today.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:16.810
Look, we're here to have <i>fun</i> !
This is leisure time!

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:19.310
Forget all about swim club for now!

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:21.640
She's super ticked off.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.720
And why'd you leave Hana behind
and go swimming alone?

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.850
Huh?

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:33.270
See, if you're all alone, so is Hana.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:35.430
What if someone hits on her?

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:36.470
Huh?

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:41.640
Can <i>you</i> be responsible if something happens?

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.680
The guy she came with has to look out for her!

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.970
Got it? Say something!

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.680
Y-Yessir...

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.970
You can start with swimsuit compliments.

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:53.140
I doubt it'll come easy to you,
but that's what you get for going solo.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.890
Uh... okay.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.100
Let's see...

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.310
You look really good in that swimsuit.
Just wonderful.

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:03.310
The sky blue suits your personal image,

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:04.520
and, uh...

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:07.560
Not <i>mine</i> !

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:17.890
Wow, what a shock. Looking at me
so seriously from so close up...

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:19.390
Doofus.

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:20.930
Hey, Uzaki...

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:25.140
What's up, Senpai? The dolphin's almost ready.

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:35.890
Oh, dear! Did he say something?

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:39.970
Huh? Oh, nothing! Nothing at all!

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.100
Covering up her embarrassment, huh?

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:49.020
Will that do?

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.930
Good job. Well done.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:54.850
I remain somewhat suspicious.

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:58.890
Hey! Enjoying yourselves? I brought a snack!

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.180
Oh, thanks.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.890
Ooh, a watermelon!

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:03.970
But we'll use <i>this</i> .

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:05.220
A bat?

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.770
That's right--it's time for...

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.850
...a seaside standby: the watermelon piñata!

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.640
Why me?

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.270
You've never done it before!
We're making memories, Sak!

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.520
Okay, blindfold's on.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:25.270
If you insist. Come at me--from any direction!

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:29.020
It's actually more fun to be on the guiding end.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:32.560
Or the <i>mis</i> guiding end.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:38.180
First let's blindside him
and drop-kick him into the ocean!

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.970
You go there <i>first</i> ?

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:45.310
What kind of games do you play, anyway?

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:48.220
Okay, Uzaki, you get right on Sak there.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.270
Roger that!

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:53.060
Hang on--can I get a video
of this with my phone?

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.970
Hey! You realize I can
hear everything you're saying!

00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:58.930
Go on then, Sak!

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:03.810
Ooh, Senpai, you're practically a sitting duck.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.720
I'll get you for this.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.390
Okay, here goes...

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:08.100
Right!

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.560
Over a short distance: up, down, left, right, B!

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:16.430
That's how you <i>start</i> ? Are you nuts?

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:21.350
Down, up, down, B, down-right,
up-left, B, up, up-left, A!

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:25.060
Why the <i>hell</i> are you feeding me
inputs for fighting-game moves?!

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:27.180
Seriously, quit screwing around!

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:35.470
Right, right, up, down, left, B!
Left, down, right, up, A, B!

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.270
Wow, is she in her element.
Nothing left for us to do.

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:35.470
That doesn't make any sense!

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:35.470
Now that's what I call a gift.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:37.310
Dammit...

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:39.810
Start by walking forward, Sakurai.

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:41.770
A little to the right--to the right!

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:46.180
Senpai, Senpai! Up, X, down, B, L, Y, R, A!

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.140
Shut <i>up</i> , Uzaki!

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:52.680
Uh-oh--

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.350
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow...

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:58.640
Huh?

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.100
What's this? A jellyfish?

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.720
Now, come on--that's just way too convenient!

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:21.060
Hey, tell me where to go! Where's that melon?

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:23.810
Aren't you grabbing it right now?

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:25.220
Huh?

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:33.140
Could you please move first?

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:38.310
Are we there yet?

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:40.970
Relax. The place is just up ahead.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.810
What are <i>you</i> so pouty about?

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:48.600
Nothing. I'm not pouty.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.390
Oh?

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:53.270
It was bound to happen.

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:57.430
Ugh, forget it! Where's that damn watermelon?

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.470
Huh? Oh, so that <i>was</i> the watermelon.

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:24.060
He is <i>such</i> a doofus.

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:27.100
Here we are.

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.720
When you said you'd handle the lodging...

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.060
Is this your summer home?

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.810
Come on in. Pick whichever room you like!

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:41.310
I didn't know you were rich, Sakaki.

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:45.770
I knew you had a summer home,
but this is the first I've seen it.

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:48.390
I invited you last year--you just didn't come!

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:51.180
And my parents are the rich ones, not me.

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:55.020
Whoa! Check it out, Senpai!

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:57.720
A rich person's light switch!

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.220
Wow! It really is!

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.180
Whoa! The intercom has a camera!

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:03.270
Seriously?!

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:05.270
Whoa! It's one of those click-pull things!

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:06.970
Awesome!

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:12.310
What's your standard for "rich," anyway?

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:17.140
Take anything you want from the fridge.
I stocked it up for today.

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:18.220
Wow...

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:20.520
Look, Senpai: meat!

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.270
You do like meat, don't you?

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:26.180
Well, of course I do! After all, it <i>is</i> meat!

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:37.390
Mmm, delish! Cookouts are the <i>best</i> !

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:39.020
What are we going to do after this?

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.520
I brought a game!

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.100
So did I.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.060
Then it's a showdown!

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.520
Hey, you two, you can do that any old time!

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:51.930
It's summer break!
Sleeping away from home! And nighttime!

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:55.180
That calls for a certain... activity.

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:58.770
To the back hills!

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:07.520
Well, we did what you said
and followed you here...

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.390
Is there something up there?

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:11.310
It's awfully dark.

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:14.020
Are we going to build a campfire?

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:18.850
Sure, it's a little clichéd,
but it's just not summer without...

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:21.060
...a test of courage! Let's do it!

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:26.390
I'm out.

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:29.520
There's this bluff up ahead, see?

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.520
I don't want to hear it! I'm out!

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:35.140
What gives, Sak? Not into this kind of thing?

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:42.890
I don't play horror games
or watch horror flicks.

00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:44.850
And do you know why?

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:47.640
Because they're <i>scary</i> !

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.720
You struck a pose to say <i>that</i> ?

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.890
He's desperately trying to avoid danger.

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:55.720
Okay! I'm sorry!

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:59.970
I seriously didn't know it was
a problem for you. I apologize.

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:03.350
Still... while it's great to be honest and all,

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:07.180
maybe it wasn't such a hot idea
to announce your own weakness.

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:13.810
Huh...

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:18.100
So scary stuff is too much for you, eh, Senpai?

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:25.850
Why, I had no idea. Huh!

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:30.100
Knock that off, Uzaki. It was all my fault.

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:32.390
Isn't it too early to raise the white flag?

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:35.140
He really <i>can't</i> deal with scary stuff, can he?

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:35.930
Yoink!

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:36.810
Ah!

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:39.390
Woohoo! Got your phone!

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:42.970
Time to air <i>all</i> your dirty laundry
for everyone to see!

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:45.180
No! Give that back! I mean it!

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:48.140
You'll have to catch me first!

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.310
Damn you!

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:51.850
Ooh, you're <i>fast</i> , Senpai!

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:53.850
Quit going further in!

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:54.930
Wait up! Hey!

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:56.720
Was this the plan?

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:01.720
I figured we'd all go in together.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:06.930
Plus, I was picturing it the other way around.

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:10.810
Oh, Senpai, I'm so scared!

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:13.020
Good girl.

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.970
Ah, well. Shall we go after them?

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.640
The other day...

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.310
Huh?

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:28.680
You told me not to meddle, to watch over them.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.270
That's right.

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:36.180
So I thought I'd just create
the right conditions instead.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:40.810
Conditions for them to turn
into something interesting.

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:45.100
I knew it. I figured that's what happened.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:49.890
But when every move those
two make is so unexpected...

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:53.310
It doesn't go so well.

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:55.770
But... why?

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:56.640
Huh?

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.310
Why would you go to such lengths?

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:02.220
Why? Hmm...

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:06.720
Sak's a great guy,

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:11.640
but he's so damn serious,
and awkward, and bad at making friends,

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.890
and a loner...

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:17.140
And while I know it's none of my business,

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:21.350
I wish his college life could be more <i>fun</i> .

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:27.430
Otherwise, it's kind of
a waste, don't you think?

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:38.770
That and... other reasons.

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:41.390
Other reasons, huh?

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:42.930
Oh, there they are.

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:44.310
Huh?

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:47.270
I'm really sorry, Senpai. Please forgive me!

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:49.560
I got carried away.

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:55.520
Sakaki and Ami are here, see? We'll all head back
and have some ice cream, okay?

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.970
I can't move another step.

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:00.060
His voice is so weak!

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:03.640
All right, I'm calling it off. Let's go back.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.560
We can go back and play games, Senpai.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.390
Play games...

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:11.270
<i>So</i> weak!

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:20.140
Yesss! Look at <i>that</i> , Senpai! New high score!

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:28.470
You said you were going to play games!

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:41.970
Sakaki and Ami fell asleep, too...

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:45.810
Well, we <i>did</i> have a really active day today.

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:49.350
Everyone's just tuckered out.

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:54.470
Still, seeing his sleeping face
like this gets me all restless!

00:19:54.470 --> 00:20:00.060
It's your fault for letting down your guard!

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:03.720
S-S-Senpai! What are you doing?!

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.850
He's asleep?

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:13.470
So he's a hugger, huh? Didn't see that coming.

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:15.220
Phew, what a fright.

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:23.310
Wh-Whoa, Senpai!
You're not secretly awake, are you?!

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:29.270
He's out cold.

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:32.350
I guess he wouldn't do this if he were awake.

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:38.890
After all, I <i>am</i> the one who teased
the scaredy cat and tired him out.

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:43.600
Maybe it's okay for a little while, anyway.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:47.220
Just for today... Just for today...

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:19.470
Huh!

00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:23.220
So I fell asleep in the
living room after all that, eh?

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:30.600
But man, it feels like
I had a <i>great</i> night's sleep!

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:35.680
You might want to invest
in one of those body pillows.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.770
Huh? Why's that?

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:39.890
Oh, no reason!

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:49.520
I get the feeling we missed on
something <i>extremely</i> important.

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:53.020
<i>Next</i> time I'll get those two together for sure!

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:57.890
And I bet Kakyoin's soul
that you'll fail yet again!

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:41.020
Hana Uzaki is becoming an adult!
