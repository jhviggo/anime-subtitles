00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.770
Slow jazz at a moderate volume.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.310
Not-too-bright lighting.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.140
And the calming aroma of coffee.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.560
Providing a space where
customers can feel at ease:

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.560
That's been my business policy
ever since this place opened.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.350
A customer's coming up to pay, Sakurai.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.060
Would you mind?

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.220
Wow. You picked up on that so quickly.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.270
Mmm. Once you've been doing this
for ten years, you'll see it, too.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.060
Sakurai started working here last year.
He's pretty good.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.060
Thank you very much.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.430
His face may look a little scary,
but he's attentive.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.770
Sakurai understands my business policy here,

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.310
and whatever may happen,
he handles it with poise.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.520
Never, <i>ever</i> making a fuss or--

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.390
Senpai!

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.470
I've never heard Sakurai shout like that.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.060
So <i>this</i> is where you work!
It's super close to school, huh?

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.020
Niiice!

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.970
A close friend, perhaps?

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.220
Why didn't you tell me?

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.680
I was just on my way back from
my friend's place--she lives near campus--

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.810
when I got hungry and figured
I could go for a little something, so--

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:32.770
Get out!

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.060
What?!

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.430
Or maybe an enemy.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.180
This may be where I work part-time,

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.350
but it's also a place to relax. So <i>leave</i> !

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.140
Hey, what gives?

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.310
Let <i>me</i> relax, too! I'm hungry!

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.020
There are other places to eat.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.430
Wow, how cold can you get?

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.560
Come on, let me eat, will ya?!

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.600
You clash with the vibe here.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.810
Huh?

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.930
That's awful! This is discrimination!

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.100
No wonder you're such a loner.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.310
That has nothing to do with it!

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.470
Mmm... I seem to have missed
my window for standing up.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.970
Oh! Are you the owner?

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.520
I'm Hana Uzaki!
Senpai here is always such a big help!

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.810
Who even <i>are</i> you to me?

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.560
Whatcha doing?

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.140
Oh, uh, just checking our stock.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.140
I see... So he's your senior.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.640
Then you're in elem--er, middle school?

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.470
I'm in <i>college</i> !

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.720
We go to the same college--
she's in the year after me.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.310
You were totally going to say
"elementary school" just now, weren't you?!

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.470
Because you're so short.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.430
Shut up! Just shut your mouth!

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.100
I... I was <i>wrong</i> ?

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.220
It looks like he's in shock.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.890
He's not usually like this...

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:34.850
All these years I've spent in the
café business, refining my eye for people...

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.430
...and I was wrong?!

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.640
Oh!

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.020
In college... You're an adult.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.470
Huh? Yeah, that's right. I'm an adult.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.520
My impression of the owner sure has changed
drastically over these last few minutes.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.430
I'm sure this spot will do.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.020
Go on, sit.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.850
What do you want?

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.640
Hey, Senpai, where'd this attitude come from?

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.470
What?

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.890
I'm a customer now, you know. A customer!

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.680
I find it hard to believe this
is how you <i>always</i> act at work.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.310
Do you even know how to wait on people properly?

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.100
Wait on people properly? What, people like <i>you</i> ?

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.180
'Scuse me, sir!
This employee has a bad attitude!

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.810
You oughta give him a pay cut!

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.180
Shut up! If you're not going to order, leave!

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.520
These two are funny!
I think I'll watch them for a while.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.970
You've gotta take your work seriously
no matter who you're serving.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.970
That's called being a pro!

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.770
Sure, but if I <i>did</i> take it seriously,
you'd just make fun of me!

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.020
No, I wouldn't!

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:02.310
To be honest, it's embarrassing
when people I know see me working.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.100
But it's so close to campus.
Haven't any of your other friends come here?

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.060
Did you give them the same attitude?

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.390
Oh!

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.890
Silly. The only one
who gets <i>this</i> attitude is <i>you</i> .

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.810
You're special.

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.930
Got it? Then drink a soda
or something and get lost, dumdum.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.350
See, badmouthing me with that
posed expression really ticks me off!

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.560
Now, now, Sakurai. Since she's here and all,
show her what you can do.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.640
He's always so great with customers.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:35.520
Okay.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.970
That's right!

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.310
I'd like to order one serving
of excellent customer service!

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.720
Now start over,
beginning with the glass of water!

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.180
She is <i>infuriating</i> .

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.060
May I have your order, please?

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.520
Nope! Nuh-uh! No can do!

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.270
That villainous mug? Gone without a trace?

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.470
This is too much, Senpai!

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.430
You know how easy it is to laugh
when you're not supposed to!

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.640
Ugh! I <i>knew</i> this would happen, dammit!

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.390
I'm sorry! I won't laugh anymore!

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.220
Please let me eat something!

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.220
Can it!

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.720
You can call it a day, Sakurai.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.430
It's getting dark. Walk her home.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:36.680
You're laughing, too, aren't you?!
You are <i>definitely</i> laughing!

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.770
Thanks for today.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:45.890
I'm positively starving. Let's stop somewhere!

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:48.470
Go straight home and eat there.

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:53.020
Aw! Then at least let me order
something at the café next time.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.430
Sure. Come by again when I'm not there.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:00.720
What?! I promise I won't laugh next time!

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.060
Even when I see your smile--

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.720
Why, you...

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.390
That's a nice café, though.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:10.640
Yeah.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.020
Quiet, just stylish enough...

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:18.350
Uh-huh. It really is a nice place.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.390
I like the feel of it, the atmosphere.

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:23.220
Hey, I know!

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.270
Maybe I'll get a part-time job there, too!

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:29.850
You know--with you!

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:30.640
Sure.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.720
Wouldn't that be a <i>blast</i> ?

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.100
Mmm-hmm.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.430
Stop that.

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:40.220
Stop <i>what</i> ?

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:51.680
Why do I crack open brand-new
games in the middle of the night?

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:13.060
A little senpai-teasing
will get me through the day!

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.350
Huh?

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:19.180
Ow! Ow, ow! Whoa! I just wanted to pet you...

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:22.390
Aren't <i>you</i> energetic, you little--

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:25.560
Ow! Hey, that hurts!

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.100
C'mon, now--

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:29.890
Gross.

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:32.850
What are you doing so early
in the morning, Senpai?

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:34.520
That's creepy.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.520
Oh, Uzaki.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:41.850
I found this stray cat. It's not running away,
so I thought I could pet it.

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.520
Huh! Must be used to people.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:49.270
It won't let me pet it,
though--it keeps scratching me.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:51.680
Then what are you so happy about?

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.390
I mean... it's cute.

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.390
Gross.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:10:01.640
Well, be that as it may... I'd say you're
a rank beginner when it comes to animals.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.020
Uh... yeah.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.020
Bring your hand up from under.

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:13.720
Cats are afraid of bigger beasties
reaching their hands down from overhead.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.770
True enough.

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:18.140
Try bringing your hand up
from below and waiting.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:21.180
There you go. Good kitty. Good kitty.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.390
Whoa!

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:26.810
See? It's easy when they're used to people.

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.600
Nice...

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:35.270
It might belong to a family in the neighborhood
or maybe someone's just feeding it.

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:37.560
You sure know a lot about cats.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.930
We have cats at home. Two of them!

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:42.770
Wow, really?

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:45.970
Want to come by and meet them?

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:47.770
Mmm...

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:53.140
I'd like to pet those cats,
but a guy going to a girl's house alone?

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:57.350
Oh!

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:02.720
It ran away.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:08.060
The sound of those brakes must have spooked it.
Cats hate high-pitched noises.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:12.810
It probably lives around
here--you'll see it again.

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:15.060
Okay, Senpai, let's get to class!

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.350
Whoa!

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.390
I wanted to pet it... just once...

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:22.270
You're really bummed out!

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:24.140
Nah. I'm fine.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:27.520
I love dogs and cats both,

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.470
but pets aren't allowed at
my parents' place or where I live now.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:33.100
I haven't touched many cats...

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:37.930
Then I'm gonna go catch that one!

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.100
Huh?

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:43.600
It can't have gone far--and it's so
tame around humans, this might just work!

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.390
You don't have to do that! Hey!

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.350
If I strike out, we'll visit
a cat café one of these days!

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:49.930
Seriously?!

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:54.810
<i>There</i> you are!

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:57.140
Hi- <i>yah</i> !

00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:00.850
Wait up, kitty cat!

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.100
What happened?!

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.180
Senpai! Bad news! Help!

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:10.770
What the hell?

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.430
Huh?!

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:18.020
Hey!

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.350
I'm stuck...

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:22.140
Put that ass <i>away</i> !

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.060
Yee <i>owch</i> !

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:25.720
What's the big idea?!

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.390
S-Sorry! I-It just... slipped out...

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.430
So you <i>hit</i> me?

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:34.220
I saw your pa... pan... your underwear.
I was trying to fix your skirt.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:34.970
What?!

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:37.890
W-Well... okay.

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:41.560
He saw my undies? Wait: he touched my <i>butt</i> !

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.930
Whatever. I'll interrogate him later.

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:49.970
Look, could you pull me
from behind? Grab my hips.

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:51.680
Got it.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:57.270
Wow, her hips are so slim...

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.430
Whoa! Stop! Stop!

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:02.520
Huh?

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.680
Uh-oh. My clothes are caught!

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.890
At this rate, there's a pretty
high chance my boobs'll pop out!

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:10.560
D-Don't say "boobs"!

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.720
First get me away from what I'm caught on,

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.180
then pull a little at a time so nothing tears!

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:17.640
I'm counting on you! I just bought this outfit!

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.890
Jeez, you're so demanding!

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:23.020
Are you pulling out, Senpai? Hurry!

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:26.350
Almost... there... just behave, will you?

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:32.680
Eh? Huh? Whoa!

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.350
You've got the wrong idea!

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:36.890
Aren't you done yet?

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.850
For a second there,
I didn't know <i>what</i> would happen!

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:45.720
Thanks, Senpai!

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.430
We can forget about that whole butt thing.

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:51.470
C'mon, let's get to class!

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:53.310
I just want to go home.

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:55.640
Then how about a cat café?

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.520
Maybe next time.

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:10.430
Eating in the dining hall today, Senpai?

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:12.100
Uzaki...

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.310
Hmm? What's up?

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:18.560
It's hard to look her in the eye
after what happened earlier.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.600
Aha!

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.350
Are you embarrassed to be eating alone?

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:23.390
What?

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:28.720
Too bad. I'm eating with my friend today,
so I can't keep you company.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.180
I know you're lonely, but please don't cry.

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:34.970
Oh, shut up! I'm eating with a friend!

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.140
Eh? <i>Huh</i> ?!

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:41.180
What? Look, you're spilling that like crazy.

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:43.600
You mean you have a <i>friend</i> ?!

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.640
That is <i>outstandingly</i> rude!

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:50.850
Oh, man--what now?
I'd better say hi to your friend, huh?

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:52.810
Who are you, my mother?

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:54.270
Get lost!

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:55.680
Idiot.

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:04.060
Huh?

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.770
What <i>is</i> that dummy doing?

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:17.140
What are <i>you</i> lookin' at?

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:34.020
Seriously, what the hell is that idiot doing?

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.720
I just don't get it.

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:44.890
What is <i>she</i> worried about?

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.930
Your noodles are getting soggy, Hana.

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:35.560
You shouldn't use your phone at mealtimes.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:36.850
Uh-huh.

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:41.810
Thank you very much. Come again.

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:47.060
How about a drink after you tidy up, Sakurai?

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:50.310
Oh, thank you! I'd like that.

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:54.600
You're about halfway through college life, eh?

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.970
How are you doing on credits?

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:57.850
They're... They're coming along.

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:03.270
My daughter took all kinds of credits.
Now she just dawdles around every day.

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:07.060
It's better that way. I'm jealous!

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:12.430
Well, it's much better
than regretting it down the road.

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:17.350
This place is great, all right.

00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:20.270
Slow jazz at a moderate volume.

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:24.060
The calming aroma of coffee.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:27.270
It's almost like time flows more slowly here,

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:30.430
in this place where you can feel at ease.

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:31.770
Senpai!

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:34.600
Hi!

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.810
Not <i>you</i> again!
I told you not to come when I'm here!

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:40.810
Aw, don't be so cold!

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:43.470
Besides, what's the point if you're not here?

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:47.060
I couldn't wait a minute more to see you!

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:51.100
Uh--I-- <i>what</i> ? What are you talking about?!

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:53.180
I have to resubmit my report--

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:55.560
please help me!

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.560
Huh?

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.270
Oh... a report, huh?

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:03.810
You always were good at writing...

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:05.970
No can do.

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:07.810
What? Why?!

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:10.100
Can't you tell? I'm working.

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.560
I'll wait!

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.720
Use that time to do it yourself!

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.520
I don't think I can do it on my own!

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.390
And you got into college, huh?

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:20.770
C'mon, please help me!

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:21.930
Look here, you...

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:25.020
Now, now, Sakurai--

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:28.640
Your junior is counting on you.
Why, that's adorable!

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:32.180
We're done here--feel free to
stick around and work on that report.

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:32.810
Huh?

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:34.810
Really?!

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:38.220
We don't have any customers right now.

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:42.390
It's fun watching the back-and-forth
between these two.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:56.020
A little something for my
best employee's junior. On the house.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:59.350
You really don't have to do that.

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:02.930
Hooray! You're so generous, sir!

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:05.270
First the report, then eat.

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:07.720
Wow. Strict.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.470
You're almost done!

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:11.930
See, this is weird, too.

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:18.460
"I think"

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:15.060
"I think" is something
you'd say in grade school.

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:18.850
Change it to "It's thought"
or "It's considered."

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:24.640
You're in college.
Quit writing childish sentences.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:30.350
Now me, I'd boost the word count with
"Personally speaking, it feels as though XYZ."

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:32.720
I see...

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.520
Once that's fixed,
all that's left is your closing sentence.

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.270
Write that and be done with it.

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:41.100
Oh, right! I've been meaning
to ask you something.

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:44.600
You can't concentrate
to save your soul, can you?

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.100
Can I go to your place?

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.100
Absolutely not.

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.310
That was quick.

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:53.350
Where'd <i>that</i> come from, anyway?

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:55.810
I just wanna see it!

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:57.640
"Just" nothing!

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.520
No way will I let my lifestyle be
upended just for your entertainment!

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.770
I won't upend anything! So why can't I?

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:07.100
Why?! I mean...

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:10.430
Is she for real?

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:13.220
I have no reason to let you into my place.

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:17.310
Sure you do. You said you live alone, right?

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:23.180
You can save money if I cook,
and you're closer to campus.

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.020
See? There are way more pros than cons!

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:30.640
Are you serious? Is your cooking even edible?

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:34.390
What kind of an excuse is that? And yes, it <i>is</i> !

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:40.220
All right, get back to that report.

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:43.680
Wait, what was that last thing you said?

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.680
Huh?

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:48.560
My place is close to campus--and?

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.020
Well, since it's so close, I figure I can sleep in--

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.020
You're not spending the night!

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:58.020
Th-That's... unbelievable!

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.310
What are you angry about?

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.640
Look, I'm... I'm not angry.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.600
It's just that... you...

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.020
What is it?

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:14.930
Letting you in my apartment is one thing...

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:20.890
It's... not so simple... for a girl...
to be in a guy's room...

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:22.890
You don't want to?

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:25.390
Wh... <i>What</i> ?!

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:29.680
We can play versus and co-op all night long!

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.520
Eh?

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:34.810
I know you bought that new game, Senpai!

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:36.560
You're on my friend list!

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:40.520
If we stop by after class,
we can play any old day of the week!

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:46.720
You idiot! Moron! Imbecile!

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.810
What's <i>that</i> for?!

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:49.930
You dummy!

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:55.970
I opened this café for the thrill of
getting a glimpse into all sorts of lives.

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:52.060
I can't <i>believe</i> you!

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:54.810
Why exactly am I an idiot?

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:56.680
Because you <i>are</i> !

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:59.970
But these two are the best--I
could watch them forever.

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:03.100
If Sakurai quits, the show would be over.

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.470
Maybe I'll give him a raise.

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:40.970
Guess we'll see Ami next time.
