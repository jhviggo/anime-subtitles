WEBVTT

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.470
Oh!

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.850
Evening! What's up, Senpai?

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:21.910
Uh...

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.310
Senpai?

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.600
Sorry this is out of the blue, Uzaki.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.020
What is?

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.310
Please: be with me. I need you.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.970
Huh?

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.640
Please: be with me. I need you.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.470
Senpai...

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.140
Uh, hey.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.890
Hey, hi.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.020
Sorry. I know this is sudden.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.270
It's okay.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.560
Um, you asked me to be with you?
On the phone?

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.640
Yeah, about that...

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:42.850
Huh?

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.390
I just can't seem
to bring myself to go in alone!

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.680
Come with me to the cat café!

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.850
Thank God you're here! I mean it!

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.350
Oh, wow, I can't wait!
This is my first time--I'm so nervous!

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.310
Ow! What--hey! Quit kicking--ow!
Stop! Cut it out! That hurts!

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.470
Party of two?
Take off your shoes and go on inside.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.890
Wow... cats!

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.310
They have cats, Uzaki!

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.720
Yep. They have cats, all right.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.680
Well, duh. We <i>are</i> a cat café.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.600
I... I can touch them, right?

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.220
Calm down, Senpai. You've got those scary eyes.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.560
If the cats are okay with it,
go right ahead and pet them gently.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.600
Got it.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.890
Do it like I taught you earlier: from below.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.140
Uh, right.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.770
Whoa...

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.520
Now's your chance! Cats like being scratched
under their chins or behind their ears.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.270
O-Okay.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.060
Uzaki, look! A cat--on my lap!

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.970
Yes, yes. Good for you.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.770
But don't be too loud, or it'll run away.

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.060
Wow. Creepy.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.520
He doesn't get this excited around humans.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.560
All that gloominess must be
keeping some stuff repressed.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.560
Cootchie, cootchie, coo...

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.020
He's so creepy that I don't even mind
the <i>extremely</i> misleading way

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.890
he got me here in the first place.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.350
He's too overjoyed for words.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.350
Hey, Uzaki, what's with that plastered-on smile?

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.310
Just thinking how creepy it is that
you act so cool, but you like cute things.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.470
Say what? Jerk.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.140
Whoops. My true feelings slipped out.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.680
Why, you...

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.350
It's <i>also</i> creepy that you're careful
to speak quietly so as not to spook the cats.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.390
Figures!

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.270
Hey, your true feelings are showing again.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.430
But I <i>am</i> glad you came today.
I'd get to the entrance and do a U-turn.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.060
You're exaggerating.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.220
I've got to thank you somehow.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.310
Thank me?

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.140
Yeah. Anything come to mind?

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.310
Hmm... let's see...

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.970
Well, my birthday's actually coming up soon.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.770
I'm turning 20, so I'd like to make it sorta special.

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:29.810
So, uh...

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.720
Sorry, Uzaki.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.970
Huh?

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.640
Truth is...

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.220
Uh... yes?

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.060
My legs are so numb that
I haven't processed anything you've said.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.640
Can you repeat that?

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.770
Then get rid of the cat!

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.310
No way!

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.390
If you can't have a conversation,

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.180
we'll just move it.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.560
But it was finally on my lap!
Just a little longer?

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.680
Uncross your legs already
and get those pins and needles out.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.180
It's not a quick-fix kind of thing...

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.350
Ow, ow, ow...

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.640
Oh!

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.600
Poke!

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.600
Cut that out! What the hell? Idiot!

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:18.520
You were just <i>so</i> wide open,
you were practically <i>asking</i> for it!

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.100
Yeah, right! <i>Everybody's</i> wide open
when their legs are numb!

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:30.180
Not so loud, now--you'll scare the kitty-cats!

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:35.600
Poke!

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.930
Pokety poke!

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.680
Pokety, pokety poke-poke-poke!

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.850
Pokety, pokety, pokety, pokety poke!

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.600
Oh, jeez, what now? This is really fun!

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.810
This might just awaken something in me!

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.520
Uzaki... please... uncle...

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.100
Hmm? I can't hear you!

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.810
What color is your blood?!

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.350
Save that kind of play for home, please.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:06.640
"Play"?!

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.270
Phew, what a blast!

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.810
Wasn't that fun, Senpai?

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:17.640
The first half was. Then <i>you</i> got us thrown out!

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.390
Dammit. Next time I'll go alone.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:23.220
Probably can't go back there, though.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.640
And whose fault is that?

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:29.850
Gotta love cat cafés, though.
Lots of friendly kitties!

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.770
Right? They were so used to being around people.

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:35.350
It's Very Easy Mode.

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:38.310
"Your communication level is puny.
Level 5? Too bad."

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.890
And they still warmed up to you!

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.270
So I'm a gun-toting old man now?

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:47.560
I have cats at home, but it's good
to interact with different cats sometimes.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.220
Huh! Must be nice.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:54.100
Is this what married men
who go to cabaret clubs feel like?

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.600
Beats me! What a horrible analogy.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.720
See you later, Senpai!

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.520
Yep. I owe you one for today,
so think it over, okay?

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.470
Oh, I've already thought <i>that</i> over.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:08.310
And?

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:13.720
Like I mentioned earlier,
my birthday is coming up. August 7th!

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.220
I have high hopes, Senpai!

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:20.430
Her birthday...

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:23.180
And that's why...

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.770
...she said she has high hopes for her birthday.

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:28.850
So you're in a pickle.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.390
You <i>do</i> seem like you'd
be bad at that kind of thing.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:32.470
Right.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.390
Anticipating that Sakurai would be bad at this,

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:39.310
then throwing him for a loop
with vague "high hopes"...

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:41.350
She's quite the schemer.

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:44.520
But that comes from the
peculiar mentality of a girl in love

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.390
who wants someone to fret over her.

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:50.350
Not that Hana realizes it herself.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:52.270
Still, any way you look at it...

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:54.680
...we're going to eat this up!

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:55.770
What are you doing?

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:57.680
Nothing.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.020
Do you have any ideas?

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:03.310
I've been thinking...

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:04.970
U-Uzaki...

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:09.970
Flowers, because my name means "flower"?
So you suck at puns, too!

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:11.560
U-Uzaki...

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.600
This is totally the wrong size!

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:19.060
Besides, only hotties can get away
with giving a present like this.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:20.850
U-Uzaki...

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.310
Couldn't you have given me
a uTunes card instead?

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:25.890
I want those special-event bonuses!

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:29.270
It feels like anything
I give her will be a bust.

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:31.810
This is getting complicated!

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:33.390
In reality...

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.350
He sure doesn't have an eye for flowers.

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:43.350
A placeholder!

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:51.600
Hey, it has multiplayer!
I'll play with you, loner senpai!

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.470
Sounds about right.

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:58.600
She'd be happy with anything Sakurai gives her.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.770
I've thought about this
too much--I'm just so confused.

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.850
Then why don't you follow your intuition?

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:06.060
My intuition?

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:10.520
Give her the first thing that came
to mind when you heard "birthday present."

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.390
The first thing that came to mind...

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.640
August 7th"

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:21.220
Yeah, I still have no idea.

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:24.350
But I need to pick something today.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:30.810
What's up, Uzaki?

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:33.270
Well, um...

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:34.890
Huh?

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:37.560
I know this is sudden, Senpai.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.850
What is?

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:42.930
I want you to be with me! I need you.

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:46.020
Eh?

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.470
I want you to be with me!

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:55.180
What's with Uzaki, anyway?

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.350
Oh!

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:00.470
Senpai!

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:02.270
Uh, hey.

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.060
Sorry to spring this on you.

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.970
It's okay.

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:11.520
So, um, on the phone...
you said you wanted me to be with you?

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:14.350
About that...

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:20.720
I just couldn't bring myself to go in alone!
Come with me, Senpai!

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.890
A... pub?

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:25.470
Your treat! Please?

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:26.470
What for?

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:30.100
I told you, remember? My 20th birthday!

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:32.850
I have high hopes, you know--

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:35.310
for your wallet, that is!

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:40.470
"High hopes"--you mean you were
angling for a pub visit all along?

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:41.770
Yep!

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:46.520
Huh? What's wrong? C'mon, let's go in already!

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:50.680
Hmm?

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:55.930
Are you sure about this?

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.180
Celebrating your milestone 20th at a pub?

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:03.600
Oh, totally! I wanted to try drinking with you.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.100
Drinking's fun, right?

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.720
That depends on the drinker,
on the circumstances...

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.390
No guarantees.

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:16.600
Well, if it's <i>not</i> fun,
you can do something to <i>make</i> it fun!

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.970
Now you're being unreasonable.

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:21.890
Let's just enjoy ourselves, okay?

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:23.350
Right.

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:24.560
Ready?

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.020
Cheers!

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:33.430
Okay, here goes!

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.680
Go on, drink up!

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.220
How is it?

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.930
Like a soft drink, but also... not.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.470
Does it taste good or what?

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:50.640
There's this, like,
burning in my throat. Deep inside.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.430
Alcohol will do that.

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:54.470
What's beer like?

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:56.060
Want to try?

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.180
Uh-huh.

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:00.470
Sorry for the wait!

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:01.930
Enjoy!

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:04.220
Give that a taste.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.390
Whoa!

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.560
You okay?

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:14.890
So this is beer! It's bitter,
but there's more to it than that.

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:18.560
That's why it goes so great
with fried and salty food!

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.430
Okay, then...

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:23.180
So juicy!

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.180
Now take a slug of beer.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.850
Right? Isn't that delicious?

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:32.680
They go <i>fantastic</i> together!

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:37.890
The beer resets the grease from the chicken
for fresh new flavor with every bite!

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:42.020
Wow, you really chugged it.
So what's your verdict?

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:46.970
It's <i>great</i> ! So you drink alcohol with food, huh?

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:50.100
Some people savor it on its own.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.100
It doesn't matter as long
as you're enjoying yourself.

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:58.060
In that case, as you so kindly suggested,
I'm gonna do just that!

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:00.180
That's right--go on, now!

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:06.390
Hey! Just how much are you ordering?!

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:08.770
Your wallet is already dead.

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:11.600
Shut up! Cancel! Cancel those!

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.060
Hidebu!

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:15.390
Pardon me...

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:17.310
No horsing around, please.

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:20.520
I'm sorry.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.560
Sheesh. Quit screwing around or--

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:26.770
<i>Yow</i> ! Spicy!

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:27.930
What <i>is</i> this?

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:31.680
Looks like one of them is ultra spicy.

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:33.100
Beer! Beer!

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.100
It's empty?!

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.560
And no water, either!

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.930
Uzaki, a drink! Anything!

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:40.600
Wait just a sec, okay? I'm looking.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.100
I <i>can't</i> wait!

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:46.470
Oh, I bet <i>I</i> can make <i>this</i> one.
I should make it for you sometime!

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:49.770
I'm begging you: make it snappy!

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:56.220
I thought I was a goner...

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:59.560
Hey, this is good!
I think I might like <i>yuzu</i> liqueur.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.850
Good for you.

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:06.060
Another round!

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.600
Now wait just one minute!

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.600
What's up?

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.020
You're really knocking 'em back there.

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:14.100
Take it easy--it <i>is</i> your first time.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:15.350
Pardon me!

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:16.520
Your <i>yuzu</i> liqueur.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.930
Much obliged!

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:21.350
That's <i>too fast</i> !

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:23.060
But I'm totally fine.

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:25.810
Fine? How many is that?

00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:26.930
Good question.

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:28.680
Is it, now?

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.180
Well, whatever.
Drink some water in there, too.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.180
I just might be a heavyweight!

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:41.060
Look, just slow down, will you?

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:42.850
Sorry for the wait! Your <i>yuzu</i> liqueur.

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:43.330
Thanks.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:45.890
Yesss!

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:49.310
Thank you very much!

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.810
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:57.060
You okay there, Senpai? You're kinda wobbly!

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.890
You're the only one wobbling around here.

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:03.890
She started out okay but
turned out pretty much as I'd expected.

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:08.810
I jotted down how much you drank.
Stay under that amount next time, okay?

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:12.020
Wow, Senpai, you sure got tall all of a sudden.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:15.020
That's a utility pole! Walk properly, will you?

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:18.890
Aw, c'mon, Senpai, carry me!

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:21.270
Let go of me!

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:24.430
Piggyback! Baby back... ribs...

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:27.220
Stop that! Your various...
areas... are all up on me!

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.140
Various areas? Whazzat mean?

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.180
What's touchin' where?

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:35.270
Jeez, she is one irritating drunk!

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:36.470
Smooshy...

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.560
Markin' you with my scent...

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.640
No way can I send her home on her own like this.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.970
Here, stand up. I'll take you home.

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:46.600
Aw! I'm not goin' home!

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.850
Let's drink at <i>your</i> place, Senpai!

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:51.180
What, more drinking?!
Go home and get to sleep, dummy!

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.810
And stand up already! I can see your underwear!

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:56.520
Who're you callin' a dummy, huh?

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.890
Say, Senpai, d'you know what time it is?

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:00.770
Huh?

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.720
Yikes! That late?!

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:07.600
Oh, too bad! No more trains! Ha ha! You dummy!

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:10.270
<i>You're</i> the dummy who can't get home, dummy.

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:11.930
We can call a cab.

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:17.100
Uzaki's dumbass drinking drained me dry!

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:19.060
The ATM should still be running.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:24.310
Ugh, but that access fee... and taxis
will be charging pricey late-night fares...

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:26.470
Let her stay over? I could never!

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:29.060
I can't think straight with this booze in me!

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.770
Quite the dilemma!

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:36.310
You wouldn't abandon your junior,
stuck away from home, would you?

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:41.140
Don't tell me this was
all calculated from the get-go!

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.520
I don't even care anymore.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.850
We're going to the convenience store.
I want some water.

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:54.970
Yeah! And alcohol!
I wanna verify my age! 'Cause I'm 20!

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:57.390
Whatever you want.

00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:01.390
Look, just so you know,
I only have one futon set.

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:02.640
Wanna sleep together?

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.430
I'm splitting it up, moron! One quilt each!

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:13.600
Senpai... Hey, Senpai...

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.640
Don't go to sleep, huh?

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:20.390
I'm begging you, let me sleep.
It's three in the morning!

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:22.270
Let's play a game.

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:24.850
No way. You play dirty.

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:26.310
Aw...

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.180
Are you <i>still</i> drinking?!

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:30.140
Yep!

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:35.890
Honestly... She needs to learn
about the horrors of alcohol.

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:39.600
Squid's yummy...

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:43.100
No--come morning, she'll know.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:46.060
Uh-oh... I really am sleepy.

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.600
Fine. I'll just sleep right here, then.

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:48.890
All right!

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:53.100
No stun-locking moves this time,
so let's get sparrin'!

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.810
Senpai? Hey, Senpai!

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:57.600
Pipe down.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.720
Senpai? Are you asleep for real?

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.350
Well, well.

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:06.100
Leaving behind your junior
and just... going to sleep?

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.100
Just ignore her.

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:12.770
Maybe he'll wake up if I kiss him.

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:28.060
See, I <i>knew</i> you were only faking!

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:30.390
Don't get so worked up.

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:33.430
It was just a joke--a joke!

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:38.140
But you sure were frantic there, Senpai.

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:40.520
Have you never been kissed, by any chance?

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.890
No! Shut up! Go to sleep, idiot!

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:52.100
Sleepytime...

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:02.640
Aw...

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:05.600
My head hurts... I feel awful...

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:09.100
That's called a hangover.
Life's going to suck for a while.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.970
I hate it!

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:13.270
Why are <i>you</i> just fine?

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:16.680
Grown-ups drink in moderation
so <i>that</i> doesn't happen.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.180
What's "modera"--

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:23.770
Don't worry. Everyone has an alcohol screw-up.

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:27.430
Good thing your first time wasn't
at some sketchy drinking party.

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:29.350
It's not good at all!

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:32.310
But you found your limit right off the bat.

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:35.180
He's in lecture mode.

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:38.060
You didn't drink much water, either.

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:40.470
It takes water to metabolize alcohol.

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:43.640
Alternate with drinks of water
and you won't get sick.

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:47.270
You should feel better by noon.
Just have to tough it out.

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:50.020
Are you listening?

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:53.520
Wow, she's in hell.

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:02.930
The bigger the screw-up, the better the lesson.

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:06.140
Next time, drink as much water as you do booze.

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:10.060
'S fine. I won't drink again as long as I live.

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:16.640
Probably for the best.
Though everyone with a hangover says that.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:20.810
Never... ever again.

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:24.470
I'm going to hit the store--
you hold down the fort.

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:26.060
Rest up, okay?

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.390
Senpai?

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:32.680
Yeah?

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:39.430
Thanks a lot... for being with me... at the pub.

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:43.100
It was fun.

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.220
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:49.640
Oh, I nearly forgot: You're 20 now, Uzaki--

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:57.060
Happy birthday.

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:38.430
Something's happening!

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:39.020
Hmm.

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.020
Sak!
