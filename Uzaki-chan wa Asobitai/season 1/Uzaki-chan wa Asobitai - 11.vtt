00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.910
Are you gonna be home today, Senpai?

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.370
Can I come over?

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.410
Yeah, I guess.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.200
Great! I'll be right there.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.290
Uzaki's everyday visits have become a habit.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.950
Whatever. I'm done fighting it.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.450
But...

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.240
...she always leaves her junk here!

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.490
I'm going to have to say something.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.450
There she is, the jerk.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.290
Check out the jumbo beanbag
I bought today, Senpai!

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.490
See? It's a big ol' frog!

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:45.490
It's <i>way too big</i> !

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.200
But it comes with a <i>little</i> frog!

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.790
Okay, that's cute... but still!

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.370
What's your take on this place?

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.790
My take? Oh, like spiritually?

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.160
Don't sweat it. The person
behind you is just passing through.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.450
That's not what I meant!
Cut that out--I'm serious!

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.580
<i>Your</i> stuff is taking over <i>my</i> apartment!

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.040
Start taking some of it home <i>today</i> !

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.990
What's with the giant beanbag, anyway?

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.950
I mean, I'm always sitting on
the floor for our gaming marathons.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.410
My butt hurts! Are you okay with that?

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.990
Isn't it the host's responsibility
to make his living space welcoming?

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.990
Or would you rather be responsible
for my butt cramping up?

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.160
The nerve...

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.990
Therefore, I plead not beanbag-guilty!

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.870
Fine. The beanbag can stay.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.330
<i>But</i> !

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.040
<i>This</i> is the problem!

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.200
Huh! It's really piled up, hasn't it?

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.490
Don't pretend it's not on you!

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.080
You're going to choose what stays and what goes.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.240
Ugh, what a drag!

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.160
And no fun until we're finished.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.540
Aw!

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.540
Everything you don't need goes
in this garbage bag today.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.540
Everything you <i>do</i> need goes home with you.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.410
Fine...

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.000
This?

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.620
Don't need it.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.170
These?

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.950
Nope.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.920
And these?

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.660
Nuh-uh.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.910
See? You don't need <i>any</i> of this!

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.950
Don't bring it to my place--throw it away!

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.990
Oh, gosh!

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.830
Sometimes you can't make up your mind, y'know?

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.490
And something that's really been bugging me...

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.740
Oh, this?

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.200
This is a real laugh!

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.080
You blow through this thing here.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.200
Like so.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.540
Well?

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.290
Toss it.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.540
What?! But it's funny!
It'll be a huge hit on Halloween!

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.700
Who cares? Besides, you only
left it here because you didn't need it.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.410
True, true.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.580
That was too easy! I <i>knew</i> you didn't need it!

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.910
It's like, sometimes I have to show things
to you first before it's all settled.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.330
What the hell?!

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.080
There we go. Nice and roomy again.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.410
I'm pooped!

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.540
It was only some huge chore because you'd
brought all that crap over.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.200
I know where this is going.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:06.870
Buying all those extra phone chargers...
You just don't <i>think</i> , do you?

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.200
Yep: it's lecture time.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.580
Hey, are you listening?

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.040
Uh, yeah. Sorry.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.200
Say, I'm thirsty. I'm gonna grab a drink!

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.120
Hey! Don't you run away from me! I'm not done!

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.790
See, you're always... huh?

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.660
What's with the bag?

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.290
Did you put that in there?

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.950
Oh, uh...

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.990
No, that's something else.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.660
Are you <i>kidding</i> me?
Now you're putting your stuff in my <i>fri</i> --

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.040
I-Is this...

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.910
Oh, gosh!

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:49.660
I thought I'd cook for us today.
It's been a while.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.540
Uzaki, I... well...

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.120
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have jumped to conclusions.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.370
Senpai?

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.830
Yeah?

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.240
What would you like for
the main dish? Fish or beef?

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.080
Fish.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.330
I'm sorry about earlier.
And... this is really good.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:24.040
I like this sincerely contrite side of you.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.830
He's so easy.

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:29.200
Sakurai?

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.990
Yes?

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.450
Want to try your hand at food prep?

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:34.040
Eh?

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:39.040
Why not? It'd be a big help if
you could handle cooking, too.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.700
Uh, but I--

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.910
Oh? You're gonna cook, Senpai? <i>Can</i> you cook?

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:49.740
Are you sure about this?
It's not as easy as it looks!

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.540
I'll do it.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.240
Oh! Will you, now?

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.200
Seriously?

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.290
You probably think I can't
cook my way out of a paper bag.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:00.990
It just so happens I <i>do</i> cook from time to time!

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.620
Um... what is this?

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.490
Spaghetti Napolitan.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.200
What on earth?

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.120
Wow.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.290
I'm sorry. Go on: laugh.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.950
Too much laughing!

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.740
I'm just doing what you told me to do!

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.080
L-L-Let me go!

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.290
Ugh, enough! Quit fighting!

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:54.790
Harder, Senpai...

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:58.490
Yes... you're so good at this, Sakurai...

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.450
That's enough! My hands are tired!

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:13.120
Man, kneading udon dough is really hard work!

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.870
I was surprised to see you here
for a crash course in cooking.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:21.540
Sorry about that.
I'd intended to do it at my place.

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:24.700
He doesn't have the right tools for the job.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:28.990
Besides, Mom, you're <i>my</i> cooking instructor!

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.700
Thank you in advance.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:41.830
Just leave it to me. And try to keep up!

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:45.790
You boys and your muscle. Must be nice!

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:49.370
That's one thing this himbo has going for him.

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:50.870
Hana! Hey!

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:54.120
It's okay. I get that all the time.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.490
All the time?

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:57.910
Well... you know.

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:02.040
I apologize for my daughter's nasty mouth.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.120
What's this?

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.700
I've been having a normal conversation
with Sakurai all this time!

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.370
But how?

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:16.580
Oh, I see! Sakurai's gaze is focused
on the udon--his eyes aren't frightening!

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:22.120
When I can't see those eyes of his,
he's well-mannered and actually easy to talk to!

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.950
I'm sorry about everything, Sakurai.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:27.870
Huh? It's fine, really.

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:33.580
Let the dough sit for about 20 minutes.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.160
I have laundry to put away, so...

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.950
I'll leave the rest to you youngsters.

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:47.240
Want something to drink, Senpai?
I bet you got a little sweaty.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.040
Yeah. Thanks.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.290
<i>Cats</i>.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.540
I was anxious at first, but I managed
to hold a proper conversation with Sakurai.

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:06.700
He really is a serious and kind person,
just like the people at his job said.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:10.200
And now I know I'm fine
as long as I don't look at his eyes.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.290
Yes, I've made great strides today.

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:17.410
And just think: a boy wanting
to learn how to cook!

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:21.540
Kids these days. He'll make a great husband!

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.450
I'm telling you, Senpai, it's fine. Go ahead!

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:27.950
You <i>did</i> say you wanted to get some petting in.

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:30.120
<i>Petting</i>?!

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.240
Not with high-alert mode still active.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.490
I'd hate to scare anyone off.

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:40.370
I-I-I-I mean, I <i>am</i> scared, but-but-but I never--

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:45.450
It's fine! I saw that one
sneaking peeks at you. She's interested!

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:48.620
I... I was looking at him,
sure--but not like <i>that</i> !

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.700
You just gotta <i>go</i> for it! Bam!

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:51.910
Hana?!

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:55.120
No--I should be more of a gentleman.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.990
Sakurai?!

00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:00.370
Uh-oh--I might just be warming up to all this!

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:02.870
I just do <i>not</i> understand kids these days!

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:07.080
And why is Hana trying
to pimp out her own mother?!

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:12.580
No. I can't give up. There's still time!

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.040
I'm back...

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:19.160
I have to put these kids on the right
path--show them the error of their ways!

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.080
Let's... get the udon boiling... shall we?

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.790
<i>That</i> is an adult's <i>duty</i> !

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:31.830
Homemade's the best!

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:33.490
Right?!

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:40.740
It really is your treat today?

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:44.160
Sure is--as thanks for the cooking lessons.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:49.200
All riiight! I've been thinking
about rock-climbing for a while now.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.240
Glad to hear it.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:56.910
That recent dip in the ocean reminded me
how fun it is to get my body moving.

00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:01.740
I see. Most pick-up
sports tend to be ball games,

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:05.240
but rock-climbing really
has you using your muscles.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.540
Your strength control is all over the place!

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.200
Phrasing!

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.120
In rock climbing,

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.200
you use these holds
to move up this climbing wall.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.990
The general rule is to
start from a hold labeled S

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:22.370
and climb to another
labeled G in the same color.

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:26.080
You'll start out with holds
meant for all four limbs.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:30.580
Look for the same color labels
as you make your way up.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.160
Looking good!

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:44.740
Okay!

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:48.120
Good job up there. How'd it feel?

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.910
That was <i>fun</i> !

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:53.580
I'm dying here!

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.740
Complete opposites...

00:12:55.740 --> 00:13:02.240
I couldn't even... think...
my muscles... at their limit... so quickly...

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.910
Enough...

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:07.120
I don't know about this sport...

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.330
No? I'm starting to enjoy myself.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.790
Oh, I bet. Your face is just
glowing with vitality. Ticks me off.

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:18.450
See, I knew you didn't get a lot of exercise.

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:22.740
<i>You're</i> the weirdo for
actually <i>liking</i> this extreme stuff!

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.410
How do you have so much energy?

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:27.490
I work out in my spare time.

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:31.660
I bet you're just sore
because you can't one-up me here.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:35.080
What?! I'm not <i>either</i>
sore--not in the slightest!

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.910
Great job training up
those useless muscles of yours!

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:41.950
Ah, I see you're still raring to go!

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:44.700
Let's bump up the difficulty for this next one.

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:51.490
The rules are the same as last time,
but you'll be climbing a taller wall.

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:56.740
This is a rope-climbing wall;
you'll be wearing a roped harness as you climb.

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.040
I'll go first.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.950
You catch your breath.

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:03.080
Bleah.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:10.830
I get it... the height on
this one makes it even tougher.

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:16.580
Uh-oh--I'm starting to enjoy this!

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:19.410
Whoops! Where's my foothold?

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:22.080
And I can't look down, either.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.370
Move your other leg first, Senpai.

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:28.700
Step with your right foot first--then
it'll be smooth sailing.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:29.950
Where to?

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:32.910
Just above your right knee.

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:35.370
I'm not getting it. Where?

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:39.410
He's holding himself up with his arms!
Is he really a beginner?

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:42.620
He looks like some kind of insect.

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.620
That was pretty fun!

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.740
Look at you, completely unfazed.

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:49.450
You're a himbo, all right--through and through.

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:51.240
Have you recovered, Uzaki?

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:55.580
He's having so much fun,
my jabs don't reach him!

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.910
Shouldn't you be resting?

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:03.620
What?! I can <i>totally</i> do this! Just watch!

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:06.370
What are <i>you</i> so mad about?

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:12.040
You all right, Uzaki?

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:14.410
I... can't do this.

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:17.040
She looks like a chrysalis.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.950
I'll just stay here forever.

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:23.700
Can't go forward, can't go back.
I'll spend my life here.

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:26.040
That's a weird way to pout.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.950
I'll lower the rope.
Go ahead and relax your body.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.370
That was a little too much, huh?

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:38.290
Rest a while. Let me know
when you're ready to go again.

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:39.410
But...

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:42.660
You look like you're done
for today. Want to leave?

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:48.080
Go on and climb, Senpai. I'll watch.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.620
But...

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:55.200
You're having fun, aren't you?
Really making use of your body... it's been a while.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.620
Man, you got me.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:02.870
Never thought you'd pick a contest
where you had the complete upper hand.

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:07.740
I hereby wave the white flag
at your cheap and heartless trap.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:11.200
If you feel bad about it,
you can buy tonight's dinner, too.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.950
Why, you little...

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:32.410
You look like you did back
in high school, Sakurai- <i>senpai</i> .

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:56.830
Oh, you didn't have to stop for <i>us</i> !

00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:59.660
Sorry to interrupt!

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.330
That's right, Senpai. Please--continue!

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:06.450
C'mon, don't sulk in a corner like that.
We said we're sorry!

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:11.330
You look like a stray cat who's
trying to say "Never trust a human!"

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:17.370
Can't say I'm surprised, though.
This <i>is</i> the same senpai who's into solo movies!

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:24.240
You <i>would</i> be doing solo karaoke!

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:24.240
Sorry, but could you add two more to room 25?

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.990
Apologies for the late addition.

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:29.620
We were out drinking and
decided on karaoke for the afterparty.

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:32.290
That's when we spotted <i>you</i> here!

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:35.080
Oh, order us some beers, would you?

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:38.910
I am <i>definitely</i> going further
afield for karaoke from now on.

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:40.990
Solo karaoke!

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:45.660
True to its name, it's using an
entire karaoke room for "one, please!"

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:49.950
It's an effective way to practice songs
without worrying about an audience,

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:53.540
and its adherents are growing in number.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.410
However!

00:17:55.410 --> 00:18:00.040
Karaoke is very much seen as a group activity,

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.370
so if you're spotted going solo,

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:05.580
odds are you'll be teased
at school or work the next day.

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.080
Even the reception desk...

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.080
Loner loser.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.700
...is no stranger to this sentiment.

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:15.240
But compared to the shame of being
unable to sing well in front of friends,

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.080
compared to the embarrassment
of whiffing the rap part,

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.830
such treatment is nothing!

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:22.950
In other words, anyone who attempts solo karaoke

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:27.200
requires a psyche that stands apart!

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:31.950
C'mon, Senpai! Don't be mad, Senpai!

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:33.830
You damn drunk...

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:39.370
Look, even if we all go to the
same college and work together,

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:43.040
you two need to respect people's privacy!

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.870
Enough with the maracas!

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:47.950
Hey, Hana!

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:52.080
Shouldn't we show Sakurai some
sincerity--you know, by way of apology?

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.490
Huh?

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:57.740
Sakurai, we're gonna hit the restroom.

00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.740
Sure.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:01.160
We're back!

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.910
Ta-da!

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:05.290
Wh-What the hell?!

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:10.490
They were loaning out cosplay outfits
at the front desk, so we tried some on!

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:11.580
I'm kinda embarrassed!

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:12.830
But why?

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:14.080
C'mon, it's fine!

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.450
Here, have a drink.

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:22.370
Wh-Why am I in the middle?

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.620
Call it a little bonus.

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:29.870
We feel real bad for barging in on your karaoke!

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:32.240
These guns are <i>incredible</i> .

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.240
Aren't you crowding him
a little over there, Ami?

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:41.660
Well, Sakurai? Has your mood improved?

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:45.040
Um, actually... I'm just... flustered.

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.240
Is it not to your liking?

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.120
It's not about liking or disliking
or this liking or that liking...

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:53.330
I'm begging you--spare me!

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:56.200
You're a tough customer. Very well!

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:59.790
How's <i>this</i> ?

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:03.290
Well, uh... that's an interesting question...

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:06.120
Um, Ami, I don't know about this costume...

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:10.410
You're fine, just fine!
It has more fabric than a swimsuit!

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:15.080
Well, Sakurai? Has your mood improved?

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:21.660
I was just thinking that this is
no place for anyone in his right mind.

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.490
So chill!

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:26.990
I guess I <i>am</i> the only sober one here.

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:29.660
Okay, yep, I'm not mad anymore.

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:31.950
Let's sing some karaoke and have fun.

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:35.370
--Yahoo!
--Yippee!

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:37.870
I like that about you, Sakurai!

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:39.990
Sure, yeah, thanks.

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:43.620
Anything I say now will
only escalate the situation.

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:46.790
I'll just nod and smile my way through this.

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:48.910
Can I put in the next song?

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:50.160
Uh-huh, yep, go ahead.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.790
Can I order more drinks?

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:54.450
Okay, sure, but don't drink too much.

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:57.990
Hey, Sakurai, what was your favorite cosplay?

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:00.290
Yep, uh-huh, I like the bunny girl.

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:07.580
Oh, wow, I never thought
you'd give a straight answer.

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:10.950
No! I, uh--you see--that--that was--

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:12.490
Pervert.

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:22.450
C'mon, shake it off! Not many guys
who don't appreciate a bunny girl!

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:25.790
I think I'll have that drink now.

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:34.990
That you, Uzaki?

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:38.450
Hey, about yesterday...
when I said "bunny girl," I--

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:47.410
What happened?! Here, come inside.
I'll grab a towel.

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:48.700
Senpai.

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:55.240
I can't hang out with you anymore.

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.620
Huh?

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:39.660
Senpai!
