WEBVTT

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.880
Darjeeling? Or perhaps chamomile?

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.380
Oh, I don't know!

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.800
I should have asked Hana what would be best.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.460
You're all I have.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.420
Huh?

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.340
Imagine if you were serious,
saying that to an older woman like me.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.420
But... I <i>am</i> serious!

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.380
Dear me! With a 25-year age difference?!

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.880
Oh, my!

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.840
Hana's senpai should be here any minute now.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.260
You're a real upstanding guy, Senpai.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.960
I know you want to return
what I overpaid for your futon,

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.710
but Mom says you don't have to.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.300
No--you gave me too much.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.800
And since <i>you</i> won't accept the money,
I have to return it directly.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.090
It's only too much because
you bought a cheap replacement.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.880
This was your chance to get a good one!

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.420
You sure are quiet today.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.590
Are you <i>nervous</i> ?

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.710
What, is this your first
time visiting a girl's house?

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.510
It is. I have an upset stomach.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.880
Boy, you surrender fast
when you're cornered, huh.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.460
Where do you think I live, anyway?
It's not a haunted house, you know.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.010
It's okay--you won't be gobbled up.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.550
And we have cats. All-you-can-pet!

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.840
What an obvious change of expression.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.010
Are you putting up
with this because of the <i>cats</i> ?

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.960
Yeah, right.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.050
Now I'm ticked.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.760
Here we are! I told Mom
I'd be bringing you along.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.960
I'm home!

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.090
Hello!

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.760
Welcome! Is this your senior at college, Hana?

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.170
She's told me all about you!

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.380
Scary!

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.340
S-Such a penetrating glare!

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.590
This is no ordinary fellow. He's so <i>big</i> !

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.340
She never told me her senior was a boy!

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.920
Hi! I'm Hana's mother.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.550
Pleased to meet you. I'm Sakurai.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.880
Thank you for offering
to pay to replace my futon.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.630
My, he's more well-mannered than he looks.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.210
I'd like to return some
of the money you gave me.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.670
It's no use. His eyes really are fierce!

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.130
C'mon, Senpai. Quit standing around
chatting in the foyer and come in already!

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.340
What? He's coming <i>in</i> ?!

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.920
I'll return the money and be on my way.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.960
That's right--I mustn't keep him!

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.630
Very well.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.460
If you insist.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.380
I see.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.210
I believe I understand the situation.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.630
Hana gave you too much money for the futon,
so you've come to return the surplus?

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.090
That's far.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.420
I tried to give it to Hana,
but she wouldn't take it.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.010
I hate to intrude,
but I thought I'd return it directly.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.420
"Hana"...

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.300
Hana? A moment?

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.590
Huh? What is it?

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.800
It was always only "my senior at college"!

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.260
Since when did you spend
the night at a <i>boy's</i> place?!

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.550
That hurts!

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.380
No wonder she's mad.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.710
But Senpai's all right!

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.510
You know that's not the point!

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.920
<i>You</i> might be fine, but Sakurai--

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.260
Well, he's... you know!

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.010
I can't really argue.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.550
I think I get the gist.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.050
This girl's been a terrible
bother to you all this time.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.920
Oh, no, really.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.260
Please--keep going.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.550
Senpai!

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:47.880
What the <i>heck</i> ?!

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.340
My looking after you is a big <i>bother</i> ?

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.630
No, not at all. One time out of ten,
I'm grateful for it.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.050
So I'm batting .100?! Why, you little--

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.630
What do you mean, one time out of ten?

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:04.510
I think I can see how their
time together has been going.

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:01.880
What does that even mean?

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.710
Calm down.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.170
What am I supposed to do, huh?

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.880
You're a total loner!

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.880
They <i>do</i> seem awfully close, though.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:07.260
But--

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.840
And you're only grateful <i>once</i> ?

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:13.510
Sakurai must be good for Hana--as
her senior and as a friend.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:10.670
Yeah, well--

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.510
Forget that! Thank me more!

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.050
He may look frightening, but he seems
serious enough, thank goodness.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:19.510
All that worry for nothing.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.300
Still, Hana bringing a boy home?

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.760
Perhaps I'll have <i>other</i> things
to worry about before long!

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.710
Kidding!

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.670
Sakurai is staring right at me.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.710
Not at <i>me</i> , as such.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.510
At my... <i>chest</i> ?!

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.630
His eyes fixed so shamelessly
on this one spot...

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.590
We've only just met!
Don't tell me he's after my body!

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.090
He... He can't want me <i>and</i> my daughter?!

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.130
Man, I love cats.

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.210
Ready to start petting, Senpai?

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:01.840
Hana!

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.800
I mean... if I can.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.170
Sa-Sakurai!

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:10.760
You probably can't just yet.
She's on high alert.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.130
She's not approaching you, right?

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.960
"Probably"? "Yet"?!

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.840
She's just shy around strangers.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.130
"Shy around strangers"?

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.300
Stop by often enough and she'll get used to you.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.630
Before you know it, <i>she</i> might be coming to <i>you</i> !

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.710
Absolutely <i>not</i> ! There is <i>no chance</i> of that!

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:29.760
What are you <i>saying</i> ?!
And right in front of your mother!

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.340
Right. It might not fly today...

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.710
Huh?

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.010
But one day... I'd like to hold her.

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:45.380
Well, I've returned your money
and all, so I'll be leaving.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.130
Oh!

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.800
What, so soon?

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.800
Yeah. I don't want to overstay my welcome.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.210
Er, um...

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.920
Then can I come over to your place?
We can get some gaming in!

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.800
Sure, whatever.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.340
Sorry for the intrusion. Goodbye.

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:05.590
See you later, Mom!

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:09.130
Why is my heart pounding so?

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.130
Thank you very much!

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.050
Here you go, Mom.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:21.380
Thanks.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:25.010
I have work to do, so just relax
and take your time, okay?

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:28.710
Uh-huh! Good luck!

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:32.420
I came to see Hana at work.

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:35.710
And I <i>am</i> glad I could see
this previously unknown side of her.

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:37.170
But...

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:43.130
I never thought Sakurai would be here, too!

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:47.590
Well, hello! I understand you're Hana's mother?

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:49.510
She's so young!

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:53.260
Nice to meet you.
You've been so kind to my daughter.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:58.420
No, no--she's been good to <i>us</i> .
Hana's a hard worker.

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.550
I understand it's her first part-time job--

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:05.960
maybe it's her cheery disposition that
lets her be so outgoing with customers.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.170
Oh, is that so? I'm glad to hear it.

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:13.010
And she's a big hit with our customers, too!

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:13.840
See?

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.630
Eh?

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:16.630
And then--

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:18.590
Right?

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:19.800
Hello there!

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.550
Hana!

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:24.300
Children just love Hana.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.130
She's always happy
to spend time with bored kids.

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:29.460
I drew a kitty!

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.630
Only when she's free, of course.

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.630
Look!

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.880
Wow! That's fantastic!

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.760
So that's how she's doing.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:41.340
As a parent, I was honestly worried...
but I feel a little better now.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:45.880
I'm a parent, too--I get
where you're coming from.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:51.670
When it comes down to it, turning customers
into fans is the service industry ideal.

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:54.420
After all, fans are frequent visitors.

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:58.050
Hana gives them a reason to come.
That gives us a big advantage.

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:01.800
It's not something first-timers
can usually pull off.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.800
You've got yourself a winner.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.170
All this praise is more
than I can possibly bear.

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.590
I'm just happy she's useful.

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:16.920
There <i>is</i> one more factor that brings
those moms in on the regular.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.050
Oh?

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:23.170
Do... do you mean Sakurai?

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:25.300
You know him?

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.840
Er... yes, s-somewhat.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.050
His eyes are fierce, but once
you get past that, he's a closet hunk!

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:34.510
Not to mention tall, slim, and fit!

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:37.210
With a serious personality and good manners!

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:39.670
He checks <i>all</i> the boxes!

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:44.510
When you put it like that...
yes, I suppose, perhaps...

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:49.210
He used to be an athlete,
so he knows how to speak to his elders.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:54.460
More than anything, though,
he's dignified--and grown-ups like that.

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.760
I-Is that so...

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:01.420
You know those moms are <i>all about</i> stopping
by if they can chat with a young man

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:04.550
<i>and</i> have someone look after their kids!

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:06.800
We are making <i>bank</i> !

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.510
Don't talk so shady about your father's café.

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:15.380
I understand how he'd make fans...

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:19.010
But what about Sakurai?

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:20.670
Huh?

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.710
What... <i>about</i> him?

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:30.960
Oh! Um, well, that is...
how should I put this... F-For example...

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.300
Does he like...

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.380
...married women? Older women?

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.590
Oh--so she's...

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:45.010
Boss?

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:48.170
Now that the beans are here,
I'll get the stockroom sorted.

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:50.130
I'll help!

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:56.380
There appears to be a...
significant misunderstanding.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:57.710
What?

00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:02.050
It's all right! He's no cougar hunter.

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.380
He's just a doofus.

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.550
Oh, i-is he?

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:10.550
Yes! He's always been prone
to taking things the wrong way.

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:12.590
"Married women"? Yikes.

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:18.050
Have no fear. He and your daughter
work beautifully together.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:20.170
"Married women"? Uh-oh.

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:26.300
Yes... Yes, of course!
I don't know what I was thinking.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:30.090
Oh, I'm mortified!
Please--forget I said anything!

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:33.130
She blushes exactly like her daughter.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:33.130
Why, what was I even <i>saying</i> ?

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:35.510
A coffee bean?

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:40.170
Yep. You have to properly mature these babies.

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:46.130
Hana? I'm going to be on my way.

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:50.130
Oh, uh-huh. Do you prefer mature adults, too?

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:50.590
Huh?

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:55.920
Mature... adults? Yeah, I guess.
That would be my preference, yeah.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.420
You know, like...
there's just this overall <i>richness</i> .

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:01.880
"Richness"?

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:06.130
But an old hand would
try 'em just like that, right?

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:09.420
Apparently. Gotta take it easy, though.

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:12.800
Overindulge and you get
so excited that you can't sleep.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.340
"Ex... Excited"?!

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:20.010
Wanna try with what we have? Now's your chance.

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:23.670
You know I can't!

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:25.420
Still...

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.630
I plan on getting a real good
taste before too long.

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:33.760
Aha! You're an old hand, Senpai!

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.210
Cut it out, dum-dum.

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:40.340
I knew it... he has his eye on me!

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:50.210
Yesss! I win yet again!

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:53.300
You sure are wimpy, Senpai!

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.630
What did you expect?
I've never played this game before!

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:59.630
That's hardly an excuse.

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:03.920
Why, I only just bought this game two days ago!

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:10.130
Although I did spend yesterday
training hard so I could kick your butt.

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:11.710
That's dirty!

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:15.260
I'll do whatever it takes to see you frustrated.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.630
You say that like you're proud, you chicken!

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:21.210
Oh, is that the last howl of a dog
with its tail between its legs?

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.510
Ha ha, loser pooch!

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.260
I'm going to grab a drink.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.340
Grab one for me, too!

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.170
Oh?

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:36.050
What? You lost, right?
One favor is the least you could do.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:40.210
Tch. Fine.

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:44.130
Aw, man, we should have made it interesting!

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:46.920
Like, loser runs to the store
to buy the winner a new kind

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.880
of slightly pricey pudding!

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:53.460
Win one game and you act like you own the place.

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:58.050
Sheesh. And to think
your mom is so quiet and kind.

00:14:58.050 --> 00:14:59.960
Huh?

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.340
Hmph!

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:09.210
Mmm-hmm! It came out great again!

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:13.840
Huh?

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.960
We can't--I have a husband!

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.880
What are you saying, Akiko?

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:24.260
That's mean, confessing your love right there!

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.710
<i>I'm</i> the one who can treat you right!

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:24.260
No...

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.800
Huh?

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.710
Ah, what a lovely soak!

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.760
Oh!

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.090
What... What is it?

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.380
Nothing.

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:47.800
Does my daughter have her eye on me, too?

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.800
Check, please.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.840
Thank you very much. Please come again!

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.460
Is... Is something wrong, Uzaki?

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:01.210
Oh, no, no. Don't mind me.

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:05.920
Normally she'd be all...

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.130
Thanks heaps!

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:08.590
Do it <i>right</i> !

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:12.460
Yow!

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.130
Okay, you jerk! I know you did <i>something</i> !

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:15.940
Take <i>that</i> !

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:19.300
Yes, I did! I did! I totally did!

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:22.340
Just please--stop flicking ice water at me!

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:26.760
I see. No wonder Hana's mad.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.420
You tactless brute!

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:33.170
Mmm. Though it's great to
be courteous with our customers,

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:35.630
she's throwing our regulars for a loop.

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:37.340
What to do?

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:42.170
I've finished tidying up!

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:44.130
Heavens, you three!

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:48.590
Just because we have no customers
doesn't mean you can stand around chatting!

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:55.590
What's wrong, Senpai?
Why are you staring at my face like that?

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:57.300
Cut that out.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.840
What might "that" be?

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.880
The way you're talking!
And acting! It's... it's weird!

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:08.050
Oh, my! Just yesterday
you told me to mind my manners.

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:12.630
Today you tell me to stop?
Oh, what <i>will</i> I do with you?

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:16.210
Stop! Please! It's just <i>awful</i> !

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:19.630
And no more of that silly giggle!

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:26.340
Are you all right, Senpai? If you're
feeling unwell, perhaps you'd like a rest?

00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:30.630
I can certainly take on your share of work.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.460
Please, Senpai... take care of yourself.

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:41.590
Stop that!

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:45.050
Why do you take damage
when someone's nice to you?

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:49.710
Please, you mustn't overexert yourself.

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:53.380
Why, if something were to happen to you, I...

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:55.960
Enough! Quit screwing around, damn you!

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.010
What's this fake "good junior" crap?

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:00.130
Go back to your usual screwing around!

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:05.260
Calm down, Sakurai. Your words are all jumbled.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:10.260
You know, Sakurai?
I think Hana's just fine like this, too.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.340
Farewell!

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:15.670
Please do look after your health.

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:18.380
Begging your pardon!

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:20.710
I foresee a new service offering!

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:23.170
Ami! Back off a little, would you?

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.920
If you find it that unpleasant,
I could always stop.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.170
Really?!

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:30.550
But first...

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:34.050
Isn't there something
you have to say to me, Senpai?

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:39.550
Yeah, right! <i>Me</i> , say something to <i>you</i> ?

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:43.300
Besides, all I could say right now is... <i>that</i> !

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:50.130
I messed up. I'm sorry.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:51.710
--Ooh!
--Whoa!

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:55.420
As long as you know.

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:02.300
The fierce and hulking Sakurai,
meekly eating crow?!

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.920
I smell another potential service
for the housewife market!

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:09.380
Ami! Be quiet, would you?

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:11.670
I prefer the usual Uzaki.

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:12.670
Huh?

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:16.590
Ah! There it is--Sakurai's famous...

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:24.050
It's working, it's working!

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:30.380
That really is you all over, Senpai.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:31.960
Huh? What is?

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.760
I'll tell you what:

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:37.090
The way you always say stuff without thinking!

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:40.090
What?! Pot, meet kettle!

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:43.170
Well, this is all <i>your</i> fault, anyway!

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:44.880
All because <i>you</i> got carried away!

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:48.420
Can we have them take on
different personas for the customers

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.670
on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, at least?

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:54.300
I know the older ladies in particular
will love meek and mild Sakurai!

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.090
Then this will hardly be a café anymore.

00:19:57.090 --> 00:20:01.090
Could you please stop trying to put
different spins on your father's café?

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:02.590
Well, you know <i>your</i> problem?

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:04.920
And you know what <i>your</i> deal is?

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.920
No fighting!

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.380
Huh?

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:11.710
Oh!

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.090
Welcome.

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:14.260
Hey, now!

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.920
I-I'm sorry she just butted in like that.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:22.380
This isn't really a fight.
It's what we call a lovers' quarrel.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.300
--No way!
--It is <i>not</i> !

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:29.090
You can have this. So make up, okay?

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:37.130
Man. Scolded by a little kid.

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:39.300
She got us good.

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:43.300
You were saying some
pretty weird stuff back there.

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.010
Weird stuff?

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:48.630
You know, like... "the usual Uzaki."

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:55.050
If I'm not careful, my expression'll slip!

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:56.960
Hey, look.

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:01.630
We have that ticket--let's do it!

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:02.840
Right.

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:07.130
Th-That means...

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:10.300
Congratulations are in order!

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.210
Huh?

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:16.630
You've won the grand prize: a two-night,
one-day trip for two to Tottori!

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:17.300
Eh?

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:18.880
Say... what?

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:31.300
Wow, they really went
all out in the airport, huh?

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.170
I hate to ask this now...

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:35.210
What's up?

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:37.380
Are you sure you're okay coming here with me?

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:42.630
What do you mean, Senpai? You deserve it!
We won together, after all.

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:44.340
Squee! The Phantom Thief Kid!

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:45.210
He's so cool!

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:47.710
This is my first time in Tottori!

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:51.670
Hey, Senpai, your eyes are
totally different. They're kinder!

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:52.760
Oh, shut up!

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.340
Hey, those glasses actually make you look, uh...

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.670
Get it right for once, would you?

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:01.050
Can it! What are you trying to make me do?!

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:38.920
But why Tottori?

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.960
Well, you see, Asai...
