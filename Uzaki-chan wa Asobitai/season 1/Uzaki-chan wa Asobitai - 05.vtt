00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.590
Summer already, huh?

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.630
Senpai!

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.800
It's that sweaty time of year again!

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.260
You're too hyper, that's all.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.760
Hey, hey, Senpai?

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.670
What?

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.920
Can I come over to your place today?

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.050
Today? Again?

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:41.760
I'm just really worried you'll build
more of Uzaki Hills without me!

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.510
I so won't.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.590
Creepy old tower.
Looks like an evil emperor's hangout.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.050
An evil emperor's hangout? No way!

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.130
That's my dream house,
stuffed full of my perfect ideals!

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.170
You'd set up a lava trap at your own house?!

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.550
Oh, that?

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.760
<i>That</i> is so you can always come by and visit!

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.710
What, you want to trap me?

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.170
Trap you? Why, I never! How rude!

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.670
With the lava! What else could I mean?

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.260
What are you doing out there, kitty?

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.420
I'll rescue you.
Stay right there and be a good kitty.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.630
Almost there...

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.050
It's all right.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.340
Hey!

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.670
No!

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.380
A dream? I was... dreaming?

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.670
Well, yeah.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.880
Must've nodded off, then woke up in a panic.
That hasn't happened in a while.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.800
If anyone saw that...

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.460
It had to be her--and only
at the worst possible times!

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.300
Turn around! We're in the middle of class!

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.340
Hey, hey, Senpai, Senpai, Senpai!

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.710
Were you dreaming of falling from a high place?
You totally jolted awake!

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.260
Don't be nodding off, now!

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.710
To think I was a witness to the big moment!

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.420
<i>God</i> , you bug me!

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.460
Be quiet. Class has started!

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.420
Whoopsie!

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.550
Are you familiar with dream interpretation?

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.670
It holds that the content of
one's dreams reveal one's mental state.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.090
Dreams of falling from a height, for example,

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.920
indicate deep-seated feelings of anxiety,

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:33.130
while vague unease about
one's career or personal prospects...

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.170
Oh, you're anxious, Senpai?

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.130
Don't worry--you can tell me anything.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.590
Shut up.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:40.420
Dreaming of falling when one is in
high spirits or getting carried away

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.880
can also be interpreted as a warning
to put one's feet on the ground,

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.880
Getting carried away there, Senpai?

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.550
Shut <i>up</i> , I said!

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.550
a subconscious dissatisfaction
with the action or attitude responsible.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.340
Quit getting so excited!
Get those feet on the <i>ground</i> !

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.050
Look who's talking!

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.760
Talk about a timely lecture! Too funny!

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.550
Really laid bare your deepest psyche, huh?

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.590
Can it. Besides, I'm not a kid--
I don't believe in that stuff.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.300
Maybe it <i>was</i> a little juvenile...

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.880
Well, <i>I'm</i> more of a believer.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.550
Psychological tests, blood-type fortunes...

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.210
Superstition, all of it.
That's not what psychology is about.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.340
Sure, you <i>say</i> that, but are you
sure you're not just acting tough?

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.550
Yeah, right.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.260
But psychologically speaking--

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.300
Uh-oh... I'm--

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.130
Watch out! What are you doing, idiot?

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.760
Nice catch, Senpai. That was scary!

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.210
That's what happens when
you're focused on riling someone up

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.050
instead of watching your step.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.630
Be careful, dummy!

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.800
Which reminds me...

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.010
Of what?

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.210
People who trip down stairs
can develop climacophobia,

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.340
the fear of descending stairs.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.090
Uh, what? Where'd this
come from all of a sudden?

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.800
It's a psychological aftershock.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.050
Huh?

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.460
It's also known as "the stair yips."

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.630
You're navigating stairs as usual, until one day

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.590
you just can't go down them smoothly,
or you tumble down them--

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.510
until at last, you're scared
of the very stairs themselves.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:17.420
Stop that!

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.590
That's terrifying!

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:24.880
Aw!

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.420
C'mon, why not?

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.420
Ah!

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.670
'Cause I have plans with <i>that</i> guy.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.050
Maybe next time, okay?

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.510
Aw!

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:41.800
You showed up at the perfect time, Sak.
Those girls are <i>relentless</i> !

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.130
What gives, Itsuhito? You running away?

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:50.010
It's honestly not much fun going drinking
with that bunch. We just don't click.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.010
Huh.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.590
So many people drink way too much.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.920
<i>I</i> prefer a more stylish approach
to enjoying alcohol.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.130
In the end, sober me is left
to clean up the mess.

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.920
Yeah, I'm not into that, either.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.130
There goes Sakaki. Aren't we going after him?

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.630
Hmm... But that other guy's a little scary.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.300
I get that.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.190
It's the eyes.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.800
Yeah--the eyes.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.880
Those two are together a lot. Are they friends?

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:26.800
Hey, it feels like I barely saw
you around at all last month.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.920
Yeah, I popped over to Okinawa.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.880
Okinawa?! It's not even summer break!

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.510
I just had this sudden urge
to see that gorgeous ocean.

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.260
<i>He's</i> living free and easy.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.960
What about you, Sak?
Anything happen while I was gone?

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:46.090
Nope.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.300
Well...

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:55.340
It's just... hmm... What even <i>was</i> that?

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.300
My days were... hard to describe.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.960
What the hell?

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.380
Life was ordinary enough, generally speaking.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:07.590
I went to classes,
worked my job, played games and stuff...

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:09.840
Kept pretty busy.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.920
Enough! Will you go hog wild just <i>once</i> ?!

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:19.210
I've been hanging out with you
for three years. Your life is <i>dull</i> !

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:21.170
It's depressing just hearing about it!

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:24.380
Only four years of college,
and you're wasting it! <i>Enjoy</i> it!

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.880
Get a girlfriend!

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.010
You always say that.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:31.890
This is no time to be drinking!

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:33.880
What the--? You gave it to me!

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.380
Shut up! Jerks like you
who waste their youth are insufferable!

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.010
Hey, Senpai!

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:42.090
<i>There</i> you are!

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:43.130
Huh?

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:45.880
Might this person be...

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.420
Wait--could he be--your... friend?

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:50.800
Yeah, that's right.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.130
<i>What</i> ?!

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:59.170
So you... you really <i>did</i> have a friend.

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:01.800
You did talk him up sometimes...

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.090
...but I thought he was imaginary.

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:09.460
You saw me eating with him in the dining hall!

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:14.630
I thought maybe you were
pretending he was your friend.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:18.210
I'm so happy... Oh, I really am so glad...

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:20.880
Wait--you were seriously worried about me?!

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.960
Quit looking at me like that!

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:26.460
Oh, right. You're that girl
who's with Sak now and then.

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.630
I'm a junior, like him. Name's Sakaki--pleasure.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:30.510
Hana Uzaki, sophomore!

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:34.760
Senpai is a hardcore gloomlord,
but I hope you'll get along well together.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.460
Who even <i>are</i> you to me?

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:41.050
Don't you worry, Senpai--
I'll still keep hanging out with you.

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:43.920
So where are we going to go after class today?

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.510
Why are you saying that like
my schedule's already booked?

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:50.090
I said I was going
to hang out at your place today.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:52.300
You want to come over again today? Seriously?

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:57.420
I mean, if you're always hanging out
with your one male friend, people'll talk.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:59.130
They'll make fanart outta you!

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:03.130
Who exactly are you worried about?
Do you even know what that means?

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:07.300
And don't assume, amid all this nonsense,
that I only have one male friend.

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.960
Now, now--you don't have to show off.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.920
I'm <i>not</i> !

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.840
So <i>that's</i> how it is.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.840
No, really--it's fine!

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.010
Whoops! Well, I've got another class.

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:18.760
Get to it.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.460
She's a nice girl.

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.130
Sometimes.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:25.710
Oh, Sak...

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:27.050
It's not like that.

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:30.510
Don't worry; I get it. Just leave it to me.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:31.840
Huh?

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.260
You've found love at long last!

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.210
You don't get it at all!

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:39.920
Don't be bashful!
I'm your wingman--I've got your back!

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.380
Ugh! Another giant pain in the ass!

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:47.880
What sort of situation are you after?
Romantic? Erotic?

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.710
Oh, this is going to be one fun summer!

00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:58.210
Yes!

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:00.050
Ah, dammit.

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:01.960
Hey, you two.

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:03.880
Oh, hi.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.630
Hey.

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:08.210
So how long have you known each other?

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:09.960
She was my junior in high school.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.840
We were in the same club.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.630
Huh. A pretty long time, then.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:15.760
You could say that.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.090
Uh-huh.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:20.920
And how far have you gone?

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.800
Any fooling around?

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:28.260
Look here, you...

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.340
This guy looks good,
but he's really just the worst, huh.

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:32.010
So, is that a no?

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:33.170
It's a no!

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.380
It's not something you talk about--and
we wouldn't tell you even if we did!

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:37.590
Not even a little?

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:38.420
No!

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.050
Not at all?

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:39.840
Not at all!

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.710
Huh?

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:41.710
Eh?

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:43.380
<i>Huh</i> ?

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.380
Oh, uh... never mind.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:49.800
Huh? Eh? N-Now hang on a sec--
I seriously don't remember anything!

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.920
N-No, it's fine. I mean, it's just between us.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.960
If you don't know,
then it doesn't count. It's okay.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.130
It is <i>not</i> okay! Tell me!
What did I do? Where? When?

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:58.130
I knew it!

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:01.050
Ugh! Shut up! This is sexual harassment!

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:03.380
Now you're mad at me, and I don't even know why!

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.510
Sakaki, too, going all in
on the sexual harassment!

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:07.710
Just drop it.

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:09.920
S-Sexual... harassment?

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:09.920
Sorry.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.840
Senpai's a good guy.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:15.090
From where I stand, he's the
safest creature in the whole world.

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:18.670
When you put it like that...
it's actually pretty awful.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:25.210
Again, sorry. I'd just never heard
any romantic tales about Sak before.

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:29.920
Seeing Mr. Serious here with
a girl piqued my interest, that's all.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.630
We can't really help that.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:37.050
He's a gloomy klutz of a sleepyhead
villain loner, so I keep him company.

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:40.550
Who are you calling a gloomy klutz
of a sleepyhead villain loner?!

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:43.840
I like to spend my time quietly, by myself!

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.710
You two get along amazingly well!

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:49.670
And it's not just me. I bet everyone thinks so!

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:52.710
You know: "Oh, those two must be dating."

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:55.630
Haven't you heard that tons of times?

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:58.090
But we're not.

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:01.960
Okay, you're not--for now. I get that much.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.800
But you're gonna have to eventually.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.130
Uzaki.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.920
Let's grab some ice cream
from the convenience store. My treat.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.630
Really? Hooray!

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:14.710
Did they just run away?

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:17.260
Still, that's not the reaction I was expecting.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.300
I pictured something a little more innocent.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.260
But it's not that he simply <i>dislikes</i> her...

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.960
There must be a reason.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.210
Hmm?

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:30.170
Got a sec?

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.010
And who are you?

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:35.380
Ami Asai, senior. Friend of those two.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:38.050
I'm Sakaki--same year as Sakurai.
Nice to meet you.

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:39.340
Sakaki.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:41.170
What was that?

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:44.590
What <i>was</i> it? Just a friendly chat, that's all.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:47.420
Were you listening in?
You should have joined us!

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.420
You've gone too far.

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:54.590
Teasing those two is one thing,
but do you have to be so blunt about it?

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:59.050
Just putting out some feelers.
I got shut out, though.

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:03.630
I want to watch over those two--and
I won't let anyone get in my way.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:07.670
Doing things your way may very well
end up nipping their love in the bud.

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:11.380
You must watch them from a distance,
with no unnecessary prying!

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.340
I see...

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:18.920
So you're rooting for them, too, huh?
And you really care.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:24.710
You've changed my mind.
After all, we both want them to be together.

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:31.550
How about we team up, then?

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:34.710
I'd do <i>anything</i> for those two!

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:37.960
Wrong!

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.630
What?!

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:44.210
I don't need anyone's help! Quit your meddling!

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:50.710
And what part of me wanting to observe
from out here do you not understand?!

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:53.880
You're pretty crass yourself!

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:57.840
I won't let you meddle
indiscriminately in their business!

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.300
Jeez, what a pain!

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:02.510
You <i>both</i> are.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:05.670
Want to share, Senpai? C'mon.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.420
You don't want any?

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:14.340
Don't be shy. After all, you bought 'em.

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:15.590
C'mon.

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:21.670
That refreshing green-blue
packaging... choco-mint, huh?

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:23.510
Is choco-mint any good?

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:26.340
Choco-mint is delicious!

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:28.420
Choco-mint...

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:31.670
But choco-mint--isn't that toothpaste?

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:33.010
Huh?

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:35.710
What did you just say?

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:37.010
Eh?

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:40.550
Look me in the eye and say that again.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:42.550
Wait... what?

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:46.590
It's just... I was wondering
if choco-mint was really any good,

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:48.550
since that's what toothpaste tastes like.

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:50.210
There it is! You idiot!

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:52.840
That is <i>always</i> what people
who <i>don't</i> eat choco-mint say

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.130
when they're mocking choco-mint!

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:56.670
I'm not mocking anything.

00:15:56.670 --> 00:16:00.920
You <i>are</i> ! It started when
you compared it to toothpaste!

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:04.170
Even though it's your garbage palate's
fault you can't eat choco-mint,

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:07.800
you cowards are always
so quick to blame the mint!

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.630
"Isn't that just toothpaste?"

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:13.550
Then these jerks always go to
"No way can that be good"

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:15.550
and "Why don't you just eat toothpaste, then?"

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:16.380
<i>Morons</i> !

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:18.550
Toothpaste isn't something you eat!

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:20.670
Can you even imagine it, Senpai?

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:23.170
How humiliating it is to be mocked
by idiots who don't know the difference

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:25.010
between toothpaste and <i>food</i> ?!

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:26.300
Uh... yeah.

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.420
But what I <i>really</i> can't stand

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:31.920
is the sheer <i>arrogance</i> of people
who think it's okay to persecute

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.460
what they don't understand!

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:37.380
That's right! We choco-mintians
have been exposed for so long!

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:38.760
"Choco-mintians"?

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.050
Exposed to the unknowing abuse
that stems from a lack of understanding!

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:42.050
Isn't that just toothpaste?

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:47.380
When choco-mint, as ice cream,
made its way to Japan from distant continents,

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:52.340
sales were poor due to its
intense coloration and unique flavor.

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:53.550
And yet!

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:56.760
We choco-mintians, amidst bias and prejudice,

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.840
slowly grew in number with many years of effort.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.960
Now it's praised as
invigorating, Instagrammable--

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.340
with more cafés serving choco-mint sweets

00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:12.210
and more varieties of choco-mint goods
on food-store shelves every year!

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:13.710
<i>Nevertheless</i>!

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:17.510
The palate-poor anti-choco-mint
brigade chooses ignorance!

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:19.260
Rise, O choco-mintians!

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.380
Turn your sadness into anger
and make your stand!

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:24.550
You hate it, don't you, Senpai?

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:27.960
It sucks when people mock your favorite game
when they've never played it

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.050
and know nothing about it!

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:31.960
Well, yeah, it does.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.800
Besides, it's all out of order!

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:39.130
Mint doesn't taste like toothpaste--
<i>toothpaste</i> tastes like <i>mint</i> !

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:42.090
<i>Idiot</i>!

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:45.510
She... She is <i>seriously</i> pissed.

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:47.880
Never mind those palate-poor losers!

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.960
I'm grateful for choco-mint!

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:54.010
Thank you, choco-mint!

00:17:55.630 --> 00:18:01.380
One bite and the sharp,
refreshing mint flavor fills your mouth,

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:06.880
the gentle notes of sweet chocolate
slowly fading away.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:12.590
That soothing feeling makes you
want to take another bite right away.

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:14.630
No matter what anyone says...

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:20.010
...choco-mint is delicious.

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:51.050
What the hell?

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:53.130
Thank you very much.

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:56.710
Brava. I guess you've been
holding onto some things, too.

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:58.460
Oh, <i>yeah</i>.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:02.840
You can hate whatever you want,
but don't diss what someone else likes.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.880
Mind your own beeswax!

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:08.380
Though you <i>did</i> mock my solo movies.

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:14.340
But man, I never dreamed that <i>you</i>
would be one of those lower lifeforms.

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:18.380
Over one lousy ice cream? That's a little much.

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:21.010
It's not that I <i>hate</i> it...

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:24.170
I couldn't handle mint as a kid.

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:28.510
Ever since, anything with that cooling
sensation--gum, cough drops--forget it.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:32.050
I even use a non-mint toothpaste.

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:34.710
That cooling sensation is the best part!

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:39.550
With the sweet chocolate chaser?
That's the real charm of choco-mint!

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:42.710
But since I can't do mint,

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:47.010
I've never tried choco-mint.

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:48.710
<i>What</i>?!

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:55.380
Why, you... Mock choco-mint untasted, will you?!

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:58.130
All right! I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:05.590
I see. So it all stems from childhood trauma.

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:10.170
But that means you should be fine now, right?

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:15.090
They do say your sense of
taste changes as you grow up.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:17.170
Maybe, but still...

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:19.550
Wanna try one, just to see?

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.630
Why the hesitation?

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:27.210
You'll be fine--it's not an intense mint.

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:29.420
What, are you scared?

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:30.550
Huh?

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:32.960
C'mon, you can do it.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.380
Conquer your pickiness. Mint's not scary.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.920
Your eyes sure are!

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:44.170
Look, just eat it already. C'mon!

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:47.170
All right, fine. Here goes...

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:49.710
Great! Say "ah"!

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:54.800
Now that I think about it, isn't this...

00:20:57.050 --> 00:21:02.300
An indirect--?!
Wait--now it's rubbing off on <i>me</i> !

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:07.090
But if I don't eat this now,
it'll turn into this big thing again.

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:10.300
Couldn't she be a little more mindful?!

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.420
Ugh!

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.210
Well?

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:25.920
It... it's actually, uh... tasty, I... I'd say.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.460
That's a pretty vague answer.

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:30.710
But you managed to eat it!

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:32.960
Last one's mine!

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.550
Oh, I-I'm sorry.

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:47.420
For... For what?

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:51.550
N-Nothing...

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:54.300
Don't realize it <i>now</i> !

00:21:55.670 --> 00:22:00.800
But it'll take a thousand years
for them to get together on their own!

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.460
Then I'll live a thousand years!

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:40.010
I <i>will</i> get you two together, Sak!
