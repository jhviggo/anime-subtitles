00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.980
Sakurai Shinichi started
working here part-time last year.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.440
Though he looks a bit fierce,

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.530
he has a serious personality
and attitude toward work,

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.440
and our regulars say good things about him.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.360
But most of all...

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.030
...his body is <i>fine</i> .

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.730
Whoops.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.480
That Sakurai's something, all right.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.730
On closer inspection, he's pretty hunky.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.400
He looks slim, but he's got
proper muscles under there!

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.190
Sakurai? We're ready to pay.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.650
Coming!

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.190
I doubt he's noticed, but he has plenty of fans.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.480
Sakurai, you're so tall! How tall <i>are</i> you?

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.820
One hundred eighty centimeters.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.530
Wow! That's tall, all right!

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.400
Did you play any sports?

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.070
I was in the swim club in high school.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.070
Wow, really?

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.570
The swim team! Yes! Good question, ma'am!

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.480
And those swimmers...
why, you can see <i>everything</i> !

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.030
To be learning tidbit after tidbit,
right here at work...

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.900
I'm making such progress!

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.690
Your heart doesn't seem to be in it today, Ami.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.690
Eh?

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.400
Getting lost in thought is fine and all,
but you <i>are</i> on the clock.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.360
You've got to be careful in this line of work,

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.190
or you'll lose track of all kinds of things.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.360
Right. I'm sorry.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.730
I do understand your hobby, though.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.530
Now go on--clear that open table.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.480
Okay, Dad.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.440
Dad may come across as gentle and tasteful,
but he sure is strict with family.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.820
This won't do. Not when I'm actually
working the same shift as Sakurai!

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.980
Hiya!

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.480
You're here again?

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.230
Don't you have anything better to do?

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.480
I could ask you the same
thing--working on a Sunday!

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.940
Who's this? Who's this? <i>Who</i> ?

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.730
Hello there, Hana.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.320
Dad knows her, too?

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.610
Sir! Up top! Yeah!

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.070
Yeah!

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.150
Dad... without a single shred of tastefulness!

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.730
Our peak time's just ended, so there
aren't many customers. Sit wherever you like.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.360
Okay!

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.360
Um... who's that?

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.230
You mean Uzaki?
She's a sophomore at our college.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.480
Ah! She's in college!

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.530
Oh, right, Senpai--I have that game you lent me.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.480
Cool. How was it?

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.150
They're borrowing each other's stuff.
Must be good friends.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.150
Whew, that final act was a real thrill.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.190
Here I thought it was
an entirely different game,

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.980
but when I found out it was
kind of a sequel to the last one?

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.610
I got <i>crazy</i> goosebumps!

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.980
I know, right?

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.860
I would've been happy playing
a plain old building game,

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.940
but it turned out to be such a find,
I just had to get it out there!

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.030
What's this? They seem like such good friends.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.320
No--they can't be--

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.730
Oh, those two?

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.530
What's with the chuckle?

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.940
Oh, nothing. Bring her some water, would you?

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.650
Welcome.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.280
Thanks!

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.980
So, you go to the same college?

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.400
I'm Ami Asai. I'm a senior.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.400
Oh, really? Then that makes you Senpai's senpai!

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.190
Be right back. I'm going to put this in my bag.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.480
Sure.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.650
I'm Hana Uzaki, and I'm a sophomore!

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.570
Now that I get a good look at her...
this girl is <i>really cute</i> !

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.280
Then there's her endearing smile...

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.400
She's short, so she has this
"adorable little animal" vibe.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.150
She's no little animal. Holy... wowsers!

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.900
This girl is a <i>beast</i> !

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.280
Come on. Pull yourself together!

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.570
You and Sakurai seem to get along really well.

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.530
Hmm? Oh, yeah, we do!

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.650
How long have you known each other?

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.070
We were in the same club in high school.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.940
The water on Uzaki's table
is getting pretty low.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.900
He's <i>always</i> been a gloomy
Gus with an evil look in his eyes.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.440
He was a hard person to get to know.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.360
Even now, in college, his personality is
no better--he's always doing loner stuff.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.400
So I'm looking out for him.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.070
Ah! So that's how it is.

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.860
Huh?

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.900
Well, call me over
when you're ready to order, Hana.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.440
'Kay!

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.070
Well?

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.730
She's just so <i>good</i> .

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.650
You want to stick your nose in their business...

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.280
But we shouldn't interfere...

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.900
Don't you just want to look out for them both?

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.650
I get that.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.780
Don't you love customer-facing jobs?

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.530
You get to watch all kinds of people
and their lives--like those two.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.110
It's one of the thrills of this business.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.280
Uzaki. Water.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.530
That's <i>cold</i> !

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.110
Wh-Where the heck did <i>you</i> come from?!

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:33.980
That's <i>my</i> line!

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.030
Customers are supposed to just
sit quietly! <i>I</i> was bringing it to <i>you</i> !

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.860
Seriously? You haven't even
been treating me like a customer!

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.320
Shut up!

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.780
They put on quite a show, am I right?

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:51.070
You're telling me.
I've <i>got</i> to start taking more shifts!

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.360
Oh, give them a towel.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.440
What?!

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.230
Senpai's out with a cold?

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:06.650
Sakurai called this morning.
I made him take the day off.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:11.530
First the ice-water drenching yesterday,
then it got so cold last night...

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:16.940
Well, huh. So much for that
"Oh, yeah--I train" expression.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.780
He's surprisingly fragile.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.570
Oh, yeah--I train.

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:27.400
Why doesn't <i>she</i> have a cold, then?

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.320
In that case, sir...

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.730
Man, I have been knocked <i>flat</i> .

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.320
Did colds always hit this hard?

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.860
Do I need a doctor? Medicine?

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.440
I should eat something first.

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:48.610
But I can't move.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:50.360
Now what?

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:56.730
What a racket. Who's there? Dammit...

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.480
And me barely managing to get out of bed.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.820
Hiya!

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:04.780
Do you really have a cold?
Well, I'm paying you a visit!

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.860
U-Uzaki?

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.530
What... how did you...

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:16.190
Are you okay, Senpai?!

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.690
Hey, uh... Senpai!

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.570
That must be one bad cold.

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:29.440
Yeah.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.030
Well, I've let her into my place after all.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:36.070
Who was it? Who told her where I live?

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.570
Oh? Was that wrong?

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:45.900
Since I know where he lives, I thought
we would play some games or something.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.650
Now <i>that's</i> some misplaced excitement.

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:51.070
He looks like he's having a really bad time.

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:54.980
He brags about his stamina,
only to be laid up in bed. Fitting.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.860
That does it.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:03.650
Have you seen a doctor?

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:05.940
No... can't really move.

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.150
Any medicine?

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.940
Not yet. Haven't bought any.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.190
Then you haven't eaten, either.

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:17.030
Oh, well. Leave this to me!

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.480
Uh...

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.610
Oof...

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:30.030
Going by his symptoms, I'd say <i>this</i> one.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.570
A cold--that calls for leeks!

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.280
Can you sit up, Senpai?

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.400
Yeah.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.110
Then eat--even if it's only a few bites.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:09:59.730
Wow.

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.940
It was a real production, let me tell you!

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:05.780
Empty fridge, awkward kitchen...

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.440
Here you go. Say "ah"!

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.440
I-I can feed myself.

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:15.360
Stop that!

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:25.360
It's good.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.940
Right?!

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:31.320
Honestly... I'm not tasting things
too well right now.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.780
But... it's probably good.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.730
"Probably," huh?

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:36.070
I'll take it.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:37.480
Sorry.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.440
See? My cooking is totally edible.

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:53.440
Sorry.

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:57.860
Eating really warmed me up.

00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.900
You got a good sweat going on!

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.320
And now?

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.440
Strip!

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.980
I refuse.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.820
No way! Wipe yourself down and change clothes!

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:10.860
That sweat? It <i>stinks</i> !

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:16.860
It's fine! I'm just going to
take my medicine and go to sleep!

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:16.860
Hey! Don't fight me, sickie!

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:26.110
You've got nice skin, mister. I'll be gentle!

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:28.030
No weird roleplay!

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:29.730
Forget feeling self-conscious, now!

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:32.400
You must be used to going
around half-naked from swim club.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.150
I'll do the front myself!

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:51.440
How can being cared for be so tiring?

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:56.320
Here's your medicine. Take this
and you'll be all better in the morning.

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:03.280
But if you're still feeling awful tomorrow,
make sure you see a doctor.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.320
Got it.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.320
Is that the time? Already?

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:12.570
You can go home. I'll be fine.

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:14.570
I will, once you're asleep.

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:18.860
I'll put the key in your door's
mail slot so you can rest easy.

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.440
You'd do that?

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.690
It's fine.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.780
I'll just play games in the meantime.

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:30.860
Sheesh.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:34.110
I'm already laid low, so let me just say...

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:36.780
You were a huge help today.

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.030
Thanks.

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:42.440
Come on. That's just how we are.

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:48.400
Senpai! Senpai!

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.480
How do I beat this bald scissors dude?!

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.360
His shields explode
when I hit 'em with my blade!

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:58.650
Look, I'll lend you the game
<i>and</i> the console--just <i>go home</i> !

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:00.860
I can't go home a <i>loser</i> !

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.650
Will you let me <i>sleep</i> ?!

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.570
Sakurai!

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:13.530
Ami!

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:15.280
Is your cold all better?

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.190
Yeah, thanks. Sorry you had to cover my shift.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:22.230
It's fine. I was free yesterday anyway.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:28.280
Why don't I take one of your shifts, then?
I have to thank you somehow.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.440
In that case... can you ask Hana to come?

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.860
Huh? Uzaki?

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:40.030
And now, a toast to Sakurai's recovery!

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:41.820
Cheers!

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.190
Thanks.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:45.900
Korean barbecue to celebrate my recovery.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:47.190
That's... a lot.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:52.280
All right! It's all-you-can-eat,
and I'm grilling--so eat up, Senpai!

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:58.650
Salted tongue! Chuck! Tripe! Skirt!

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:00.440
H-hey, that's too much!

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.860
Short ribs! Knuckle! Ribeye!

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:04.610
Let me take my time eating!

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:07.480
Such energy!

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:12.230
She really does seem happy
that Sakurai's feeling better.

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:19.980
Look at you two knock 'em back!
Are beer and liquor really that tasty?

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.900
Uh-huh--especially when paired with good eats.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.730
Let's go out for drinks when you turn 20, Hana.

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:27.030
Hooray!

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:29.690
Now that that's settled, eat up, Senpai!

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:31.190
You listen here...

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.440
I'm going to hit the restroom.

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.820
I'm glad you're feeling better, Sakurai.

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:44.820
I'm sorry I had to take the day off yesterday.

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.570
Not at all.

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:50.780
I'm just happy Hana took such good care of you.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:54.940
So you <i>did</i> tell her where I live.

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:57.650
And? How'd it go?

00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:59.320
"How"?

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:08.230
Stop pressuring me while piling
on the finest cuts of meat!

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:12.440
Just so you know,
it's not like that with me and Uzaki.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:15.480
I want to enjoy my quiet solo lifestyle,

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.780
so I don't want people over if I can help it.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:22.780
And Uzaki is basically
the polar opposite of quiet.

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:23.570
So gloomy!

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:24.940
Way gloomy!

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.440
That's what <i>you</i> are, Sakurai.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.940
And what's wrong with that?!

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:33.110
They've really had a lot to drink...

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:34.860
Besides...

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:39.900
Uzaki may be my trusted junior,
but she's still a girl.

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:43.400
If rumors start at school about
her coming to my place all the time,

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.360
it'd only make unnecessary trouble for her.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:50.940
I live near campus--someone could see her.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:52.940
Th-This is getting complicated!

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:57.070
I had an inkling, but this? This is a pain!

00:15:57.070 --> 00:16:01.690
I was fully aware, but still... still!

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:03.110
Dad.

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:07.860
Right. This'll only get juicier
if we just let it be.

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:12.690
It's like coffee, Ami.
Slowly roasted, painstakingly brewed...

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:16.110
Let's be patient and
watch over these two for now.

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:20.610
Yes--until we get that rich, deep flavor.

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:23.030
Whatcha been talkin' about?

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:24.440
Huh? Oh, um...

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.940
Oh, tomorrow's work.

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:27.900
That's right.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:28.900
Aha!

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.900
We'll be getting in a shipment of beans
and other heavy packages.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.190
Can you come in a little early, Sakurai?

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.320
Sure thing, Ami.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.690
Thanks! It'll be so helpful
to have another man around.

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:44.530
Wait, what was going on just
now--between you and your dad?

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:46.780
Hmm... Psyching ourselves up?

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:50.980
Psyching--huh? What's wrong, Uzaki?

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:55.070
I see you call Ami by her first name.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:56.480
Huh?

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.730
If I use her last name,
she'll get mixed up with her father.

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:02.730
Hmm. If you say so.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:08.320
Hey, uh, I was really careful grilling that.

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.230
Come on!

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:14.190
Wait, uh... Uzaki!

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:17.610
Mmm! Perfect with a side of rice!

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:31.400
Why the hell would Uzaki want to meet me here?

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:35.150
She <i>did</i> start acting weird
in the middle of that dinner...

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.900
Did I do something to tick her off?

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:42.030
Senpai.

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:43.360
Huh?

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.690
Eh?

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:50.150
Keep your eye on this five-yen coin.

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:55.320
You're getting very sleepy-- <i>very</i> sleepy...

00:17:55.320 --> 00:18:00.070
Hypnosis? Now what's she trying to pull?

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:05.650
You will do what I say--do what I say...

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:11.150
I don't know what she's after,
but she <i>did</i> take care of me earlier...

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:13.940
Oh, well. I'll play along.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:18.980
Wow, I sure am feeling sleepy.

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:24.030
All right! Simple people really
<i>are</i> the easiest to hypnotize!

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:26.150
Who are you calling "simple," dammit?

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:28.070
Okay, then, Senpai!

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:31.480
Here we go. I just hope it's nothing unreasonable.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.480
Call me by my first name!

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.360
Huh? Is that it?

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.530
<i>That's</i> what she hypnotized me for?

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:44.070
She's waiting for it. I guess I have to.

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:47.110
Ha... Ha... Ha...

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:48.480
Ha...?

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.860
This is a little embarrassing.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:52.480
Ha... Hani.

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.320
Huh? That's not it.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:54.880
Hanu.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:55.690
No.

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:56.380
Hane.

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:57.070
Not that.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:57.640
Hano.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.190
Are you doing this on purpose?

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:02.860
Dammit!

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:04.070
Hana.

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:10.360
Again!

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:10.980
Hana.

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:12.440
Again!

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.650
Hana.

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:15.190
Yes! Again!

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:16.230
Hana.

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:17.400
Again!

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:17.400
Couple of love-dummies.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.280
Hana.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.940
Love-dumb, huh?

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.480
Again!

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.280
Love-dumb.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:20.180
Hana.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:24.900
So that's how it works.
I'm pretty happy with it!

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:29.780
It went so well--I might just
have a knack for hypnosis!

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:30.980
No way.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:34.480
But if that's all it takes to make her happy...

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:34.480
Okay! Next...

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.480
"Next"?

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:38.480
Let's have you buy me something to drink!

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:38.980
Yes.

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:41.440
And ice cream from the convenience store!

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.320
Hey, now.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.980
I can have you buy me lunch at the dining hall!

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:46.180
Don't...

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.860
Oh! And you can buy me
the latest VR setup, too--

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:51.400
Don't push your luck!

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:51.400
Ow!

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.610
No fair pretending to be hypnotized!

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:56.980
Says the girl making demands
of a hypnotized guy!

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:59.150
What are you trying to accomplish?!

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:01.110
I mean...

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:04.860
You call Ami by her first name, right?

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:11.190
I've known you for a pretty long time,
and I just get "Hey" and "Look here."

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:13.480
Rude way to treat someone, don't you think?

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:27.230
I see. I didn't even realize
that I'd made you feel bad.

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:30.190
I apologize for that. I'm sorry.

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:38.530
But I'm kind of, uh... I'm uncomfortable
calling girls by their first names.

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:43.360
Ami told me to call her that for work,
and I've been doing my best, but...

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.980
Please, just... not that.

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:54.070
That's fine, then. I don't want
to force you, poor gloomy thing.

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:57.610
Thanks.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:03.320
Still, hypnotizing with a
five-yen coin in this day and age?

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.150
No way is <i>that</i> gonna work. Right?

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:08.110
Guh...

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:11.320
It worked! Are you kidding me?!
You must have zero resistance!

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.110
Hey! C'mon!

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.230
Buh...

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:17.690
How do I put her back?!

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:20.360
It's gotta be in here somewhere!

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:21.890
Uzaki!

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.940
Uzaki is floating in the sky.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.360
It's not working.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:02.900
I <i>told</i> you: I'm not hypnotized!

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.110
It's truly frightening that you can't remember.

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:09.860
Look, I'm not hypnotized, all right?
It'd be a big deal if I were!

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:12.070
Why do you sound ticked off?

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:14.280
I'm <i>not</i> ticked off.

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.230
Dad... could this be?

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:17.730
Yes...

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:22.480
They say you can't hypnotize
someone who doesn't trust you.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.570
Which means these two...

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:28.400
It certainly looks that way.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.280
Let's not tell them. It's too amusing.

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.610
If I were ticked off, it'd be a big deal.

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:34.360
You really suck at this!

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:40.940
What should we do, Senpai?
