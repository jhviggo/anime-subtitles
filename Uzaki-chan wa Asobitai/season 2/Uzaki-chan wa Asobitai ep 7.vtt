00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.690
<i>You'll</i> still be in school
the year after next, though.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.240
What's wrong, Hana?
Something on your mind?

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.160
N-No, nothing.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.460
Oho... it's <i>something</i>, all right.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.380
Does it involve that senpai of yours?

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.210
N-No way!

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.750
She's too easy to read.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.460
"Thinking about another
cooking lesson next week. OK?"
"I'll check with Mom (Read)" "Thanks"

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.430
You can always open up to me, you know.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.560
Oh, please! What does a middle-schooler
know about college worries?

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.310
Given your usual behavior, though,

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.600
you have about a middle-schooler's
take on romance.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.770
"Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!"

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.480
I do not, either! Don't get smart with me!

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.440
And it's <i>not romance</i>!

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.570
This is getting interesting, all right.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.790
"Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!"

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.940
"Episode 6:
Uzaki-chan Wants to Celebrate!"

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.960
"Episode 7:
Uzaki-chan Wants a Confession!"

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.880
Thanks, Sakurai.
You sure I can have your textbook?

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.220
Sorry about all my scribbled notes--
they might make it hard to read.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.730
No, no--I'm happy to have those, too.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.230
Sakurai gets good grades, after all.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.190
Hey, are you joining the class
the next time we go out for drinks?

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.110
Ooh, sorry. I can't make it. Work.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.070
Oh...

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.700
But do try to come sometime, okay?

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.780
Yeah... next time.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.830
I told you so.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.910
What do you mean?

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.880
I was just waiting for the right moment
to launch a sneak attack on Senpai.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.090
OMG, you are <i>the best</i> at lying!

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.510
Those girls are in the
same class as me and Sak.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.890
Whenever we go out,
they grumble about wanting boyfriends.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.930
They might be after Sak.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.180
Of all the ridiculous...

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.770
You shouldn't assume, Sakaki.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.100
Look who's talking.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.650
I'm sure they just reached out to him
once they saw him all alone.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.740
It just means his adorable junior
isn't the only kindhearted one around.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:45.990
Look who's talking.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:51.250
And <i>that</i> means I don't have to go out
of my way to pay attention to him.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.620
What a timesaver!

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.000
Yeah! It's actually a <i>good</i> thing!

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.340
So I can introduce Sak to
those girls from our class, then?

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.800
That--um...

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.300
That's... different.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.350
You said it yourself, Uzaki:

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.140
"I have no choice but
to pay him attention."

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.440
And now it's "It doesn't have
to be <i>me</i> by Sak's side"?

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.320
No. No!

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.910
You're forgetting something:

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.910
None of those girls will
ever be that person for Senpai.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.950
That's because...

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.290
...he likes <i>me</i>!

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.870
Not that again!

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.670
Even if those girls <i>were</i> after Senpai,
I'm the one he likes,

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.670
so it's no use coming onto him.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.930
They'll just end up disappointed!

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.770
Man, how pathetic would it be
to be turned down by <i>him</i>?

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.060
In other words, by showering
Senpai with my attention,

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.860
I'm protecting the people
around him at the same time!

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.030
Such twisted logic--and so self-conscious!

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.150
But...

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.490
It's like you said earlier, Sakaki:
I better hurry up.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.910
That's true.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.000
Honestly, that was
driven home for me earlier.

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:21.710
I mean, um... it's not like I...
didn't see it coming...

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.550
Is she...?

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.010
I realized something else, too:

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.640
Senpai's a third-year--and
it's already December.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.260
His college years are almost over.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.850
I've got to do something
about him before graduation!

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.690
That's what you meant, right?

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:41.980
Not in the slightest!

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.110
What?!

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.030
You've got to make your move
before someone else does!

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.320
You don't need a whole year to bag him!

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.700
In fact, I'm amazed you
think it'd take that long!

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:58.290
Sheesh... As soon as one of them
gets interested, it'll be done in a flash!

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:02.750
Still, at least she wants
to settle this somehow.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.590
It's a big leap forward
as far as Uzaki's concerned.

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.590
Anyway, there's one year left!

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.930
In one year, I'll make
Senpai confess his love for me!

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.720
Quit beating around the bush!

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.140
Just say, "I like you," right now,
and this'll all be settled--instantly!

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.770
Zip right over and do it!

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.900
Wh-What?! I can't say that! No way!

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.900
Why not? Say it!

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.700
I'm so sick of hearing you say that!

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:32.030
Look, <i>I</i> don't like
Senpai--<i>Senpai</i> likes <i>me</i>!

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.700
Well, <i>I'm</i> sick of hearing <i>that</i>!

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.790
Whatever. I'm beat.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.670
You seem ready to go for it.
I'll leave you to it.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.090
I wish you every happiness.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:45.750
Oh, hang on a second!

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.050
What is it?

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:51.720
What's a good way to get
Senpai to confess his love?

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.970
Beats me!

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.440
What's up, Itsuhito? You look tired.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.570
Don't pay it any mind.

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.860
I was just giving an
acquaintance some advice.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.570
Things are moving
in the right direction...

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:11.610
...probably.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.410
Huh.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:15.700
Hey, Itsuhito.

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.250
Uzaki threw a birthday celebration for me.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.250
So I hear.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.790
What'd make a good
thank-you present for her...

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:30.090
...uh, for a girl?

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.800
"Bath Oil"
"Essential Lipstick"
"Shea Butter Cream" "Teddy Bear Bouquet"

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:38.310
Sorry. I'll come up with something.

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:42.020
Mmm. Probably for the best.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.690
Yeah, they don't need a whole year.

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.950
Sakaki's no help at all.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.740
"Senpai, how's Thursday? (Read)"
"Got it--I'll check"
"Senpai, we on for tomorrow?"

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:57.240
So what can I do over this next year...

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.870
...to make Senpai admit he loves me?

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.590
That's it!

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.760
"Asia CafÃ©"

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.140
So listen...

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:19.770
Senpai always grabs lunch at the
dining hall or a convenience store--

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:22.520
what if I made him bento lunches?

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:25.230
Is he in middle school?!
Too clingy--so cringe!

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:26.610
What?!

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:30.110
Whatever. You're motivated now,
so dive right on in!

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.820
"Senpai, we on for tomorrow? (Read)"
"Sorry for the late reply
See you then"

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:33.450
It's a billion times better than
your usual useless shilly-shallying!

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:36.030
Although <i>anything</i> times
zero is still zero!

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:41.330
Sakaki's becoming more outspoken, too.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.080
I think it's a good idea.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:47.840
Who wouldn't love a homemade lunch
from someone like you?

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.250
Right?!

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:55.050
I already cook for him all
the time--I know what he likes.

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.680
This is gonna be a slam dunk!

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.140
"Easy Everyday"

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:01.390
Or so I thought.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.020
Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup!

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.860
--The whole family's staring at me.
--Hup! Hup! Hup!

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:16.610
"Easy Everyday Bento"

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.990
I get <i>you</i>, Mom, but what
about the rest of you?

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.200
Go play games in your room, Yanagi.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.450
But if you won't play with me,
that leaves Kiri--

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:23.370
and he's been turning me down
'cause I beat him so bad.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:28.880
Besides, I have more
fun watching you these days.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.550
Who's the bento for?

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:36.680
You're such a good cook.
They'll be thrilled!

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:42.310
Oh, no, don't mind me.
Go ahead with what you were doing.

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:44.980
That's super hard to do!

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.560
What's <i>your</i> deal, Kiri?

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:51.770
Don't think I'm pulling a Yanagi here.
I'm not here to tease you.

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.150
Then what?

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:56.400
I'll take care of any leftovers.
Now get to it!

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.910
Back in your room, you vulture!

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:00.490
What about you, Dad?

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:05.160
Never mind...

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:09.460
Who knew this family was
full of such avid rubberneckers?

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:13.710
Tsuki remained blind
to her own love of soap operas.

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.050
What should I make?

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:22.850
A bento doesn't have to be
out of the ordinary, you know.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:27.480
You can use anything as long
as you avoid raw foods that spoil easily.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:32.230
It can be your star dish--or
whatever you yourself like.

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.440
A <i>tamagoyaki</i> omelet, for sure.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.240
Yes, nice!

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.490
What a real mother-daughter conversation!
This is more fun than I'd expected!

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.160
Ooh, Hana! Hana!

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.490
Yeah?

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:51.080
"Pink Flaked Fish"
"For Bento Decoration"

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:48.160
Are you <i>sure</i> you don't
want it to be heart-shaped?

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.420
Yes. Now, please, Yanagi, be quiet.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.670
How about shredded
chicken breast instead of rice?

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:56.510
Butt out, Dad!

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:59.930
Yeah, and keep your
"advice"--I'm eating this, too!

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:02.010
I'm not <i>making</i> any for you!

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:03.300
Aw...

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.850
Fine! I'll make enough for everybody!

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:07.430
Yesss!

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:14.110
I've gotta hand it to you, Mom.
Making bento is hard work.

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:19.110
No, Hana. I don't have
everyone getting in my way.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.410
Hey.

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:26.580
Brrr...

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:30.000
So why'd you want to see me here--

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:37.050
I made lunch. Just... on a whim.

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:39.720
This is... this one's yours.

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:45.430
Um... er... uh...

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:50.140
What gives?
She's cooked for me plenty before...

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:54.270
This is... kind of...

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:57.150
Crap--is that my heart thumping?

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:00.780
I-I mean... sorry--I--

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:05.320
What is this? What is this--what <i>is</i> this?

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.580
Thanks.

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:11.620
Well, I'll just be going.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.170
Huh? What for?

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:15.960
Look, it's fine.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:19.590
You can eat that where no one can see you.

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:22.260
What, is the dining hall no good?

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.260
It's fine!

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.180
You're used to eating alone, aren't you?

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:29.470
That's not true!

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:33.440
I actually made myself a lunch, too...

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.230
Want to eat together?

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.450
Man, it's cold...

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:47.620
What's wrong with the dining hall, anyway?

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:58.790
Wouldn't want anyone to
see us eating matching lunches.

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:01.260
Oh... huh.

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.760
That would make sense,
yeah, if they're both the same!

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.430
Why didn't <i>I</i> realize that?

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:13.810
Turns out I didn't have a lot
of time to make them different.

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:16.520
Sorry.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.730
Oh, hey: Drinks are on me, then.

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:21.190
Thanks.

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:23.990
It... It's going great!

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:27.160
How can this be happening?

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:31.830
Right--turns out they're
<i>both</i> middle-schoolers.

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:35.000
Glad it turned out well this time.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.080
Now for Itsuhito Sakaki's smooth exit.

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:41.500
Meanwhile, Fujio Uzaki...

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:42.840
Get a load of this!

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.590
My daughter made this for me.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.050
Check it out!

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:47.340
Isn't this amazing?!

"November 2"

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.390
Mr. Uzaki...

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:51.470
This is not your lunch break.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:55.640
Please put away your lunch
and get back to work.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:00.230

bento, irritated his workplace senior.

"Asia CafÃ©"

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:06.200
I did a great job giving Senpai his lunch!

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.240
How do you like my raw talent <i>now</i>, huh?

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.660
Nice!

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:11.120
"November 3"

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:12.990
Keep it up.

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:16.830
They'd get together faster
if it weren't for this nonsense...

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.010
Almost there!

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.260
Aw, <i>man</i>!

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.970
That was a great race!

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:38.100
You move well now
that you've got the hang of it.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:41.860

new game with me, Yanagi.

--Why don't I cook one of your favorite meals tomorrow? What would you like?

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:53.030
Gratin!

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:58.160
She may be my sister and all,
but she shows love in a warped way.

"Asia CafÃ©"

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.870
Your senpai likes gaming, too, doesn't he?

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:05.420
Yeah, but he always
goes for one-player titles.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:08.260
I've gotta introduce him
to this kind of game, too.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.880
Huh.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.300
Sure wish I could meet him!

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:13.600
No way.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.020
Oh, right. I've got a report to write.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:18.430
Aw, Hana! You always do this.

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:22.060
C'mon, Hana! Aw, c'mon!

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:26.110
There she goes, running off again.
Such a hardhead.

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:29.070
Why does she hate the idea so much?

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:34.580
Whatever her reasons,
if Hana's gonna stay clammed up,

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.620
I've got an idea of my own.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:40.500
Oh, my--you're all smiles!
What is it, Yanagi?

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.500
Right, Mom?

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:50.420
I overslept!

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:55.140
Oh, Yanagi! You're up early
for a Sunday. Heading out?

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.310
Well, you know.

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:57.470
Nice!

00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:58.890
You've got work?

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:00.730
Yep! See you later!

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:02.350
Bye!

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:11.820
Now, then...

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:18.910
Time to head out!

Welcome!

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.380
Hello.

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:38.140
Hi, I'm Uzaki's little sister Yanagi.
Thanks for everything you do for her.

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:39.430
Well, well!

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:42.180
Y-Yanagi?! I thought you were heading out!

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:44.230
Yeah, I was.

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:45.480
I did.

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:48.190
How did you...?

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:50.570
I asked Mom.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:57.410
Don't go blaming her--I only
asked her where you worked.

00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:02.040
It's fine, right? Not like
I quizzed her about your senpai.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.620
Go home!

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:08.500
Hey, now. Don't be chasing off
your sister when she's come all this way.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:12.920
The morning rush just ended,
so you can take your time and relax.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.470
Sit anywhere you like.

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:17.340
He's huge... must be him!

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.310
It's just, um, you know...

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:23.730
I don't like having friends
and family watch me work--

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.640
"November 29"

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:26.900
I get all flustered,
and it's hard to do my job!

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:32.570
Feels like I've said the
exact same thing to someone...

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:33.740
At any rate,

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:38.280
I'll handle clean-up;
you wait on your sister.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.740
Thanks...

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:46.870
I kinda figured you had
some kind of reason

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:51.380
for suddenly taking this job
your second year of college...

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:52.920
Was I right?

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:01.060
One hot cafÃ© au lait, boss.

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.510
Got it.

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:07.100
What's wrong?
You were fine when Ms. Tsuki came.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:08.060
"Lousy Cat Wants to Hang Out!"

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:08.940
"Ms. Tsuki"...

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:10.480
What?

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.360
Nothing.

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.740
Look, she can be a real handful.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.610
What is it?

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:21.330
Just... you have a little sister.

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:23.040
What's wrong with that?!

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.410
I'm not messing with you or anything.

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:30.540
You look after me,
worry about me in weird ways,

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.250
even fuss over me sometimes--

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:35.920
and now I know why.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.180
It's like... I get it now.

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:43.180
What's <i>that</i> about?

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:45.680
Huh... so you're a big sister.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.190
Are you <i>sure</i> you're not messing with me?

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:51.360
I'm sure. I'm an only child, see?

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.070
I don't know the trials
of being an older sister.

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:55.360
How about that...?

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:56.610
You're totally messing with me.

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:58.450
I am not.

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:01.320
Really?

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.030
Yes, really.

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:09.420
Your cafÃ© au lait's ready.

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:12.380
Thanks!

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:18.090
As long as I keep Senpai far away
from her, I can make it through this day.

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:22.640
If I serve Yanagi... and guard him...

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.180
Then I'll grill her back home.

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:28.180
Here's your cafÃ© au lait!

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.270
Hey, can your senpai serve--

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:33.400
Your table's been assigned to <i>me</i>.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:37.530
I will <i>not</i> let those
two have a conversation.

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:39.820
C'mon, Uzaki.

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:45.330
You forgot to give her a hot towel--and
after she came here in this cold.

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:46.620
Here you are.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:51.210
Thank you very much!
My fingertips were cold.

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:53.710
Why are you just
earnestly doing your job?!

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:56.340
You're mad at me for being thoughtful?

00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:00.840
Oh, would you be Hana's senpai, then?

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:02.720
Can we talk for a moment?

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:03.890
Yanagi!

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:08.470
Sure, why not?
We don't have any other customers.

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:10.180
Senpai!

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:14.100
I... I have to stop them.
At this rate, I just know...

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:20.030
Hana's told me so much about you.
I wanted to see you for myself!

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:20.900
Is that so?

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:23.200
Senpai, Senpai! You have work to do!

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:24.990
Nah, I'm caught up.

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:26.200
Dammit!

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:29.330
For as much as you suck at cooking,
you sure are quick to tidy up!

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:33.620
I can never tell if you're
complimenting me or mad at me...

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:36.420
How old are you, Mr. Senpai?

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.800
Twenty-one. And you, miss?

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:39.920
Eighth grade.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.840
Huh! You're more put-together than Uzaki--

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.090
I was sure you were
at least in high school.

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:48.010
--Um...
--Wow, really?

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:49.060
Absolutely.

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.890
Well, we better be getting back...

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:55.440
Oh, right: I heard you play
a lot of games, Mr. Senpai.

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.690
Actually, so do I!

00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:59.530
You do?

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:00.900
Have you played that one game?

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:01.990
Which one?

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:12.250
That opening cutscene was so darn long.

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:13.580
It really was!

You don't have to call me "miss."

You can call me by
my first name. It's Yanagi.
