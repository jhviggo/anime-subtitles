00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.900
By his third day as a member,

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:12.570
former athletic-club kid Sakurai
was fitting right in at the gym.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.070
Immersing himself in training let him
shake off the day's smaller worries

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.740
and clarify his thoughts.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.410
One of those worries?

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.960
Okay, Shinichi?

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.790
Gotta go harder.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.460
"Thinking about another
cooking lesson next week. OK?"
"I'll check with Mom (Read)" "Thanks"

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.800
I haven't seen Senpai much these days...

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.770
"Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!"

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.940
"Episode 6:
Uzaki-chan Wants to Celebrate!"

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.230
Okay--next.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.030
You sure are full of energy, Sakurai.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.900
Are you letting your sore muscles recover?

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.450
Yeah.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.030
I've had a lot on my mind lately...

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.830
But after I tire myself out here,
I sleep like a log.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.080
You're still young for
that monk-in-training stuff.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.420
Speaking of worries...

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.170
Fuji... is it?

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.510
Ah, Sakurai!

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.630
Need a spotter?

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.680
If you would, please.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.930
He wants to go hard enough
to chase his worries away.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.930
Something bothering you, Sakurai?

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.650
Let me guess: A woman, right?

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.690
I wouldn't fret about <i>that</i>.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.940
You're sharp, you're in
shape--they'll come to <i>you</i>.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.160
It's just like Fuji,
sticking his nose all the way in there.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.160
Sorry, Sakurai.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.000
If it's advice you're after,
we've got plenty of "life senpai" here.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.920
Myself included, of course!

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.670
Speaking of worries: My eldest daughter...

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.380
Seems there's this guy she likes.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.850
<i>Now</i> who's looking for advice?

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.220
You can't discuss
that daughter stuff here.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.440
I just want to vent to my senpai, okay?!

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.730
So <i>you're</i> the one
who wanted help all along.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.110
I mean... we'll hear you out.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.570
How old's your daughter?

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.570
Twenty--she's in college.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.530
About your age, Sakurai.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.530
Huh...

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.580
Then she's an adult,
and you should butt out.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.370
I get that you're worried, though.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.540
No way! These days,
you're still a child at 20!

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.380
That's--

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.420
You're the same generation, Sakurai;
what's your take?

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.340
Well, let's see...

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.260
Twenty does look
different on different people.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.430
Still, I think anyone--me included--who
can't behave like a proper adult

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.310
even after they've
reached the age of majority

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.230
is still a child--no matter their age.

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.360
You go, Sakurai!

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.240
S-Sorry. That was impudent of me.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.200
No, no, not at all.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.410
So, uh, your daughter and this guy
she likes... how far'd they go?

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.290
About that...
Seems they haven't gone <i>anywhere</i>.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.590
They're not at a stage
where you'd worry, then?

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.010
I don't really know myself...

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.130
To hear my daughter tell it,
he's her senpai at school,

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.680
and they've known each other a while.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.510
Seems she hangs out
at his place on the regular.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.390
To top it all off,
she even cooks for him--

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.270
but he still hasn't made a single move.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.690
What the hell?

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.030
Are you sure you can take
your daughter at her word, Fuji?

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.490
She couldn't be fibbing?

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.240
No--I'm sure. When she lies,
she glances to the right.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.200
He even knows his daughter's quirks.
What an annoying dad.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.000
But if they do all that together
and he hasn't made a move...

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.540
There's really only one answer.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.380
What's that?

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.260
He's not into your daughter like that!

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.880
Nope! That can't be!

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.930
I mean, my daughter is <i>super</i> cute!

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.680
Subjective much?

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.930
I'd say Fuji's the one
with a credibility issue.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.900
No, I don't! That is a <i>fact</i>!

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.400
So this boyfriend of hers...

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.980
If we assume he <i>is</i> into your daughter,

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.110
wouldn't it be <i>good</i>
that he hasn't made a move?

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.830
He's been a gloomy loner
ever since high school.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.950
Look, he's so pitiful, I'm doing
him a favor by paying him attention!

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.710
You <i>love</i> him!

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.170
Giving my little girl the cold shoulder...

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.170
I don't know whether
to curse him or praise him.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.630
This guy is such a pain.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.220
What do you think, Sakurai?
As her contemporary.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:15.390
I can't really say since I don't know
what kind of guy this boyfriend is,

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:16.520
but if it were me...

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.520
If a girl I liked came over,

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.980
I wouldn't move too quickly
if she were important to me.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.480
Sakurai...

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.150
You're so... pure.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.700
But this is good!

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.080
It's good...
that you have a girl you like.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.540
Could we please move on?
That was an example--a what-if!

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:45.050
So your daughter is important to this guy.
That's all right, isn't it?

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.050
I wonder...

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.430
Sure would be nice, though.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.340
Wonder what he's like?

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.680
Yeah, what kind of guy could he be?

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.520
Well, I won't know without meeting him!

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.930
Back to work.

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.060
That's right--could you spot me on squats?

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.610
You got it!

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.400
He's cheered up for now, anyway.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.360
Sure has.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.120
You know, you talk
really well for your age.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.660
I am? No one's ever said that before.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:22.370
The beta-endorphin and noradrenaline
secreted during intense training

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:26.300
are said to provide a psychological boost.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.590
Though he trained hard
in his athlete years,

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:34.470
the introverted Sakurai rarely
let that side of himself show.

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.720
But the personal skills
gained from two years

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.560
of earnest work in a customer-facing job

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.440
and the exhilaration
of moving his body again

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.400
began to mesh together like two gears,

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.440
and Sakurai started facing
brand-new changes within.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.740
"Senpai, how's Thursday? (Read)"
"Got it--I'll check"
"Senpai, we on for tomorrow?"

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.030
Still unread.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:58.700
I don't <i>think</i> he's working today...

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.330
Want to play a game, Hana?

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:03.870
Not today.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:05.380
Aw!

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.710
How about you, Kiri? It's been a while.

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:11.920
Forget it. There's no way I can beat you.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.890
It's okay--I'll go easy on you.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.300
That's the part I don't like!

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:27.980
Did he find another hobby
he could lose himself in--alone?

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.820
"Senpai, we on for tomorrow? (Read)"
"Sorry for the late reply
See you then"

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:33.570
There we go.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:37.530
"Mom & I will be waiting.
Looking forward to it."

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:40.240
Ooh, must be that senpai of yours!

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.540
N-Nuh-uh!

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:46.750
When Hana Uzaki lies,
she glances to the right.

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.550
This is paradise...

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:55.590
Aw, c'mon, Hana! Please?

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:59.850
I wanna see your senpai, too, Hana!

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.890
He's not a display piece, you know!

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:04.480
Dummy! You'll stretch it out!

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.610
Besides, he's not
that interesting to look at.

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:12.070
He's sullen, has menacing eyes...

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:13.740
But you love him, don't you?

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.410
<i>He</i> loves <i>me</i>! Senpai loves <i>me</i>!

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:20.530
Mom! Senpai said he's coming tomorrow!

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:25.160
Mom! Mom! Take a picture
of Hana's senpai for me, please!

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.370
Ignore her, Mom!

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:30.790
No banging around in the changing room!

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.420
Then can I take tomorrow off school?

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.590
Of course not!

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:38.300
And stop talking like your father!

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.970
Oh, and Hana, about tomorrow...

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.560
Mom said something came up.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.060
Oh, okay.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:53.280
Still, it came out well,
thanks to her recipe.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.240
You've gotten the
hang of cooking now, huh.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.740
By the way, Senpai...

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:03.950
You've been over a fair number of times
since you started those cooking lessons.

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:06.250
I guess I have.

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:09.000
Aren't you forgetting something?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Something important?

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:19.090
Right about now, Hana must be...

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:22.050
Is something wrong?

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.470
You just look so serious.

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:28.270
Do I? But... if all goes well,

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:31.190
everything will be made clear after today.

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.070
Can't ask for much more than that!

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:39.320
It's better this way.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:43.030
Those two, all alone--surely
there'll be <i>some</i> kind of development.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:47.620
And with Hana there,
Sakurai won't be looking at me.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:51.250
Forgive me, Sakurai.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.340
I can't reciprocate your feelings.

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:56.170
Dad...

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:58.630
Just let her be.

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:01.890
Father and daughter
once again read between the lines

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:05.220
as Tsuki Uzaki persisted
in her misunderstanding.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.480
Bliss--pure bliss...

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.110
Shyshka likes people--I figured
she'd be about ready.

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:18.110
But Nika's a scaredy-cat,
so she's not quite there yet.

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:21.660
Oh, one is plenty, trust me.

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.070
Thanks, Uzaki.

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.540
You know, Senpai...

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.290
You're not that gross today.

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:31.540
What's <i>that</i> mean? Am I usually gross?

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:34.040
If he's not gross, then...

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.880
What could have happened?

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.390
Uzaki!

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:46.470
Uzaki! Uzaki! Her throat's all rumbly!

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:48.720
She must be happy!

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.980
Nope: still gross. Just my imagination.

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:56.150
This is amazing...

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:57.820
Ah, whatever.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:04.570
I thought the coast would be clear...

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:05.950
Oh! Ms. Tsuki!

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.910
...but then I ran into him on my way home.

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:11.580
Thank you for that recipe.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.080
Oh! Sure--of course.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:18.880
Did today's dish turn out all right?
You must have spent a bit of time on it.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.010
Yes.

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:23.880
Oh, the cooking went off without a hitch;

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:27.050
I just stuck around after it was finished.

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:29.520
This response--can it be?

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.180
Do you mean it finally happened?

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:35.440
Wow, you noticed? That's embarrassing...

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.150
But yes. I've been
interested for a while now.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.490
And you'd stick around for <i>that</i>, for sure!

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:42.440
Right!

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.240
And today, at long last...

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.110
Yes!

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:46.620
At long last, you and Hana...

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:48.280
She finally let me!

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.580
The cat.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:57.290
She was so soft, so warm...
It was just such a joyous sensation...

00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:58.670
The cat.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:00.840
M-My goodness...

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:03.550
I did think Hana would go along with it,

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:07.300
but couldn't she have
scrubbed that rocket launch?

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:10.140
It's probably asking too much,
but one day,

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:13.100
I want to try both together,
one in each arm,

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.440
instead of one at a time.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.060
The <i>cats</i>.

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:25.990
All right, then--until next time!

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:28.570
Y-Yes...

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:37.170
A young wolf's insatiable desire...
Is there any stopping it?

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:41.340
Tsuki Uzaki's unnecessary
torment continues.

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:44.840
What should I do?

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.430
Not a darn thing!

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:48.970
"November 2"

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.890
Happy birthday, Mom!

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:55.020
Thank you!

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:57.310
So how old are you now?

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.400
Tsuki comes from a family of babyfaces.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.400
She's still a youngster!

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.240
Say, wanna try for a fourth?

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.660
Stop! How can you say that
in front of your adolescent kids?!

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:11.120
"November 3"

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:13.290
Morning!

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:16.290
Hana, Kiri--what's wrong?

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:22.460
Can I help, Tsuki?

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:26.090
Oh, Fujio... be careful.

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:28.010
Good morning, Yanagi!

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:31.180
Sorry--I overslept a little.

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:33.760
Breakfast is almost ready, okay?

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:39.980
The siblings didn't know what to do
with their faces at times like this.

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:43.570
For crying out loud.
Just because it's her birthday...

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:47.440
"Birthday"... Hang on.
Now that I think about it...

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.950
Do I not know Senpai's birthday?

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:54.240
That's definitely an "oh, crap" face.

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:56.410
"Asia Café"

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:56.750
So...

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:59.370
Why did you call me here again?

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:01.710
I <i>know</i> Sak has something to do with it.

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:06.460
Please! You must know
all of Senpai's weaknesses.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:08.550
I'm begging you--I need your help!

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:10.550
Whoa there! Calm down.

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:13.600
This could be fun. Let's hear it.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.180
What do you want to know?

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:17.100
Senpai's birthday!

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:24.190
Listen, Uzaki... do you
remember what I said earlier?

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:26.650
That you should hurry things up?

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:29.610
And you're asking about his birthday <i>now</i>?

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:32.780
Wow, he's sincerely bummed for once.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:35.530
He's remembering all his hard work.

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:38.410
It just... slipped my mind.

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:41.040
<i>We</i> know.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:45.040
Right--because we celebrated
his 20th birthday last year.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.550
Here, after closing.

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:48.300
What?! No fair!

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.260
Oh, come on.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.840
But this sudden
interest in his birthday...

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:57.180
Is this some kind of "I have to
celebrate my loner senpai" thing?

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:58.100
Adorable.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:59.270
No, it is <i>not</i>!

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:02.940
What kind of rotten woman would I be
if I let him celebrate my birthday

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:05.940
without doing anything in return?

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.940
So it's self-preservation.

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:12.360
No sense in hiding it. It's November 29.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:16.910
Yikes--that's right around
the corner! Glad I asked!

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:20.370
<i>I</i> remember it by its number pun:
"nice meat day."

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:22.330
"11/29
Nice Meat Day"

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:22.870
Didn't need to know that.

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:25.830
What would be a good present for him?

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:31.050
It ticks me off that he'll barely crack
a smile no matter what I give him.

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:32.930
Boy, you got <i>that</i> right.

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:37.050
Last year we threw a surprise party.
It didn't have quite the desired effect.

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:40.310
Oh, are you sure? Thank you very much.

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:41.890
What a blah reaction...

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:43.440
Boo.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.850
Yeah, he can be like that...

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.530
Use this. And don't tell a soul.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:59.790
And here I thought you'd washed
your hands of the whole affair...

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:01.790
Oh, so what? It's on my own time!

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.040
I'm not using the café anymore!

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:07.790
Hmm. Maybe I raised her wrong.

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:09.630
Sakakiii...

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:11.420
<i>You</i> think of something!

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:12.720
Meanie!

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:16.890
Don't you know best
what would make Sak happy?

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:24.140
Then the big day arrived: November 29.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:23.640
"November 29"

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:27.480
Happy birthday, Senpai!

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:32.400
I thought long and hard about your
present, but I just couldn't decide.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.400
You didn't have to trouble yourself.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.700
It was a real drag, so I'll just give
you everything that came to mind!

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.530
A drag?

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:42.240
First: a meal!

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:46.370
Hey, hey! You gonna carve all day?

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:48.790
Whoa! Quit setting bombs!

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.220
He's the one who did it!

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.470
Hey! That was an act of war!

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:01.390
Sorry! It slipped out. On purpose.

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:03.430
"On purpose" is right.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:08.060
"Lousy Cat Wants to Hang Out!"

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:05.680
Are you done with that volume yet, Senpai?

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.810
Five minutes and I'll be finished.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.410
Boy, was that fun!

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:26.750
So how was your 21st birthday, Senpai?

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:30.250
It didn't feel too different
from any other day...

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:32.960
But yeah--I had fun, too.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.210
I know, right?

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:37.470
Having such a cute girl
celebrating your birthday

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:41.180
is miraculous good fortune for
a socially awkward guy like you!

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:45.600
Now thank me--worship me!

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.810
Yeah, you're right. I'm grateful.

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:51.730
Well! That was sincere.

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:54.360
You had a cake for me and everything.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.700
But you really didn't
have to go to all that trouble.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:01.570
I'm getting better, but I don't
know if I can return the favor.

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:05.830
No need to fret about that--
you're the birthday boy.

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:08.410
Still, though...

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:10.370
Okay, how about this?

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:13.380
Do your best to pay me back next year--

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.550
on <i>my</i> birthday!

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:18.170
There it is.

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:22.550
The harder you try, the more
magnificent <i>your</i> birthday'll be, too.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:27.520
Plus, you get points for being
extra-nice and extra-sociable with me.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.230
Points? What points?

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:31.270
Gotta save up your Uzakimiles!

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:33.360
What kind of system is that?

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:37.280
What gives? Is it because
I've been hitting the gym?

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:40.400
That fuzziness in my head is gone.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.950
Sure, she says infuriating stuff,

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:45.950
but when you really think about it,
she's good people.

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:50.210
I feel like half of that
is her fussing over me.

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:53.750
With one thing and another,
it's fun being with Uzaki.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:56.250
She <i>makes</i> it fun.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:20:00.420
Ah, dammit.
Now I really want to return the favor.

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:03.930
I won't say so,
though--she'll get all cocky.

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.310
I'll keep that in mind.

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:09.390
In the <i>front</i> of your mind,
as a sure thing!

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:11.310
All right, all right.

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:14.650
We'll make it a regular
annual event, Senpai!

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:17.730
Yeah, okay.

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:20.820
<i>You'll</i> still be in school
the year after next, though.

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:27.790
Uzaki?

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.540
What Sakaki said earlier...

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:34.500
You might want to hurry things up.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.630
Is this why?!

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:38.880
Only a year and change left.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:42.880
What can I do with him in so little time?

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:47.300
It's so aggravating that <i>he</i> doesn't
seem to be in any kind of hurry!

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:53.020
Is he going to graduate all nonchalant,
never knowing how I feel?

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.150
And after that...

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:58.190
I'll never...

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:03.820
Se... Senpai!

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:04.740
What's up?

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:08.410
Um, well... you see...

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:10.950
The thing is... uh...

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:13.210
Having trouble saying it?

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:17.670
At this late date? You can say anything.

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:24.340
All right, then: here goes.

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:25.880
Okay.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.470
Senpai...

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:32.980
How about staying back a year?

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.650
What the hell are you talking about?!

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:41.610
Spend one more year
having fun hanging out with me!

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:43.320
As if!

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:47.110
Right now, you'll earn <i>triple</i> the
Uzakimiles if you repeat a year!

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:49.410
Oh, that's already started, has it?

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:51.580
Well, I'm not doing it!

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:53.660
Pretty please!

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.500
It was on this day that a
not-insignificant impatience

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.840
burgeoned forth within Hana Uzaki's heart.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.550
Seriously, what am I going to do?

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:39.980
"Next Time"
"Episode 7: Uzaki-chan Wants to Confess!"
