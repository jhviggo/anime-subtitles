00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.440
A surprising development greeted Sakurai

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.190
when he visited his parents
for the first time in two years.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.030
I have a baby sister?!

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.950
And the reason behind Sakurai's
solitary lifestyle was revealed.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.490
Your mom and I could get
back to getting frisky again!

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.740
You suck.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.790
"Public House"

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.960
Meanwhile, Ami and Sakaki
had invited Uzaki out for drinks.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:29.920
You know, I'd love to hear more
about you two back in high school.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.010
"Fresh Fish"               "Nipponkai Pub"
"Grilled Chicken"

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.770
"Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!"

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.730
"Episode 11: I Kind of Want
to Do Things Right Already!"

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.730
During post-club practice...

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.560
How many lessons has
Sakurai-<i>senpai</i> given me already?

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.530
How was that, Senpai?

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.160
Mmm... better than
when you started, but...

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.450
You've stopped sinking, anyway.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.750
See, with the crawl,

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.170
you just kind of have to <i>splish</i>.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.080
<i>Splish</i>?

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.420
Right. <i>Splish.</i>

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.800
Huh? Wasn't I <i>splish</i>ing?

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.630
You were <i>splosh</i>ing.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.390
<i>Splosh</i>ing?! And that's not
the same as <i>splish</i>ing?

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.810
They're pretty different.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.680
This is <i>splish</i>,

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.060
and this is <i>splosh</i>.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.650
Can't tell them apart?

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.400
I'm sorry--I'm completely lost!

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.280
Hmm... how should I put this...?

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.820
Senpai?

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.990
What's up?

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.410
Oh, it's nothing. Sorry.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.540
No, come on.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.960
Well... I feel weird telling <i>you</i>...

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.000
It's fine, really. Go ahead.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.210
Promise you won't get mad.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.340
I promise.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.340
Well, I've been thinking
for a while now...

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.770
This is the third time
you've watched me swim.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.310
You swim fast,
and your form is beautiful...

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.320
But you're really not
a great teacher, are you?

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.280
I-I'm sorry! That's so cheeky of me--

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.910
here you are teaching me and everything!

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.210
No... it's fine. I'm sorry, too.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.790
I had a feeling.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.340
Sorry. I wish I could teach you better.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.250
I've never taught anyone before.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.340
Really? Not even the other freshmen?

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.100
I haven't taught them.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.890
Everyone this year has some
experience swimming, anyway.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.430
Now that you mention it...

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.230
I didn't even start swimming
till my freshman year.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.070
And you're that fast?

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.440
I was hopeless at first, too.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.700
And it's only now that I really see
how well my seniors guided me.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.410
It's hard to teach other people...

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.160
What about me?

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.250
Why are you teaching me?

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.830
You're too dangerous
to be left on your own.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.460
It's like...

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.300
I can't stand by and do nothing?

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.090
Look,

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.470
even someone with just a year of swimming
under his belt can watch over you.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.390
I know you won't drown, at least,
so you can practice with peace of mind.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.310
You're a real nice guy, huh, Senpai?

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.900
I am?

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.900
I thought you'd be a lot scarier.
It's the eyes.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.620
Oh, no! I did it again!

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.530
I'm so sorry! Was that a sore spot?

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.620
Well, yeah... kind of.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.330
But it's okay.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.170
Sakurai-<i>senpai</i>?

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.340
If you started swimming in high school,

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.010
what was your middle-school club?

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.550
I played baseball at first,
but I quit after a year.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.510
I wasn't in any clubs after that.

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.510
Why not?

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.350
I think I just wasn't cut out for them.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:39.770
Then that kind of makes me
your first junior, doesn't it?

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.070
Yeah... I guess it does.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.320
I mean, as far as clubs go.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.530
Hmm, yes, I see!

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.030
Okay, I'm going to get
a little more practice in.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.540
Be careful.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.710
I get it now...

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.540
It occurred to me:

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.800
Senpai's bad at using anything
that's not his own body.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.260
"Fwoosh"

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.510
The more a sport is separate
from his body, the worse he is,

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.270
but all his muscle strength
and stamina make him great

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.600
at running, swimming solo,
and rock-climbing.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.820
No, when I said "I get it," I meant--

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.820
And maybe it's his
natural loner tendencies,

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.240
but he doesn't seem to be
any good at team sports.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:34.990
He said he made a mistake
picking baseball in middle school.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.210
We gotta make her talk more
while she's good and sloshed.

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.380
Any weird interjection could
disrupt this flow, so please, Ami...

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.300
Uzaki's going to notice that creepy look!
Try a slightly more normal face, please!

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.510
And wipe that drool!

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.180
Hana...

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:01.350
Today's drinks are on me,
so go on--drink up!

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.110
A pitcher of beer, please!

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.860
Hooray!

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.780
So reckless...

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.030
Stop that.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.750
It doesn't hurt much,
but still, stop that.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.830
Uh... Nodoka, was it?

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.960
Well, what do you know?
You're best buds already!

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.920
That's siblings for you.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.880
Nice babysitting!

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.470
Does this count as babysitting?

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:36.260
Isn't that nice, Nodoka?

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.560
What a sweet big brother,
playing with you!

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.440
You're taking too many pictures!

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.360
Turn more toward me.
I'll send some to you later.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.860
I'm good.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:53.240
Oh, don't worry--I'll hang
out with you, too.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.370
Huh?

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:57.530
You might get sweaty;
best to do it before your bath.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.210
Now, then...

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.920
It's been a while--

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.550
let's see just how rusty you've gotten.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.760
Show me what you've got!

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.190
Good job!

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.360
I hope they finish
before dinner gets cold.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.960
Got him at last. Now to topple--

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:45.920
High collar grip!

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:55.930
Phew! I'm beat.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:58.930
Not much has changed since high school,

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.640
though his pulling hand is more powerful.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:06.600
He moves well, too.
Must be working out a lot.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.730
Now...

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.240
Uh-oh!

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.450
Oof!

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:23.540
You panicked and put your hand out.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.040
Gotta break that bad habit.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.000
Stay one move ahead...

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.800
of the next move ahead.
Get flustered, and it's game over.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.090
Your physical ability hasn't diminished,

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:37.090
and you broke your
fall well--I'll give you that.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:41.180
But you won't get anywhere
without your intuition for the sport.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.850
Come back any time;
I'll gladly spar with you.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:48.520
Who exactly was it who tried
to get me to stay away?

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:53.530
Whoa, someone did that?
What a nasty piece of work.

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:57.360
God, Dad, you're such a jerk.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.870
You know, I've been wondering...

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:03.290
Why are you wearing
a <i>hakama</i> skirt for judo?

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:05.160
Isn't it cool?

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.410
So it's just a fashion statement.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:10.210
Here I thought you'd taken up aikido, too.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:13.170
We started wearing these
in the family dojo this year.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:14.460
Where's mine?

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.800
You don't have one. Jealous?

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.470
Dammit. Kinda.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:21.430
C'mon, up, up--no resting.

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:25.140
If you can't manage to throw me
before I throw you ten times,

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.390
I'll make you tell me
all about your girlfriend.

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:31.730
Three more throws to go!

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.780
Look, I told you, she's not my girlfriend!

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:37.650
Oh, she's not, eh?

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:44.450
So what is this not-girlfriend doing
at your place so late at night, hmm?

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:45.790
Did she spend the night?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.040
Yeah, but...

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.420
There are steps to take
before you fool around like that.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.510
No steps involved, believe me!

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:57.840
Not that.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.300
I'm suggesting she's someone
who'd readily take a bath

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.260
in the apartment of a man
who's not her boyfriend.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:09.480
She's not! There are some iffy things
about her, but she's not like that!

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.770
Not that it's your business,

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:15.980
but she comes over to hang out
because she worries about me!

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:20.610
She trusts me, as her senpai!

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:21.490
Abeshi!

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.280
You imbecile!

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:28.450
How can my son be
so frighteningly useless?!

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:31.540
A s-sneak attack...

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.210
Think about it!

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:37.210
If you don't do things right,
people are gonna <i>talk</i> about that girl!

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:42.840
He's finally getting it.
But I can't stop there.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:47.350
Two more quick throws,
and I'll have you spilling <i>all</i> the beans.

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:49.350
Here goes!

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.100
It's almost dinner time!

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.810
What are you doing?!

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:57.070
You stink of sweat.
Bath first, both of you!

00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:00.530
Now I'll have to reheat dinner.

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.030
Honestly!

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.580
I'll let you off the hook for today.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:12.000
Y'know, your mother may have had a baby,
but she's still stronger than I am.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.380
Don't get her too angry
or too worried, okay?

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:18.590
Ami...

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:20.590
Something I noticed:

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:24.930
Having water afterwards is
a big part of going out drinking.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:28.470
I get that!

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.100
Look at this girl...

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.020
What an old-man conversation.

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:39.230
Thanks for bringing her home, Ami.
Can <i>you </i>get home okay?

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:43.820
I'll be fine. I've got a taxi waiting.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.990
And I just <i>love</i> taking taxis
with other people's money!

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.160
I-Is that so...?

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.910
Well... good night.

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:53.500
Ami! Ami!

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.870
Yanagi?

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:59.460
Were there any developments
between Hana and her senpai today?

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:03.130
No... I'm afraid Sakurai didn't join us.

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:04.680
Aw, too bad.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:09.560
In the end, I just got some rather
one-sided enjoyment out of it...

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:14.600
I wish she'd lay off the
creepy eyes when she comes over.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.690
Why do you ask?

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:18.520
Well...

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.900
There's something I'd like to try.

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:23.610
Such good water...

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.860
Ow, ow, ow...

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:31.870
Uzaki...

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:37.960
If you don't do things right,
people are gonna <i>talk</i> about that girl!

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.550
Can I... perhaps...

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.060
...join you?

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:55.390
You and your papa, Shinichi?
For old time's sake--

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:57.480
Who's this "papa"?!

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.990
Go on, now!

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:11.160
You haven't been home in
nearly two years, so eat up!

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.410
But this is <i>way</i> too much!

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:16.000
That's a mother's love.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.120
Shut up and take it.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.500
"Asia Café"

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:23.000
So you and Sakurai go to the same gym!

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.880
And when I heard the café's name,
it turned out to be yours!

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.840
Small world, eh?

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.600
Do you two go way back?

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.930
Imura and I were in
the same year at school.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:37.520
The sandwiches here
are made with our bread.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.270
Though it's been years
since I've stopped by.

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:42.360
It's that kind of relationship.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.520
I see.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:48.570
Sakaki, you're Sakurai's friend, right?
How about you join him at the gym?

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.240
Hmm, well...

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.120
And I hear your back's been
giving you trouble, bossman.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.580
Nothing better than exercise
to fix that right up!

00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:00.370
It might be fun to work out
with people I know.

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:04.880
We're waiting for you!
Sakurai got used to it right away.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.840
Always with the fevered sales pitch...

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:11.470
By the way, speaking of Sakurai...

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:14.680
He's been wiping
that same spot all this time.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.390
It's okay. He does that a lot lately.

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:20.730
He's at that age. Lots to worry about.

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:26.650
But today it's more serious.

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:32.570
Well, I'm heading back.
I've got work today.

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:35.580
Just don't get sick, okay?

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:38.000
Right. I'll be careful.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.620
And I'll come back more often from now on.

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:45.790
I'd like to really throw that rotten
father of mine <i>once</i> before I graduate.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:48.880
Yeah! Do your worst!

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.020
See you later, Nodoka.

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:02.390
Shinichi?

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:04.230
<i>Do it right.</i>

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.020
Oh, shut up.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.030
What was that about?

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:10.570
It's our secret!

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:17.280
My indecisiveness is going
to cause problems for her, huh?

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.290
I never even considered that.

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:24.960
Heck, my not realizing might have
<i>already </i>screwed things up for her.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:28.000
"Do things right," eh?

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.260
But I have no idea what
I need to do to make that happen.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.010
Sakurai?

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:36.850
Fuji...

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:39.770
You've had that pained
look on your face all day.

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:45.600
I'm sorry. I've been thinking too much
and getting my head all mixed up.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:49.820
Is this about that girl
you mentioned earlier?

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:53.530
Wow, Sakurai...

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:56.450
You'd ask advice from
someone you only just met?

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:59.240
You've known us for so much longer...

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.200
And what's wrong with that?!

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.500
Besides, it's not like that.

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:06.500
I didn't ask for advice--or
say anything at all, really.

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.340
More like Fuji just
guessed what was going on.

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:12.590
It's not like I was leaving
you two out of the loop...

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.800
We were kidding. Partly.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.390
Well, in any case...

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:21.640
Sakurai, be honest:
What do you want from this girl?

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.310
What do I want?

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:28.860
A girlfriend? A lover?
Someone who'll be with you?

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:31.940
Aren't those all basically the same thing?

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:36.950
Aren't you fretting because
the status quo isn't cutting it?

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:39.780
Because you want to resolve this somehow?

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:41.990
That's what <i>I</i> think, anyway.

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:49.130
The status quo isn't working...
<i>Is</i> that what I think?

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:51.800
Solve the problem.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.130
Huh?

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:58.590
How you end up solving it is up to you.

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:02.680
But you might be able to get there
by setting aside your worries

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.600
and figuring out your goals first.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.650
My... goals?

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:12.820
Right. What do you see as
the best possible outcome?

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:16.950
Try mulling that over for a while first.

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:20.410
Then, if the problem's too hard
to solve on your own,

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:23.370
you can lean on those around you.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:28.170
You've got friends who won't
begrudge you a little help, right?

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:32.000
Everyone knows you're a good guy.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.800
We'll forgive a little
greediness on your part.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.260
Boss...

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:41.430
Thanks.

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:46.270
You really went all-in this time!

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:49.230
I thought it was your policy
not to intervene.

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:56.490
It's just that Sakurai was in such
a pickle. I figured it couldn't hurt.

00:18:56.490 --> 00:19:00.360
"Couldn't hurt"? You should
push him like that all the time!

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.700
As embarrassing as it is to admit,
I was moved.

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:04.080
Leave it to you.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.160
What an unpleasant place to work.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.000
Oh, goodness me, stop that.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.420
Though I do sort of resent having
my moment stolen by someone

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.630
who just showed up out of the blue...

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:15.250
I <i>completely</i> understand.

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:17.210
What's this, Sakurai?

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:19.590
You don't even have
to blow off steam at the gym--

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:23.010
you're already surrounded by great folks!

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:26.430
What the--?! Is he trying to
insert himself into the discussion

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.230
with a know-it-all look?

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:30.190
Sakurai,

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:34.190
you always looked so gloomy
when you came to the gym.

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:38.280
I get the feeling you'll look a
lot less weighed-down next time.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:42.950
Fuji... I hope you'll be my spotter again.

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:44.070
Sure!

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:47.450
"The Next Day"

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.790
I may not have reached any conclusions...

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:53.080
but I do feel a lot better.

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.040
I'll have to think things over.

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:57.880
That's right.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:02.890
Uzaki may have a foul mouth,
but she's good people.

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:06.350
And she's done so much for me.

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:10.810
I'll thank her for all she's done
when I see her today.

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:15.900
And I'll do my best not to be
mean or ungrateful to her...

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:17.020
Senpai!

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.610
Hey.

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:28.410
Gosh, I don't see you for a little while,
and it feels like forever.

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:29.620
Does it?

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.750
Looks like she's in a good mood, too.

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:39.710
She's all smiles... If I'm going
to thank her, now's the time.

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:42.050
Uzaki, about everything--

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:45.680
Look, I can't be bothered to beat around
the bush, so I'll just cut to the chase:

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:49.640
I <i>know</i> you don't have any Christmas plans.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:50.640
You're right.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.640
Oh, you poor thing!

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:55.480
When I picture you spending
that sacred night all alone at your place

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.980
picking at fried chicken and cake,

00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:00.070
I want to laugh and cry at the same time!

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:03.450
My girlfriends have invited me
to a Christmas party,

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:06.700
but I can turn them down
for your sake, Senpai.

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.280
And if you really, <i>really</i> want me to...

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.710
I can hang out with <i>you</i>
on Christmas instead.

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:16.830
What would you <i>do</i> without
such a kind-hearted junior, Senpai?

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:18.960
Christmas with a cute girl!

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.340
This is your big chance--it might
never come again as long as you live!

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:24.090
You'll make memories for a lifetime!

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:26.680
I win! Part 3 is over!

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:30.100
Huh? Nope: She's ticking me off.

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:31.640
Right, Senpai?

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.980
Quit coming over to my place!

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.400
Why?!

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.150
You hurl insult after insult
at me right after we meet up?

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:40.860
What even is the point?

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:43.690
Wait, Senpai, please!

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:44.780
Stop following me.

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:46.320
But, Senpai...

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.910
Quiet!

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.490
Why are they like this?

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:55.540
Senpai!

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:58.710
Please let me in!

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:00.960
--The banishment stands.
--Senpai!

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:04.670
What will come of Christmas?!

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:40.020
"Next Time"
"Episode 12: I Want to Play
on Christmas Eve, Too!"
