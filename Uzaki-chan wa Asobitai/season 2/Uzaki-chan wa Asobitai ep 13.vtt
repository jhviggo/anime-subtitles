WEBVTT

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.900
Still, that Sakurai...

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.320
Such a pure soul in that big body--

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.990
to think he'd get that bad...

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.500
I mean, he loves my daughter!

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.080
But...

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.340
We kind of missed the point of
getting him drunk, but what he said...

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.960
'Specially my dad...

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.420
They're fine bein' all over
each other right in front of me.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.050
Are things not so hot at home?

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.640
Maybe he's in some really
unfortunate circumstances...

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.900
"*Fujio's imagining"

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.020
Shinichi! Go buy me some booze, dammit!

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.310
Honey, please--stop!

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.190
Not that I've approved
his relationship with Hana,

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.860
but I can go a little easier on the kid.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.240
I'm home! Bought us some more provisions.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.160
What the--?

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.420
What the heck is going on here?!

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.460
You have to be more gentle, Hana.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.720
That's right, Hana. Handle him with care!

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.350
Okay. I'll strip him gently.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.100
No! That's not the
"going easier on him" I had in mind!

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.740
"Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!"

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.990
"Episode 13: I Want to Hang Out
Together Next Year, Too!"

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.240
A half-hour before
the hellscape Fujio witnessed...

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.120
Senpai, that's three L's in a row!

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.670
I know you're drunk,
but you <i>super</i> suck at this!

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.540
Sorry, I suck...

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.590
Well, I'm not about
to let you get away with it!

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.180
She's an absolute demon!

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.050
--Okay, time for round four!
--Uh, hang on...

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.760
What's up?

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.230
Shouldn't you impose a little
something before the next hand?

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.150
You know... a penalty?

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.940
Indeed.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.440
Hana was also plenty drunk.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.820
Good.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.240
Yanagi wasn't especially drunk at all.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.490
So what'll it be?

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:47.530
Strip him?

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.660
Let's strip him.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.080
An instant reply.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.750
Strip him... take pictures...
sell 'em to Ami.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.800
She does seem likely
to pay good money, yeah.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.720
Drunk Hana is plenty fun herself!

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.430
My daughters have picked up
some nasty games...

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.760
I must stop them!

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.720
S-Say, you two!

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.600
I'm home! Bought us some more provisions.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.690
What the--?

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.270
And we're all caught up!

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.230
What even <i>is</i> this hellscape?!

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.200
No, Fujio--calm down!

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.950
<i>You</i> calm down!

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.240
Hana's drunk and out of control,

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.370
Sakurai's totally defenseless,

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.410
and Yanagi's engrossed in camera angles.

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.370
You should have <i>stopped</i> them!

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.750
The least I can do to make amends

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.880
is make sure his stripped
clothes don't get wrinkled.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.010
Seriously, what are you saying?!

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.010
In fact, Tsuki, too, was drunk.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.010
Can't get his pants off.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.430
Lift your knees a little there, Senpai.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.900
Stop that!

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.820
We can't hurt his poor heart
any more than it already is!

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.700
You okay, Sakurai-<i>kun</i>?

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.280
Yeah... more or less.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.830
Hana seems to have sobered up.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.000
A train's out of the
question--should I call a cab?

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.080
Sorry to trouble you...

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.960
No, not at all.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.630
I gave him too much
to drink, strategy or no.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.010
I'll go with him. You come, too, Dad.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.720
Senpai's big--if he passes out,
I'm in trouble.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.390
G-Got it.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.810
Thanks for having me...

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.320
Good night.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.610
Later, Mr. Senpai!

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.950
Are you all right, Senpai?

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.780
Yeah, fine. I don't feel sick.

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.960
You're not still mad, are you, Dad?

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.050
I'm not mad. And I'm sorry--both of you.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.390
Come hang out again,
whether at our house or the gym.

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.100
Dad!

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.890
Fuji...

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.730
I already knew he was a good guy.

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.150
Who knows what's down the road,

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.440
but Hana seems to have
enjoyed herself, anyway.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.950
I'll call it good.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.990
We got through it, Sakurai!

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.910
Okay, Dad, wait here a sec.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.380
C'mon, Senpai--you're home.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.220
Can you sleep like this for tonight?

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.890
Yeah.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:57.180
Sheesh, you really are
hopeless without me. Ha-ha.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.270
I'm sorry...

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:04.020
I'll do things right...
I really will do things right...

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.280
So I don't make trouble for you...

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:27.420
You... You can make
all the trouble you like.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.470
Uzaki...

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.560
Sen... pai...

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.520
Man, what's taking Hana so long?

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.030
Kiri...

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:54.070
Can we come over your house?

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:57.120
Absolutely not, you hear me?!

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.540
But <i>I</i> can, right, Kiri?

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.500
What's with the casual hand
on my shoulder, huh?

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:28.940
Senpai?

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.020
<i>Holy</i> crap, that startled me!

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.480
The sheer timing on that sudden collapse!

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.190
Given who Senpai is,
I'm sure it was a coincidence...

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:11.440
Still, what a shock!

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.990
Is Sakurai-<i>kun</i> all right, Hana?

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.200
He collapsed on the way to his room,
so I covered him with a futon.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:25.040
O-Oh, okay. He sure
did drink his fair share.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.710
Whose fault was that?

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.590
Busted!

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:31.250
Uh-oh.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:35.880
We've got work tomorrow.
How am I even going to face him?

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.510
"Closed"

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:45.180
Not sure I can face <i>this</i>, either.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:49.520
What's up, Ami? Did something good happen?

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.900
You could say that!

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.900
Y-Yanagi! She actually sent those?!

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.740
It's not what you think!
We were drunk, and--

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:03.080
Senpai in various states of
undress--from all different angles!

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:07.290
All I ever wanted was for you two
to have a good Christmas.

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:12.040
I couldn't be more grateful for the
magnificence you've shared with me.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.960
It's not much, but...

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.170
She's actually paying?!

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:20.970
Ami, shouldn't someone
who wants her own cafÃ© someday

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:25.270
think a little harder about
how she uses her money?

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:28.480
I suppose...

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.690
It <i>really</i> isn't much once
you give Yanagi her share.

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:33.150
<i>That's</i> how you think?!

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.610
See, Hana, the thing is...

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:39.740
It's not money I like--it's
increasing profits.

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.830
I like efforts to boost performance.

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:49.870
I do think it's important
to use money in the right way.

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:51.710
Keeps the ol' economy running.

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:56.960
And shelling out for Senpai's underwear
shots is the right way to spend money?

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.840
Yes, it is.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.630
Not the slightest hesitation!

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:05.560
Therefore, I'm free to
spend money on whatever I like!

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.770
My tastes and my wanting
to show my gratitude

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:11.600
are two entirely separate
issues--in two different genres!

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.110
So here!

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:15.820
I know you're insisting, but I can't!

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.150
And... is there even <i>more</i> now?

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.740
I forgot Sakurai's share.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.410
Now that's being <i>too</i> conscientious!

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.490
Good morning!

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:30.460
Why all the shouting, Uzaki?

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.710
S-Senpai...

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:35.960
Hey, Uzaki...

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.250
Y-Yes?

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:39.670
About yesterday...

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:45.220
My memory's a total blank.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.140
Did I... do anything?

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:52.850
If I did something untoward, or--

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:01.360
What the hell?! How did <i>this</i> happen?

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.240
You did all that,
and you still don't remember?

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.120
Not that I'm one to talk.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.580
I really don't remember a thing!

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.660
Wait--seriously, what even <i>is</i> this?

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.370
All these angles of me being undressed?!

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:16.750
Not this same old shtick again!

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:18.840
How does he think <i>I</i> feel?

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:23.720
I might actually be better off
not remembering this...

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:27.260
Would it jog your memory to reconstruct
the scene by stripping right here?

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:28.850
I'm good.

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:32.310
Ugh!

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:37.560
"Closed"

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:35.100
Shall we get the cafÃ© ready for opening?

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.480
Oh, right.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.650
Okay.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:42.070
I guess... if he doesn't remember...

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:45.530
Well, that's a bit of a relief.

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:48.660
So we're back to normal, then?

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.870
Senpai?

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:54.870
What are you doing for New Year's?

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:59.920
Oh, right. Itsuhito suggested
we all do the first shrine visit together.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.170
Hey, nice!

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:05.010
Yeah... it is.

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:11.350
I'll get in touch with Itsuhito, then.

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:12.890
Thanks!

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.900
Well, see you later, Senpai.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.020
Yep. Take care.

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:10.120
Like I could have forgotten <i>that</i>...

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:16.040
This year went by in the blink of an eye.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.790
Probably because, unlike last year,
I spent the whole time

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:23.550
hanging out with you
to keep you from being a loner--

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:28.090
What gives, Senpai?
Why are you staring at my face?

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:33.600
Hey, Senpai, why are you
still wiping that same spot?

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:37.350
This is our last day of work this year.
Do it right, would you?

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:42.980
Well, Senpai... Happy New Year!

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:46.990
Oh, but I'll see you again
tonight for the shrine visit.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.290
Ow...

00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:01.540
That was awful.
You're less focused than last time.

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:04.420
It's even more of
a brute-strength judo now.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:08.300
Like you want to lash out at
someone--doesn't matter who.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.390
Something on your mind again, eh?

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:15.350
Like... I know:

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:20.270
the girl you'd dragged
into your room, maybe?!

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.770
So infuriatingly perceptive.

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:25.610
<i>This</i> is why I hate coming home!

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:28.400
You'll never inherit
the dojo doing stuff like that.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.110
I wouldn't inherit it,
anyway--I don't have the chops.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:35.950
I'm just exercising here because
my gym's closed for New Year's.

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:37.830
Why, you little...

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:42.580
I mean, I did know you
weren't big on judo and all.

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.960
Hell, I just inherited it
from your mom's family.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.760
I wasn't what you'd
call enthusiastic about it.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.180
But teaching li'l
munchkins isn't half bad!

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.680
They're all like, "Sensei, Sensei!"

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.550
Doesn't sound like you.

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:59.020
It'd sure make the job-hunt a lot easier.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.270
That <i>is</i> appealing, I admit...

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:03.270
Well, we're not there just yet.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:07.860
You'll never throw me <i>or</i> your mother
with that brute strength alone.

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:11.360
If you're looking to topple a <i>girl</i>,
though, it'd be <i>highly</i> effective!

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:17.660
This is a man who stepped on
a gigantic landmine.

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.080
Nice sneak attack...

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.830
Shut up! Such a vulgar
father--and so loud about it!

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:28.590
Still, kicking your father like that...

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:30.630
Who do you think you are?!

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:37.220
I'll show you there's no such thing
as a son who's better than his dad!

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:38.180
Shut up!

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:40.060
What's all this?

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:43.100
Fighting--and on
New Year's Eve, of all days?

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:49.230
Shinichi, don't you have plans for
a shrine visit and the first sunrise?

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:51.190
Don't blame me if you get hurt.

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:07.460
Sakurai!

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.340
Hey.

00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:11.760
Here's to another year.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.430
Happy New Year.

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:16.970
H-Happy New Year.

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:18.970
You too, Itsuhito.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:23.350
Now, the reason we
three are meeting early...

00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:25.690
You wanted to talk--privately?

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:26.980
Yeah...

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:31.690
Um... keep this among us, okay?

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:34.490
I'm looking for some advice.

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:37.910
I just happened to learn
a certain something.

00:17:37.910 --> 00:17:40.410
I've been fretting
about it alone all this time,

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:43.000
but I just can't seem to put it to rest.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.580
I have no idea where it's headed,

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:48.130
what the conclusion--or answer--could be.

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:52.670
So you're bothered by a certain something

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:56.430
you came to hear entirely unintentionally.

00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:57.760
Is that about right?

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.550
Y-Yes.

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:01.850
What'd you hear?

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:04.180
W-Well, uh...

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:07.650
That Uzaki... actually, uh...

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:09.810
...likes me... apparently.

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:15.860
Sak.

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:19.160
<i>All</i> of us knew <i>that</i>.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.120
We did.

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:23.450
What?! You did? What--<i>all</i> of you?

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:25.370
Yeah, everyone.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:28.330
Ami, the cafÃ© regulars--everyone.

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:30.540
The only one who didn't know is you.

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.590
No way!

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.920
But never mind that.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:38.550
Now that you know this big important
thing, what are you gonna do?

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.640
Do? What--I mean...

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.720
Don't give me that!

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:46.180
You probably thought you could pretend
you heard nothing and let this slide,

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.520
but you can't!

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.140
How'd you know?!

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.940
How could I <i>not</i>?

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:55.610
Sak, are you really
okay doing nothing here,

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:57.990
not even a change in attitude?

00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:59.990
Well...

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:02.870
You already have
your conclusion, don't you?

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:06.620
Bothering you so much
that you need advice--

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:10.540
you're just fishing for
a result that suits you better.

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:14.800
You can't unring that bell.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.510
The key here is what you do next.

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:20.630
No: What do you <i>want</i> to do, Sak?

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:29.230
What do I want to do?

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:31.850
It's not fair to Uzaki--

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:37.570
secretly learning how she feels,
then deciding what to do with myself?

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:39.860
Only a coward would do that!

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:43.660
Poor Uzaki! I'm better off doing nothing!

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:48.040
That's what a guy who'd actually
been <i>doing</i> something would say!

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.580
You've never done <i>anything</i>!

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:53.040
That's true!

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:59.260
Sorry to spoil the fun, but it
looks like Ami and Hana are here.

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:01.430
Let's stop there.

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:03.640
Okay...

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:08.720
There's still a lot I want to say, Sak,
but for now, I'll just say one thing.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.430
Itsuhito?

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:13.520
You have my full support.
Just say the word.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.110
Same here.

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:19.610
So, uh... good luck.

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:21.320
Thanks.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.620
I did decide to do the right thing.

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.990
I'll face this head on--no running away.

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:30.500
Senpai! Over here!

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.670
All that fretting, not being able
to talk about it with anyone...

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:44.800
I'm sorry I'm so pitiful,
only taking action after I'm told to.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.720
I apologize for being so unfair.

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:53.310
Here's to another great year, Senpai.

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:54.770
Yeah.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:59.610
I've thought and thought about this,
and there's only one answer:

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:04.820
You okay, Uzaki?

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:09.200
I'll save our spot;
you go warm yourself up.

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:12.200
Aren't <i>you</i> being nice.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.330
I-I am not, either!

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:16.580
Why are you mad?

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:22.920
I want to have
the confidence to tell you...

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.930
Here it comes! Senpai, Senpai!

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:27.140
Look: the first sunrise!

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:28.550
Yeah...

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.520
...that I like you.

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.360
S-Senpai?

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.570
U-Uzaki...

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:45.700
Y-Yes?

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.820
I, um... I...

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:57.920
No, not yet.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:01.920
We've still got lots of hanging-out to do!

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.470
Yeah!

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:10.050
"Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!"

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:08.510
We'll hang out tons
this year, too, Senpai!
