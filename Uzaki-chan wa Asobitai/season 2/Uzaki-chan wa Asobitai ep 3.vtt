00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.190
"School Festival"

00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:03.520
Okay, over here!

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.190
"Okonomiyaki"      "Candy Apples"

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.310
Sure thing! Hold it steady, okay?

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.440
--Seriously?
--Is this how many we have?!

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.860
Wow!

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.780
Senpai! Senpai!

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.070
I <i>know</i> you're all alone.
I'll make the rounds with you!

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.120
Man, the things I gotta do!

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.950
I'm not going to the school festival.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.370
What?!

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.760
"Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!"

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.510
"Episode 3: Does Uzaki-chan
Want to Go to the School Festival?"

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.300
What's wrong? It's the rare college event!

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.880
Do introverts seriously hate festivals?!

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.100
Who are you calling an introvert?

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.390
It's not that I <i>hate</i> festivals,
it's just...

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.720
Look, hear me out.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.850
No, don't bother. You're just going to
hole up at home, playing video games.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.770
Good call!

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.150
They released way
too many games last month.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:21.030
Sometimes I think you're a
very special type of idiot, Senpai.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.750
Aw, man! Still buying all
the new time-sink titles, huh?

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.870
Which is why I'm taking 3 days off:
the festival and the day after.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.090
I'll take the opportunity
to make some real progress.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.880
And yet somehow you
deny being an introvert.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.720
Besides, school festivals...

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.300
I don't hate them, but I have
no reason and no obligation to go.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.600
"Obligation"?

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.930
None of my friends have
exhibits or booths this year,

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.690
and I'm not really into the pop idol
or comedy performances.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.530
I figure I'm better off at home,
immersing myself in my hobby.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.360
You're calculating the losses
and gains for a school festival--

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.910
you haven't noticed?

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.530
Noticed what?

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.540
This is hopeless.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.460
When he decides something,
he goes through with it.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.290
So many snap decisions--and all terrible!

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.590
Playing games takes precedence
over the school festival.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.010
And he's in <i>college</i>!

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.630
He's almost a total failure!

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.640
Well, if he's not coming,
maybe I should take time off, too.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.270
Okay--

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.890
can I come to your place
on the festival days, then?

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.850
I'll cook for you.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.020
Really?

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.780
They never change, do they?

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.200
Hey. Got a second?

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.870
Hey! You look tired.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.990
Hiya.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.620
What are you two doing about the festival?

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.580
Not going.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.040
It's a surprise three-day break!

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.920
I figured as much.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.750
Oh.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.420
I'm actually helping out with
the organizing committee this year.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:03.630
You are?

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.300
No kidding! Is it hard work?

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.180
It's a real pain, as it turns out.
Takes up a lot of my time.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.440
That's because you're such a people
person. You can't say no, am I right?

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.900
You got it.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.110
Which is why I have to
get you two involved, at least.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.940
Huh?

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.530
Oh, something a
committee-member friend asked me.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.870
"What should we do
to increase attendance?"

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.710
They decided to go with my idea,

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.960
but now I'm stuck helping out because
I'm the one who suggested it.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.540
What was your idea?

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.420
This right here.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.750
"Vendor Stamp Rally"

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.800
"Vendor Stamp Rally"
"Collect stamps at booths
for a chance to win great prizes!" "*500 yen = 1 stamp"

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.920
A stamp rally?

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.720
Yep. You get a stamp for every
500 yen spent at a given booth.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.560
Each stamp gets you
one entry in the lottery we'll hold

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.140
on day 2 of the festival.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.900
If your ticket's chosen,
you win a fabulous prize.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.690
A lottery, eh?

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.400
"Fabulous"--sure you can aim that high?

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.990
Ah, less interested now
that you've dismissed them

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.070
as school-festival-grade prizes?

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:11.580
I'll just clue you in on the prizes
we'll be announcing tomorrow.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.830
Let's see here...

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.000
A DC6-Pro?!

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.170
The console of my dreams! Gimme!

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.130
You've got some pricey prizes in here.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.420
It was a real mess, let me tell you.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.300
I wound up supervising
the entire stamp rally.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.430
I'm keeping my mouth shut from now on.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.820
Wanna go after all?

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.570
Where'd <i>that</i> come from?

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.860
I mean, you want that prize, right?

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.160
There's no telling if we'll win, but the
more people, the better our chances.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.410
Are you sure?
Didn't you want to hole up at home?

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:00.380
It's fine. Now I've got
a reason <i>and</i> an obligation.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.380
We'll load up on those stamps.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.050
Yeah! We can hang out
at the school festival!

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.890
Good! I'm glad you've decided to go.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.550
Now for a word of advice:

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:18.270
The most efficient stamp-gathering
starts at the most expensive booths.

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.730
I recommend the occult club.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.270
Not only are their fortunes priced high,

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.280
word is they're authentic
and pretty accurate.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.360
Well, I'm gonna be on my way.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.700
Right. See you.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.160
You two enjoy the heck out
of your school-festival date.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.540
Later!

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.210

"School Festival"

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.890
Hell of a turnout, all right.

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.020
Please don't make that face.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.230
They'll think you're a hoodlum
come to collect protection money.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.690
What, at a school festival?

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.980
Where'd you learn about that, anyway?

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.150
"The Tiger Eats God"

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.860
In that game of yours, <i>The Tiger Eats God</i>.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.990
"Kamubuki-cho Ichibandori"

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.700
Oh. So that's where.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.780
Hand over the protection money, dumbass!

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.080
Let's just get those stamps
and head back home.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.170
Hey--is this...

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.640
Great job, Senpai!

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.350
But of course!

was talking about.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.440
There's a good-sized line.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.490
I'm a little beat from
running all over the place--

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:54.660
how about we line up here
and rest for a while?

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:58.330
Yeah, sure.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.290
Is there a particular kind
of fortune you want told?

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.830
Mmm, not especially.

Let's see...

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:21.100
I'll ask them to find me
a pet-friendly place

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.100
that's near a station
and a convenience store.

--Oho!
--Right?

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:37.030
Are these people looking
at us a lot or what?

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:39.330
They sure are.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.790

I'd heard it was authentic and all...

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.600
It's got that real-deal feel.

As it turns out, my fortunes
got rave reviews last year,

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.240
so I'm back again this year.

her about, Senpai? <i>Not</i> apartments.

--Apartments?
--Well...

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:44.140
I'll be job-hunting next
year--something along those lines?

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.140
Huh?

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:48.770
Um... didn't you know?

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:49.810
Know what?

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:53.650

tells romance fortunes.

Shall we try somewhere else?

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:08.290
Yeah.

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:09.460
Huh?

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.880
Sorry, Ito.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.210
Sorry. We'll get out of your way.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:15.460
What? No!

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.050
Now just hold on!

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:20.260
Where'd they all come from?!

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.640
It's true: Some guys try
to escape at the last second.

No cold feet allowed.
This is how we do things here.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:32.060
I'm sorry--we didn't realize
when we came in.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:37.320
Can we ask for a stamp without
getting a reading? We'll pay you!

What?! Who even <i>are</i> you? No way!

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:43.870
I <i>despise</i> selfish children like you!

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:47.330
Your bodies are grown,
but you're still mentally a child!

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:52.540
Worst of all, you strung along
our most promising newcomer!

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:56.510
Once you're in here,
you <i>will</i> let us tell your fortune!

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:58.220
This is tyranny!

00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.340
You shut up!

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:02.050
People are waiting--get
your fortune told already!

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:05.260
Go on, Ito! Go ahead and give it to them!

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:06.850
I-It's not that simple.

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:10.730
I haven't even asked
Sakurai his birthday yet.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:12.940
I'm so sorry. This is the occult club--

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:17.150
the senior members can be
so serious about fortunes.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.530
Let's just have our fortunes told, Senpai.

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.080
We're just wasting time if we resist--

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.910
and causing problems
for the folks in line.

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:32.830
All right, then...

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.500
Whoa...

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.130
She said "whoa."

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:42.130
Keep your reactions inaudible,
at the very least.

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.050
I'm done.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:47.850
I can't tell--how did it go?

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:51.270
Well, fortunes are fortunes, after all...

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:54.270
They don't determine individual opinion.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:57.730
You could say it all depends
on how the couple feels.

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:01.360
What's with the long preface?
Is it that bad?

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.530
It's eye-poppingly good!

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:05.700
"Eye-poppingly"?!

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.580
This is a little dicey, all right...

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.200
It is?

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:14.000
Out of everyone I've seen this past year,
no one's been a more perfect match!

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.290
This card indicates
that you two just click!

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:19.550
This one represents mutual trust!

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:25.340
This is a stable future! This one
means you're the perfect couple!

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:28.220
So you really <i>can</i> get
all these cards at once!

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.850
Uh-oh. Ito's going full-throttle.

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:34.350
Oh! But...

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:38.900
I heard that you two aren't even dating.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.400
I see...

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.530
And you're <i>so</i> compatible, too.
What a waste.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.780
Why <i>aren't</i> you dating?

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:50.290
B-B-B-Beats me!

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:52.250
Usually I only see women.

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:54.750
It's so rare for a couple
to come in together

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:58.340
that I figured you were past
the whole fortunes thing!

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:02.090
I'm sure everyone in line
thought the same thing.

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:04.300
You should just date already!

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.140
You're really just
so amazingly compatible!

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:10.390
And then you were asleep
in each others' arms on campus--

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:13.230
Okay, Ito, that's quite enough.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:14.810
It's overkill!

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.560
Chin up...

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:26.610
Tell me: Was that a true reading?
Unscripted?

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:29.070
It was the real thing.

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:33.450
Don't worry--Ito doesn't
really do lip service.

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:36.000
Really. That's good to hear.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.670
Thanks for letting this non-member in.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:40.210
Happy?

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:45.920
Ecstatic!

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.090
Oh, uh... okay.

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:51.890
Well, I'm off to tail those two.

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:55.180
Thanks again! Bye!

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:58.400
Bye! See you at the café!

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.440
How was it?

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.740
Good enough to nearly knock me
off my feet more than once.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.700
Thank goodness.

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:15.000
Me, I've already collapsed.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.910
Get home and sleep, then.

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:21.920
I can't leave yet. There's so
much post-event clean-up.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:25.380
How... did I...

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:29.180
I'm not even... on the committee...

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:33.260
Well, good job.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:37.890
When I first heard about this plan,
I thought it was unnecessary.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:41.110
"Step 1: Invite Uzaki & Sak to the festival.
Stamp rally (Sakaki): Great prize"

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:41.730
But to be able to see all that...
I can't complain.

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:45.110
"Step 2: Uzaki & Sak come to the festival.
--> Occult club:
Romance fortune (Asai sneaks in)"

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:45.400
Having their romance fortune told?
Like I'd miss <i>that</i>!

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:51.700
Still, blowing everything on the lead-up
and missing the big show is sad indeed.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:54.540
Props for putting up a good fight.

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:59.420
Job well done. May you be at peace.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.670
Rats!

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:05.750
I lost them...

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:12.010
Are you calmer now?

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:16.020
Yeah... sorry. I didn't know it
was... that kind of thing.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:19.640
'Course not. It's fine, really.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:23.400
Thinking about it now,
I bet that was one of Sakaki's traps.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.480
A little late, if you ask me.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:30.570
Yeah... I can see that.

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:33.530
Damn...

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:36.490
I can't look at Uzaki's face.

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:40.330
Did that reading open her eyes somehow?

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.540
You and me...

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:46.250
What do you think about us
being so compatible?

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:54.140
What kind of question is that?
How should I answer?

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:59.730
Well, uh... it sure beats
being <i>in</i>compatible... right?

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.990
Eh, I wouldn't think about it too much.

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:16.910
Fortune-telling is basically
just a game for us girls.

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:19.080
Oh... okay.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.420
How the couple feels, huh?

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.260
The grand prize winner!

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.050
Yesss!

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.260
I should have made her tell
my lottery fortune instead.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.770
It's two days after the fortune-telling;

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:46.270
there are no classes as the
festival booths are coming down.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:51.530
It's a welcome day off for those
students who didn't run booths,

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:54.820
but Sakurai was still preoccupied.

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:59.080
Man, what's going on?
I'm flat-out exhausted.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.830
I still can't get that out of my head.

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:04.370
It's eye-poppingly good!

00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:06.830
And you're <i>so</i> compatible, too.

00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:09.420
Why <i>aren't</i> you dating?

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:15.630
If it's up to the couple,
why don't you just butt out?

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:19.100
That wasn't the only thing
bothering Sakurai...

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.390
Why was Uzaki making that face?

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:32.740
Well, <i>she</i> doesn't seem too concerned.

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:36.570
Hey, is there any way I can help?

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:38.410
No, not really.

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:40.990
Nabe is just cutting stuff up
and simmering it.

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:42.330
Oh, okay.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:46.290
Besides, you're not a good
enough cook to help out yet.

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:49.590
I'm actually better off alone.

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:55.050
You can set the table, Senpai.
It's almost ready.

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:56.260
Got it.

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:03.310
Yeah, she's not worried.

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:06.850
She <i>did</i> say fortunes are just a game.

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:11.110
She came here to cook
for me, too... I feel bad.

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:14.110
All right: <i>I'm</i> not going
to fret anymore, either.

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:16.740
Just be your everyday, natural self.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:18.320
Like Uzaki.

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:22.490
That was not the case.

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:24.450
In contrast to the bewildered Sakurai,

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:28.420
Uzaki was in such high spirits
that even <i>she</i> didn't notice.

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:31.790
Look out! Hot food, comin' through!

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:34.300
It had been about
five years--since high school.

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:38.720
Though she hadn't considered their
compatibility over their long relationship,

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.550
it had now received a seal of approval,

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:44.520
which put Uzaki in a fantastic mood.

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:49.310
But her interpretation
differed slightly from Sakurai's.

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:51.770
If we're so compatible,

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:55.780
that must mean
Senpai <i>really</i> needs me around.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.440
Emotional bias!

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.450
This variety of cognitive bias

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:04.240
means we prefer--and accept--the
data that's most convenient for us.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:08.960
Guess I'll keep paying attention to him,
so he doesn't get lonely!

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:05.620
"Emotional bias"

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:08.620
"Emotional bias"
"Cognitive bias"

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:13.290
The fortune brought
happy news for Uzaki...

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:14.630
Let's dig in.

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:16.460
I mean, it makes sense!

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:20.970
I <i>am</i> the only woman
who gives Senpai any attention.

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:26.350
...but biased thoughts fed on
biased data, soon to run amok.

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:30.100
You know, he seemed
pretty aware of it, too.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.310
He was beet red!

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:33.560
And <i>that</i>...

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.190
Do you think Senpai likes me?

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:38.740
...is how...

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.570
He only has eyes for me!

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:42.990
...<i>this</i> happened:

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:46.620
He can't live without me!

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:51.750
A warped and self-serving conclusion
was born, within Uzaki alone.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:55.420
Hey, yeah! Me and Senpai!

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:58.960
We can't help it--we're
just so compatible!

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:03.140
Not all of it could necessarily
be chalked up to Uzaki's delusions.

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:06.010
She's smiling more than usual today.

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:08.680
Probably planning
something else infuriating.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.520
Hey, Senpai, Senpai!

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.810
Yeah?

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:16.070
Isn't there something you
wanted to say to me? Huh? Huh?

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:19.860
Thanks for cooking for me again.
I'm enjoying it.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:22.780
No, not that. Isn't there something <i>else</i>?

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:26.280
It's tasty, too, as always.
You really are a great cook.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.700
No, no, no--not that.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:31.160
Right--the cost of today's ingredients.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.330
I better pay up before I forget.

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:35.000
Oh, come <i>on</i>.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.290
Pass the ponzu.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:41.510
Still, a partner is a partner.

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:43.680
What's up, Uzaki?

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:47.010
This... moron of a man...

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:51.180
He has a <i>long</i> way to go
before he can tease <i>me</i>.

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.560
Why are you so mad all of a sudden?

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.980
What is it? Was it something I said?

00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:00.070
Tell me! I'll apologize!

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:06.200
That's right--he's an airhead.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.830
C'mon!

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:10.490
Look, just hurry up and eat, would you?!

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:12.450
Jeez, you dummy!

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:15.750
Whoa, watch out! Okay, okay--I'm eating!

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:17.420
I won't ask again.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.290
Sheesh... pretending you don't know.

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:21.710
You really are hopeless, you know that?

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:26.680
Even though I knew he wasn't
the type to suddenly get all greedy...

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:30.060
Guess I'll leave it there for today.

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:30.930
I mean...

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:32.980
It's all up to Senpai's attitude now!

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:36.810
There's gonna be
a lot to think about! Yep!

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:40.940
Choosing the status quo
while mentally celebrating her win:

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:43.780
In the end, Uzaki, too, was a wuss.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.490
Though the fortune
had ruffled their feathers,

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:49.160
the two found serenity once more.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.830
Pass the <i>shichimi</i>.

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:51.990
Here.

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:04.260
That being said, their relationship
<i>had </i>changed in some small way.

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:40.020
"Next Time"
"Episode 4:
Uzaki-chan Wants to Be Number One!"
