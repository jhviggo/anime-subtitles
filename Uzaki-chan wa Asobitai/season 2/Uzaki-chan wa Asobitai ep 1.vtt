WEBVTT

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.540
Pretty cold out, huh, Senpai?

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.120
I mean, it <i>is</i> December.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.050
You're awfully low-key today.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.760
It's so chilly;
did you catch a cold or something?

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.060
No, no, I'm fine--just fine!

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.770
It's just... um...

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.350
We've been hanging out
so much, you and me,

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.230
but this is the first Christmas
we've spent together.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.740
Yeah. It is.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.700
Uzaki...

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.620
Sen... pai...

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.770
"Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!"

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.690
"Episode 1:
Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out, All Right!"

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.400
Man, it's still so hot...

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.280
Hey, Uzaki. Haven't seen you
since we got back from break.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.960
What's wrong?

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.710
You're giving off this whole haunted vibe.

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.250
Summer break just ended so suddenly...

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.880
It wasn't sudden at all.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.380
It's been days since he went away,

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.600
"Summer"

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.010
but sometimes I feel like there's
this gaping hole in my chest...

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.980
You're personifying summer now?

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.850
I guess you get hyped for it, too.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.360
Sak's not here yet, eh?

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.110
Ooh, is <i>that</i> what's behind all this?

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.200
Well, Sak ought to be here any minute now.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.780
Why don't you make plans
to hang out somewhere?

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.450
You don't <i>only</i> hang out
during the summer, do you?

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.460
It doesn't have to be summer.
We can hang out whenever.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.920
We'll always be together.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.130
Yeah--you're right.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.880
That's a little better.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.170
You two sure are friendly, though, huh?

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.220
Ever since high school, right?

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.390
Oh, we weren't that close at first.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.050
No?

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.850
Have you seen that mean old mug of his?

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.940
I pegged him for some kind of hoodlum!
Scared me silly.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.730
Sak'd be sore if he heard you say that.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.360
Nah: She'd say it even with him around.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.240
I talked with
Ami about this earlier, but...

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.620
...my first impression
of him was the pits.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.200
Wait, what? This is news to me!

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.370
Asai's so mean--she
doesn't tell me <i>anything</i>!

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.580
Sucker!

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.420
So was there something
that sparked your friendship?

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.210
Something... in particular?

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.130
Must've been <i>something</i>.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.970
An event that made your
scary senpai not so scary after all.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.310
An event? Well, probably...

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.190
Stay calm. Relax your body.

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.440
Maintain correct form as you
slice through the water.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.520
Oh, um, right!

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.440
You're almost there. Keep it up.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.280
So yeah--a few things.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.030
Oho...

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.280
Go on.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.910
You know, his eyes may be fierce,
but he's a real accommodating person.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.290
I mean, once I realized
that was just how he was,

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.880
it's like we could start talking normally,

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.340
and I could ask him for
swim lessons, no problem.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:07.630
Yo.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:08.720
Hey, Sak!

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.800
You're late, Senpai!

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.020
What were you doing, Senpai?
Did you oversleep, Senpai?

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.480
Still fighting the
summer-break lazies, eh,

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.730
Senpai?

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.190
Cut that out!

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.400
Dammit! It's too early to be this noisy!

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.440
We don't even <i>have</i> first hour today!

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.700
Amazing. Talking about
Sak snapped her right out of it.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.990
I guess that's where they're at.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.160
Just date already.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.120
Hey, you two.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.710
If you're still pining for summer
and need to hang out more,

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:42.750
how about this?

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.590
<i>She's</i> the only one pining for summer.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.130
"Anybody, Anytime! One Free Game!!"

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.880
Bowling?

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.180
I don't know about Uzaki,

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.390
but Sak, all you did apart
from work was play games, right?

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:59.100
Oh, no way! Senpai is
super sucky at bowling!

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.650
It is <i>hilarious</i>!

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.020
He just kinda heaves
the ball toward the pins!

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:08.030
A precision sport like
bowling is <i>way </i>beyond him!

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:11.990
But this guy is dense in so <i>very</i>
many ways--what can you do?

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.580
So can I assume you're going?

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:17.910
Yeah. Thanks.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.590
Here you go.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.090
Thank you. One moment, please.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:30.760
Is it that bad?

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.390
You've been warned.

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:34.140
Wanna make it interesting?

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.560
Like, last place has
to do as they're told!

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.980
Count me out.
You and Sak have fun with that.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.360
Okay, you're all set!
Head on over to lane 12.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.440
All right--here we go!

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.280
Win or lose, no hard feelings, Senpai.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.120
Now, what'll I have you do once I win?

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.540
Yeah, yeah, keep on talking.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.160
You're so chill today, Sak.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.250
Getting all riled up
just plays into Uzaki's hands.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.710
She's intent on seeing me flustered.

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:11.590
I see. So this really boils down to
Uzaki throwing you off your game

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.390
or you maintaining your cool.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.770
What do you two usually <i>do</i> together?

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:21.060
All these off-the-board tactics...

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:24.810
Tell me about it.
I've been practically paralyzed lately.

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:26.730
Well, in any case...

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:29.150
losing my cool is exactly what she wants.

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:33.780
I just have to let it roll right off m--

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:38.160
"Hana"
"Punk"
"Hunk"

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.280
Dammit, Uzaki!

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.490
The battle was already underway...

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:43.460
Okay! I throw first!

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.960
Oh, man! Two pins standing!

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.050
She's only average.
And she was so sure of herself, too.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:52.010
There's not that big
a difference between us.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:56.260
"Hana"
"Punk"
"Hunk"

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:55.340
C'mon, Senpai, you're next.
Let's get this show on the road!

00:08:55.340 --> 00:09:00.310
Yeah, yeah.

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:03.020
You're doing a fine job bluffing, Sensei,

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:07.440
but it won't take much for
that calm veneer to chip right off.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.820
Again with the psychological warfare...

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.580
Whoa! A strike!

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.090
I haven't particularly
put on a calm veneer.

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:33.970
I practiced a little on my own
but didn't see much improvement.

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.050
That?

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:40.470
That was me putting all the anger
you riled up in me into one throw!

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.060
This is beyond lame.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:46.940
So it's your usual
forceful throw, but more so.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.610
It <i>does</i> require luck, but it might
be better than aiming poorly.

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:52.650
It... It can't be...

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:57.110
Now what? The more you piss him off,
the more powerful he gets.

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:58.820
Senpai...

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:02.040
You're such a loner that you
even go <i>bowling</i> by yourself?

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.410
That's just too pitiful!

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:04.500
<i>That's</i> the problem?!

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.460
Shut up! And don't go there!

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:15.420
Well? Now he's agitated enough to
let loose an even more powerful throw.

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.930
Get 'em, Senpai!

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:28.940
There we go. I was only cheering him on.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.690
Th-That was <i>dirty</i>!

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.520
It's all right.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.150
If he's taking the power angle,

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.700
I'll just use
underhanded tricks to spoil it.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:41.120
I wish you wouldn't say that
with such a sweet smile.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:44.830
A-<i>choo</i>!

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.920
"Icy Cold" "Icy Cold" "Piping Hot"

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:51.000
"Choco-Mint Oden Stew"

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.170
"Choco-Mint Oden Stew"

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.180
And the winner is... Sakurai.

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.140
That was one tough battle.

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:06.850
Maybe you should have focused
on your game instead of on sabotage.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.650
It's fine, Itsuhito. She's used to it.

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.940
Your everyday routine
is really weird, you guys.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:14.820
Now, then:

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.940
Seems to me the loser has
to do anything the winner says.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:21.110
I-I didn't say <i>anything</i>.

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:22.990
You going for it? Some lewd command?

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:24.240
I am not.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.790
Ugh! You are <i>hopeless</i>!

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:29.870
Say, how about one more game?

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:31.620
Yeah, sure.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:32.880
Aren't <i>you</i> confident.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.920
This time <i>I'll</i> win
and tell <i>you</i> what to do.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:40.380
Dummy. Like I'd lose to someone
whose only strategy is obstruction.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:44.010
Why are you only ever
this combative with each other?

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:47.770
One-upping Senpai is what
makes my life worth living.

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:50.310
And Uzaki is the <i>last</i> person
I want to lose to!

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:52.850
Oh, <i>now</i> you've done it!

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:54.440
Uzaki and Sakurai:

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.980
Having witnessed a territory
no outsider could enter,

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:58.530
Sakaki took a step back.

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:00.740
But be that as it may...

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:02.660
Tell her to do something lewd!

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.570
...thought Sakaki.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.660
"Asia Café"

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.290
Well, I'm off to the
neighborhood association.

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:12.290
And we're closing for the day, as planned.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:15.590
I got it, okay? Off you go!

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:16.750
"Closed"

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:26.300
Truth is, I haven't told those
two we were closed today.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:31.060
I've been waiting quietly for
this day when Dad would be out.

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.940
Yes, indeed... ever since that night.

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:38.400
That night--that's when the fire was lit.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.740
These feelings have been consuming me,
and I can't hold back any longer!

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:49.660
I want to make Hana
work in a sexy uniform!

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:53.250
This all-black uniform
is just <i>too </i>classic.

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:57.460
By overhauling the visual component,
we'll pull in customers and boost sales.

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.500
And I know just the thing for Sakurai:

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.050
an outfit that'll drive the aunties wild!

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:06.090
Well, actually... <i>I</i> want to see it!

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:09.350
If I have to work, I'd rather
look at something beautiful.

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:13.230
I doubt Dad will allow it,
but if I can get those two on my side,

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:14.520
or perhaps...

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.770
You made a mean fried egg this morning.

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:19.360
You really can't cook a thing, can you?

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.190
Oh, hi, Ami!

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:23.490
Hey. Say, where's the owner?

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.860
He's stepped out for a moment.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.070
Oh, and I know this is out of the blue,

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:30.200
but would you be interested
in new uniforms?

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.790
That <i>is</i> out of the blue.

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:33.250
Are you changing them up?

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:36.370
No, it's just an idea so far.

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:39.040
I actually already have a few here!

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.000
Try them on and tell me what you think!

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.170
What, like right now?

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:46.550
For something in the idea stage,
you're awfully well prepared.

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:50.720
W-We can't do try-ons
when customers are around!

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.180
C'mon, c'mon--get to it!

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:54.310
--Wh-Whoa there!
--W-Wait a sec!

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.230
"Closed"

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.570
I <i>love</i> it, Hana! So sexy!

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:06.910
I wish you would make
your praise a little less direct.

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:10.240
This seems like it'd be
hard to work in, though.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.370
I do have to bend over sometimes.

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:15.410
She's pretty level-headed about this.

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:18.370
Well, how about this next one?

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:22.880
Outstanding...

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.630
That's the only word for it.

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:28.430
How do I put this?
You're creepy today, Ami.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:31.430
I don't <i>care</i> if I'm creepy
if I get to see <i>this</i>!

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:35.020
But this one would be
even harder to work in.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.810
And it doesn't fit the
vibe of the place, either.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.610
Feels like it's catering
to certain tastes.

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:42.860
Crazy that the owner'd allow this.

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:50.910
Please show me what's
in these other shopping bags.

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:52.240
Why so distant?!

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:56.540
No! Wait! I want to savor
them one by one--in order!

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.040
"Uzaki"

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.250
What the heck is all this?!

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:00.920
As <i>if</i> I could get any work done
in uniforms like these!

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.380
Is this another bunny girl outfit?!

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.550
I wanted to see you wear it again!

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.710
I knew it! This is all <i>your</i> deal,

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:09.800
and you're taking advantage of
the owner being away to go hog wild!

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.720
--I sure am!
--You got defiant <i>fast</i>!

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.220
At this rate, Senpai must have...

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:17.520
'Scuse me, Ami...

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:21.400
The only thing in this bag
was a pair of leather hotpants.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.610
See?! I <i>knew</i> it'd be something like that!

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:26.150
What on earth were you thinking, Ami?

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:29.320
In what world do café
employees wear this stuff?!

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.490
If they don't in this one,
my café ought to be the vanguard!

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:35.290
Stop that! No visual aids!

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:37.830
Why can't there be
one lousy café in this world

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:40.960
where you can gaze upon
men's nipples as you work?!

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.290
Dude. No.

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:46.250
Why not? Hana, you saw them
every day in high school, didn't you?

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:48.380
Nipples! No fair! No fair!

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:51.470
--I want nipples!
--Stop saying "nipples"!

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:53.340
Besides, that was for a club.
It is <i>too </i>fair!

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:58.060
Nuh-uh! I wanna see 'em!
The sexy outfits--and the nipples, too!

00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.350
Wow.

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:03.900
Now she's throwing a tantrum.
And she's the oldest one here.

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:05.270
Um...

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:07.530
Mom!

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:10.070
Are you closed today?

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:11.360
Oh, Hana!

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.660
Don't you look cute.

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:13.780
Mom!

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:16.160
--Sorry?
--That's my mother!

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.790
This is terribly sudden,
but do you want a job?

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:20.160
S-Sorry?!

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.250
And wear one of those!

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:24.460
I-I could never!

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.300
She's not even trying
to hide what she wants.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.090
She's gone beyond shameless.

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:33.640
Of course you could!
Why, I've had my eye on you!

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.890
Is she confessing her crush or what?

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:39.310
I-If you don't like frills,
we can--I--oh--wh-white!

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:41.810
Yes, a plain white T-shirt would be fine!

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:45.940
Over a swimsuit! No! Forget the swimsuit!

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.190
You'd wear a white T-shirt, wouldn't you?!

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:51.280
And I'll put kind of a high stage
in the middle of the café,

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.450
and I'll have you two stand on that!

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:54.990
--Uh-huh, uh-huh.
--And then!

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:56.700
And then?

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.410
I'll use this squirt gun, see?

00:16:58.410 --> 00:16:59.830
A squirt gun--yes?

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:23.020
Why the outfit, Ami?

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:27.940
I-I've been thinking about
the future of this café...

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:31.360
I guess she's not big on wearing
an embarrassing outfit herself.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.740
You're staring, Senpai.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.860
I am not either!

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:43.410
You can't fall asleep yet, Senpai!

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:46.580
One more round! One more!

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:49.670
You want to quit now--as a <i>loser</i>?

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.670
"Senpai"

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:51.880
Look, it's two in the morning.

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:55.090
Just one more round--that's all!

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:56.430
Are you listening?

00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:58.140
Hey! Senpai!

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:01.100
"Senpai"

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.760
Hey! Did you fall asleep?!

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.020
I can't beat this guy
all by myself, y'know!

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:04.980
Coward!

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:06.770
Wake up, you chicken!

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:09.770
Hana! Do you have
any idea what time it is?

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:11.520
Hang on a sec, Mom!

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.650
I'm gonna save, okay?
So hands off that plug--

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:15.820
Yoink!

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.160
You sure are sleepy today.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:28.330
It's Uzaki. These past few nights...

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:31.250
I keep saying we should
go to sleep already,

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:33.630
but she's all "One more round! One more!"

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:35.880
I know what it <i>sounds</i> like,

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.130
but they're up late playing games, right?

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:40.140
Bet on it.

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:42.390
Want to nap till second hour?

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:43.930
I'll wake you up.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.680
Please.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.770
And that's when Ito's boyfriend...

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:51.360
Whoa, seriously?

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.820
C'mon, don't say it...

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:58.990
Hey, Hana! We saved you a seat.

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:00.990
Oh, thanks.

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:03.280
The villain has landed.

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.660
She hasn't seen you yet. Snooze away.

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.920
But you <i>have</i> a boyfriend. I'm so jealous!

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:13.800
Don't be. It's so tiring--a lot of work!

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:16.880
It sounds like bragging when
you say it with a face like that!

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.340
Boyfriends, ha! What a hassle.

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:24.510
But <i>you</i> have one, too, don't you?

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:27.100
You know: You're always
going home together.

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.440
Tall guy--kind of scary.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:33.610
I've seen you be really
friendly together, tons of times.

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:37.860
See? I <i>told</i> you that's
how you two come across.

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:39.530
Lucky him.

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:42.820
With all this girl talk,
Uzaki might let her true feelings slip.

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:46.120
Oh, him? He's not like that.

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.580
I just hang out with him--as a favor.

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:52.460
A-As a favor?

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.630
I mean, he is <i>so</i> gloomy!

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:57.880
Not a lot of friends, always on his own...

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.760
But I can't let that go--he
was my high-school senpai.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.090
I just <i>have</i> give him
some attention, poor thing!

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:05.100
Is she serious?

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.890
So actually, I have no choice.

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:09.020
Really?

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:12.150
Yeah, really. He's a handful!

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:14.610
Oh, he's hearing this. For sure.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:22.910
Honestly. Just saying
whatever works for her...

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:24.240
Damn.

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:28.120
My sleepiness came back
after eating lunch.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:31.120
I never did get any
sleep during all that...

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.960
I'm just going to
sleep off my indignation.

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.930
I <i>knew</i> you were over here!

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:43.430
Senpai, Senpai!

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.770
Wow, you really can sleep anywhere, huh?

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:54.770
That's a sloppy,
thick-skinned guy for you.

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:58.440
I guess I've been keeping him up
late these past few days.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:02.780
Ah, well. We have fourth hour together;
I'll just wait here till he wakes up.

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:28.300
Ha. Delete, delete...

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:39.770
Is this where Hana's been--sleeping?

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:42.110
Fourth hour is about to begin!

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:44.990
Those two, I tell ya.

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:48.120
No matter how much
they themselves deny it...

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.450
That thing about them not dating?
It <i>had </i>to be a lie.

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:53.250
Totally.

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:56.420
...they're thoroughly unconvincing.

00:21:56.420 --> 00:22:00.420
Now, which one would be
funnier to wake up first?

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:39.980
"Next Time"
"Episode 2: I Want to Make
Udon After We Hang Out!"
