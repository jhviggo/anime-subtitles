00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.770
Hey! What are you showing her?!

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.110
Delete that! Delete!

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.150
Something this juicy happened
when I wasn't around?!

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.610
Why didn't you <i>call</i> me?

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.990
I totally forgot.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.370
You're not all leaving me
out of the loop, are you?

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.660
No, nothing like that.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.620
Right, right!

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.830
Really?

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.460
Hey, why don't we all hang out together?

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.170
Hey, yeah!

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.550
What do you think?

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.430
Okay, you're forgiven!

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.970
Yes, I <i>will</i> witness more juicy
Sakurai-Uzaki stuff in person,

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.520
thank you very much!

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.730
I'm <i>sure</i> that's what she's thinking.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.690
Okay, let's figure out where we're going.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.060
Right.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.480
Oh, I want to go shopping!

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.110
--What about you?
--Ah, to be young.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.870
"Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.960
"Episode 2:
I Want to Make Udon After We Hang Out!"

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.210
You hardly even have to go
to class anymore, huh, Ami?

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.710
Must be nice...

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.380
Hang in there, you guys.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.590
Yeah, Uzaki really struggles
with her reports.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.220
That stuff is a breeze
when I apply myself!

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.390
Is it?

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.270
Besides, I have tons of friends.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.230
Don't lump me in with my national
openweight-class loner senpai!

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.730
Then I guess I never
have to help you again.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.450
Hey! That's against the rules!

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.240
<i>What</i> rules?

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.450
It's a senpai's <i>duty</i>
to help his juniors--his <i>duty</i>!

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.870
Looks like Sak won't be getting
one-upped in academics, anyway.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.250
I hardly see <i>you</i> on campus, Sakaki.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.300
Are you gonna even graduate?

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.840
Itsuhito's got more credits than I do.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.180
This dude's <i>good</i>.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.430
He registers for classes where he
just has to show up or hand in a report

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.520
to get full credit.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.060
Some people just have a knack, you know?

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.230
Gotta use your time wisely.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.150
What do you <i>do</i> with all your free time?

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.490
Lately? Solo camping.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.780
Nice!

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.320
This seems unfair.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.950
It was a way of life that
Uzaki had no hope of imitating.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.910
Oh, can we check out the swimsuits?

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.080
Sure.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.880
Didn't you already buy one earlier?

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.090
Well...

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.340
I've been going to the pool lately.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.300
The pool?

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.130
With, um, with Senpai.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.300
With Sakurai?!

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.300
Apparently, after swimming in the ocean,

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.060
he's started to enjoy
being physically active.

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.400
Here you go, Senpai.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.360
Thanks.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.740
Ah, rats. My time's slipping.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.150
I mean, with my
swim club days behind me...

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.910
Just because they have swim lanes doesn't
mean you have to check your times.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.120
Sorry. Habit.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.080
Okay, time for some regular old swimming!

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.620
Right!

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.830
Oh, yeah--Uzaki?

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.630
Yeah?

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.630
Today's swimsuit? Another cute one.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.840
Cute one... cute one...

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.680
He just kind of...
complimented me... out of nowhere.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.180
So I figured I'd buy a new one.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.310
You can start with swimsuit compliments.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.980
Not <i>mine</i>!

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.270
Aha...

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.320
That'd be my fault.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.240
Good job remembering that lesson, Sakurai.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.490
Let's see...

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.870
Maybe he's the kind of
person who says that stuff.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:14.040
--Hana looks so happy...
Better not to say anything after all.
--I mean, I didn't exactly hate it. I didn't <i>hate</i> it...

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.500
But <i>man</i>, I wish I'd seen that!

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.960
--Uzaki, all embarrassed about
her swimsuit compliment!

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.380
--Mommy?
--Uzaki, all embarrassed about
her swimsuit compliment!

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.300
"Using the Futsal Court'

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.060
Take that!

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.640
Hup!

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.600
Ha!

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.230
Yes!

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.940
We're still going, Senpai!

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.440
C-Can you not talk to me right now?!

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.780
Sak says he's hopeless
at any and all ball sports,

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.280
but let him practice
and he can hold his own.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.280
Now if something indecent
were to happen, we'd be golden.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.790
Futsal is not that kind of sport.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.120
Specifically something like this...

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.460
<i>He</i> winds up naked?!

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.590
Ready for a mini-match?

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.590
I mean, I'm not sure...

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.970
C'mon, it's a game. Relax--take it easy.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.300
Right.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.010
It's not like we're expecting any
high-level plays from you in the first place.

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.480
They're underestimating us, Senpai.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.650
No, I really do suck at this.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.940
Shall we split into teams, then?

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.030
That's a middle-schooler team for you!

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.780
Can't even beat us
when it's five against three!

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.490
C'mon, cut it out.

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.330
D-Dammit...

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.200
What are they doing playing
middle-schoolers, anyway?

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.580
Shame on them.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.090
Where do you college guys get off
dunking on middle-schoolers for kicks?

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.460
Act your age and go to
a college mixer or something!

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.590
Although some hunk'd probably
wind up snatching all the girls away

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.220
from <i>you</i> losers!

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.350
--Boo!
--Boo!

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:00.480
Those middle-schoolers
are being plenty rude right back.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.060
It worked like a charm.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.360
That hit a nerve?

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.860
I don't think I can watch this.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.610
Wait--is he <i>crying</i>?

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.240
I am <i>not</i>! And who
the hell are you, anyway?

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.580
Whoa, he's coming after us!

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.120
He's just lashing out.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.120
Listen, we paid good money
to play here, same as you.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.000
Try to be a little more aware
of your surroundings, okay?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.460
Huh?!

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.460
Hey--it's you! Sakaki!

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:29.210
You know each other?

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.050
<i>Do</i> we?

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.680
"Do we," my ass!

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.760
You were at the
soccer-club mixer last week!

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.600
Oh, I remember!

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.810
The mixer!

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:42.100
Remember <i>us</i>!

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.100
Sasamoto!

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.360
Kawakami!

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.610
Hamada!

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.570
Don't bother remembering them.

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:50.690
A mixer?

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.780
I only went because they begged me
to help even out the numbers.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.240
And you snatched away all the girls.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.040
No, no--we split up
at the station afterward.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.580
You did? Then get your ass over here!

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.750
Come to our miserable
afterparty-slash-consolation bash!

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:11.260
I don't know if I want to be invited to
an afterparty even <i>you</i> call "miserable."

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.970
Still, striking out at
a mixer is all on you.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:18.220
Did you make an effort to entertain the
girls who went out of their way to attend?

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:23.270
You can't do all the talking--you
have to let them talk, too.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:31.610
Those girls said your bragging and
your club talk bored them to tears.

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:33.030
--Stop--please!

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:35.110
--His words are like <i>knives</i>.
--Stop--please!

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:36.990
Behold the confidence of the mighty.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.080
Dammit! That guy really grinds my gears.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.450
Hearing hard truths from that halfway
handsome face is what ticks <i>me</i> off!

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:45.170
For me, it's how girls were showing up
right away when I told 'em

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:47.460
Sakaki would be there.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.790
But more than anything:

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:51.420
Bringing your own girls is unacceptable!

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.470
And they're both hella cute!

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:55.760
We're super jealous!

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.930
See, you can't say that stuff out loud.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:02.390
You sure are speaking <i>your</i> mind.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:03.730
Let's battle it out!

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.480
We'll play a 20-minute match.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:11.070
If you win, we'll pay your bill!
But if <i>we </i>win...

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:16.030
I-It'd be nice if you
introduced us to those two...

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:18.450
How unexpectedly innocent.

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:19.580
You're on!

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.000
Can't help you with the pipsqueak,
but the one with glasses is available.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.290
Yesss!

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:26.080
What?!

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.420
This sucks!

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.830
What do you mean, "pipsqueak"?!

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:31.710
I'll probably be useless!

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.420
Sorry, ladies, but you'll be spectating.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.680
We'll borrow a middle-schooler
for our goalie.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.760
It'll be fine. I'm okay at soccer.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.650
Wow!

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:50.560
What part of that was "okay"?

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.490
So that's why he was
so quick to take the bet.

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:56.150
And conversely...

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:02.030
What are you even doing, Senpai?
Just running around?!

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:03.490
"slip"

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.040
Nice! More of that, please!

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.380
Hana the heckler
is having a fine old time...

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:15.260
If he's that good,
why didn't he join the club?

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:16.800
I don't get it...

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.800
This dude is infuriating, all right!

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.180
But he has a weakness.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.140
Take <i>him</i> down first.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.730
We can't let this end
without scoring even once!

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:30.810
We'll get at least <i>one</i> point
from them, even if we lose!

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:32.110
This is pitiful...

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:35.320
Sak.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:39.450
With this broad of a spread,
you can relax.

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:43.780
Relax? But I haven't
even done anything yet.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.540
With your legs,
we don't need cheap tricks.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:50.420
If the ball comes your way, just
haul off and kick it toward the goal.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:51.750
Got it.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.010
That's right--

00:10:56.010 --> 00:11:00.630
don't think, just zero in on
the one thing you have to do.

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:06.020
Focus. Focus!

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:07.980
Don't look at anything but the ball.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.060
Concentrate only on...

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.440
...the ball!

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.070
Senpai's face...

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.280
He looks...

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:21.530
...like he did in high school.

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:29.960
Here it comes, Sak!

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.540
That's mine!

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.170
Nothing but...

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:34.920
...the ball!

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.050
Go!

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:44.970
"*For illustration purposes only."

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:55.230
Nothing but...

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:56.730
...the ball!

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:03.910
"*For illustration purposes only."

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.530
The ball!

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:13.170
"*For illustration purposes only."

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:21.510
I did it...

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:23.720
I scored!

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:42.650
Okay:

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:43.700
Run!

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:45.450
What?!

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:47.120
You middle-schoolers can go home now!

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.950
Aw!

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:50.240
Are you sure, Itsuhito?

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.710
Sure I'm sure. We won, didn't we?

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:56.080
Senpai! KOing everyone was total overkill!

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.000
No, I--that was a coincidence!

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.420
That was amazing...

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:00.380
Right?

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.420
The god of destruction...
an absolute god of destruction...

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:11.270
And so Sakurai became a mini legend of
the futsal court before he even knew it.

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:14.480
Okay, so I didn't see anything
juicy between those two...

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.270
...but I did get an eyeful!

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:20.980
"Using the Futsal Court"

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:25.070
You sure made a ton, Senpai!

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:30.990
Yeah, I got pretty good at making udon
after your mom showed me how.

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:34.200
Mom's been looking forward to this.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.290
Senpai! Wait!

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.960
I can't--we're going to be late!

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.340
Hustle!

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:42.960
Oho...

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:47.680
Yo, Sakurai!

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:55.350
You start early with
that bummer of a face, huh?

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:57.730
You're looking
<i>particularly</i> villainous today!

00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:59.650
Right? Right?

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:02.150
Good morning, Uzaki-<i>senpai</i>...

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:04.990
Your pestering is
as irritating as usual, I see.

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:08.450
Oh? <i>What</i> did you say to me, Sakurai?!

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:11.410
And here I am looking out for
and paying attention to

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:15.290
my miserable junior
with his sad loner college life!

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:20.290
Is that how you talk to your kind,
gorgeous senior?!

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:22.800
I didn't <i>ask</i> for your help.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.960
Then you should be even <i>more</i> grateful!

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.800
It's your senpai's
affection--freely given!

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.800
If it's freely given, why are
you demanding gratitude?

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:35.020
Details, details!
You're always so darn nitpicky!

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:38.940
You and your big body,
always trying to trip me up!

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:44.150
I wonder about people like you,
speech center shot full of holes.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.610
Always chattering on without thinking.

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:47.950
Shaddup!

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:50.200
Yeah, yeah, I know.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:54.910
My senpai may be tiny,
but her heart is just sooo big.

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:57.790
Wow, amazing. I totally respect her.

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:00.790
Quit making fun of me,
you jerk! I'm <i>over </i>it!

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:05.210
How many times have I told
you not to talk about my height?

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:06.630
Whoa--Senpai--

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:08.470
Just because you're a tiny bit tall...

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:10.380
You're infuriating!

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.430
Wait, Senpai--wait!

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:14.930
It's too late to say you're sorry!

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.270
No--No, it's not that!

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:19.730
Oh? Then what, Sakurai?

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:23.400
Well, uh, I'm bumping up
against some things...

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:29.280
"rub rub rub"

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:27.900
I'm bumping <i>them</i> up against <i>you</i>!

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.650
On purpose!

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:32.660
To give my cute little junior
a little somethin'-somethin'!

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:34.580
I don't understand!

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:39.250
Am I cute or am I infuriating? Pick one!

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:40.710
Shut up, you!

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.590
It wasn't much different.

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:46.670
What's up? Your face is all red.

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:52.180
It is not either!

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.140
N-No?

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:57.430
Look, Mom's waiting, so let's get going!

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:59.180
Uh... okay.

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.610
Yes! They came out great!

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:08.070
Thank you so much.

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:13.320
You may have a real knack for cooking.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:17.410
Nah. I've just spent the past month
making nothing but udon.

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:18.990
Here's some for you.

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:21.540
That's a <i>lot</i>!

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:24.540
It's more fun for me now
to make it than to eat it.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.090
When there's a will, there's a way, huh?

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:31.340
So you got this good this quickly
from focusing only on making udon.

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.510
And <i>udon</i>ly that!

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:35.590
Don't mug like you said something clever!

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:38.180
But I <i>am</i> getting
tired of my udon-only life.

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:40.770
I was wondering
if you'd teach me something new.

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:42.310
Of course!

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:45.940
Oh, no! This is still no good, Senpai!

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.270
What? What is?

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:52.740
Oh? You mean you don't know?
Want me to tell you, Senpai?

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:55.200
Spit it out already!

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.410
See? This here.

00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:01.700
You can knead the dough right,
but cut it like this and it's ruined.

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:06.920
They have to be the same size, so
they're all done cooking at the same time.

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:12.300
These noodles are defective!
They're not fit for eating!

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:18.800
But <i>you're</i> eating them.

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.430
Get it, Senpai?

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:24.350
You can't call yourself an udon master
if <i>this</i> is what you're cranking out!

00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:26.440
You're a rank newbie!

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:31.280
Why is she acting all
superior toward her senior?

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:35.950
You're right. I can't move on
while this still isn't perfect.

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:39.370
Please--teach me how to cut them properly!

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:41.490
Attaboy, Senpai!

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:43.200
Of course, but...

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:48.630
Won't you just be eating udon
for that much longer?

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:49.710
<i>Udon</i> know the half of it!

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:51.210
Pipe down!

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:58.300
Show me how you usually cut them.

00:17:58.300 --> 00:17:59.510
Okay, got it.

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:01.100
Already?

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.930
Take one step back on your dominant side.

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:05.230
Like this?

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:07.690
Let's see... a little more like...

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:13.030
I-I'm so sorry! I got too close!

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:15.900
Oh, no... I'd forgotten...

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.570
Sakurai may be Hana's boyfriend,

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:22.620
but he's also a dangerous boy
with designs on her mother--me!

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:28.750
Tsuki Uzaki, 43,
has magnificently misread Sakurai.

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:33.000
Oh?

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.170
Yeah--he's concentrating.

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:40.720
Senpai's super earnest about everything,
so he gets right into the zone.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.890
He doesn't react to <i>anything</i>
when he's like this.

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:44.470
It's great for pranks.

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:46.310
Not to <i>anything</i>?

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:52.150
Man, right here next to him?

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:54.190
What an opportunity this would've been!

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:56.780
An opportunity?!

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:59.660
C'mon, let's head over there.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:02.660
That's right--an opportunity!

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:06.330
I've got to fix the messed-up
relationship he has with Hana.

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:12.040
Tsuki Uzaki has no idea that
she's the one who's messed up.

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:15.380
H-Hana?

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:20.090
I'll start with her--and
some gentle prying.

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:24.720
Er, how are things with you
and Sakurai lately?

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:25.890
"How"?

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:27.930
I-I, um--you know!

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:30.140
Anything... <i>unusual</i> recently?

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:38.900
Hey, Uzaki woke up first.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:42.240
I'll send you this
picture later, okay, Hana?

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.120
Oh, would you prefer the video?

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:46.950
St-Stop... just stop!

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:50.210
Let go of me, Senpai!

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:56.340
This is when two coincidences collided:

00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:00.840
the daughter who wondered how her
mother could have known about that event

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:06.180
and the mother who, for better or worse,
happened to be prying for something.

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.100
How? Who told her?

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:13.020
Hey, boss, look at this.

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:16.070
Actually, the other day...

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.900
Ma'am! Ma'am!

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:21.280
Is <i>that</i> how it got here?

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:24.240
How sad indeed is a
chain of misunderstandings.

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:29.120
What could I do? It's just a habit of his.

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:35.130
A habit? A <i>sexual</i> habit?!

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:38.210
Though we shouldn't have
let anyone at school see us...

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:40.670
See them? At school?!

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:42.800
We have it all on video.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.930
They <i>recorded</i> it?!

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:48.100
Senpai just wouldn't let me go.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.310
Not a second round!

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:52.270
It was a just a big mess...

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:54.140
Big mess... big mess...

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:57.690
To think they've already gone that far...

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:02.070
If only I'd been stricter with
her--this never would have...

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:09.580
Hana... I'm going to
go lie down. I'm tired.

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.870
Huh? Okay... sleep well.

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:15.580
She only hurt herself
with her misunderstandings,

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:20.250
and Tsuki Uzaki's days of anguish
would continue a little longer.

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:23.840
I did it.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.220
The udon was cut nicely.

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:33.980
Aw, not udon again!

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:37.020
Senpai made way too much.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:39.610
<i>Your</i> senpai?

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.950
Don't mind if I do!

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:52.700
And another misunderstanding was born.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:56.330
College-girl udon tastes 17 times better!

00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:59.590
Boy, <i>he's</i> hungry.

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:02.210
I'm home!

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:03.590
Hey there, Yanagi.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:39.980
