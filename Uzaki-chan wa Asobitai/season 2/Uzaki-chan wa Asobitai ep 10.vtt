00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.480
What should we do for Christmas this year?

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.730
It's starting to feel
like Christmas, all right.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.900
Everyone's so merry!

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.120
Heck, someone right here already
has a Christmas date on the books.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.530
Isn't that right, Ito?

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.040
I-I wouldn't call it a <i>date</i>...

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:26.040
My boyfriend booked a table at a
restaurant and invited me, that's all.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.090
Aw, you little lovebirds!

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.500
Won't <i>you</i> have plans
for Christmas, too, Hana?

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.210
You know, with your senpai?

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.050
You two really are ultra-compatible.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.680
W-Well, you know...

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.310
There hasn't been the
slightest whiff of any plans yet.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.690
But I'm sure Senpai
will invite me to <i>something</i>!

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.310
After all, I'm special!

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.780
"Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!"

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.950
"Episode 10:
We Want a Thrill Before Christmas!"

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.210
I'm doing prep;
you can go set the table, okay?

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.380
Sure.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.050
He can't stop looking at me!

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.560
Man, I can read him like a book.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.770
He wants to spend Christmas
with me after all!

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.060
A special season!
With his special someone!

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.070
That's what that
torrid gaze means, I know it!

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:00.650
Sure, Senpai! I guess I'll have
to make this a fun Christmas for you!

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.080
If I can just get your wuss self
to show me you're serious...

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.700
Senpai... serious?

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.540
Oh, w-wow... Now <i>that</i> makes me
nervous all of a sudden.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.210
If he really does mean business...

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.550
What if he turns into some kind of beast?!

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.470
Nah--not going by
what I've seen of him so far.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.140
He could be a gentleman about it...

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.310
Come here... Uzaki.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.480
Yeah. In that case...

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.850
Wait, is that what a gentleman's like?

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.150
The Christmas preparations
are complete, Miss Uzaki.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.320
That's not a gentleman--that's a butler.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.610
Woo! Christmas!
Let's raise the roof, Uzaki-<i>chan</i>!

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.910
No, no! No way--not ever!

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.870
Okay, Hana, calm down for a sec.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.870
Knowing him,
he won't suddenly come after me.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.130
Although we <i>have</i>
known each other long enough...

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.960
But, I mean, still...

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.590
Huh? Hang on...

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.060
Wasn't I just saying that senpai was
the safest creature in the whole world?

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.480
So what has me so worried?

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.890
Wait... huh?

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.030
No, Hana! Senpai is
the safest in the whole world!

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.410
That's right! Hang in there, angel me!

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.410
"Safest in the whole world," my foot!

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.040
That's too many devils!
What's wrong with my conscience?!

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.370
Just be honest with yourself already!

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.920
N-No! Hana isn't even considering
being like that with her senpai!

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.300
"Like that"?

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.510
And by "that"...

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.630
Like <i>what</i>, hmm?

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.640
W-Well, um...

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.350
An opening!

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.940
D-Do you think maybe...

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.610
...at some point... <i>I'll</i> go after <i>him</i>?

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.940
--Uzaki?
--Yes!

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.610
Wh-Wh-What is it, Senpai?
I'm not done prepping yet.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.910
Oh, no, I wasn't
looking to hurry dinner up.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.490
There's something
I wanted to check, that's all.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.210
Can you... take your top off?

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:24.050
No... no way.
He's not even waiting for Christmas?!

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.720
No... he would never...

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.430
I can't... I can't do this...

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.970
I mean...

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.850
We've never...

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.860
...done anything...

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.200
I can't...

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.490
And yet...

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:54.830
Uzaki.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.800
That's perfect.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.390
Senpai?

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.390
I knew it. That's my T-shirt.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:26.400
Oh. Yeah, I guess it is.
I forgot I borrowed it.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.530
I don't mind.
Just be sure you give it back.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.200
Huh? What? What are <i>you</i> so mad about?

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.370
I'm the one who has his T-shirts stolen!

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.830
I didn't steal them--I <i>borrowed</i> them!

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.840
And I'll give them back, okay? Happy?

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.500
I'll wash everything
and bring them over tomorrow!

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.050
O... kay.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:52.010
These oversized shirts are awfully comfy,
but fine! You can have them back!

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:56.470
They don't smell like you anymore,
so I'm fine letting them go!

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.930
You were smelling them?

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.230
Stop that. How mortifying.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.150
I'm sorry! I won't mention it again!

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.150
I'll forget all about it--I already have!

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.820
Was that some kind of sore spot for you?

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.910
Here I thought I'd take
the initiative for the holidays...

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:20.620
Oh, but this ain't over.
I'll show him a thing or two tomorrow!

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.540
And the next day...

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.800
Are you ready for this, Senpai?

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.180
Uzaki, no! Please--anything but that!

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.350
Yes... there's that face.

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:41.640
<i>That's</i> what really makes my day.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.520
But it's too late to stop now.
And it's all <i>your</i> fault.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.730
No, no, no--wait! I don't understand!

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:50.650
I have no idea what I did
to make you so angry!

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:54.070
At least tell me what I did wrong!

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:55.740
Like I could, perv!

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:59.200
What on earth could I have done this time?

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.080
Just take your lumps!

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.290
The horror film <i>Atrocity</i>!

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.880
Here we go!

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:14.130
Uzaki was unnecessarily riled up yesterday

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:17.180
by Sakurai's suggestive
language and behavior.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.220
Though the misunderstanding
blew up in her face,

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.600
Uzaki, needing to soothe her rage
at having her girlish heart toyed with,

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.310
attempted to have
her revenge with horror films.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:29.690
What a bold grudge to hold!

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:33.450
"Lousy Cat Genius"

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:33.570
Humans really are stupid creatures.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:36.120
And... play!

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.560
Why are <i>you</i> so terrified?

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:06.730
"Revenge Failed"

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.770
I-I-I've never actually
seen a ho-ho-horror film...

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:12.360
I never knew they were so scary...

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.530
I-I-I just wanted to hassle you...

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:20.160
You're the poster child for
"hoist by your own petard."

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.540
Wh-Wh-Why are you okay with all this?

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.120
I thought you couldn't
handle horror films!

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.420
I mean, it's scary and all...

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:32.090
But the plot's surprisingly fun.

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:35.590
Plus, seeing you be
so scared let me keep my cool.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:38.840
Wha--no fair! So I'm the only one...

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.600
You traitor!

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:46.560
I'd be mad, too, if the tables
were turned and <i>she</i> hated horror.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.690
If you're that scared,
let's just stop here.

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:52.860
But I haven't seen you be terrified yet...

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.280
And I don't want to stop halfway through
when you're enjoying yourself.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.320
She shows integrity
about the strangest things.

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:04.830
Whoa! G-Get off me!

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:08.120
Sorry... I was just so scared...

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:15.300
Get out of there!
That's a weird way to be scared!

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:20.140
I'm all burned out.

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:22.760
Scared to exhaustion...

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.310
I guess I can't handle horror, either.

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:29.310
I had no idea.
Not that I'll ever watch any ever again.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.780
C'mon, the movie's over. Let's move on.

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.940
It's about time to go home.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.490
It's late, so I'll walk
you to the station.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.410
Nuh-uh.

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:45.580
--I'm afraid.
--What?

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.910
I don't want to walk
at night because I'm afraid.

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:49.250
Are you a <i>child</i>?

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:51.960
I was fine with it up till now!

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.920
But now I'll think something's
lurking around every corner!

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.260
I mean, I kind of get it...

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.170
Should I call a taxi?

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:00.590
No way! Absolutely not!

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:02.970
What if the driver's a ghost?

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.350
That's not a thing!

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:08.020
Should we have someone
from your house come get you?

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.060
Any one of them could be
a ghost in disguise!

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.820
We could go on forever
with this kind of thing!

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.740
Please, Senpai, let me spend the night.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:19.530
I'll go home in the morning.

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:23.030
And I'll never ever
watch another horror film!

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:24.910
Yeah, but...

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:28.500
I'll make breakfast
<i>and</i> a bento lunch tomorrow!

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.880
Well, if you insist...

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:36.960
Hooray! Thank you! Thank you so much!

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.010
It's fine, really.

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:41.430
Gotta let the family know!

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:47.310
Sakurai had not noticed all the bait
consistently being laid out for him.

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:48.970
Oof.

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:50.980
Oh, you bought a futon.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.600
For guests.

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:57.270
You <i>do</i> realize I'm the
only one who'll be using it.

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:59.110
None of your friends
would spend the night;

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:01.950
this is destined to become
my own personal futon.

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:03.530
Shut up!

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:07.410
Still, for as much as you hate
the idea, you still have one ready.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:09.120
For me, right?

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.210
You're too kind, Senpai.

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:14.830
Shut <i>up</i>! And go take a bath!

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:17.090
Okay!

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:23.010
It's starting to be a given that Uzaki will
spend the night... and that's not great.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:27.600
I haven't even worked
through my own feelings yet.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.770
It might be because you're special.

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:33.390
Senpai!

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:36.520
Don't suddenly turn
the lights off or anything!

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.190
No pranks, okay?

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.320
Like I would ever.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.490
Oh, and no peeping, either!

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:48.830
No matter how cute I am,
peeping is a crime. Got that, Senpai?

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.500
It's so dark! I'm so scared! Senpai!

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.420
Uzaki's bag...

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.470
Food? Damn, did she forget about these?

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:06.300
Might have to get 'em in the fridge.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:21.360
Sorry I went poking around in your stuff.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.400
Huge... that bra was huge...

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.530
I-I guess these things happen.

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:29.240
It's fine--it doesn't bother me.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:33.000
Next time I'll just hide it
where you can't get at it.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.500
"Next time"? "Hide it"?

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:40.130
I actually brought some underthings
thinking I might stay here again.

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:44.420
Sure didn't think I'd be
using them already, though!

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:49.600
Dammit! And after my big clean-up,
when I told you to take your stuff home!

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.060
Huh? What's that you're wearing?

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:57.060
This? I only had
underthings with me today,

00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:01.820
so I dipped into your dresser
to borrow this shirt and these shorts.

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:05.320
Uh, those aren't shorts...

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.320
They're... my underwear.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.910
Next time I'll bring PJs, too.

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:16.790
Please do.

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:21.380
Oh! I'll go wash them,
at least--to atone for my crime!

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.000
She ran away...

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.510
She might actually be better off
with less control, not more.

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:32.970
A phone call? At this hour?

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:36.270
Senpai! I'll wash those bath towels, too!

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:37.730
Okay.

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:40.150
Hello?

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:43.440
So you've got a girl
in there with you now?

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.190
Here I was always worried
about you being so rigid and cold.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:53.160
I mean, I think it's great.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.450
Very fitting for a college student.

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:57.500
That's my son!

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:02.330
I won't tell Mom;
just don't go overboard, okay?

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:05.590
It's not like that.

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.170
What do you want, Dad, you jerk?

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:17.430
Booze! Booze! Going out for drinks!

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:19.850
Made it!

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:22.150
Still waiting on Sak and Uzaki.

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:26.690
Ah, alcohol, emboldening us
to pry into where young folks stand

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:28.490
right before Christmas...

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:32.410
Could anyone ask for
a more exceptional feast?

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:38.660
Sorry I'm late!

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:41.330
Huh? You're not with Sak?

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:42.880
About that...

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:46.130
"Fresh Fish"             "Nipponkai Pub"
"Grilled Chicken"

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.420
Huh! Sakurai's back home?

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.130
That's right.

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:50.880
I guess he hadn't been home in two years,

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:54.010
and he got a phone call
telling him to give it up already.

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:57.220
Two years?! That's... wow.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:00.480
I guess even a loner has his limits.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:14.070
I'm home.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.490
It's been a while.

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:20.620
"Haruko Sakurai, 49"

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:23.370
Welcome home, Shinichi. It really
has been quite a while, hasn't it?

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:27.340
Were you going to stay away again
this year if we hadn't called?

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:29.760
Do you enjoy your
solitary lifestyle that much?

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:33.300
Yeah, sorry I haven't been back sooner.

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:36.140
It <i>is</i> pretty carefree, living alone...

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:41.180
But--sorry, can I ask you something first?

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:44.190
Who's that? Are you babysitting part-time?

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:48.110
It's your little sister, of course.

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.940
Huh?

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:54.740
What do you mean, "huh"?
You didn't know you had a baby sister?!

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:58.490
I have a baby sister?!

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:01.160
"Nodoka Sakurai, 8 months"

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:01.200
Wha--huh? Huh?

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:06.920
That's my line!
Didn't your father tell you anything?

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:10.590
He always said college kids were busy,

00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:13.800
so I shouldn't bend over
backwards to come home.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:19.140
Huh? But he said,
"I'll call Shinichi and fill him in"...

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:20.810
So <i>that's</i> what happened.

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:24.060
I think I get the gist.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:28.860
Oh, you're home at last, and you're
going to stay in the entryway chatting?

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:32.360
"Shiro Sakurai, 46"

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:32.280
Hey. Welcome home.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:35.650
Dad.

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:42.290
You know, there's something
I've been wondering about Senpai.

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:43.870
What's that?

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:46.330
Sak's not even here,
and he's all she talks about.

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:48.790
We should have these
drinking parties more often.

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:52.170
Why does he live alone?

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:57.180
His family shouldn't
live too far from campus.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:00.930
Right, especially since you
both went to the same high school.

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:05.270
Living alone in college
can be hard on the pocketbook...

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:08.690
And he could commute
from his folks' house.

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:12.520
I wonder if there's a reason for it?

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.530
So that's it.

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:18.280
The reason you half
forced me to live on my own,

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:21.780
saying it was another kind
of learning, like college.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:22.950
Exactly right.

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:27.160
Your mom and I could
get back to getting frisky again!

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.460
Just like our newlywed days...

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:32.040
What a stupid reason.

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:35.010
You suck.

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:39.680
I got in touch with Shinichi.
Says he's busy, too.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:43.180
He won't be coming home for New Year's.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:46.890
He's really living it up
over there at college!

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:52.310
I headed off Mom's message to you
so you wouldn't come home.

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:56.240
I wanted her to focus on
raising Nodoka... and on me.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.950
I sure wish it could have
gone on a little longer!

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:01.820
You're the worst.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:06.830
I mean, it's nice for a married couple
to be frisky--er, friendly and all...

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:08.790
Mom, how old are you again?

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:11.580
Fifty next year.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:16.880
It's not out of the...
realm of possibility...

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.220
We got a little wound up ourselves.

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.550
You really are amazing, Mom.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:23.800
Oh, you!

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.810
I don't much feel like
praising you, though, Dad.

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:30.140
Your mom was all sad:

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:34.320
"Why won't Shinichi
come home to see the baby?"

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.030
I wound up having to get
your butt over here after all.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:42.200
You shouldn't have covered up
such big news in the first place!

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.580
What were you thinking, you jerk?!

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:46.830
This right here.

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:50.160
You go for logical arguments,
like your mom.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.960
I bet you've always got a
quick comeback at school, too.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:56.130
That's not... that's not me at all!

00:19:56.130 --> 00:20:01.050
But Shinichi <i>can</i> put his own needs
above the needs of those around him.

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:02.890
That's like <i>you</i>.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.180
Don't like that, do you?

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:10.980
Look, I've put in an appearance.
I'm going back to my place.

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:17.230
Oh, come on.
You're finally home! Stay a while!

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:20.490
You're the one who's been keeping me away!

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:25.200
Say, I'm making dinner;
just spend one night, okay?

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.120
Right, right!

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.790
Listen...

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:34.790
Since you're here and all,
spend some time with your sister.

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:36.000
What else have you got to do?

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:36.840
But...

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.880
Nodoka! It's your big brother!

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.970
Wh-Whoa! This is so sudden!

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:44.840
I don't know how to hold a baby!

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.550
Support her neck and cradle her bottom.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:52.770
It'll be fine.
She's not shy like you were.

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:56.150
I'll get the bath started.
Shout if you need something.

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:57.690
Hey!

00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.830
My little sister by 21 years...

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:12.160
"Public House"

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:16.250
Oh, that's Senpai all over!

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:19.040
He <i>never</i> tells me anything important!

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.960
He just comes to his
own conclusions in his head!

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.050
What's the point in being
with someone like that?

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:30.600
I always wonder what he thinks
of the people closest to him...

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:34.890
"It's Meowvelous!"

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:40.070
Christmas is right around the corner.

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:44.150
We've had plenty to drink
to so far... and yet...

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:48.620
She seems pretty fed up
with how slow things are going.

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:53.660
Now, now. Unload that dissatisfaction
on the man himself when he gets back.

00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:03.800
You know, I'd love to hear more
about you two back in high school.

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:05.010
"Fresh Fish"             "Nipponkai Pub"
"Grilled Chicken"

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:40.020
"Next Time"
"Episode 11: I Kind of Want
to Do Things Right Already!"
