00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
"Asia Café"

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.400
Hey, Uzaki! I'm off today--just
came by to see how it's going.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.400
Working hard or hardly working?

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.990
She's been like that since yesterday.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.870
What did you do, Sakurai?

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:27.500
Honestly, it's like this
every dang time with you.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.920
What?! Now wait just a second!

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.380
I'm totally in the dark here!

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.720
Yeah, but still... y'know?

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.260
Still... right?

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.100
Somewhere along the way
I've lost all credibility at work.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.350
Um... hello there.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.780
"Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!"

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.950
"Episode 5: The Whole Uzaki Clan
Wants to Get Together!"

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.990
Hana hasn't been herself since yesterday.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.080
I thought maybe she was
causing problems for you folks.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.880
Oh, no--don't worry about that.
She's been her usual cheery self.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.930
Except toward Sakurai.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.430
That's not good...

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.730
But Sakurai's definitely
behind this either way.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.640
I've been racking
my brain over here, but...

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.900
I'm sorry. I've got nothing.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.940
Still, a change like that is a big deal.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.110
Wait...

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.820
Haven't we seen...

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.030
...something like this before?

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.870
I think it started yesterday evening.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.500
"Breadcrumbs"

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.000
Sakurai, Hana, and I were having
a cooking lesson at our house.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.090
It was like any other lesson at first...

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.840
But about when the dish was
finished--that's when her mood soured.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.260
When I asked her why,
she only said, "No reason."

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.520
I really am sorry. That attitude
doesn't belong at the workplace.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.560
Don't mention it.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.940
That's right--it's not your fault.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.020
I see. So you don't
know either, Ms. Tsuki.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.280
No...

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.150
That's it!
That right there is definitely it!

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.240
Oho!

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.490
What is?

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.490
Tell us, Ami!

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.370
That's totally it!

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.000
"Closed"

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.500
Aha! Because Uzaki's the
only one I don't call by name?

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.960
Oh--but that's because...

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.710
I've always been resistant
to calling girls by their first name.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.180
I know! So how come you're
okay doing that with my mom?!

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.390
If you're going in order,
<i>I'm</i> next in line!

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.560
Well, uh...

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.020
I-I can't bear this...

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.230
Still, to use her mother's
name so readily...

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.020
At a time when
Hana's still so indecisive...

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.730
It's obvious which one's
getting special treatment.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.280
Can't... laugh...

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.990
I do feel a little bad for her, though.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.620
Sakurai calls <i>me</i> by my first name, too.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.960
All right--it's Hana's turn
to get a helping hand!

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.210
So you just have to get over your block
about calling Hana by her first name.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.210
Wh-What now?

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.460
You need to get used to it, then!

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.590
Starting now,
no using <i>any</i> of our last names!

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:47.970
Huh?!

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.430
Just for today--and just here.
You can handle that much, right?

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.310
Don't give me that face!

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.900
I don't even know the owner's first name.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.190
Call me Akihiko!

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.570
"Akihiko Asai, 51"

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.200
What's with the cute spin
you put on that, Akihiko?

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.240
Never mind that, Shinichi...

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.580
There's someone else here who needs
the first-name treatment more than I do.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.170
You can do it, Shinichi!

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:20.920
Go get 'em, Shinichi!

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.630
We'll be over there.
You just take your time, Shinny.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.640
They're enjoying this, all right.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.430
Oh, but first of all...

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.430
I need to apologize.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.980
I did the same damn thing all
over again and made you unhappy.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.940
Boy, do I suck.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.490
I'm really sorry!

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.030
Senpai...

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.280
You're trying to get by
without saying my name.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.040
Nope: fail. Try again.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.670
I'm sorry... Hana.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.000
Say my name a few more times,
and I'll forgive you.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.090
Sorry, Hana.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.220
--Again.
--I screwed up, Hana.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.260
Once more.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.140
I apologize, Miss Hana.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.220
Ooh, I like <i>that</i>!

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.930
That was much more
heartfelt than your first one.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.520
Okay. I forgive you.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.860
But...

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.650
Please do get used to it--even
a little at a time.

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.440
Okay, Shinichi?

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:34.910
Oh--since you're older than me,
maybe it should be "Mr. Shinichi."

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.120
What's wrong, Senpai?
Wait--are you blushing?

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.630
I-I am not!

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.800
Your face is beet-red, Shinichi!

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.170
You're seeing things!

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:49.260
You do have your cute moments, Shinichi!

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.090
Can it! And don't look at my face!

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:52.720
Mr. Shinichi!

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.300
Stop that!

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.510
There we go.

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.850
Looks like they've made up.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:01.900
Those two... I'd heard
they'd been friends for ages--

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.320
yet all this fuss about names...

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.320
They're doing things all out of order.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.030
How is she still taking
things the wrong way?

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:16.620
You and I need to have a
nice long chat, ma'am. For real.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:21.000
Hey, which is better?
Shinichi or Mr. Shinichi?

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.920
--C'mon, Mr. Shinichi!
--Shut <i>up</i>!

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.470
I sense there's been a development!

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.260
Man, I'm beat.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.980
Definitely what
I'd call mental exhaustion.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.350
Shinichi!

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:44.560
Shinichi! Shinichi!

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.150
She's been teasing me
with my own name ever since.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.280
I suppose all of this <i>was</i> my fault...

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.160
"One-Day Free Trial Coupon"
"Regularly ¥2,000"

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:55.780
A gym?

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:04.040
It's been a while since
I've worked up a sweat.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.710
Being able to casually do this
on my own suits my personality.

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:10.880
It's perfect for blowing off steam, too.

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.800
All right. Next up...

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:21.310
Hmm? You there, with the piercing eyes.
Heading for the bench press?

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:24.440
Hang on--you need a spotter.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.940
Oh, someone's here for a trial visit!

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.650
Hey, Fuji.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.570
I work here.

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:34.150
Here, why don't I spot you?

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:38.490
Barbell work is prone to accidents,
so a spotter's a must.

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:44.160
A gym trope:
Busybody trainers flock to the young.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:51.170
Eight... nine...

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.050
Ten!

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:56.390
Jumping in with three sets
of ten 100-kilo reps--impressive.

00:08:56.390 --> 00:09:00.510
Okay! Stay strong till the end!
One more to go!

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:01.890
Got it!

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.520
E... leven!

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.770
Attaboy! Keep going! Last one!

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:14.030
Yesss! You did it! What effort!

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.410
All right--now get that last rep in!

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:19.950
C'mon! One more to finish!

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:26.000
Great! Now for the last one, for real! Go!

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.000
How many last reps <i>are</i> there?!

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.630
There's no way!

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.460
No! It'd be a waste to compromise here!

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:36.680
One more rep! Last one! You can do it!

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.970
Jeez, Fuji, lay off already!
Just spot the kid!

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:43.560
That's why I don't want
to ask him to be my spotter.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.770
Go!

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:55.990
Sorry about that!

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:59.740
You were working so hard,
I got all fired up, too.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:03.200
And <i>that's</i> why we keep
losing younger members.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.500
Shh!

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.670
Still, I haven't been pushed
to my limits in a long time.

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.000
Oho!

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.920
Having a spotter really
does boost your efficiency.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.630
Wow, someone who can keep up
with Fuji's enthusiasm. You're a beast!

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:23.100
For some reason, we don't have
many former athletic-club folks here.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:28.140
Sakurai! Do you have any goals
you'd want to achieve if you joined?

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.480
Just as an example, uh...
I can be your trainer!

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.480
I can spot you--and come up
with more high-efficiency workouts!

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.320
Calm down, Fuji.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.450
He's going hard on the sale pitch.

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:42.450
I like to work out,
but I don't have any specific goals.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.580
Our doctors told us
we needed to exercise more.

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:49.040
Plus my daughter doesn't
like me--said I was lame.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.130
My son's been mouthing off lately, too.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:58.220
What do you say? A bulk-up
regimen for your fatherly dignity!

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.630
Nothing cooler than a battling dad!

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.050
I'm good.

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:04.600
I get the feeling your
workouts'd be excessive.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.020
So mean!

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:09.100
Still, Sakurai, how about joining up?

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:11.600
The more folks you know,
the easier the workout.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.060
That's true.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:17.900
Invite your friends, too, if you like.
We'll all have fun together.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:21.700
That might be nice.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.030
Yesss!

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:24.280
Please do!

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.830
Not that Uzaki'd come if I did invite her.

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:31.330
What? Why would you pay
good money to get exhausted?

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:33.960
I can hear her already.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.380
It's a good place for some alone time.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.130
Sakurai! Do you have any goals?

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:44.300
Goals, huh? I really don't have any.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.100
I'll just train everything.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:51.770
Speaking of training...
I have to keep trying new things.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:52.560
"Senpai (Introvert)"
"Thinking about another cooking
lesson next week... (Tap for more)"

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.610
Oh--Senpai.

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:57.780
I'm home!

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:00.030
Hi, Dad.

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:02.450
Welcome home, Fujio.

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:04.700
Dinner will be ready soon.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.990
Great! I'm starving.

"Fujio Uzaki, 46"

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:09.410
It's <i>you</i>.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:15.130
Hey, Hana, a kid about
your age joined the gym today.

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.590
Huh! Good for you.

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.590
You don't have a lot of
younger people there, do you?

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:25.550
We sure don't--and it's just
not lively enough without them.

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:30.350
I hope this kid brings
his friends with him...

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:31.850
You wanna join?

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:36.400
And be surrounded by nothing
but old guys? No, thanks.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.940
I hate being alone.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.860
Don't be like that...

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:46.780
Actually, what would that shabby bunch
do if a cute girl like you approached?

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.280
Forget I said anything!

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.620
Okie-doke.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:54.290
Oh, Mom? Senpai's talking
about another cooking lesson.

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:56.040
Goodness! When?

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:59.130
Is the usual Thursday still good?

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:01.260
Maybe you could do
simmered fish this time.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.010
That's fine. I'll get ready for it.

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:07.590
Thanks! I'll let Senpai know.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:11.560
Is Hana's senpai the one who
made all that udon a while back?

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:16.980
That's right. Lives alone
and wants to be a better cook.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.520
Such a hard-working beginner, too.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.860
Nice! Sheer determination--I like that!

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:25.650
She'll make a great wife one day.

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:27.450
Senpai's a guy.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.280
And "Send."

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:34.960
Huh! Is that so?!

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.420
I'd sure like to meet him...

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:40.540
I know: I'll take that day off.

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:45.050
You can't, Fujio! You need to do your job!

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.390
I'm home!

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:55.100
Brrr! It really got cold fast.

"Yanagi Uzaki, 14 -
Middle School, 2nd Year"

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:06.200
What's for dinner tonight, Mom?

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.700
Sit down, Yanagi.

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.620
Is this... the usual?

00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:14.830
Yep: the usual.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.120
I should have kept my big mouth shut...

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:22.460
I hereby call the
Uzaki family meeting to order.

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:23.960
On our agenda:

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.720
Hana... has a boyfriend.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.970
Seriously? That's hilarious!

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.770
Really? Good for you, Hana!

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:36.850
Huh!

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:38.310
It is <i>not</i> good!

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:41.150
This time has finally
come for my daughter...

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:44.440
Probably some no-good bum,
given that it's college.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.700
He better be a fine upstanding man,
or I won't allow it!

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:51.870
Another never-ending meeting, with
Dad the only one getting all agitated.

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:54.740
Mom, can you hurry dinner up?

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:58.960
Hana's an adult.
Let her do what she wants.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.500
That side of you is pretty out there, Dad.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:06.630
Nag too much and your kids
will end up hating you.

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:09.380
Why are you all so cold toward me?!

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:16.390
Kiri and Hana used to speak in
my Kansai dialect, too--not just Yanagi...

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:21.310
I got teased in grade school for talking
like a delinquent. Never again!

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:23.020
It's just imprinting on you.

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:25.980
Aw, Kansai dialect is cute!

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:32.280
Hate it all you like, but you can't
escape your Kansai soul!

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.580
Read these <i>without</i> the jingle!

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:40.290
Oh, wow! That <i>is</i> super
hard not to sing! Spooky.

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:45.210
See? That's the fruit of your upbringing!

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:50.130
Those not living in Kansai,
don't worry about it.

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:55.260
Good: We've gotten off track.
All because Dad's so energetic...

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.510
Dodged that bullet.

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:02.140
Hey, what kind of guy
is this boyfriend of yours?

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:05.360
Is he cool? Do you have a picture?
Show me!

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.820
C'mon, Hana! Please?

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:10.280
N-No, I don't have any pictures.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:12.490
This is a lie.

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:14.910
It figures Yanagi would be all over this.

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:16.990
And I thought we were
good and distracted...

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:21.710
So there's a guy out there
who goes for a petite girl like Hana.

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:24.750
I'm worried about him for
<i>different </i>reasons, y'know?

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:25.670
What?!

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:28.460
<i>You</i> don't get to go
around calling <i>me </i>small.

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:32.340
Save the high-and-mighty act
till you're past 160 centimeters.

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:34.300
No wonder girls don't like you.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.100
Huh?! I <i>am</i> past that! I'm not little!

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.810
Just a tad below average, that's all!

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:42.100
Now, now, you two...

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:46.110
I hope you'll always
be shorter than me, Kiri.

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:48.480
What? I'm totally gonna blow past you!

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.940
I'm only gonna get taller and taller!

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:53.700
How tall is your boyfriend, Hana?

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:54.990
Um...

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:57.490
I think he said he
was 180 centimeters tall.

00:16:57.490 --> 00:16:58.620
He's huge!

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:00.540
What a size difference!

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:03.540
H-Height isn't everything! Right, Dad?

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.040
That's right, Kiri!

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.710
The short men are in cahoots...

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:11.920
W-Well, uh, anyway...

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:15.430
As I was saying:
Is he really a decent man?

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:18.140
There are a few things I want to know.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:20.350
Does he have a kind disposition?

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:21.970
Does he have good manners?

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:24.350
Is his personal life in order?

00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:26.980
How many kilos can he bench-press?

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:30.360
He sneaked in his own ask.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.740
In any case, you can forget
about dating some half-baked--

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:37.360
S-Senpai is... He's respectable.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.660
Hana?

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:43.040
He's super serious... maybe <i>too</i> serious.

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:46.330
He looks over my assignments,
he doesn't smoke,

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:50.250
he hardly drinks, and he likes
weight training and video games.

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:53.630
Ooh! Here we go with the info dump!

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:56.630
He even keeps his place clean!

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:58.800
You've... been?

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.430
Um... Hana?

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:08.060
No! Not like that! Nothing's going on!

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:11.190
I just go there to hang out
all normal-like, that's all!

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:13.780
We both like video games--
we play those together!

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:17.950
He sucks at cooking,
so I do <i>that</i> for him sometimes, too!

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:19.700
And that's it--really!

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:24.870
I never realized your
relationship was that chaste.

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.290
I just assumed...

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:28.920
...things had escalated
to a whole other level.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.830
We're not doing <i>anything</i>!

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:34.590
Oh, and, uh... I forgot
to correct you earlier, but...

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:36.670
Senpai, um...

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:38.380
He's not my boyfriend.

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:39.550
What?!

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:42.010
But you still went to his place?!

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:45.640
And played games with
him--and cooked for him?

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.020
And you're not dating?!

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.230
Hana...

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:49.900
What are you <i>doing</i>?!

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:54.570
Then you must <i>like</i> this guy, Hana!

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:56.190
I-It's not like that!

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:59.360
He's been a gloomy
loner ever since high school.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.910
He was always all alone at college, too!

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:05.870
Look, he's so pitiful, I'm doing him
a favor by paying him attention!

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:07.330
You <i>love</i> him!

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:12.790
Wrong! <i>I</i> don't like <i>him</i>--<i>he</i> likes <i>me</i>!

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:14.800
I mean, jeez, either way!

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.510
No! There's a big distinction!

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:18.380
It's all the same!

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.260
It's not the same thing at all!

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.760
Do you know Hana's boyfriend, Mom?

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:27.890
Yes--I give him cooking lessons here
sometimes. He's a really good kid.

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:29.690
Still a little scary, though.

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:32.060
Huh. Cooking lessons, eh?

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:35.320
Remember those croquettes
we ate the other day?

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:39.570
Oh, those! Hana's senpai made those?

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:41.530
They were way delish!

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:44.580
What is it, Kiri?

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:49.250
So that udon that Hana's senpai
brought... don't tell me...

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:51.080
He made it.

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:59.470
No way! A <i>man</i>?!

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:02.090
I thought a college girl
kneaded that dough--

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:04.550
I was on cloud nine eating that stuff!

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:06.760
Are you <i>kidding</i> me?!

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:11.480
Kiri's at that age now where
he'll say these disappointing things...

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:15.270
If only Kiri got his act together--girls
might actually like him.

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:17.690
Forget this! I'm taking a bath!

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:20.650
H-Hey, Hana...

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:22.070
Wow, is she mad.

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:25.370
Well, yeah. You took it too far.

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:27.950
Guess that's all for today.

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:29.700
But that man...

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.670
Is my darling daughter
not good enough for him?

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:35.830
He hasn't put the moves on my ultra-cute
Hana after all she's done for him?

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:38.170
That's actually amazing! And infuriating!

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:39.960
And kind of admirable!

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.630
Which is it?

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:43.340
Give it back!

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:45.550
--I want my innocence back!

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:48.220
--So Sakurai wasn't her boyfriend...
--I want my innocence back!

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:53.480
He hasn't even made a
move on her. But if that's true...

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:56.560
One day... I'd like to hold her.

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.770
Then what was that all about?

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:01.650
Don't tell me he's always been after...

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:04.410
...me--and me alone!

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:08.700
In the end, the family meeting
brought its members only confusion.

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:14.040
Meanwhile, the man on
the agenda of said family meeting...

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:17.540
97... 98...

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:22.340
...99... 100... There!

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:24.720
Yep, always nice to break a sweat.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:27.760
Really clears out the old cobwebs.

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:35.100
Just one more set.

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.190
...had become a fitness freak.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:46.450
Dad just doesn't get it.
Not in the slightest.

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:48.870
Senpai likes <i>me</i>!

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:50.780
I'm not the one who...

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.200
You <i>love</i> him!

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.200
I do not either!
