00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.320
By the way,
your father has this Sunday off.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.200
Kiri and Yanagi are done with exams;
let's all go get refreshed!

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.110
Refreshed?

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.620
One of our members clued me
in on this really fun spot.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.000
Someplace fun? What is it?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.040
Here--check it out!

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.210
"Hakone Kowakien Yunessun"

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.500
Hakone Kowakien... Yunessun?

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.550
It's a hot spring where you can
suit up and swim--even in winter.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.920
A hot spring? Wouldn't you get
dizzy swimming in one of those?

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.300
Apparently the water's
kept comfortably warm.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.850
They have a regular hot spring, too.
I might prefer that.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.400
So you can swim, huh?

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.280
You with us, Kiri? Looks fun, ri--

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.700
N-No way... Count me out.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.540
I am <i>definitely</i> not going!

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.330
What the heck happened to you?!

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.720
"Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!"

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.970
"Episode 9:
Fujio Uzaki Wants Family Time!"

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.390
Good thing the weather
turned out all right!

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.940
Why was Kiri so dead
set against this, though?

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.610
Our kids are growing up so fast--it
could be any number of things.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.200
Isn't he at an age
where he prefers being alone?

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.530
Yeah--his rebellious phase.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.160
I really did want this
to be a family trip...

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.790
Fujio...

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.760
Ah, but Kiri's a guy.
He should be fine on his own.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.350
Honestly, the one
I most want to enjoy this...

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:30.140
Hey, Hana, wouldn't you rather have
spent this weekend with your senpai?

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.480
But if this place turns out to be cool,
you can go with <i>him</i> next time!

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.190
Ugh, enough! Shut up already!

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.530
Aw, no need to blush!

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.700
F-Fujio... please drive safely, okay?

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.210
Why, you lousy little so-and-so...

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.970
W-What the--?!

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.180
That car behind me...
I don't like the looks of it!

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.720
Oh... Hana!

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.770
She's been coming home late these
days--and sometimes not at all.

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.070
Tsuki and Yanagi have met
this fellow of hers,

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.530
but they both just dance
around the subject.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.910
Oh, beloved daughter of mine...

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.080
Are you already pulling
away from your father?

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.040
"What the heck"
"Who cares"
"Forget it"

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.580
Listen up, Hana:

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.290
You'll be fine in Kansai if you know
when to use "What the heck?"

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.830
"Who cares?" and "Forget it!"

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:37.880
What the heck?

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.840
Yes! Like that!

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.340
Look, Hana:

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.220
a beautiful sunset, just like those
Hotel Something Awaji commercials.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.390
Who cares?

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:54.180
Attagirl, Hana! Your timing is <i>perfect</i>!

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.650
I want to spend more time with you...

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.320
I want to be at your side
to see your smiling face...

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.650
Eyes front, moron!

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.190
No matter what...
no matter what it takes...

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.740
My family <i>will</i> enjoy this day together!

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.120
And then!

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.700
Wha--is that an aura?! I see an aura!

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.880
This little trip will restore
our father-daughter bond!

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.470
"This anime is a work of fiction.
Drive safely and
follow the rules of the road."

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.770
Welcome!

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.610
Ooh, Hana, look!

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.780
That must be their mascot.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.690
It's adorable!

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.690
It looks like that stuff in here!
You know, like they have in Italy?

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:23.900
Roman architecture?

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.240
Yeah, that!

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.780
Hana! There's a water slide outside!

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.700
It's called Rodeo Mountain.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.500
They seem to like it.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.500
Thank goodness...

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.420
Ooh--lukewarm. In a good way.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.590
This feels great. Like a futon!

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:56.100
Hey, girls? There are lots
of other baths over there, too.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.180
All right! C'mon, Hana!

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.440
A wine bath!

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.520
It's supposed to be rejuvenating.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.480
I feel like Cleopatra!

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.860
Et tu?

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.900
That's Caesar and Brutus.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:16.080
"*Subject to change due
to special events."

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.870
A coffee bath!

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.410
This smells <i>amazing</i>!

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.950
It helps you shake fatigue
and enhances the skin.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:25.630
There's a saké bath, a green-tea bath...

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.420
Hana, Hana!

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.970
"Experience the Doctor Fish!"
"Doctor Fish (Garra rufa)"

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.340
Let's do this--doctor fish!

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.800
That's a new one!

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.340
I wanna try!

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:38.680
They're enjoying themselves.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:42.900
I'm glad. I really am!

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.520
Why don't we check it out, too?

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.660
Forget it--way too tickly!

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.490
I can't last even ten seconds!

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.710
No can do! Count me out!

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:06.750
Hey now, you two, keep your
voices down! This is a public pla--

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.970
It really does tickle...

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.640
Keep <i>your</i> voice down,
too--for other reasons!

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:23.640
Nope, I'm out! Uncle!

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:27.190
Same here! Later!

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.730
Wait, you can't go off alone!

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.280
Are you okay, Fujio?

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:40.080
Phew, that was a close one.
Almost squashed the fish.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
N-No! Not there!

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.790
No nibbling there!

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:55.300
F-Fujio! Stop making
weird noises in a public place!

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.430
Whew, that tickled!

00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:59.640
We sure laughed a lot!

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.270
But I do think my feet
feel a little smoother.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:03.930
I get that!

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:05.390
Where to next?

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:07.600
Wait till Mom and Dad catch up.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.980
Hey, got a second?

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.740
You two are such cuties!
Where are you from?

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.320
Whoa, Hana, they're hitting on us.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.830
Aw, man... what a pain.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:22.330
I haven't had to deal with this lately.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:28.250
Isn't that because you're
always with your senpai?

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:33.340
Oh, right. His nasty eyes
really <i>do</i> scare people away after all.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:36.130
That's... not exactly it.

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:40.100
Hey, quit whispering
amongst yourselves, wouldja?

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:41.760
Wanna grab a drink over there?

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.060
"Café Restaurant Fontana"

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:46.440
No, thanks.
We're here with our family today.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.980
Then give us your contact info.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:54.110
Look, y'all, just so you know, we're in
middle school, and that's a crime.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:55.690
Mid--?!

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:58.240
"Y'all"? Did she just say "y'all"?!

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:03.450
Middle school, yeah... that's, uh...

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.000
They bought it?!

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.370
Yeah. Might wanna touch base
again in five years or so...

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:11.090
Hey! What's the big idea?!

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:14.550
Get lost, punks!

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:16.840
We're sorry!

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.010
Of all the...

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:27.480
Rats! How could I let my ultra-cute girls
roam around in their swimsuits?

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:35.280
That's basically like tossing
raw meat into a safari park full of lions!

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.360
I brought them here
so they could enjoy themselves,

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.950
but it's all for nothing
if they wind up being hit on!

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:46.540
Um, Dad?

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:51.500
Hana, Yanagi, are you okay?
Did they do anything to you?

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:55.130
I'm sorry I took my eyes off you.
That was scary.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:59.840
No, uh... why are you
silky-smooth all over?

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.840
Never mind me!

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:06.600
Don't be so worried. It's not like we were
ever going to go with them.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.730
Besides... well...

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:09.980
Yeah.

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.980
You're never far away, Dad.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.900
You'll always protect us.

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:21.070
Hana... Yanagi...

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:22.410
A mother of three?!

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:23.620
No way!

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.580
Um... this is problematic.

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:32.120
I'm here with my family,
and my children are waiting, so...

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:36.340
He's back!

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:38.050
What's <i>with</i> that dude?!

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:40.170
You just can't be too careful...

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.300
Hey, check that out!

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.470
What a body...

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.260
Wow...

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.180
Ugh! They just keep on coming!

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:49.850
Um, excuse me?

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.310
Your physique is incredible!

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:55.150
Do you work at it?

00:11:56.610 --> 00:12:00.320
Er... would you mind
if we took some pictures?

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.530
"Photography is allowed
in some areas of Yunessun!"

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:05.490
--Nice!
--Look at those bulges!
--He's so smooth...

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:06.620
Sure thing!

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:07.700
Yesss!

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.410
Thank you!

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:13.040
How did Tsuki wind up with this man?

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:22.420
Look this way!

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.470
Okay, next pose, please!

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:26.890
Nice! Looking good, looking <i>good</i>!

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:30.390
What a smile!

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:31.560
He's huge!

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.600
Wow, look at that! Amazing!

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.440
Whoa, what <i>is</i> that?! Crazy!

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.110
What the...?

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.610
What on earth is that turning into?

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:46.410
Dad just loves it when
people compliment his muscles.

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:49.080
That physique really is something else.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.290
How do I work out to get a body like that?

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:56.420
We keep working out hoping
for six-packs, but no luck.

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.210
See, with your abs...

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:01.300
Fine-tuning your diet is
enough to see some changes.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:06.720
What you want is a balance
of proteins, fats, and carbs...

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:11.310
Now he's dishing out workout advice.

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:15.310
Still doing the trainer thing,
even on his day off...

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:21.360
This looks like it'll take a while.
I'm gonna go look around on my own.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.110
Watch your step--be
careful you don't slip.

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:25.450
I will.

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.520
Whoa! What a view!

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:01.320
A little chilly, though,
since it's winter and all.

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:08.490
Cave baths...

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.410
Yes--shelter.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.290
Now, how about lunch?

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:20.710
Good idea.

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:26.760
S-Senpai?!

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.510
Uzaki?!

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.140
What are you doing here?

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.680
Oh! What a coincidence!

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.100
Sakaki, don't tell me...

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.350
You planned this, Itsuhito?

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:41.190
No, no, no! I was completely
hands-off this time!

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:44.020
This is 100-percent
unadulterated coincidence!

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:48.150
But given how you <i>usually</i> operate...

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:49.910
--Right?
--Yeah.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.580
Man, there is zero trust
in this relationship.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:55.790
Uzaki...

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.420
All right. I swam my heart
out the other day--

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:03.340
I can talk with her normally again.

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:07.130
Itsuhito gave me a complimentary ticket,
so I tagged along.

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:10.380
Sak happened to be free,
so we popped over in my car.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:14.180
Huh! I'm here with my family.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.260
Huh.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.560
This place sure is fun, huh?

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.350
Imagine, a hot spring with a water slide!

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:22.100
Have you tried it yet, Senpai?

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:23.360
No...

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.900
If you'd like to, I could come with.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.860
What are you, my mother?

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:30.820
What now, Itsuhito?

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.200
What's that grin for?

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.790
Oh, just thinking how Sak hasn't mentioned
having a lot of free time lately.

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:39.040
I haven't?

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.290
No, sir.

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:43.710
And what are you trying to say
with that creepy smile of yours?

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:50.090
You know, that maybe it's because
you're always spending time with him.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:55.350
In fact, lately Sak's the one who
hasn't been paying attention to <i>me</i>.

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:59.310
I can only get him to hang out
when you're not around.

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:04.770
I'd say you have
higher priority, all right.

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:10.110
Makes me kinda lonely... and kinda happy.

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:13.410
Oh, you're so full of it! Shut up!

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:16.740
Don't get all flustered, musclehead.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:23.620
W-Well, I mean...
if you were that lonely, Senpai,

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.880
I-I'm sorry I couldn't
hang out with you today.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.630
N-No, I'm fine!

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.930
So... what now?

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:37.300
I could join you two
and all hang out together.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.350
No, let's not.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:45.520
You're here with your family.
You should put them first.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:49.690
You can always give me a shout, and
we'll hang out together some other time.

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:51.690
Senpai...

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:56.120
Yeah, enjoy some quality time
with your family today.

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:03.790
Kiri and Yanagi are done with exams;
let's all go get refreshed!

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:07.580
Hana, Yanagi, are you okay?
Did they do anything to you?

00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:11.050
I'm sorry I took my eyes off you.
That was scary.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.840
Yeah, you're right. I'll do that.

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:18.890
We can come back here together later!

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:21.390
Sure--just say the word.

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:24.230
Well, I'd better be getting back.

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.100
Right. See you at work tomorrow.

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.110
Yep!

00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:29.820
Oh, and Senpai?

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:36.110
Aren't you going to say
what you always say?

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.870
That's another cute swimsuit
you've got on today.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.750
Thanks.

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:47.580
Okay, Senpai--see you tomorrow!

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:48.670
Yeah.

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:51.590
You two, in your own little world...

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:56.220
I forgot!

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:57.720
Still...

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.260
What?

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:04.770
For us to be talking about enjoying
quality time with the family...

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.940
Yeah.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.190
You going home for the holidays, Sak?

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:15.150
Mmm, probably not unless
they ask. What about you?

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:17.150
I'd rather ditch my family, too.

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:21.490
Now's the time to come up
with a good excuse not to see them.

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:24.540
We can do the New Year's shrine visit,
see the first sunrise.

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:26.330
Ooh, nice!

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:28.170
Invite Uzaki along, too.

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.760
Oh, Hana's back.

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:40.340
Well, <i>you're</i> in a good mood.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:43.430
This place is fun!

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:47.140
Yes, with fresh air and a beautiful view.

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:50.600
I could stay in this warm water forever.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:54.320
Yeah, but aren't you getting hungry?

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.030
Should we grab a bite to eat?

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:58.530
Let's call in our bodyguard, shall we?

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:02.370
Dad! We're leaving!

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.390
Mom, I'm hungry!

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:25.560
All right, all right.
I'll get started on dinner soon.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:29.140
Here, Kiri--eat these in the meantime.

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:33.770
"I Went to Yunessun.
Lousy Cat"

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.400
Sounds like you really enjoyed yourselves.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.820
It was fun!

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.900
You should have come, too.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.530
They had a bunch of baths,

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:46.410
and then all these people came
around to admire Dad's muscles!

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:48.500
It turned into a
photo session and everything.

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.790
Why exactly did you go again?

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:53.380
These guys were flirting with Hana and me.

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.920
Flirting?!

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.800
Dad chased them off right away.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.470
Man, that was classic.

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:05.050
I said Hana was in middle school,
and those guys believed me!

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:08.680
Hey, yeah! How dare you, Yanagi?!

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.940
Passing off a 20-year-old adult
as a middle-schooler!

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:13.900
Sorry about that!

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:23.320
Next time I'd like to spend the night.
You should come too, Kiri.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:28.700
Yeah... if it's that much fun,
maybe I could go, too.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:33.000
Sure, Dad--count me in next time!

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.790
Oho, okay!

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:37.670
Yep, your old dad'll
take you whenever you like!

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:42.170
Hana and Yanagi enjoyed
themselves this time around--

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:46.800
next we'll have a family trip
with the <i>entire</i> Uzaki clan.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:50.600
Ah, dammit! I should have gone, too!

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:55.650
Hey, Dad, let's go next week, okay?
I'll skip club!

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:57.310
Oh, my!

00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:58.900
But you hated the idea.

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:00.820
What the heck happened?

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:03.700
And what's your hurry?

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:08.200
Even runts like Hana and Yanagi
get hit on over there, right?

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:13.330
I might actually get
a college girl to flirt with me!

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.880
Oh, man, I am <i>stoked</i>! I can't wa--

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.760
Ow! What's the big idea?!

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:26.340
Who are you calling runts?

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.390
This? This is why
girls don't like you, Kiri.

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:31.770
You ruined it, you dum-dum!

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:34.850
--Well... this is our family, too.
--Where's the lie? You <i>are</i> runts!

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:37.900
--Keep saying stuff like that,
and you'll <i>never</i> have a girlfriend!

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:38.980
--Our family's usual...
--Keep saying stuff like that,
and you'll <i>never</i> have a girlfriend!

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:41.360
--Our family's usual...
--No wonder you're
not getting any taller.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:47.530
What?! I am too!
And I will, too, have a girlfriend!

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:50.830
Your father's over here
crying tears of disappointment...

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:40.020
"Next Time"
"Episode 10:
We Want a Thrill Before Christmas!"
