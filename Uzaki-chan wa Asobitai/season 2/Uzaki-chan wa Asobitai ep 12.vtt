00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.100
In our last episode of
<i>Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!</i>,

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.770
Sakurai had gone home.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.820
If you don't do things right,
people are gonna <i>talk</i> about that girl!

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.990
In light of his father's advice, Sakurai
reconsiders his relationship with Hana.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.990
Christmas Eve is quickly approaching,
and he's no closer to an answer.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.120
Hana was giving Sakurai a good
riling-up--as usual--when...

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.000
Huh? Nope: She's ticking me off.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.460
Senpai!

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.880
...she was banished.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.300
--Please let me in!
--What will Christmas Eve
look like for these two?

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.770
"Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!"

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.940
"Episode 12: I Want to Hang Out
on Christmas Eve, Too!"

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.650
I've finally come to a realization:

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.530
When one of you is interested,
the other one will ruin it.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.150
Like a tub faucet and a showerhead.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.950
You keep leading us on with this nonsense!

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.790
This one here really
is hopeless at romance!

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.170
What is this, a tribunal?

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.960
Be that as it may,

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.420
how can <i>you</i> talk about romance,
daughter of mine?

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.470
Wh-What's so wrong about that?

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.260
Senpai's a loner--that's a fact.
It's totally fine!

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.560
We'll just watch and
wait till this all blows over!

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.730
Watch and wait, with
Christmas Eve around the corner?

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.390
Watchful waiting... hmm.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.480
Some girls in our class invited me
and Sak to a Christmas drinking party--

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.150
we can go, right?

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.070
I didn't really want to,

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.570
but I won't turn down radical measures.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.410
How about we let Sak be taken, for real?

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.540
Let things blow over?
Nah: We'll pour fuel on the fire.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.120
Calm down, Sakaki.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.750
A sincere apology from Hana
and Sakurai will forgive her.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.260
Right...

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.800
What?! Is that true, Hana?

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.850
You made your senpai mad
and he banished you--

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.970
what about Christmas?

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.230
If you don't do some damage control,
you'll be having one lonely Christmas.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.770
Like Kiri.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.820
I-I-I have plans, you know!

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.860
Yeah, with your swim-club pals again.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.830
She hit the nail on the head, dammit...

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.410
Oh, you hush.
I apologized to Senpai already.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.870
Besides, this has nothing
to do with you, Yanagi.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:54.830
Verily.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.670
"Verily"?

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.960
But there are some things I can
only see from here on the outside.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.470
And I can stir the pot all I like
<i>because </i>it has nothing to do with me.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.100
Wow. Vicious.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.890
Just butt out.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.230
Come on, Yanagi, don't tease her.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.650
Hana's serious about this.

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.440
But I get impatient--she's
such a late bloomer.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.200
And her senpai's doofy, too.
He doesn't make it easy.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.870
Sure is fun to watch, though!

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.620
If I ever have my eye on a girl, I'll make
damn sure Yanagi never finds out.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.550
Still, it's almost Christmas.
She can't give up now.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.130
Which means...

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.180
"Asia Café"

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.510
...this must be where I come in.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.010
Hello there!

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.100
Oh, hi, Yanagi-<i>chan</i>.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.690
You're up to something, aren't you?

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.690
I sure am.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.530
From what I hear,
our Hana is in a bit of a pinch.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.400
Ever since Sakurai scolded her that time,

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.070
things have been a bit awkward.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.910
They're at a stalemate.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.000
Hana isn't mentally strong enough
to broach the subject herself.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.000
And you're saying <i>you</i> can do something?

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.510
Oh, Mr. Senpai?

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.430
I just happened to overhear...

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.020
You had a fight with Hana,
and now she's not allowed to come over?

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.560
Huh? I mean, that's...

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:44.440
But won't that mean a
lonely Christmas for you?

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.990
In that case,

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.320
how about spending Christmas with me?

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.570
Wh-Wh-<i>What</i>?!

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.240
We both like games
and all--I think it'll be fun!

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.790
Ooh: the obviously pointed dig!

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.340
Of course! That's why
Hana isn't getting serious--

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.170
there's no rival going
after the same prey!

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.510
This is a move reserved
for a family member

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.390
who knows her personality inside-out
and can use it against her!

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.430
Quite the trick for a 14-year-old...

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.770
What a nasty little sister!

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.190
But couldn't <i>you</i> have tried
a pointed dig on her, Ami?

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.230
Hmm? How so?

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.780
Well--

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.320
Never mind.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.990
--Oh. Huh, yeah, I don't know...
--And here's Sakurai with
the blandest of responses!

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.660
What a marvelously safe creature!

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.910
Can we hang out at your place?

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.580
I know Hana can't come over,
but I can, right?

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.790
Well, hang on now...

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.920
Senpai, you can't!

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.590
Huh? What's the problem?

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:54.350
I mean, if <i>you</i> weren't invited,
then why not?

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.180
Or <i>maybe</i>...

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.810
Did <i>you</i>, perhaps...?

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.150
I have a better idea, Senpai!

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.030
Let's have Christmas Eve at my place!

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.530
We've got games! Mom and I will cook!

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.360
And you can pet the cats!

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.240
No, wait, that's--Hana, whoa!

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.570
Whaddya say, Senpai?

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.580
The banishment doesn't
apply to <i>my</i> house, right?

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.830
Ha! Gotcha!

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.370
Well, uh...

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:26.050
I'm not mad at her anymore,
and I <i>was </i>going to lift the banishment...

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.680
Okay, let's do that.
If it's okay with you.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.680
Senpai...

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.180
Are you sure about this, Hana?

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.100
Aren't you forgetting about Dad?

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:46.230
Why don't you switch to
your senpai's place instead?

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:49.150
B-But if I do that,

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:53.240
it'll look like I <i>want</i> to do
Christmas at his place.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.200
You don't?

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.910
No!

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:59.620
You're just stirring
the pot--in the weirdest way!

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.540
Because <i>you're</i> a coward.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.750
Why don't <i>you</i> butt out?!

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.750
It's fine, okay? I'll talk to Dad!

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:09.460
Oh, man. You're on your own.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:17.810
The only thing I can do now
is pray this all ends uneventfully.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:22.690
Hana faced the big day with
no particular approach in mind.

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:27.820
You know, there's the tiniest chance
that Dad might actually <i>like</i> him.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.860
Hey, this might actually work!

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.530
Senpai's super earnest and all...

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.910
Yeah! I bet they hit it off big!

00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:39.580
I've got a good feeling about this!

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.960
You're awfully low-key today.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.250
Did you catch a cold or something?

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:48.540
No, no, I'm fine--just fine!

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:51.090
It's just... um...

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.720
We've been hanging out
so much, you and me,

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.890
but this is the first Christmas
we've spent together.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:01.430
This'll work. It'll be fine--I know it.

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:04.600
I trust that Dad's
a good judge of character!

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.100
I'm home!

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.980
You must be Hana's friend!

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:12.070
Cold out there, eh?
Come on in! Merry Christmas!

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.410
So...

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.790
It was <i>you</i>!

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:25.960
It did not go well.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:30.630
♬ We do this over
and over and over again ♬

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:35.260
♬ No one knows where
our feelings are headed ♬

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:40.260
I want a girlfriend...

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:47.940
What'll you have to drink, Senpai?
We have the hard stuff, too.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.230
I-I'm fine, thanks.

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.690
The candles are lit.

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:54.990
I'll turn the lights off, then.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.700
Such an oppressive vibe...

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.200
Sooo, um...

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.580
My, uh, dad... He's a little...

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:14.630
No, it's fine. Really--fine.

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:17.630
Um... I'll turn the lights back on.

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:24.890
Gosh, I just assumed "Fuji"
was your last name.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.390
I had no idea you were the Uzakis' dad--

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:30.440
Who are you calling "dad"?

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.980
I--uh--I'm sorry.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:36.940
Okay, not "dad"... Mr. Uzaki, then--

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.910
Who are you calling "Mr. Uzaki"?

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:42.410
What, can't he use your last name?

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:45.620
Um, well...

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:50.710
Oh, Fujio, don't be
too hard on the young man.

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:53.500
No kidding. It's so juvenile.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.710
Mr. Senpai here is a good guy--

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.720
right, Hana?

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:02.260
Dad...

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:06.100
Don't worry about him.
Make yourself at home!

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:10.730
Hana and I made plenty of food,
so please--eat up.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:12.650
Thank you very much.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.780
What, so I'm the only bad guy here?

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:20.780
I don't like this. Next time at the gym,
I'm gonna work him so hard--

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.410
The gym?

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:26.450
This is bad!

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:33.380
Sakurai-<i>kun</i>...

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.920
Let's, ah... start with drinks.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.590
What kind of face is <i>that</i>?!

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:42.050
This is way, way, way bad!

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:44.680
Hana's special person is Sakurai?

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.640
I must have already told him
just about everything!

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.560
No! If anyone finds out...

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:54.400
I can't believe you'd just blab
all about your daughter's love life.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.360
You're the worst!

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:00.650
I'm so disappointed in you.
I'm done using the Kansai dialect.

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:03.740
...my darling daughters
will be disgusted with me!

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:07.790
And <i>that</i> can never, ever happen!

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:09.950
How about a little one-on-one chat?

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:11.080
Dad!

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.080
It's okay. I won't do anything to him.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:19.340
We'll call a cease-fire.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.420
Now, then...

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:24.430
Are you all right, Fuji--er, Mr. Fujio?

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:27.100
Your face is looking awfully slick.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:29.970
I just want to be sure about one thing...

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:33.600
It's fine if you don't remember.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.100
What's that?

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:39.320
That... talk we had, at the gym.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.820
A talk? At the gym?

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.990
My eldest daughter...

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:48.120
Seems there's this guy she likes.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.830
He's her senpai at school--

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:53.870
seems she hangs out
at his place on the regular.

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:01.210
Hey! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:02.550
Why are you trying to slip out?!

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:05.180
I-I'm sorry!
I couldn't hold out any longer!

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.470
It's not my place to say this,
but calm down!

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:10.140
I have a favor to ask you!

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:16.100
I talked about that stuff because
I thought we were strangers.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.560
Boy, ignorance is a scary, scary thing.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.980
Uh, yes.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:23.490
--Yes, it is.
--So it was basically
an accident--in passing.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:27.240
--Sorry?
--See, what I'm trying to say is...

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.330
Yes?

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:33.700
Is there any way you
could forget about all that?

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:38.630
Please! If Hana finds out
I blabbed at work, she'll hate me!

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.710
I can see that, yes...

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:42.550
Just for today! Please?

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:45.630
Hana's been so looking forward to this!

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:49.090
She started prepping
for dinner last night...

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:54.480
Both were in such a panic that
neither realized Fujio was spilling

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.560
more secrets about his daughter.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:02.610
Look, stay mum on the gym thing,
and I won't say a word today.

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:05.820
Just let my daughter enjoy herself!

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:08.610
Understood.

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:12.790
Besides, there's no way I could
say anything about it, anyway.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:16.750
That Uzaki... and I...

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.460
Thank goodness.

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.040
Okay, shall we head back?

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.340
I mean...

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:26.880
We'll have <i>other opportunities</i>
to discuss Hana.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.680
Did it go okay, Senpai?

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.930
Sure. He wasn't mad at me or anything.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:41.360
We were both just surprised,
since we knew each other from before.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.150
Oh, okay. Good!

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:48.700
"Forget it," he says--but
at this stage, how can I?

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.080
C'mon, Senpai--you eat something, too.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.870
We worked hard on this!

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:59.460
Thanks. I will, later.

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:03.630
--Oh, my.
--Eat it while it's hot!
It's really tasty.

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:04.460
O-Okay.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:08.220
Oh, can you not handle hot food?
Here, I'll blow on it to cool it off.

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:10.930
No, it's fine!

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.970
It's <i>fine</i>, I said!

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:14.720
Just open your mouth, okay?

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.350
--Say "ah"!
--I-I can feed myself!

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:20.230
I never said you could flirt!

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:23.060
--Flirt?!
--W-We're not!
We're always like this!

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:24.650
That's even worse!

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:26.360
Fujio!

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:30.990
What's with this
miserable guys-only stuff?

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:35.490
Next year! Next year for sure!

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:38.660
A girlfriend, huh?

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:42.790
Hey, your big sister is cute, right?

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:44.670
How old's your little sis again?

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:45.960
Kiri, about your mom...

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.510
Not funny, you guys!

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:51.090
You're the cutest of them all, Kiri.

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:57.850
I <i>would</i> like to know
how you feel about Hana...

00:15:57.850 --> 00:15:59.980
But never mind that for now.

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:06.860
Can you work with me--just
for this one evening?

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:09.360
All right.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:15.530
Our mission: Give Hana a fantastic time--
no making her sad <i>or</i> spilling the beans.

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:17.910
Making sure his daughter has fun:

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:20.290
Yes, it makes up
for revealing her secrets,

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:22.960
but it's also a genuine fatherly desire.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:26.290
Secret-sharing Sakurai
regained his own composure

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:28.800
and went to work revving up the party.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.920
Here, Senpai!

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.670
He tasted homemade food...

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:32.590
Have some, Senpai.

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:34.050
...enjoyed drinks...

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:35.680
C'mon, Senpai!

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.220
...and played games.

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:38.430
However...

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:41.140
M-Mr. Fujio...

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.400
Just when they'd started
to enjoy themselves...

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.690
T-Time out!

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:49.020
You give up <i>fast</i>!

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.530
...one of them threw in the towel.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:57.240
I'm sorry. The secret's too big for me
to just shut up and enjoy myself.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:01.290
I thought this'd be better than
unwittingly letting it slip,

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:03.620
but I guess it put
a lot of pressure on you.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:08.460
I mean, I was surprised
to see you, too, at first.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:11.630
I'd've remembered that talk myself,
once I calmed down.

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:13.470
Yeah.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:16.590
I sure do wish I could forget it, though.

00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:18.390
Yeah...

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:20.600
How hard of a blow to the head

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.680
do you think it would take
to wipe out your memory?

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:27.270
I'd like to leave
violence as a last resort.

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:29.730
Wait--that's it!

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:31.480
What, violence?!

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.650
Not that!

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:35.490
Embarrassingly enough,
I've lost a memory here and there

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:38.370
when I've gotten stinking drunk before.

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:40.910
I don't know how well it'll work on <i>that</i>,

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:46.750
but if I'm drunk, I'll have a reason to
go home--and I'll keep my mouth shut!

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:48.040
I see...

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:53.630
The secret stays safe as we entertain Hana
until the evening ends naturally.

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:57.470
And if all goes well,
you'll forget about tonight, too.

00:17:57.470 --> 00:18:01.310
That's three birds
with one stone--at least.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:06.390
Go on, drink all the booze in the house!

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:08.310
If that's not enough,
I'll run out and buy more!

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:10.310
Start knockin' 'em back, pal!

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:12.230
Got it!

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:16.610
Wait--is this really something worth
trying so desperately to forget?

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:21.830
Does Sakurai truly view
Hana as just a friend?

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:25.160
Senpai! Come hang out with me!

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:28.580
Yeah, that would piss me off, too.

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:32.170
Then, one hour later...

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:37.720
Wow, Sakurai-<i>kun</i>, look at you!
You're a mess!

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:40.680
I know it's early,
but let's call it a night.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.050
Okay?

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:46.350
He's so insistent.
Must be plotting something.

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:48.140
Hang on, Dad.

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:54.020
When Senpai's this drunk,
he leaves himself wide open.

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:58.200
Usually he hates this and
makes a quick escape, but now...

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.070
--Cut that out...
--How's <i>that</i>, Senpai?

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:01.370
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:05.700
You must be pretty drunk yourself
to be getting so hands-on!

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.210
I'll say this again
when you're sober, Hana:

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:11.420
Stay away from those
college drinking parties!

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.380
Please stop making that face.

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:16.050
How was dinner today?

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:19.680
Good. Real good again today.

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.640
Outstanding.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.180
My goodness, how adorable.

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:27.270
Hana's a proactive drunk, too.

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:31.560
You sure are funny
when you're drunk, Mr. Senpai.

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:36.650
Nah, it's fine... really... I'm fine.

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:39.110
This isn't fine at all.

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:42.070
Sakurai's made himself totally useless.

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:44.530
Excellent--all according to plan!

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:48.950
See, Senpai's gone into auto-reply mode.

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:51.500
Wanna try saying something to him, Mom?

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:55.040
Sure, okay. Then... Sakurai-<i>kun</i>?

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:59.510
Thanks for always hanging out with Hana.

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:02.130
Keep looking out for her, okay?

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:04.220
Same here...

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:08.140
She's got an annoyin' way of buttin' in,

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:10.560
but Hana really is good people.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.600
Cookin' is tasty, too.

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.110
The way she butts
in is annoyin', though...

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:16.650
He said that twice.

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:19.230
How can I say this...

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:22.030
Thanks so much--for everythin'.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.160
That is one smug mug!

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.160
She just wanted to hear it for herself.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.700
Aw, you only say that when you're drunk!

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:34.790
How do we get you to be
that candid on the regular?

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:40.670
He <i>is</i> going to lose these memories, right?
He <i>will</i> forget this, right?!

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:44.390
I didn't say it only
'cause I'm self-conscious.

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:47.140
But I'm grateful.

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.890
I mean it.

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:55.980
This is going some <i>tremendous</i> places!

00:20:55.980 --> 00:21:00.190
Um, my parents...

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:02.240
'Specially my dad...

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:06.370
They're fine bein' all over
each other right in front of me.

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:10.040
Me, I've always hated that kinda thing...

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:18.290
I was so repelled by my dad... that I
turned out to be kinda bad with women...

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:23.090
I guess it only makes sense
for you to mock me.

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:30.140
Lately, I've, well... kinda welcomed
you gettin' up in my business.

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:32.140
Senpai...

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:37.940
But that hateful dad of mine
told me somethin' recently...

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:43.530
That if I didn't do things right,
it'd mean trouble for you.

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:46.320
So lately I've been thinkin'...

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:51.240
I oughta give you some
real, proper consideration...

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.000
Senpai...

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:59.040
He <i>loves</i> her!

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:03.420
It took all Fujio Uzaki had to grit
his teeth and keep from saying it aloud.

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:04.970
He <i>loves</i> her!

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:40.020

Together Next Year, Too!"
