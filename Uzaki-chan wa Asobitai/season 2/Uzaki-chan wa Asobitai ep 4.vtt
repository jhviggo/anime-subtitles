00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.359
Now I see it. It turns out
Senpai and I have good chemistry.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.199
It's terrifyingly good!

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:14.240
Why don't you date?

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:21.359
Ah?

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.920
Mom, Hana-chan is drowning.

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:29.649
Eh?! Hana! Pull yourself together!

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:42.020
(Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out W!)

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.810
(Episode 4
Uzaki-chan Wants to Be One-up!)

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.960
That's what happened.
Anyway, it seems Senpai has a thing for me.

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:16.080
Oh, I can be called an enchantress now.
Charming, you know?

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.259
- Eh?
- Eh?

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:21.620
Ah, hmm... There's such a happening
after the campus festival?

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.900
Right!
Actually I've been suspecting him for a long time.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.639
And after seeing his reaction, I can confirm it!
Undoubtedly!

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.469
Umm... you just noticed it now?

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.080
That's what she figured out...?
No wonder she's giggling all the time today.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.560
With a big smile on her face.

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:44.000
Hey, Uzaki, have you looked in the mirror lately?

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.400
Huh? When I wash my face and brush my teeth,

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.870
of course I'd look in it.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.490
Seems she can't get the irony in this state...

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.490
No, even so...

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.949
Uzaki's theory aside,

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.490
this situation is indeed unexpected.
But...

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.259
Oh... Impressive that
the two dummies finally got to realize...

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:08.009
- But...
- Just a little... just a little more...

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.009
It's very close now, but...

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:17.939
- I don't think they'll ever reach the goal.
- I don't think they'll ever reach the goal.

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:21.199
What do we do about this?

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.270
I guess it depends on themselves.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.729
Not much can be done by people around them.

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:31.750
Lately, I began to think that
let them be at their own pace...

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.210
But... might be because the goal is somehow
within the reach, your daughter doesn't look good...

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.169
I guess being kept in suspense
is like torture to her.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.060
So this time...

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.550
There's nothing we can do...

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.939
By the way, Master, where's Saku today?

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.069
Huh? Sakurai-kun is off today.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.120
You mean Senpai? He bought a new game.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.889
So he hurried home.

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:04.189
But there were already
so many games for him to finish.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.939
He's beyond saving now, don't you think?

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.419
Oh...

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:09.060
She knows him so well...

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:11.240
Won't you play it together with him?

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.280
I guess he wants to have fun alone at first.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.459
I'd feel sorry if I interrupted his fun time.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.069
She's being quite considerate about him...

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.569
Normally, she would dash into his house
no matter what...

00:04:24.019 --> 00:04:24.509
Eh?

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.410
You know, Senpai likes me...

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:33.300
She's so sure of it.

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.040
So... if I go to Senpai's house alone...

00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:39.329
It's kinda... kinda "that", you know.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.980
- Ha?
- Ah!?

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.110
No, no, no. She's not being considerate...

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.959
Uzaki is simply being intimidated!
Geez, what a tricky girl...

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.220
Well, I think it's too late
for you to say that, no?

00:04:51.269 --> 00:04:51.730
Eh.

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:54.680
You've been to Saku's house many times, right?

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.040
Moreover, you've stayed over
at his place many times, right?

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.800
Em...

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.939
And Uzaki, didn't you say that
"Senpai is the safest in the world" once?

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:05.410
Yeah, that's right...

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.759
But the divination told me so much...

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:11.670
Senpai might also have changed
his feelings about me.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.339
Don't be silly...

00:05:14.769 --> 00:05:16.029
Ami is pissed!

00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:20.670
I'm not quite sure that...
the stubborn dummy would so easily change it...

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.509
No, no. You don't understand.

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:26.579
Anyway, he's a potent adult male after all...

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:29.250
Uzaki, what were you insinuating by that...?

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.220
What do you think would happen
if you run wild here?

00:05:33.769 --> 00:05:37.620
I'm sorry. It's been always like this thus far...

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:39.970
So I suddenly felt triggered...

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:41.139
Eh...

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:43.430
I see what's happening now.

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:48.250
They are fine together to begin with
but as time passes,
they got more and more awkward.

00:05:49.209 --> 00:05:51.680
I thought if it is Uzaki, she'd accept it and
be even more proactive.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.660
I didn't expect her to be so passive
when it comes to this stage...

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:59.810
Or should I say... that Saku and Uzaki...

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.120
I can only imagine them lingering
in front of the goal all their life.

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.850
Oh, no... Once I've realized it,
I can't stand just observing them now.

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:09.629
I can't wait to see how they end up!

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:10.899
But...

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:15.170
- They'll never make it as they are now.
- They'll never make it as they are now.

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.920
Your imagination of them is too rude...

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.540
(Senpai)

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:23.879
What's up, Senpai?

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:28.100
I was soloing this game, but it's becoming a drag...

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.970
Since Uzaki also bought this,
let's play together.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.410
Huh? I'm pretty busy too.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.649
I see. Well, I'll see you another day...

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:41.220
No problem.  Since you've said so, I can help you.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.610
I can't just leave you alone.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.259
Well, I also wanted to refuse.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:52.129
Senpai said no matter what he wants me there.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.870
Alright, I gonna go now.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.589
- So you will go to his place if you're called!
- So you will go to his place if you're called!

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:02.990
How do you perceive this?

00:07:03.209 --> 00:07:06.329
How? It just got me more and more irritated.

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.370
Tell me about it...
I'm thinking about a new strategy.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.540
It's time to stir up some "activeness"
in their relationship.

00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:15.470
We must do it.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.149
Now, these two are going to team up too.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.370
I wonder if it's appropriate...

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.000
And especially,
Uzaki overlooked something important...

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:28.170
We must let her realize that...

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:34.139
In that case... Why don't we just lock them up
in a closed room for a few days?

00:07:34.209 --> 00:07:37.720
An uninhabited island...
No, it's almost winter, how about a snowy mountain...

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.879
We have to try to lock them
in an extreme situation...

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:43.860
No, I suppose a more normal situation is enough...

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.050
(A few days later...
Cafe Asia)

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:51.300
Welcome... Huh?

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:52.910
Hello, everyone.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.810
Sakaki-san, you've been visiting here a lot lately.

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:57.819
Senpai is off today.

00:07:58.079 --> 00:07:59.569
It seems so.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:01.279
I knew that.

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:02.980
Because that's how we planned it.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:04.089
Well...

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:06.689
To let two of them be in the shop
at different times,

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:09.810
they staggered their shifts
so they are now working alone.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.589
This is the so-called Anti-Uzaki Network.

00:08:14.529 --> 00:08:17.170
Yeah. That's what I said too.
(Closed)

00:08:17.389 --> 00:08:19.720
Then, Senpai he...

00:08:20.009 --> 00:08:22.230
She keeps talking until closing time...

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.079
Just she seems jubilant as last time...

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.689
It's been about a week since the campus festival,

00:08:26.769 --> 00:08:29.839
but she's just reveling in her victory and
no progress is made...?

00:08:30.029 --> 00:08:32.259
The goal is just around the corner,

00:08:32.259 --> 00:08:34.529
but looks to me like she's just waiting.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.200
No, no. I have to calm down.

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:40.600
Today is the day of executing the plan
about making Hana-chan active...

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:45.029
- Hahaha.
- But, how can I do that
as she's in such an elated state?

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:50.179
Well, Uzaki. Nothing wrong about
being proud of your victory but...

00:08:50.419 --> 00:08:52.039
Is it really good to let up right now?

00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:53.009
- Eh!
- Eh!

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.269
Let up?

00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:56.250
I've been thinking about this...

00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:00.259
Uzaki, you are the only one
who says that "Saku likes you", right?

00:09:00.629 --> 00:09:02.269
He... He's going to...!

00:09:02.309 --> 00:09:04.100
Oops, he spoke it out.

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:09.419
Umm... I guess... indeed he didn't... say that...

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:11.789
Have you confirmed Saku's feelings?

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.080
I think it's necessary to confirm it.

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:16.490
Confirm it...

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:21.940
I'm telling you this since I reckon you don't know.
Saku is quite popular among his peers.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.600
What!?

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:27.320
There're many patrons of our shop are
Sakurai-kun's fans.

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:29.139
He's a good boy.

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:30.759
Hana-chan, you know that, right?

00:09:31.129 --> 00:09:31.970
Huh!?

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:36.720
Sakurai-kun? The first impression is very scary,

00:09:36.769 --> 00:09:39.539
and I feel it's very difficult to get close to him.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:44.220
But when knowing him more,
he's actually serious and gentle.

00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:45.159
Right?

00:09:45.289 --> 00:09:48.659
In our seminar,
there're girls who kinda like Sakurai-kun.

00:09:49.169 --> 00:09:50.269
Oh, it slipped out of my mouth.

00:09:50.639 --> 00:09:54.399
He also works hard. He's really a good boy.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.080
If I were a little younger, I might pursue him.

00:10:02.019 --> 00:10:05.789
What, suddenly... there's sweat on my back...

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:11.009
Well, because Uzaki you're always wandering
around him, people don't think he's single.

00:10:12.059 --> 00:10:15.440
That is to say! When you get used to it,
Saku is a normal and good boy!

00:10:15.649 --> 00:10:17.360
He's a conditional handsome guy!

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.409
A conditional handsome guy!?

00:10:19.529 --> 00:10:21.070
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.580
The father and daughter
found the all-year-most plausible thing.

00:10:24.019 --> 00:10:27.090
That's why I said you shouldn't let up now, Uzaki.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.340
Do you know the saying
"while the dogs growl, the wolves devour the sheep"?

00:10:31.259 --> 00:10:34.789
I think it's better to let him be "yours"
as soon as possible.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:35.710
Um.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.779
Ami-san is also looking at Saku
with quite lewd eyes.

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:41.779
Um, um... What!?

00:10:42.049 --> 00:10:43.539
Eh!

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.980
Eh! Is it true, Ami-san?

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.100
No, I'm not!

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:51.710
Oh, aren't you peeking at him quite often?
Please don't lie about that.

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:54.830
Even I, who don't come here very often,
noticed that.

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:56.210
Shut up!

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.210
Saku has quite an athletic body, right?

00:11:01.539 --> 00:11:05.330
- So you are looking at him all the time!
- I am not! I'll take that personally!

00:11:05.679 --> 00:11:07.440
Yes, you are.

00:11:07.759 --> 00:11:08.820
Dad!?

00:11:09.259 --> 00:11:11.379
Though you restrain yourself before guests,
you are.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.820
Dad! But not with lewd eyes!

00:11:15.029 --> 00:11:16.190
Sakaki-san, packs please.

00:11:22.399 --> 00:11:24.169
See? Lewd eyes.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.980
I saw this look in your eyes before.

00:11:26.379 --> 00:11:29.379
No, it's wrong! I can't help it, Hana-chan!

00:11:29.429 --> 00:11:31.379
My eyes are drawn to him against my will!

00:11:31.379 --> 00:11:32.450
She implicitly admitted it...

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:35.909
Anyway, I don't like Sakurai-kun!

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.639
Ah, it's not like I hate him either... Well...

00:11:38.929 --> 00:11:40.990
Yes, I find him nice but...

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:43.909
but... how should I put this...
it's not like I'm admiring him...

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:48.320
Well, well... Right! I only looked at his body!

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:53.970
That's wrong!

00:11:54.019 --> 00:11:55.320
Do you get it now? Uzaki.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.059
There may be other "sexual beasts"
like her around Saku.

00:11:58.059 --> 00:11:59.940
(Sexual beast)
There may be other "sexual beasts"
like her around Saku.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:00.240
(Sexual beast)

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.889
(Sexual beast)
Don't call me a sexual beast!

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:07.750
It's OK to feel good now, but if you wish
your relationship would develop further,

00:12:07.879 --> 00:12:09.740
maybe it's better to haste up now.

00:12:09.919 --> 00:12:13.820
Hmm... Even if you say so...

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:17.350
Excuse me, you worked hard.

00:12:17.529 --> 00:12:18.690
Sakurai-kun.

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:22.179
Ah? Saku, aren't you off today?

00:12:22.639 --> 00:12:26.190
Uzaki said she'd eat at home
after part-time work,

00:12:26.409 --> 00:12:28.820
but recently it's getting dark early,

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.110
so I think it's better to pick her up.

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.240
That's what I was talking about...

00:12:34.419 --> 00:12:35.059
Huh?

00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:37.679
We... Well, I will go change clothes.

00:12:38.159 --> 00:12:40.299
Oh. Itsuhito, will you come along?

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:44.240
Ah, sorry. I have something important to do.

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:45.809
I see.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:50.740
By the way, Ami-san, what's the matter? You've
been staring at the ceiling since I entered.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.440
Sorry, Sakurai-kun,
I'd better stay this way today.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.480
I'm ashamed to face you.

00:12:58.629 --> 00:12:59.460
Ha?

00:13:01.269 --> 00:13:04.580
Seems I accidentally lit the fire.
How will it turn out then...?

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:06.940
Oh, I feel refreshed,

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.740
though at the cost of Asai-san's dignity.

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:14.440
Sakaki-kun, I hate you!

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:15.620
Yes, I know.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:27.059
Hmm? Uzaki, you're quite quiet today.

00:13:27.169 --> 00:13:29.779
Hmm. That's not true.

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:33.139
Well, I'm considering
what I will cook tonight.

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:34.690
My hands are itching!

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:48.850
Okay!

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:50.889
(Breadcrumbs)
Next is breadcrumbs...

00:13:51.259 --> 00:13:52.899
(Breadcrumbs)
Sakurai-kun,

00:13:52.899 --> 00:13:55.240
(Breadcrumbs)
the portion doesn't have to be that accurate...

00:13:55.289 --> 00:13:59.519
Ah, how irritating!
A roughly right amount should do it!

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:03.129
But, this is my first time
making fried food like croquettes.

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:05.399
If something goes wrong...

00:14:06.159 --> 00:14:10.960
Hmm... but if you measure the amount every time,
it will soon start to be annoying.

00:14:11.029 --> 00:14:12.480
Then, what should I do...

00:14:12.629 --> 00:14:14.159
Well...

00:14:14.799 --> 00:14:17.590
Let's just learn how to measure it
with our eyes.

00:14:17.679 --> 00:14:18.659
Measure with eyes?

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:22.720
Is it okay? For a beginner,
that's a quite high-level...

00:14:22.899 --> 00:14:25.409
It's not that high-level actually...

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.950
It's just about using your eyes

00:14:28.399 --> 00:14:30.750
to remember the correct amount.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:37.490
This is the 10g of salt Sakurai-kun
you just weighed. Can you remember the amount?

00:14:38.149 --> 00:14:38.990
Probably.

00:14:40.399 --> 00:14:42.409
Try to give me an equal amount of salt.

00:14:42.549 --> 00:14:43.120
Yes.

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:50.450
OK.

00:14:50.659 --> 00:14:51.730
Is it OK?

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:54.980
Of course. It doesn't have to be
the exactly same amount.

00:14:58.389 --> 00:15:00.710
Sakurai-kun, he's really taking it seriously.

00:15:01.029 --> 00:15:03.370
Well, that's how he is.

00:15:07.059 --> 00:15:09.730
I think it's better to let him be "yours"
as soon as possible.

00:15:11.889 --> 00:15:12.850
- Ah!
- Hana?

00:15:12.919 --> 00:15:16.340
Eh? Ah, nothing. No, no problem.

00:15:17.429 --> 00:15:18.049
Umm?

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:22.629
Phew. Let me have a break.

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:27.370
Thank you.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.889
Because Senpai is a concentrated one,

00:15:30.049 --> 00:15:33.629
he may continue to come to our place
until he masters it. Is that OK? Mom.

00:15:34.539 --> 00:15:36.960
It's fine by me.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:40.480
I'm also glad he is willing to
help make some dishes for us.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.419
As long as you consent, it's good.

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:48.019
Well, but there're other reasons
for Senpai to come here.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:48.759
Ah!?

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:55.379
Mom, what do you think of Senpai?

00:15:55.779 --> 00:15:56.429
Eh!?

00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:00.450
It's coming? Finally? That topic?

00:16:00.639 --> 00:16:01.460
It's not coming.

00:16:02.289 --> 00:16:03.929
Why?

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:10.960
Well... Somehow, recently...
people around me... say Senpai is very popular...

00:16:11.779 --> 00:16:12.320
Eh?

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.440
So, I was hoping
you could give me some advice...

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:19.330
Oh?  That means...

00:16:22.039 --> 00:16:24.470
Ah... I'll go feed them.

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:25.700
Meow.

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:27.029
Hana?

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.460
I'm telling you this
since I reckon you don't know.

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:35.769
Saku is quite popular among his peers.

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:38.799
No, no, no. Absolutely impossible!

00:16:39.299 --> 00:16:41.500
But... maybe...

00:16:44.519 --> 00:16:46.820
(This is Uzaki's imagination)

00:16:48.399 --> 00:16:50.039
Here.

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:51.899
Sakurai-kun.

00:16:52.419 --> 00:16:53.899
Are you all right?

00:16:53.899 --> 00:16:56.820
Though it's the seminar drinking party,
you were still a bit unrestrained.

00:16:58.049 --> 00:17:00.259
Sakurai-kun, you're so gentle.

00:17:00.679 --> 00:17:03.450
Of course, because we're classmates.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.490
Classmates?

00:17:08.809 --> 00:17:10.759
Ah?

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.079
Get a hold of yourself...

00:17:15.519 --> 00:17:16.019
Eh?

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:23.059
I like you, Sakurai-kun.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.819
- Me too!
- Me too!  - Me too!

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:30.839
Sakurai-kun!

00:17:30.839 --> 00:17:31.940
Sakurai!

00:17:32.089 --> 00:17:32.720
Huh?

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:40.369
No, no, no! Only I would like him!

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:47.779
I wonder what Hana was going to ask...

00:17:48.369 --> 00:17:49.839
This odd feeling...

00:17:50.579 --> 00:17:51.210
Excuse me...

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.549
Ah! Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you...

00:17:55.779 --> 00:17:59.359
No, it's me overreacting... What's wrong?

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:02.819
I've made raw balls of croquettes.

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:06.190
Then, the next step,
coating them with breadcrumbs.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:07.900
Ah, yes.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.460
I startled her...

00:18:14.009 --> 00:18:16.259
I should have called her from the kitchen.

00:18:17.299 --> 00:18:19.759
But what should I call her?

00:18:20.079 --> 00:18:23.410
Aunt? Uzaki's mom? Uzaki-san?

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:27.190
Oh. Excuse me...

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:29.210
Eh? What's wrong?

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:32.720
Could you please tell me your first name?

00:18:33.319 --> 00:18:33.630
Eh...

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:37.970
Ah!

00:18:38.039 --> 00:18:42.049
Why? Why? Why did he suddenly pose
such a cottoning question?

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.200
Could it be that he...

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:54.599
I have a favor to ask...
Could I call you by your first name?

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.890
Ah... that's...

00:18:57.609 --> 00:19:00.000
No, I can't tell him my first name...

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:04.289
I have a husband and a child,
I can't fall for such a young boy.

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:05.500
Great.

00:19:05.759 --> 00:19:06.269
Eh?

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:08.990
If you don't let me call your name,

00:19:09.279 --> 00:19:11.799
it means you care about me.

00:19:12.259 --> 00:19:13.039
Eh...

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:17.319
Is that so?

00:19:19.809 --> 00:19:24.079
Tsuki. My name is Tsuki Uzaki.

00:19:25.049 --> 00:19:29.529
It's not a big deal yet...
Just telling him my first name... It's not a big deal...

00:19:29.759 --> 00:19:32.400
A strange chicken game abruptly started.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.849
Then, can I call you Tsuki-san?

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:40.400
Eh... Please... Just call me...
the way... you like...

00:19:40.569 --> 00:19:41.880
This is some kind of soap drama?

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:48.650
When the surface is fried to
a delicious brown color, it's done.

00:19:48.759 --> 00:19:50.420
Oh, I see.

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:53.640
Oh! Senpai, it will soon be done?

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.500
Not yet, Uzaki.
I mustn't let up until the final moment.

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:00.319
Maybe it would explode
and blow up the house.

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:01.630
It wouldn't!

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:05.670
Might be because you're a beginner at cooking.
You're worrying too much when making fried food.

00:20:05.839 --> 00:20:07.329
Geez...

00:20:08.759 --> 00:20:12.880
I don't know
what Hana and Sakurai-kun are thinking about...

00:20:13.539 --> 00:20:18.609
But... As a mother, as an adult,
what I should say is...

00:20:19.089 --> 00:20:20.609
Hana, come here.

00:20:22.539 --> 00:20:26.720
Just now, you asked me
"what do you think of Sakurai-kun?"...

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:30.849
That's because you're not sure about
something concerning Sakurai-kun.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:31.400
Eh...

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.099
I won't ask you that question now...
But anyway I want to tell you one thing...

00:20:36.799 --> 00:20:41.700
I think a boy should be honest
before everything.

00:20:42.089 --> 00:20:43.279
Honest...

00:20:44.369 --> 00:20:45.109
It's done!

00:20:48.599 --> 00:20:51.150
Wow, they're perfectly fried.

00:20:51.599 --> 00:20:52.799
Really?

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:57.069
Want to try them?
The croquettes I made for the first time.

00:20:57.529 --> 00:20:58.089
Eh?

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:02.619
Alright, then. I will be your lab rat.

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:09.369
How does it taste? Uzaki.

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:15.890
As my mom taught you,
it's very delicious.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.140
Great!

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:19.089
Being honest, huh...

00:21:19.089 --> 00:21:23.519
Regardless of how Senpai perceives them,
those "beasts" are actually more alarming.

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:30.720
(Sexual beast)
He, he, he...

00:21:30.829 --> 00:21:33.119
Maybe it's better to haste up now, Uzaki.

00:21:35.099 --> 00:21:36.460
Hmm... The girls around me
are all noteworthy...

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:38.599
All thanks to Tsuki-san.

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:40.089
Eh!?

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.690
Now I've learned how to make another dish.

00:21:44.089 --> 00:21:45.309
Thank you very much.

00:21:45.619 --> 00:21:49.829
No, no. It's because
you're a fast learner, Sakurai-kun.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:51.569
A good student.

00:21:51.769 --> 00:21:56.220
You're flattering me... Please teach me
another dish next time, Tsuki-san.

00:21:58.319 --> 00:21:59.400
The girls around me...

00:22:01.339 --> 00:22:02.960
The girls around me...?

00:23:35.009 --> 00:23:40.430
(Next time, Episode 5
Uzaki Family Wants to Get Together!)
