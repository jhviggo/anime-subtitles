00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:06.610
A fire is lit under Uzaki as she realizes
Sakurai's graduation approaches,

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.820
but she responds with
a middle-school bento strategy.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.570
Meanwhile, her younger sister
Yanagi stops by Uzaki's part-time job,

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.030
and, while talking with Sakurai,
has him using her first name--

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.290
which Uzaki had tried over many months
to have him do with her, to no avail.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.380
It took mere minutes for her
little sister to leave her in the dust!

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.760
"Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out!"

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.220
"Asia Café"

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.770
"Asia Café"
"Episode 8: Yanagi and
Kiri Want to Have Fun, Too!"

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.520
Why are you <i>like</i> that?!

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.020
Will you calm down?

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.520
"Closed"

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.810
What do you mean, calm down?
Is this <i>my </i>fault?

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.400
That's not what I meant...

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.530
<i>What's</i> not what you meant?!

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.030
Calm down and let's talk.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.660
How can I be calm about this?

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.700
Oh, I get it now.
They're not on a first-name basis yet.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.410
It's so young and innocent of them.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.710
It really is.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.710
What about when they're alone together?

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.970
Not even then, I don't think.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.590
If they did,
<i>that</i> would never have happened.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.520
I heard he wasn't her boyfriend...

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.310
That's one of the more
lovable things about those two.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.690
Hey, where'd you come from?

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.690
When I heard Hana's sister was here,
I couldn't help but run right over.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.320
Ami Asai.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.780
I'm Sakurai and Hana's coworker
and in my fourth year at their college.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.030
Nice to meet you!

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.250
I see... It's a pleasure.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.330
You're Hana's sister, all right. So cute!

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.920
Oh, no, no...

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.250
It's too unnatural for her to be here

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.630
right on time for such
an amusing development.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.470
Why--no, <i>how</i> did Ami pick up on this?

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.350
Don't tell me...

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.270
Eh? Okay, then... Yanagi-<i>chan</i>.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.020
See?! I <i>knew</i> this was going to happen!

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.360
The café owner fought hard
to get past the misgivings he had

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.700
about his own daughter.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.370
Still, for all that...

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.740
This has gotten interesting, all right!

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.750
C'mon, Uzaki, shake that mood.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.460
Hmph!

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.460
Hana...

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.210
Forget it. This is your punishment:

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.130
The forgetful Shinichi and I

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.960
will call each other by
our first names all day today.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.840
Aw, that's so embarrassing! Can we not?

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.890
What's embarrassing
about a person's name?!

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.350
I happen to <i>like</i> mine!

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.850
I'm sorry!

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.480
It's not about your name... Hana.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.320
It's just, you know...
being on a first-name basis...

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.660
It's like we're really close friends.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.170
What exactly are you trying to say?!

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:36.750
Oh, I, uh...

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.630
Shinichi! <i>Think </i>before
you speak, Shinichi!

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.010
You are <i>hopeless</i>, Shinichi!

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.470
Do you realize that, Shinichi?

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.430
Isn't this partly because
she wants to say "Shinichi"?

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.600
Right. I'm sorry. We <i>are</i> close.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.570
I apologize. Sorry.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.360
You do all kinds of stuff for me... Hana,

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.530
and we've hung out together a lot.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.780
Though I <i>do</i> lose my temper occasionally...

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.330
I was wrong.
I fully acknowledge that much.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.460
We're close friends.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:24.760
So can you call me by
my first name from now on?

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.220
I don't know.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.850
Oh, is that so?! I see how it is!

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.140
You don't even understand this yourself!

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.230
Let's make this perfectly clear:

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.190
Tell me, here and now, why <i>mine</i>
is the only name you won't use!

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.400
What?!

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.650
Are you just coasting on
the length of our relationship?

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.700
<i>I'm</i> about to lose <i>my</i> temper with
the rotten way you're treating me!

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.200
It's nothing like that!

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.450
It is too!

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:59.880
Out of what few friendships
you have, ours is the closest!

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.250
And yet...

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.090
Ami.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.960
Itsuhito.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:03.920
Ms. Tsuki.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.010
Yanagi-<i>chan</i>.

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.550
Kitties!

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.430
Uzaki.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.640
That's not what I look like!

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.510
Look here, Shinichi.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.980
We've known each other for
five years, starting in high school.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.480
Do you understand that much?

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.310
Y-Yeah, that's true.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.480
But not even <i>ten minutes</i>
after you meet my sister...

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:30.070
I'm sorry--I apologize--
I screwed up--forgive me!

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.620
Only I get the last-name treatment...

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.830
Am I the only one
who thought we were close?

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:44.460
Do you not consider me
your friend, Shinichi?

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.210
That's a real blow to my self-confidence.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.800
A-All right.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:56.520
Let me really think it through.
Just hang tight for a sec.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.390
Let's see...

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.100
I guess it's Ami who's gotten me

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:06.190
to call people
by their first names lately.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.860
Yours is the only one
still giving me a hard time.

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:12.660
Which means, well...

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.620
It might be because you're special.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.670
What did I just say?

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.180
H-Hey.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.760
Y-You said that I was...

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.390
...special.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:40.980
--I did?
--You did.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.560
Me?

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.520
You.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.520
To you?

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.860
To me.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.820
Why?

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:55.370
Don't ask me! You're the one who said it.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:08:00.450
W-Well, if you're saying I'm... special...

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:01.540
No--

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.290
We'll just leave it at that, then!

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:07.420
"Confidence Restored"

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:07.460
Confidence: restored!

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.630
W-W-Wait, Uzaki! Forget I said that!

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.050
Nope! Already heard it.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.720
And what are we doing today?

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.640
Hana...

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.970
What is it, Shinichi?

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:22.690
She loves him--enough
to make <i>us </i>self-conscious.

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:23.890
She loves him.

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:25.600
She loves him!

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.520
But yeah, Hana's a late bloomer--

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.240
that goofball <i>would</i> be tough to win over.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.450
Oh, well. I might just
lend her a hand soon enough.

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:39.330
I'm home!

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.410
Welcome back!

00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:44.040
Boy, is it cold out there.

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:52.920
Well, hello to you, too!
Lucky you, staying someplace warm.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.760
Oh, right! Guess what, Mom?

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.890
I finally met Hana's senpai!

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.430
So you <i>did</i> go to the café.

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:06.350
Just don't bother them too much at work.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:11.230
I think it's okay. They happened
to be closed today, anyway.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:13.190
Oh, were they?

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:18.030
The owner and his daughter were
watching those two and eating rice.

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.830
Rice...? Why?

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:21.910
Dunno.

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:27.120
Her senpai has scary eyes,
but he's easy to talk to.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:32.840
He likes games; I wonder
if he'd play a round with me?

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.970
We'll just leave it at that, then!

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:39.050
Mom, did you know?

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:42.810
Hana really loves this senpai of hers.

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.390
Yes, uh-huh.

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:49.310
Sakurai seems to have
taken a liking to Yanagi...

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:54.030
He hasn't said <i>that</i>
kind of thing to her, right?

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:57.910
It's probably asking too much,
but one day I want to try

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:01.330
both together, one in each arm,
instead of one at a time.

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:08.920
I wish pairing up with Hana
had put an end to all that...

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:14.090
Tsuki assumes that Sakurai and Uzaki
are already in a special relationship.

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:19.800
But even if things <i>have</i>
settled down with Sakurai,

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:25.220
he could still turn his
bottomless passion toward Yanagi!

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:29.850
No! If that happens to my girls...

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:33.860
Maybe I'll go see
that senpai again sometime!

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.030
Ya-Yanagi, you can't!

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:37.070
Huh?

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.610
You're still in middle school!

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:41.660
And going alone?

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.030
The next time you're headed over there,

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:47.660
go with me, at the very least!

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:48.660
What?

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.670
Understood?

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:54.420
Y-Yeah... understood.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:57.590
It goes without saying for
Yanagi the middle-schooler,

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:01.220
but even fully-grown
Hana is still a child!

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.930
And I, their mother, must guide them!

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:11.350
That's fine and all, but middle-schoolers
do go to cafés nowadays.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:14.650
Does Mom want to go, too?

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:19.530
Well! Sure is lively in here.
Got some fun going on?

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:22.280
Bring Dad into the loop!

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:27.330
Say, Yanagi, it's not often
you go out on a Sunday.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.330
Where'd you go? Where'd you go?

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:34.960
Nah, it's okay. It doesn't
have anything to do with you.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.960
Huh? Why?

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.130
Now I feel all lonely...

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:44.640
If I tell Dad, it'll only start up
the noise and fuss again.

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.060
Oops. Were you studying?

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:56.980
We got a little loud, huh. Sorry, Kiri.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.360
Kiri's ticked.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:04.870
It's finals. He's all stressed out.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:08.080
He's not great at studying.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.540
I've got exams, too, as it happens.

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:15.880
Well, I'm not worried
about you for a second.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.590
You're an ace student!

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.710
I heard that. I heard <i>everything</i>!

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:22.550
I crave physical activity!

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:26.010
Yeah--no club stuff during exams.

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:28.260
But your studies are important.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.520
You worked hard
to test into that high school--

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.560
now work hard to keep your grades up.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:38.520
You can do all the club activities
you want once finals are over.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:42.610
I know... but even then...

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:48.580
Oh, right: Winter's all about building
stamina--running, working out.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.580
Even if you start back up
after exams, it's not much fun.

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:54.080
Yeah, exactly!

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.080
That's a whole other issue,
though, isn't it?

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.550
I guess, yeah...

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:04.050
I hate studying.
I can't help stressing out.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:06.550
And I'm supposed to take exams like this?

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:09.510
Dad?

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:15.770
Can I ask you a favor? Don't tell Mom.

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:18.770
Kiri...

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:22.150
Your father would <i>love</i> that!

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:25.650
Right after his daughter's curt
brush-off got him feeling lonely,

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:30.450
he was thrilled to have his
rebellious-phase son ask him a favor.

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:38.500
Yes! Finally, some exercise!

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.460
I've got all this excess energy.

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:48.840
As if I can just study all the time...

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:52.010
Dad gave me a free pass for this place.

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:53.810
It sure is clean!

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:58.100
Jeez, should I join for real?

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.770
Kiri Uzaki, 17. High-school junior.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:06.200
Member of the swim club,
where his times are just above average.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.870
His athletic ability is so-so.

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:13.290
Dad said there were lots of seniors here;

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:16.790
yep: nothin' but grannies and grandpas.

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:21.340
Nice! With no other young people
around, I'm literally peerless!

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.300
Also? Small fry!

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:29.090
Time to really get all
that exam-studying anger out!

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:39.480
Okay. So that's about where everyone is.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.360
Whereas <i>I</i>...

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.820
...will go with <i>this</i>.

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:46.650
Youngsters sure are different!

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:49.150
You're really going that heavy?

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:54.620
I usually go even heavier, but I'm a
little rusty with clubs out of session.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.500
Gotta ease in.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:01.250
Wow! And you usually lift <i>more</i> than that?

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:03.340
Impressive!

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:06.420
Oh, it's nothing, really.

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:13.260
I'll try that next.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:18.640
Maintain proper form at the bench press
and set the safety bars correctly.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.230
Ooh, can you really lift that much?

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:25.690
Well, I'm rusty. I figured I'd start here.

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:28.110
Young people are amazing!

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:31.450
Really, it's noth--

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:45.090
You do find the occasional
super-buff old guy...

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:48.260
I'll make sure not to work out near him.

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:00.060
Wow, that's fast.

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:01.940
Nah--I'm rusty.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:05.400
I'll kick up the speed
a little once I'm used to it.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.400
Really? Faster than that?

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.740
You're something else!

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:10.900
It's n--

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:36.430
Hey, Sakurai!

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:40.180
I'd like to use the pool.
It's open to club members, right?

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.520
Of course! Use it as long as you like.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:49.400
You said you were experienced--go ahead
and use the advanced lane.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.530
The advanced lane?

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:57.870
"End"
"Slope, Walking, Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced"

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:56.660
The lane on the far right as you enter--
generally meant for folks who can swim.

00:16:56.660 --> 00:17:01.500
Rules may vary from gym to gym,
so check first.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:06.750
The lane's all set up and labeled,
but no one uses it. Such a waste!

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:09.250
We get lots of older folks with weak legs.

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:11.130
Aha.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:15.680
Since you'll be in there alone,
you can really put some oomph into it.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.470
So don't worry--enjoy yourself.

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.430
Got it.

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:22.640
Thank you.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:28.770
From that look on his face, I'd say
Sakurai's got something on his mind again.

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:31.900
Ah, youth...

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:34.280
Girl trouble again, I bet.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:39.580
Fujio still had no idea that
the "girl" was his own daughter.

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:43.500
Dammit. What's the deal
with those old-timers?

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.500
Whatever. The real workout starts now.

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:52.760
An indoor pool!

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:59.390
I'm sure it'd love to be used by
an actual athlete instead of old people.

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:02.970
I figured I had the
advanced lane to myself, but...

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:05.100
There's a big dude here.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:09.360
Ah, if he comes to a gym
full of nothing but old farts,

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.150
he can't be that great.

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:18.860
I <i>thought</i> there was someone
in the advanced lane for once.

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:22.660
So humans really <i>can</i> swim that fast!

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.290
Wow. Amazing!

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:33.050
It must feel great
to be able to swim like that!

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:36.010
It did not.

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:38.430
He's so <i>fast</i>! What the hell?!

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:43.720
We're getting further and further apart!
Dammit, Dad! You tricked me!

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:47.180
How can I blow off steam
with <i>this</i> guy around?

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:50.350
I don't know who he is,
but he's always out in front.

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:52.310
<i>Now</i> I'm pissed!

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:56.280
That does it! I'm gonna catch up, dammit!

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.030
Meanwhile, over by Sakurai...

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:01.620
Forget getting it out of my head.

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.620
It might be because you're special.

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:10.580
The more time passes,
the more it weighs on me!

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:13.590
It might be because you're special.

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:18.920
Why did I say that?!

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:24.390
I'll just have to swim hard enough
that I can't think of anything else!

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:26.220
Until I'm totally beat!

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:31.440
Exercise had become
Sakurai's escape from distress.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.650
--Gotta drive it out!
--It might be because you're special.

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:37.440
--Forget. Forget. Forget!
--...because you're special.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.900
Dammit! I'm staying on him,
even if it's pure stubbornness!

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.490
I <i>will</i> catch up, I <i>will</i>...

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.370
When did he wind up behind me?!

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:49.830
What's <i>with</i> him?

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:53.460
What's with him? What's with him?

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:55.750
What's <i>with</i> this guy?!

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.890
I wound up getting passed. Twice.

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:06.310
And I was swimming at such a crazy pace...

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:17.730
Dammit. I'm dead on my feet.
<i>That</i> guy never rests.

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:19.610
I'm utterly defeate--

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:23.820
No! I just got out of
shape studying for exams!

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:27.240
I wasn't at the top of
my game, that's why!

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.750
Yeah! I was in a slump!

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:35.000
It's just like small fry to pile on excuse
after excuse at a time like this.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.670
I'm at my worst--mentally and physically!

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:39.710
Since it wasn't club or a tournament,

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:43.430
I couldn't get my head in
the game and give it my all!

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:48.470
Totally. If I were in peak condition,
I'd be winning on all counts!

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:49.720
It's <i>him</i>!

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:19.040
What's wrong with Kiri?

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:22.840
Who knows? He's been doing
that ever since he came home.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:26.760
Maybe we should make one
of his favorite dishes tonight.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:31.060
I'm home! Tsuki's... not around, is she?

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.980
Mom? She's in the bath.

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.140
Great!

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:40.360
Well, Kiri? How'd you
like your dad's workplace?

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:45.280
Let me know if you ever want to join up!

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.990
What's wrong? Something happen?

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:50.450
We've got plenty of gear, right?

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:54.330
Lots of room to swim in the advanced lane?

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:57.750
What is it?

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:01.130
A sense of absolute failure
was etched ever so deeply

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:04.050
into the young man's very soul.

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:39.980
