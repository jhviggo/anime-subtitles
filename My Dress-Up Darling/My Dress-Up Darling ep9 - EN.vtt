I'm home.

Gojo Dolls

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.440
Hello!

<b>Yuzawaya</b>

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.640
Does this take care of all the shopping?

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.520
Yes!

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.860
Also, the mannequin I ordered
 will be arriving today.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.970
For real? I'm super excited!

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.820
<b>The World's Hobby Shop</b>

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:17.240
Oh, hey, Gojo-kun...

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.510
How's this?

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.800
Dude, you totally screamed.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.960
Don't scare me like that.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.260
B-B-But you suddenly... 
sh-showed me your underwear—

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.340
It's a swimsuit. I bought it earlier 
and just wore it out of the store.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.670
<b>This part</b>

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.720
I think we can use a swimsuit. Are there 
swimsuits that sit that high above the hips?

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.760
You mean a high-waisted swimsuit?

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.840
I totally have one
 One sec

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.650
Also, when we were talking 
about the outfit yesterday,

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.050
I sent you a pic, which you totally 
saw, but you never replied.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.050

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.050
It looks like this
It's not quite right though, huh?

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.050
Let's go look at swimsuits tomorrow

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.390

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.390
What's with that? It was so rude.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.390
Harumph

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.260
W-Well...

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.390
<i>A lot happened after I saw that photo...</i>

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.380
I had such a hard time finding
 any high-waisted ones.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.400
I finally found an imported 
one. Isn't it awesome?

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.360
Gojo-kun?

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.070
U-Um... If you could just...

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.040
Leave me alone for a bit.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.320
<b>Squee~</b>

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.210
What's this? Could it be?

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.700
Are you excited?

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.330
Oh, Gojo-kun, you little perv—

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.930
I'm sorry! The swimsuit is fine!

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.170
Just, please! Do not! Touch me right now!

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.280
Wait, are you mad? My bad.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.190
I'm not mad... Just please, 
leave me be for now...

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.990
This is totally random, but do you ever 
blow on cold noodles to cool them off?

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.920
Yes.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.690
<b>Ahaha</b>

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.690
Isn't it like, totally embarrassing 
when you realize it?

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.160
This turned out super nice!

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.870
I'm so happy right now.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.340
You seem very happy.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.240
Of course I am!

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.670
It feels so nice when you feel 
like you're actually being useful.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.910
I mean, getting all up in my feels just for 
painting this thing is a bit much, but...

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.880
<i>So I... was actually useful.</i>

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.060
It's so frickin' pretty! I'm even 
more hyped for this cosplay now!

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.930
Maybe I'll try it on.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.560
Wait, Kitagawa-san!

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.190
I totally don't mind you watching.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.360
I-I absolutely will not! 
What are you talking about?!

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.450
I've got a fancy bra on today,
 so I totes don't mind.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.270
Lookie!

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.990

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.380
<b>Gojo Dolls</b>

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:04.970
So effing cute.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.550
How is it, Inui-san?

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.070
It's amazing.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.050
It fits me perfectly. It's gorgeous.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.010
So precious...

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.540
Is it hard to move around in at all?

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.220
No, it's fine.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.170
If there's anything you're not 
satisfied with, please let me know.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.440
Well...

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.030
The skirt could be poofier.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.490
<b>Ask Inui-san.</b>

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.490
<b>Make all the decorations
 on the cap gold.</b>

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.490
<b>Upper arm 23 cm
Use a fabric 
that'll stretch easily.</b>

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.490
<b>Military uniform base.
Outlines her figure well.</b>

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.490
<b>Think about how the
 fabric fits around her 
arms and hips.</b>

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.490
<b>Add a crease to 
accent her eyelids</b>

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.490
<b>Put on 
6 buttons.</b>

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.490
<b>Waist 
55 cm</b>

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.490
<b>Use cosplay tape
 to make her eyes 
narrower</b>

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.490
<b>Add eyeliner to make
 her eyes more beautiful.</b>

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.490
<b>Light blue 
color contacts</b>

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.490
Oh, you're right. Should we 
try putting in some wiring?

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.830
I think we'll be fine if I just wear 
a firm tutu underneath. I have one.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:34.920
All right.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.950
Would you like to try the cape, too?

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:37.600
Yes.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.850
I wanna see!

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.070
You used embossed fabric for the lining.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.170
It's beautiful.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.700
The only thing is this fabric is a bit thick, 
so it might be harder to pose in.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:49.840
It's fine.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.110
If we take multiple shots while I'm moving,
 it'll look like it's waving, too.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.940
The heavier fabric will actually look nicer.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.260
<i>She sounds super cool! I wish I sounded like 
I actually knew what I was talking about!</i>

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.780
How's yours, Kitagawa-san?

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.780
Uh, yup.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.460
Um, uh...

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.870
This part is like squeeze, and...

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:11.660
It's insane!

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.910
The thingies on my shoulders 
are cool, too, and...

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.080
mega insane!

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.580
And this part is too cute, and...

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.420
It's super-duper insane!

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.670
<b>Blush</b>

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.770
You don't have to push yourself.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.670
Thank you so much.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.680
Kitagawa-san, I'd like to do your makeup 
and have you put your wig on, too,

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.060
so let's get your hair up.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.220
Okay!

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.110
Marin Kitagawa.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.110
Is this the only shade of
 foundation you have?

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.770
Yes.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.360
If you choose a tone that's one shade lighter

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.490
when you're wearing a light 
wig, it'll match better.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.200
Use some color-correcting makeup, too.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.660
<b>Juju-sama'<b>s

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:54.160
<b>Base layer</b>

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.970
I think blue might work 
well for Black Lobelia.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:54.160
<b>Purple or blue 
color-corrector</b>

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.120
<b>This will make your

She is an enemy, after all.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.160
<b>Foundation</b>

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.940
If you don't have any, you 
can use mine for the shoot.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.160
Really? That'd be super awesome!

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.160
<b>This will make you 
skin look even lig</b>

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.640
All right, let's change 
the shape of your eyes.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.410
Wait, what?!

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.160
We'll use cosplay tape.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.960
Inui-san told me about it, so I bought some.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:09.550
<b>We want to turn this</b>

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:06.300
I didn't think fake eyelashes would accurately
 depict Black Lobelia's sharper eye shape.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:09.550
<b>into this</b>

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.900
Also, I was curious to see how it worked.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.550
Noice. Let's give it a shot!

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.890
Take the corner of the eye and 
lift up gradually diagonally.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.050
Like this?

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.720
This feels weird.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.740
Once you apply it, use bobby pins to
 keep the wig cap and tape in place.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.560
And my eyebrows?

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.520
Should I shave 'em off?

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.850
This time, your eyebrows should
 be even, so you don't have to.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.070
Wait, you shaved them totally off last time?

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.770
We're done.

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.490
Yeah, looks good.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.310
Good job. Hey, hand me a mirror.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.770
Sure, here you go.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:48.630
Holy... crap! Does my face 
always look like this?!

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.010
I... Have I...

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.440
Have I always been Black Lobelia?!

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.470
No, you dummy.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.850
That wig's a great color. Where's it from?

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.690
Swallowtail! It really is beautiful.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.400

<b>Beaming</b>

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.800
I'm even more hyped now!

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.360
I can't wait until our group cosplay!

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.950
<b>Gloom</b>

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.950
I was so looking forward to it...

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:15.580
<b>Fukudaya</b>

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.430
Sudden rainstorms are common
 this time of year. It happens.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.580
It's cooler and darker now, and this 
fits the image more, so it's fine.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.710
I know, but it just brings 
down the mood, you know?

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.930
That corset is really nice.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.130
I love Black Lobelia's outfit.

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.120
You totally get it!

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.930
Corsets just kinda rule, don't they?

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:40.930
Maybe also 'cause it 
looks kinda like a dress.

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:42.690
And it's ruffly but still Gothic.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:47.720
Ever since I was a kid, I loved the difference
 between Neon-oneetama and Black Lobelia.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.190
So I'm super stoked to be cosplaying her!

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:51.370
Yeah...

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:54.280
Actually... I have a request.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.120
What?

00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:01.500

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:56.400

Could we get a picture t-together... maybe?

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.140
Sure, whatever.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.590

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.800
<b>Right in the feels...</b>

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:13.010
Thank you so much... I can't right now...

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:15.330
Is it okay if I tweet this?

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.800
Sure... But your makeup's running.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.980
Shinju sure is late.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.310
It usually doesn't take her 
this long to get ready.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:26.230
<b>I'll go check on her</b>

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.230
Gojo-kun's not back yet, either.

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:28.650
Ohmigod, I'm getting so many likes!

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.670
My photos barely ever get any!

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.020
Juju-sama, you're too amazing! I can't!

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.920
That's because you usually only 
upload pictures of your meals.

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.840
What's with the pics of fried rice
 with all kinds of stuff on it?

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.330
Oh, that's my cooking.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:41.370
You must be kidding.

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:45.580
I'm getting a ton of replies! 
"Wow, Juju actually exists."

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.430
Of course I do! What the hell?

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:50.330
Well, you never go to 
cosplay events, Juju-sama.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.270
Sorry to keep you waiting!

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:56.010
Heya, what took you so long—

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:57.340
Huh?!

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:03.410
Wait...

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.270
Wait, Inui-san?

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:09.020
What's wrong? Inui-san?!

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:10.550
Inui-san!

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.030
<b>Scouting (Location Hunting) Day</b>

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:15.120
I'm so sorry.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:18.240
<b>Gloom</b>

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.240
I'm the one who wanted to go, 
and I ended up fainting.

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:22.490
Oh, no worries! Shinju-chan and I 
managed to check the whole place out.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:23.140
Yes.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:25.710
I took pictures, so we can look at 
them together when we get home.

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.110
Okay...

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:29.000
I guess you weren't feeling well.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.380
I'm sorry I didn't realize it sooner.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.130
I-I feel just fine...

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.280
Then can we call it a day?

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.350
That's a good idea.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:41.240
Okay.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.730
I have plans with Nowa and the others 
in Shibuya, so I'll see you guys later.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.940
Finals are coming up, so we're 
gonna get hyped at karaoke.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.520
Just study like normal people.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.360
See you, Gojo-kun!

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.190
Yes.

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:54.440
We should get going, too.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.430
This is my first time at Shim-Misato,

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.850
so do you mind if I browse 
the shops by the station first?

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:02.450
Okay, I'm going to head home first, then.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.760
Be careful.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.640
Okay.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:07.020
Um...

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.260
Is something wrong?

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.570
Did you have another
 question about the camera?

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:13.460
Oh, n-no...

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:17.130
If I've got the wrong idea, 
I apologize in advance.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:18.100
But, um...

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:24.960
Did you actually want to 
cosplay, too, Inui-san?

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:27.590
When we first met the other day,

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:30.400
I wondered if it was hard to 
say so in front of your sister.

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:37.850
I'm sorry! I m-must've had the wrong idea!

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.290
Please forget I ever said 
anything. I'll be going now!

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.530
I-I would like to try it, actually...

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:51.830
I have a character that I love 
very much, so I'd love to try...

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.900
Just like Marin-san said,

00:10:54.900 --> 00:11:00.500
I've been jealous, watching my sister cosplay.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:01.050
Then...

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:03.760
But... I just can't!

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.520
I'd... never look good as this character.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:13.450
I'm not cute like my sister.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:18.440
I'm not skinny, and this character 
is completely different from me.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:23.730
I can't be like that... 
I'd end up looking weird.

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:25.850
So I shouldn't even try.

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:28.700
And...

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:34.190
If I ended up doing a weird cosplay,
 and upset my sister...

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:35.880
I don't know what I'd do if she hated me!

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:38.020
I'm too scared...

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:43.770
The other day...

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:49.770
I saw so many cosplayers enjoying 
cosplaying for the first time...

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:55.550
And thought that the best thing about cosplay
 is that you can be anything that you want.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.570
If you feel like trying it, 
even just a little,

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.200
you should definitely cosplay!

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.450
I'll help you.

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:11.620
And I'm pretty sure your sister 
would never judge you, Inui-san.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.500
Gojo-san, please...

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.880
Please help me!

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:23.510
Yes, of course!

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.100
So, what series did you want to cosplay from?

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.930
Well, actually...

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:32.140
I also want to cosplay a character 
from "Flower Princess Blaze!!"

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:33.600
<b>Fidget Fidget</b>

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:33.600
Oh, I see!

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.540
<i>I wonder who she wants to be?</i>

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:39.150
<i>She said it was someone different from her, 
so maybe it's the heroine, Mirai-chan.</i>

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:40.360
I...

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.070
want to be Soma-oniichan.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.910
Soma-oniichan?

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.370
I've always looked up to 
Soma-oniichan so much.

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:50.570
He's so strong and cool.

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:54.410
And whenever his little sister Mirai-chan is 
in trouble, he's always there to help her out.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.860
<b>Soft...</b>

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:57.880
He reminds me so much
 of my sister, I love him.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.460
I see...

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.080
While we're at it, why don't you join 
their cosplay group on the shoot day?

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.820
I'm sure they'd both be very happy.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.110
S-Sure!

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:09.470
B-But could you keep this a 
secret until the day of?

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:11.690
This is my first time, 
so I'm a bit embarrassed.

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:12.770
All right.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.000
Um... Do you really think I can pull it off?

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.270
What do you mean?

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:22.780
I'm f-f-fat... so I have a hard 
time fitting in some clothes...

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:25.400
<i>I wouldn't really call that "fat"...</i>

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:30.030
And I only have my allowance, 
so I don't have much money...

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:33.900
<i>That's right! She looks 
so much older, I forgot!</i>

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.540
<i>She's in middle school, so she 
can't work a part-time job yet!</i>

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.800
<i>That's going to be rough. 
I won't be able to make a costume...</i>

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:43.420
<i>N-No. Cosplay can definitely 
be an expensive hobby,</i>

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:45.560
<i>but it's not like everyone 
has a lot of money to spare.</i>

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.390
<i>They should be able to enjoy 
it even with limited funds.</i>

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.550
<i>There has to be a way.</i>

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:52.220
<i>Think... Think!</i>

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:55.830
O-Of course, it must be too difficult...

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:56.610
No!

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.400
I'll definitely figure it out!

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:06.740
<b>Gojo Dolls</b>

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.690
First, let's start with the outfit.

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:06.740
Right...

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.410
If we use this uniform for your outfit, 
we won't have to buy one.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.160
Is this your uniform, Gojo-san?

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:20.330
<b>Please adopt me</b>

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.910
I remembered a thought I had while  
 watching "Flower Princess Blaze!!"

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:19.520
Soma-oniichan and Sakuya's uniform 
looks like the one from my school.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:20.830
It really does!

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.670
Is it really okay to borrow it?

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:23.420
Yes.

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.130
I'm not sure if it'll fit you, but...

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:27.060
Hup.

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:33.010
<i>If Kitagawa-san had been the one who 
wanted to cosplay Soma-oniichan...</i>

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:40.520
<b>Dude, this is huge on me</b>

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.180
Dude, this is huge on me!

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:37.730
<i>W-Would I have lent her my uniform?</i>

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:39.750
Gojo-san! I did it!

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.520
<b>Flinch</b>

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:40.520
Okay!

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:42.340
How does it—

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:42.860
<b>Yikes!</b>

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.070
<b>Gonna</b>

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.070

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:49.240
<b>Shake</b>

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:53.490
<b>Boom!</b>

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.080
I-I-I-I'm so sorry about the buttons!

00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:02.630
<b>Awawawa</b>

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.180
Inui-san, your front! Your front!

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:06.550
<b>Sad</b>

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:04.730
I'm so sorry...

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:07.460
Oh, no problem. I can sew 
this back on in no time.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.020
The size seemed about right, though.

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:11.860
A little hemming should do the trick.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:15.010
Yes. I'll be rolling up the sleeves, 
so the length was perfect, too.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.140
So, the only problem is your che—

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:21.030
I-I mean, how to make you look 
like you have a guy's physique.

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.900
Right...

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:26.290
<i>At this rate, she'd just 
be wearing a guy's uniform.</i>

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:29.710
<i>I guess we'll have to somehow 
make her chest stand out less</i>

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:32.070
<i>and somehow make her look like a guy...</i>

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.170
<i>Hina dolls wouldn't have this problem...</i>

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:37.700
<i>They also wear a kimono, 
so there aren't any buttons.</i>

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:39.290
<i>Kimono...</i>

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:40.080
<i>That's it!</i>

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.170
<b>Ta-da!</b>

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.680
Let's try a sarashi wrap!

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:49.510
Not having cleavage would help a lot

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.790
If we use a sarashi to give 
you a more even shape,

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:47.320
I think we can make you look more like a guy.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.680
How about we give it a try?

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:49.510
All right.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.660
<i>Come to think of it, Kitagawa-san 
wore two NuBras...</i>

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.290
<i>Changing how your face and body 
look just to look like a character</i>

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:05.060
<i>is actually pretty amazing...</i>

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.150
But

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.150
But...

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.520
<i>It's basically the ultimate form of love!</i>

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.360
<i>I love her, so I want to be her!</i>

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:19.290
<i>I think it's because they love these characters
 so much that they're able to do this.</i>

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.880
My stomach doesn't stand out as much anymore,

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:35.930
but my chest still—

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:36.970
Right...

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:42.280
Also, that shirt still eventuates your curves, 
 showing your girlish figure,

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.770
so we'll have to adjust the shoulders, too.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:48.680
Soma-oniichan is really athletic, 
so I'd like to make him look strong.

Hello, I hope you don't mind me answering. I'd recommend a B holder. 
I also had a hard time getting my chest small enough when I would 
cosplay guys, but after using a B holder and some taping, I managed to 
get the physique I was going for. I would recommend you give that a shot.

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:00.870
I wonder what that is.

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:07.750
<b>Chest flattener with hooks</b>

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:07.750
Undergarment that will help flatten the volume of your chest when cross-dressing, cosplaying, 
or wearing formal clothes. For B~H cups. It can almost completely flatten your chest.

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:07.750
*"B Holder" is a registered trademark of LBeRoad.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:03.640
Wow, it changes this much?!

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.170
They have my size, too!

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:08.100
But something this amazing 
must be really expensive—

We can actually adjust

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.680
Yes! I'll buy it right now!

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:19.530
Now we just have to get you a wig.

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:24.060
I'd like to buy it when I go shopping next, 
so may I measure your head circumference?

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:24.980
Sure, of course.

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:30.500
Please look straight forward, 
and sit up straight...

I-I'm so sorry! That wasn't on purpose!

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:41.710
I-It's... It's okay! I'm so sorry!

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:47.610
Sorry to have you come all 
this way when you live so far away.

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:48.540
It's fine.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.130
I bought your wig.

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:55.760
<b>Necessary items
-Scissors
-Hair clip
-Comb
-Mannequin head
-Hair wax, etc.</b>

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:55.760
Your cosplay is a secret, so let's 
go ahead and cut it ourselves.

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:55.760
<b>Section off the hair</b>

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:55.760
<b>Don't try to cut 
everything at once 
to make sure 
it's all balanced</b>

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:55.760
<b>Set with

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:55.760
<b>Complete</b>

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:01.960
<i>Amazing...</i>

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.770
<i>This is his first time, and he's 
showing no hesitation at all.</i>

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.450
...Ghh.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:23.790
This sure is nerve-racking.

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:25.790
<b>Blank</b>

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:30.100
It's hard to cut when I know I can't mess up.

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:33.990
Oh, I'm sorry!

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:37.040
I was just relieved that you 
feel like that sometimes, too.

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.700
O-Of course I do!

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.930
You make such amazing outfits,

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.390
<b>Look</b>

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:43.730
so I thought you were super 
talented and could do anything.

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:46.240
Oh, no! There's so much that I can't do!

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.920
Even now, I'm trying to figure things out.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.690
Really?

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:56.150
There's someone who I really 
look up to in my class.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:00.480
She's a ray of sunshine, 
loved by everyone around her.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.370
She's incredibly strong and able 
to say whatever's on her mind.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:08.710
I figured that she didn't 
have troubles like I did.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.310
But then, one thing led to another,

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:15.920
and I ended up spending a lot of time
 with her, and I found out...

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:19.740
She also had things she 
wanted to do but couldn't...

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.340
Things didn't always go her way.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.180
She even messed up at times.

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:26.350
She has the same feelings I do...

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:28.770
She was just so happy...

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:34.160
She can be really cute sometimes.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.440
<b>Gasp</b>

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:38.570
I-I didn't mean to make it sound like that!

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:41.530
Um... Wait...

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:43.420
What was I trying to say?

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:44.570
Well...

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:49.920
We can't see what they're feeling inside,

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.080
but everyone has a lot going on.

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:54.600
I'll continue to cut this.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:01.830
<i>Everyone has a lot going on...</i>

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.760
<i>Is that how it is?</i>

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.140
Let's do your makeup, too.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:14.650
<b>Proud</b>

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:14.650

<b>Grand Total:

Yay!!</b>

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:09.910
I got all your makeup at a hundred-yen shop,

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:12.310
so the total for everything 
was under 10,000 yen.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.650
Thank you so much!

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:17.270
First time applying
 foundation

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.980
Next, let's do your eyes.

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.390
To make your eyes look a little more manly,

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:25.100
we'll extend the eyeliner a bit.

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.120
Lastly, we'll adjust the wig and...

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:30.410
This is...

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:32.240
Sh...

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.190
Shinju?

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:39.300
U-Um... You see...

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:42.800
I-I... also...

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.330
t-tried cosplaying...

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:52.060
You look amazing! Absolutely 
amazing! Seriously amazing!

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:53.920
I couldn't actually tell it was you, Shinju!

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.920
What she said, though!

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.340
Holy crap, holy crap, I can't!

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:57.520
You actually look like the real Soma-kun!

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:58.770
I thought the real Soma-oniichan 
showed up for a sec and freaked!

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.520
Um...

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.230
I can't believe it! Is this real? You're Shinju?!

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:01.230
Like, what?! He's actually 
here! The real deal is here!

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:01.230
Uh... I-I...

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:05.740
You really look wonderful! 
Absolutely lovely, Shinju!

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.030
You look <i>so</i> good!

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:13.410
Isn't this great?

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.220
Yes...

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:20.960
Hey, Shinju-chan!

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.000
How'd you... where'd your boobies go?!

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.220
It's a total mystery!

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.280
I bound my chest using a 
B Holder and a sarashi wrap.

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:29.260
He also added shoulder pads.

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:31.260
You have a girly face!

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:32.770
Girly?

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.900
You've got the powerful presence 
of a dude, but your smile is so girly,

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:36.970
the difference is amazing!

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:37.930
Ohemgee, this is awesome!

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:40.000
I can't right now! Or rather...

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.460
Can I take a selfie with you?

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:42.530
Let's take one together!

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:43.900
Please!

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:48.760
Sure.

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:53.010
H-Hey! Let's take one more! This time...

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:55.370
Er, we should get started 
before our time runs out...

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:58.820
Oh, right! It's 15,000 yen per hour!
 Shinju, get the camera...

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:00.090
R-Right!

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:03.470
That camera costs 190,000 yen...

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:02.560
Oh, shit!

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:05.050
B-Be more careful, for crying out loud!

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:05.050
We're okay.

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:40.060
Episode 10

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:40.060
