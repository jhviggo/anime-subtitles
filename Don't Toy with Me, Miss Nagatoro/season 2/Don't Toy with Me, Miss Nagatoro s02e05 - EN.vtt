00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.590
Top of the mornin', Senpai.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.200
H-Hey.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.970
M-Morning, Nagatoro.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:36.690
<i>Wait a second...</i>

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.100
<i>Her first name...</i>

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.220
Hayase-chan!

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.480
I brought your album!

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.100
Kazehaya Elementary School

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.860
Let's go through it with 
Senpai-kun, Hayase-chan!

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.650
Morning, Hayase.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.900
<i>No, no, no!</i>

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.030
<i>That's way too creepy.</i>

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.940
<i>Don't get ahead of yourself.</i>

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.260
M-Morning, Nagatoro.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.530
Senpai...

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.400
You're already creepy this early in the morning.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.050
Shut up.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.130
Hey...

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.650
Senpai...

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.450
Wh-Wh-What?!

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.450
Look at you getting all flustered!

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.610
Is your heart racing?

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.850
Pupupu!

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.980
N-N-Not really.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.110
See? Look!

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:02.350
<b>Top things girls do that get a guy's heart racing!!</b>

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.740
I read this online yesterday.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.950
"Top things girls do that 
get a guy's heart racing."

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.350
Number three:

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.260
Swishing hair.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.600
Number two:

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.450
Looking up at you.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.110
And number one:

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.580
Tugging on your sleeve.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.430
Y-You shouldn't take what you 
read online too seriously.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.450
Oh, come on, you were 
totally flustered just now.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.000
You're so obvious, Senpai.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.880
I'm not flustered.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.440
You just surprised me because 
you tugged at me out of nowhere.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.150
See?

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.610
You're flustered.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:43.910
I'm not.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.700
<i>It had me flustered at first, 
but now it's just annoying.</i>

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.780
<i>I know!</i>

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.100
<i>What if I grabbed her sleeve instead?</i>

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.130
<i>I could slow her down!</i>

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.260
Look at you two, so early in the morning.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.110
They're at it again.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.270
They are.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.510
No!

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.520
I was just...

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.520
Just...?

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.740
Sleeve lifting and pulling hip throw!

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.740
I was just practicing judo moves on Senpai!

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.190
No one's buying that.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.990
No way.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.300
Nopers.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.760
<b>DON'T TOY WITH ME,

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.760
<b>DON'T TOY WITH ME,

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:25.470
<b></b>So This Is Your Room, Huh, <b>Senpai</b>?

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:36.980
Uh-oh...

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.080
I think I have a cold.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.120
Oh, dear.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.990
That's not good.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.240
I have a business trip today.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.200
Well, what can you do?

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.500
I'll cancel it.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.080
It's fine.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.680
I'm not a kid.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.330
I don't know.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.520
It's just a cough.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.130
It's no big deal.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.690
Are you sure?

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:07.550
Sorry.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.640
I'll be home as soon as I can.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.430
It's fine.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.000
Okay, see you.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.170
<b>Art Room</b>

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:49.810
<i>Bored...</i>

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.390
<i>Senpai, where are you?</i>

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:03.020
Senpai, where are you?

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:07.940
Why aren't you in the club room?

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:07.940
Have you escaped?

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:07.940
Fled overseas?

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:07.940
Hiding in a suitcase?

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.880
<i>Why aren't you in the club room?</i>

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.180
<i>Have you escaped?</i>

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.930

<i>Hiding in a suitcase?</i>

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.870
<i>Nagatoro!</i>

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.610
<i>She must be frustrated because 
she has no one to toy with.</i>

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.950
<i>I kinda caught a cold, 
so I stayed home.</i>

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.580
I kinda caught a cold, 
so I stayed home.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.080
I kinda caught a cold, 
so I stayed home.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:20.500
<i>For real?!</i>

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.080
For real?!

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.580
I kinda caught a cold, 
so I stayed home.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.580
For real?!

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:21.990
<i>For real.</i>

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.080

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.080
Nagatoro

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:27.090
Nagatoro

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.340
Yes? Hello?

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.590
Senpai!

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.560
<i>You're so loud.</i>

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.470
Oh, sorry.

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:36.950
So, uh...

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:38.740
Are you all right?

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:40.050
<i>Y-Yeah.</i>

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.600
<i>It's not a big deal.</i>

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.000
<i>Just a slight cough.</i>

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.360
Yeah?

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.030
<i>Senpai...</i>

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:47.860
Hm?

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:49.410
Uh...

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:51.210
Sorry.

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:53.490
I gave you my cold.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.750
It's not your fault.

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:59.130
<i>Senpai!</i>

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.080
Sorry, I can't stop coughing.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.500
<i>I'm sorry, Senpai.</i>

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.610
You should go to bed.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:10.510
You'll get in trouble if your parents 
see you awake with a cold, after all.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.560
<i>N-No.</i>

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.870
<i>My mom's at work.</i>

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:18.510
What?! You're home alone?

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.570
Are you okay?

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:21.780
<i>I'm fine.</i>

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.550
<i>It's not a big deal.</i>

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.580
<i>Bye.</i>

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:37.660
<i>I'm not sleepy, but I guess I'll lie down.</i>

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.270
The doorbell...

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.180
It's hard to get up.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.490
It stopped.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.560
Guess they're gone.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.530
'Sup, Senpai?

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.140
Uh... um...

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:19.530
Wh-What?

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:24.790
Oh, I just thought you might 
be conked out from your cold.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.290
S-So you came to check up on me?

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.600
I think you've got the wrong idea!

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.520
You're a lanky bean sprout.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.050
You have zero stamina.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.980
I asked the bunny ears lady where you lived,

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.570
and I rang the doorbell, but no one answered.

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:49.220
So I thought you might 
have legit passed out,

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.190
so I had no choice but to come in.

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:54.480
No, it's just a cold.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.070
<i>I guess I'm in no position to speak.</i>

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.760
Wh-Why don't you come in, I guess?

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.830
'Kay, thanks for having me.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:07.460
Actually, wait!

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:08.990
Why?!

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:12.020
I mean, I don't want you to catch my cold.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.840
Don't worry about that.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.340
You probably got it from me to begin with.

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:26.070
I have a sort of immunity 
to the Senpai virus.

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:29.600
Your bean sprout virus is no match for me!

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.050
Okay, I'm coming in!

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:33.610
Uh-huh...

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:38.610
Senpai!

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:42.240
Your cold's going to get worse 
if you sleep on the sofa!

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.620
True.

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:48.210
<i>I'm starting to feel really sick.</i>

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.110
You'd better go sleep in bed.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:53.380
Y-Yeah...

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.120
Where's your room?

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.290
Upstairs.

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:57.330
Gotcha.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.130
And where are the stairs?

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:00.990
This way?

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.470
Y-You don't need to shove.

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.260
Just go!

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:09.770
<i>This is turning into a situation.</i>

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:12.150
Huh...

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:15.730
So this is your room, huh, Senpai?

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.980
<i>Nagatoro's in my room...</i>

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.310
<i>This feels kinda weird.</i>

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:29.330
You keep it surprisingly tidy in here.

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:35.150
But you're hiding your pervy books 
somewhere in here, aren't you?

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:35.790
<i>Per—!</i>

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:37.430
<i>Sh-Shoot!</i>

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:40.240
<i>I shouldn't have let her in!</i>

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.060
I-I don't have such books.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.560
Under the bed.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.810
In the drawers.

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:50.400
Back of the shelves!

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.950
Under here!

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:54.060
S-Stop it!

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.520
Whoa, Senpai!

00:11:57.930 --> 00:11:59.550
Sorry, Senpai.

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:01.180
Come on, you should go to bed.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.370
I won't go through your stuff today.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:04.410
"Today"?

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:05.910
Just go!

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:07.280
Hurry up.

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:08.950
Th...

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.290
Thanks.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:20.310
Senpai, do you have a thermometer?

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:24.180
I don't... remember where...

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.130
Senpai, never mind the thermometer.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:59.460
Yup, you have a pretty bad fever, Senpai.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.410
Your face is beet red, Senpai!

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:09.980
<b>DON'T TOY WITH ME,
MISS NAGATORO</b>

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:14.980
<b>DON'T TOY WITH ME,
MISS NAGATORO</b>

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.030
<i>I'm getting woozy.</i>

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:29.120
<i>The ceiling's moving.</i>

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.700
<i>So hot...</i>

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.700
<i>So cool...</i>

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:46.050
Nagatoro.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.360
I thought about using the sticky things,

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.700
but I figured this is still the way to go.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.420
I do this when I get a cold, too.

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:55.410
How is it?

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.150
Y-Yeah...

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:59.310
It feels good, I think.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:22.740
No, like I said, he has a cold.

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:26.090
Huh? Y-Yeah.

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:27.820
Yes, my senpai.

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:31.140
No, it's not like that.

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:32.770
Whatever.

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:33.880
Bye.

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.620
Sorry about this.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:39.600
I-It's fine, really.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:46.740
I-I don't mind, but when is 
your family getting home?

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.650
I'll check...

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:53.740
Sorry

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:53.740
I won't be home
until pretty late

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:53.740
How are you feeling?

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.740
Seems she's getting home late.

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:55.990
Seriously?

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.000
Senpai, do you have an appetite?

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:05.300
A bit.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.510
I haven't eaten all day.

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:11.130
Okay, I'll make you something.

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.800
N-No, you don't have to do that.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.220
It's getting late.

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:18.140
You can go home now.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.510
Don't be so polite.

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:22.150
You don't get to be like that, Senpai.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:27.010
I'll treat you to my 
favorite extra spicy dish.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.730
Nah, I'm just kidding.

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:34.660
I'll make something you can eat, 
even when you're as sick and limp as you are.

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:38.160
Okay, I'm borrowing your kitchen.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.410
Wait, I might have to do some shopping.

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:45.990
Stay put for a while, Senpai.

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:48.210
Hey, wait...

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.830
<i>I'm so dizzy.</i>

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.760
<i>Everything's a daze.</i>

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.320
<i>Like I'm in a dream.</i>

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:07.070
Well? You do have a fever, don't you?

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.560
Yeah.

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:12.070
Just take the day off from 
work and get some rest.

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:13.820
I'll do that.

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:16.250
I'll be okay on my own.

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:18.080
You have a meeting today, don't you?

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:19.830
Don't worry about that.

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:21.830
I have plenty of paid leave.

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:23.600
What's this?

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:28.940
You should depend on your 
wife for once, you know.

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:33.470
<i>What a creepy dream, even coming from me.</i>

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:36.590
Here, Senpai, I made you some congee.

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:38.600
O-Okay.

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:43.920
Here, say, "Ahh."

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:51.020
How does it taste?

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.110
Delicious.

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:53.440
Right?

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:57.120
You'd better be thankful for your cute wife.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.660
Yeah.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.120
Thanks, Hayase.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.330
Hm? What was that?

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:23.350
What was that?

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:28.340
Nuts.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.020
What was that?

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:40.620
What did you say just now?

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.630
Say it again, please.

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.510
If you're just playing dead...

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.310
Maybe I'll kiss you.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.540
Are you okay with that?

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:07.890
Are you okay with that, Senpai?

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:16.860
Are you okay with that?

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:19.160
I'm home.

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:22.640
Sorry I'm home so late.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.660
How are you doing?

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:37.180
I feel lighter.

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:39.130
I think my cold's better.

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:40.650
Morning.

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:41.980
Oh, morning.

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:43.510
Are you all better?

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:44.850
Yeah.

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:46.390
Thank goodness.

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.440
Sorry about yesterday.

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.260
I got home really late.

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.530
You were already asleep, 
so I didn't want to wake you up.

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:53.980
I said I'd be fine.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:55.930
It was just a slight fever.

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:56.810
Really?

00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:58.150
By the way...

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:00.530
Who was that cute girl?

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:02.630
C-Cute girl?

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:04.870
Y'know, the one who was over yesterday.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.330
I'm home.

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:18.740
Oh, my, are you a friend?

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.560
Th-Thanks for having me.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.840
I, er, heard he had a cold, so...

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.060
Oh, thank you very much.

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:28.230
N-No, it's nothing.

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:30.710
I should get going.

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:32.060
B-Bye.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.480
I really appreciate it.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.940
I'll give you a ride home, 
since it's late now.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.330
No, I'll be all right.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.010
I live pretty close.

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:44.760
Pardon me.

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:49.580
So, who is she?

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:52.400
No, she's just...

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.760
Is she your girlfriend?

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:54.830
No!

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.090
No.

00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:58.950
She's just one of my juniors.

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:08.660
<i>Man...</i>

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:11.030
<i>I know I was loopy because of the cold,</i>

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:13.100
<i>but that was a creepy dream.</i>

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.610
Thanks, Hayase.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:26.770
<i>How much...</i>

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:30.370
<b>Reality</b>

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:30.370
<b>Dream</b>

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:29.910
<i>How much of that was a dream?</i>

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.130
M-Morning.

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:43.510
Good morning.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.720
Are you feeling better?

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.270
Y-Yeah.

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:53.000
Thanks for everything yesterday.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.020
You were a real help.

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:56.650
It's fine.

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:58.270
I owed you, anyway.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:01.280
That was...

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:03.090
<i>A dream?</i>

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:04.800
<i>It was a dream.</i>

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:08.870
Anyway, now that you're better...

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:15.330
I'm getting back at you 
for all your jackassery!

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:17.690
Take that!

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:18.580
Take that!

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:19.460
Take that!

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:21.460
You stupid Senpai!

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.010
Stop!

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.220
Look at you two, so early in the morning.

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:34.010
They're at it again.

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:34.990
They are.

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:37.730
No, I was putting my foot down...

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:39.610
You were putting your foot down...

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.190
Lifting pulling ankle block!

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:48.510
I told you, I'm just practicing 
judo moves on Senpai!

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:49.570
Right, Senpai?

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:50.400
Urg...

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.920
No one's buying that.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.600
No way.

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:54.950
Nopers.

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:26.840
Points of improvement for today!

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:29.840
What were you fantasizing about 
in your fever dreams, Senpai?

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.600
You called me by my first name.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:32.880
I w-wasn't fantasizing or anything.

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.230
Okay, say it again, then.

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:35.680
I don't think you can.

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:36.760
All right...

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.350
Haya...

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:39.520
Sorry.

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:39.980
...se.
