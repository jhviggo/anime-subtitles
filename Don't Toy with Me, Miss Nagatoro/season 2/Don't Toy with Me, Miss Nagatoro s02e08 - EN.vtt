00:00.910 --> 00:04.100
This cabinet is nearly full with canvases...

00:04.100 --> 00:06.730
Doesn't look like it'll fit many more.

00:07.560 --> 00:09.360
Why don't you sell them?

00:09.650 --> 00:11.280
Like at an auction or something.

00:11.280 --> 00:12.400
No way.

00:12.400 --> 00:14.360
A student's work isn't going to sell.

00:14.360 --> 00:16.630
Yeah, you're right.

00:16.630 --> 00:18.400
Especially not your work.

00:18.400 --> 00:20.700
There's no way you're selling any.

00:21.500 --> 00:25.180
I think you can easily dispose of this one.

02:06.800 --> 02:10.020
<i>I feel like there's something 
I'd rather be drawing...</i>

02:34.940 --> 02:38.160
You were watching me just now,
 weren't you, Senpai?

02:38.160 --> 02:41.210
You were glancing at me just now, right?

02:41.210 --> 02:42.510
Right? Right?

02:42.860 --> 02:44.650
Were you just violating me with your eyes?

02:44.650 --> 02:46.120
Creepy creep!

02:46.120 --> 02:47.530
N-No!

02:47.530 --> 02:48.360
Oh?

02:48.360 --> 02:50.930
Did you need something, then?

02:50.930 --> 02:52.300
Well...

02:52.300 --> 02:56.400
I just realized, there's something 
I haven't drawn lately.

02:56.720 --> 02:58.330
What's that?

02:58.330 --> 03:00.610
P-Portraits.

03:08.370 --> 03:09.610
So?

03:10.010 --> 03:11.640
I-If...

03:12.730 --> 03:14.170
you'd like...

03:15.240 --> 03:16.690
would you...

03:19.670 --> 03:23.020
model for me again?

03:28.640 --> 03:31.910
Aw, I dunno...

03:31.910 --> 03:36.600
Believe it or not, I'm pretty busy.

03:36.600 --> 03:39.030
M-Maybe next time, then.

03:39.030 --> 03:41.160
Oh, all right.

03:41.160 --> 03:46.020
I can't say no if you insist, Senpai.

03:46.020 --> 03:48.540
Guess I'll have to take one for the team!

03:48.540 --> 03:51.180
Y-You don't need to do that!

03:52.260 --> 03:53.920
You're beet red!

03:53.920 --> 03:56.470
You're actually dying to 
draw something naughty.

03:56.470 --> 03:57.800
I'm not!

04:02.750 --> 04:05.300
What kind of pose do you like?

04:05.680 --> 04:07.810
A-Anything's fine.

04:10.260 --> 04:13.020
When someone asks you 
what you want for dinner,

04:13.240 --> 04:16.640
you're the kind of guy 
who's, like, "anything,"

04:16.640 --> 04:18.360
aren't you, Senpai?

04:19.200 --> 04:21.520
What do you want for dinner?

04:21.520 --> 04:22.590
Anything.

04:24.820 --> 04:25.820
Sorry.

04:25.820 --> 04:27.200
Then...

04:27.200 --> 04:30.120
Whatever pose comes most 
naturally to you, then.

04:30.680 --> 04:34.630
Natural, huh? Hmm...

04:35.800 --> 04:37.600
Something like this?

04:38.630 --> 04:40.240
Some kind of ready stance?

04:40.240 --> 04:42.130
Muay Thai.

04:42.710 --> 04:44.810
It actually looks convincing.

04:44.810 --> 04:47.640
Though, I only really dabbled.

04:47.640 --> 04:50.260
I can do other stuff, too.

04:50.260 --> 04:52.140
That's boxing, right?

04:52.720 --> 04:53.930
What's that?

04:53.930 --> 04:55.310
"Don't think."

04:55.310 --> 04:57.030
"Feel."

04:57.030 --> 04:57.900
Huh?

04:58.330 --> 05:01.200
This one's a bit more obscure.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.020
I don't know what that is.

05:04.450 --> 05:05.900
Capoeira!

05:07.780 --> 05:12.160
Those poses all suit Nagatoro,
 but I can't decide.

05:12.610 --> 05:14.370
Other than that...

05:22.240 --> 05:23.150
That's it!

05:24.110 --> 05:27.250
Oh, that wasn't it.

05:27.250 --> 05:29.230
No, I liked that one.

05:30.440 --> 05:34.100
That one seemed the most natural.

05:36.560 --> 05:38.310
Did it?

05:40.980 --> 05:43.740
Okay, could you do that again, then?

05:43.740 --> 05:45.940
Oh, fine.

05:51.640 --> 05:53.440
<i>What's this ready stance from?</i>

05:54.070 --> 05:55.950
<i>I don't really know, but...</i>

05:59.780 --> 06:01.460
<i>It looks good.</i>

06:19.460 --> 06:21.230
Let's see.

06:26.800 --> 06:29.240
Wh-What do you think?

06:30.250 --> 06:32.510
It's kinda pervy.

06:32.510 --> 06:35.990
You were ogling me all over.

06:35.990 --> 06:39.000
Gross! Gross! Gross!

06:39.550 --> 06:42.380
Wait, what's this stance from, though?

06:42.380 --> 06:43.250
Karate?

06:43.250 --> 06:45.130
That's not it...

06:47.210 --> 06:51.690
This is my original martial art!

06:53.220 --> 06:54.990
'Sup?

06:54.990 --> 06:57.580
Look at them, flirting again.

06:57.580 --> 06:58.850
Flirty paradise!

06:58.850 --> 07:02.510
I was just strangling Senpai 
because he was being gross!

07:02.510 --> 07:04.360
You like it rough, huh?

07:04.760 --> 07:06.130
Violence!

07:09.730 --> 07:11.780
That's a nice stance.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.370
Wanna do it again?

07:18.500 --> 07:20.870
"Do it"? Do what?

07:25.410 --> 07:26.550
Wait up!

07:30.840 --> 07:34.140
I'm not telling you, Senpai.

07:34.140 --> 07:35.620
Hold up!

07:35.620 --> 07:36.710
Wait!

07:36.710 --> 07:37.640

07:57.590 --> 07:59.590
Try a little harder. Jeez.

07:59.590 --> 08:01.290
You got wiped.

08:01.790 --> 08:04.820
If Nagatoro saw me like this...

08:04.820 --> 08:06.510
Pupupu!

08:06.510 --> 08:10.300
You're such a wimp, Senpai!

08:10.740 --> 08:15.550
I'm gonna have to train you really hard.

08:20.390 --> 08:21.270
Wimp.

08:21.870 --> 08:23.350
Shut up.

08:23.350 --> 08:25.080
Did you say something?

08:25.080 --> 08:27.060
No, nothing.

08:27.350 --> 08:32.570

Huh?

09:07.640 --> 09:09.420
Are you the only one here, Paisen?

09:09.420 --> 09:10.360
Yeah.

09:11.120 --> 09:14.110
She vanished after she saw that around noon.

09:15.120 --> 09:17.860
So she's still like that about judo, huh?

09:19.870 --> 09:21.960
Deserter!

09:21.960 --> 09:23.870
That's just how she is.

09:25.090 --> 09:27.910
I'll go win in Hayacchi's place!

09:27.910 --> 09:29.750
That would be cheating.

H-Hey...

09:33.060 --> 09:37.630
D-Does Nagatoro do j-judo and stuff?

09:40.910 --> 09:42.320
What? What? What?

09:42.320 --> 09:43.810
Are you curious?

You knocked me down,

11:28.630 --> 11:31.670
Nope, that was a pretty good punch.

11:31.980 --> 11:35.560
All because Senpai emerged 
out of nowhere glaring at me.

11:35.560 --> 11:36.920
Sorry.

11:37.190 --> 11:40.210
It's your fault for getting distracted.

Anyway, get some rest.

Stalker.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.560
I-I'm not!

11:52.120 --> 11:55.560
So, why are you here, Senpai?

11:55.890 --> 11:59.080
You obviously don't have any 
interest in this kind of stuff.

11:59.080 --> 12:01.570

And I bet you just brought 
him here for the laughs!

12:09.950 --> 12:10.880
Whatever.

12:10.880 --> 12:13.820
Just watch there, I guess.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.960
I'm going over there.

12:16.630 --> 12:20.730
I-It's true that I don't have much 
interest in martial arts...

12:24.460 --> 12:28.850
I was a complete failure at 
the judo tournament last year.

12:29.840 --> 12:35.100
I just wanted to do a little 
bit better this year.

12:38.340 --> 12:40.960
S-So...

12:42.650 --> 12:45.980
Could you teach me a little judo?

12:55.590 --> 12:57.740
<i>What was I expecting?</i>

12:57.740 --> 13:01.010
<i>I just barged in and begged her to teach me.</i>

13:01.010 --> 13:02.380
<i>I'm being a nuisance.</i>

13:10.560 --> 13:13.390
Y-You came all this way.

13:13.850 --> 13:20.400
I guess I can coach you a bit, 
if you're actually serious.

13:21.610 --> 13:22.860
Thanks!

13:26.350 --> 13:29.870
Also, since I'm coaching you...

13:29.870 --> 13:34.510
you shall not be allowed a pitiful defeat.

13:34.510 --> 13:38.380
<i>Maybe I shouldn't have asked.</i>

13:38.800 --> 13:40.830
Okay, let's start with falling techniques.

13:40.830 --> 13:42.200
Y-Yes, ma'am.

13:45.630 --> 13:48.200
You kinda know how to do it already, huh?

13:48.200 --> 13:49.110
Yeah...

13:49.110 --> 13:50.890
It would hurt if I didn't.

13:50.890 --> 13:52.600
We're going for lunch.

13:52.600 --> 13:53.760
What about you guys?

13:53.760 --> 13:56.410
I'll join later.

13:56.410 --> 13:57.730
What about you?

13:57.730 --> 13:59.020
I ate at home.

13:59.490 --> 14:02.030
Okay, watch the shop for us.

14:02.030 --> 14:03.150
Sure.

14:09.040 --> 14:11.830
Well, wanna try some free practice, then?

15:56.000 --> 15:58.770

<i>Not that I had high hopes, 
but I didn't stand a chance.</i>

16:28.730 --> 16:30.550
<i>She always impresses me.</i>

16:31.460 --> 16:32.550
<i>But...</i>

16:34.990 --> 16:37.250
She can kick her from so far back.

16:37.250 --> 16:39.810
She's got sick reach for a high school girl.

16:43.420 --> 16:47.560
Hayacchi's got a good thing going, 
but the physical difference...

17:19.040 --> 17:20.510
Senpai.

17:20.510 --> 17:24.350
I didn't expect much physical strength or
 technique, but you have no stamina at all.

17:24.950 --> 17:26.610
That throw...

17:27.270 --> 17:30.700
Oh, that would have won
 the match if it were judo.

17:30.700 --> 17:33.360
But in MMA, it's just one point.

17:34.590 --> 17:36.280
Stop there!

17:37.270 --> 17:42.490
I can't quite finish off 
someone in Gamo-chan's class.

17:44.640 --> 17:48.010
Did you do judo before?

17:54.490 --> 17:57.010
I guess. A little, a while ago.

17:57.010 --> 17:59.180
Th-That's amazing.

17:59.180 --> 18:00.510
Not really.

18:00.900 --> 18:04.270
I'm just doing stuff as a hobby now.

18:05.960 --> 18:11.770
I don't hate judo, either, but there
 were people I just couldn't beat.

18:12.390 --> 18:16.150
I felt stuck, and I got tired of it.

18:16.660 --> 18:19.370
That's about all it was.

18:25.780 --> 18:30.670
You might be able to win the 
school tournament, though.

18:31.120 --> 18:33.420
I'm done already!

18:36.280 --> 18:39.950
Whatever. 
I'm gonna pass on the tournament.

18:39.950 --> 18:40.970
Oh.

18:42.300 --> 18:44.800
Okay, I'm going this way.

18:44.800 --> 18:45.740
Right.

18:45.740 --> 18:46.560
Bye.

18:46.860 --> 18:49.340
You'd better get your running in.

18:49.340 --> 18:50.680
Y-Yeah.

18:50.680 --> 18:52.280
If I have the time.

18:59.220 --> 19:00.670
That throw...

19:04.330 --> 19:07.260
Th-That throw was beautiful.

19:14.540 --> 19:15.880
Say what?

20:57.420 --> 20:58.680
Uh-oh.

20:58.680 --> 21:00.950
Are you supposed to be here?

21:00.950 --> 21:02.400
What do you mean?

21:02.400 --> 21:07.040
The president's apparently working 
Paisen one-on-one really hard.

21:07.040 --> 21:08.160
Spartan!

21:10.330 --> 21:12.080
What did you need from me, President?

21:12.080 --> 21:14.040
Why did you call me here?

21:14.690 --> 21:16.390
You're done with exams already.

21:16.390 --> 21:18.790
I thought you didn't need 
to come to school anymore.

21:19.360 --> 21:27.050
I happened to hear that you've been training 
for the upcoming school judo tournament.

21:28.460 --> 21:31.170
Wh-Who told you that?

21:31.170 --> 21:35.560
The cat-eared girl's usual 
buddies came to inform me.

21:35.560 --> 21:38.160
Hey, President, did you hear?

21:38.160 --> 21:39.190
Whistle-blower!

21:39.190 --> 21:40.820
<i>The friends! Damn it!</i>

21:41.860 --> 21:45.570
So, I shall give you some training.

21:45.890 --> 21:49.570
N-No, you don't need to do that for me.

21:49.850 --> 21:51.680
Stop bumbling and ready yourself!

21:55.670 --> 21:59.580
<i>She's kinda like Nagatoro 
in how pushy she is.</i>

22:05.000 --> 22:07.550
<i>She's not wearing a shirt—</i>

N-Nagatoro...

22:24.150 --> 22:26.530
What the hell are you doing?!

22:27.040 --> 22:27.760
Training.

22:27.760 --> 22:30.530
You freaking pervert!

22:31.420 --> 22:35.790
I wouldn't mind training him
 until the tournament...

22:39.460 --> 22:44.800
I appreciate it, but Nagatoro's 
teaching me right now.

22:50.040 --> 22:51.150
I see.

22:51.620 --> 22:54.560

they just fade away."

Farewell.

23:03.680 --> 23:08.070
And off to the trash bin for 
the bunny-eared girl!

23:08.070 --> 23:10.950
Now I'm gonna whip you into shape!

23:16.840 --> 23:18.120
Sorry to keep you waiting

23:25.980 --> 23:27.130
Points of improvement for today.

23:27.130 --> 23:28.670
Senpai, you know what you did.

23:28.670 --> 23:29.950
I'm sorry for calling a girl heavy.

23:29.950 --> 23:30.910
Oh, that?

23:30.910 --> 23:31.900
Er, um...

23:31.900 --> 23:34.540
Is it about how I got squashed 
by the president's breasts?

23:34.540 --> 23:37.560
I w-wasn't really thinking about
 her breasts or anything...

23:37.560 --> 23:39.820
You still are!
