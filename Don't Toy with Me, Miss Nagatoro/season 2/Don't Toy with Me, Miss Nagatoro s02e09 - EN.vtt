00:27.180 --> 00:29.560
I hope I can win for once.

00:30.320 --> 00:34.520
Especially since I owe it to Nagatoro, 
for helping me practice.

Kawaguchi Yamashita Nagatoro    Urao   Orihara Minami Kawashima Hidaka Kawata Ueda Moriguchi

01:02.870 --> 01:09.790

02:41.120 --> 02:42.060
Full point!

02:44.640 --> 02:46.330
Wow...

02:46.330 --> 02:48.090
That was a really clean throw.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.210
All right!

H-Hey...

02:59.780 --> 03:01.220
Um...

03:03.220 --> 03:04.280
Hold it!

03:04.780 --> 03:05.780
Warning!

03:16.200 --> 03:21.300
I could have finished you 
if you were a guy...

03:27.730 --> 03:29.810
Congrats on winning the first round.

03:29.810 --> 03:31.060
Thanks.

03:31.450 --> 03:33.310
You looked pretty good out there.

03:33.310 --> 03:34.810
You're in good condition today, huh?

03:40.850 --> 03:43.900
My hair's a mess.

03:43.900 --> 03:44.980
I'm tired.

03:44.980 --> 03:46.040
Hey.

03:46.040 --> 03:47.080
Heya.

03:50.080 --> 03:52.630
You're awful fired up today, Nao-kun.

03:52.630 --> 03:56.000
You had dead fish eyes last year.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.240
D-Did I?

03:58.240 --> 04:00.590
I don't think I'm that different.

04:00.590 --> 04:02.680
No, you're turning into 
one of the popular kids.

04:02.680 --> 04:04.330
Traitor.

04:04.330 --> 04:05.970
I'm not!

04:05.970 --> 04:08.720
I'm just getting used to it 
since this is my second time.

04:08.720 --> 04:12.110
Ooh, Orihara from Class B is joining.

04:12.730 --> 04:14.300
Wow.

04:14.300 --> 04:16.060
The girls are gonna have a rough time.

04:16.730 --> 04:18.240
For real?

04:18.240 --> 04:19.540
Is that even fair?

04:19.540 --> 04:22.580
She's a candidate to 
represent Japan, isn't she?

04:24.740 --> 04:28.610
Also, my first round is against her.

04:28.610 --> 04:30.610
My condolences.

04:30.610 --> 04:32.250
Don't give up!

04:43.270 --> 04:44.260
Begin!

04:46.090 --> 04:47.260
Here we go!

04:49.770 --> 04:51.680
I don't think I'm going to win anyway.

04:51.680 --> 04:53.520
Maybe I should forfeit.

04:53.520 --> 04:54.940
Huh? Really?

04:55.520 --> 04:57.400
Kidding!

05:04.110 --> 05:05.900
Not done yet!

05:08.950 --> 05:09.980
Full point!

05:11.160 --> 05:12.400
Good job.

05:12.400 --> 05:13.340
Good job.

05:13.340 --> 05:14.570
Nice fight.

05:14.570 --> 05:15.660
Man...

05:16.330 --> 05:18.230
She's really nimble.

05:18.960 --> 05:22.190
She's gotten even stronger than before.

05:22.990 --> 05:26.170
You've fought her before, Gamo-chan?

05:26.170 --> 05:27.730
No, I haven't.

05:27.730 --> 05:30.030
I'm just guessing from what I've seen.

05:30.680 --> 05:33.750
You don't need to give me a report.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.830
It's not my problem.

05:35.830 --> 05:37.310
Don't say that.

05:38.440 --> 05:41.320
You're up against her next, Hayacchi.

05:41.320 --> 05:43.860
Now's your chance to redeem yourself!

05:43.860 --> 05:44.960
Go win!

05:44.960 --> 05:46.350
Get 'er!

05:47.820 --> 05:50.820
I'm not into that stuffy stuff.

05:50.820 --> 05:53.450
You're so boring.

05:53.450 --> 05:55.330
All so fleeting.

05:55.700 --> 05:59.470
But don't you want to impress Paisen?

05:59.470 --> 06:02.340
What?! Senpai's got nothing to do with this!

06:02.760 --> 06:07.440
Bean sprouts like Paisen 
like strong girls, you know.

06:07.440 --> 06:09.340
I told you, he has nothing to do with it!

06:11.660 --> 06:13.170
Hayacchi!

06:14.850 --> 06:16.260
Hey.

06:16.260 --> 06:17.730
H-Hey.

06:18.100 --> 06:20.590
I haven't fought you in forever.

06:20.590 --> 06:22.970
Y-Yeah, I guess.

06:22.970 --> 06:25.220
I hope it turns out to be a really good bout!

06:25.220 --> 06:27.360
You're not gonna beat me!

06:28.240 --> 06:29.300
Bye!

06:30.340 --> 06:33.010
Stare...

06:33.660 --> 06:35.320
What a pain.

06:36.140 --> 06:38.490
Maybe I should forfeit.

06:39.620 --> 06:41.280
Where are you going?

06:41.280 --> 06:42.610
Where?

06:42.610 --> 06:44.430
Taking a break!

06:56.620 --> 06:58.100
What?

07:00.590 --> 07:02.030
Senpai.

07:03.520 --> 07:05.750
W-Well, I...

07:05.750 --> 07:08.530
Sh-She seems pretty strong.

07:10.270 --> 07:13.530
She wasn't before.

07:13.530 --> 07:15.340
Before?

07:16.420 --> 07:19.320
It's none of your business.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.540
Y-You're right.

07:27.750 --> 07:31.910
Not that you'd be interested to hear...

07:31.910 --> 07:33.550
Y-Yeah?

07:34.490 --> 07:38.710
But I've been doing judo since I was a kid.

07:40.940 --> 07:47.070
I had a knack for it, so I won a 
few tournaments and stuff, too.

07:48.460 --> 07:52.070
I was in the same dojo she was.

07:54.270 --> 07:58.000
She didn't really have raw talent for it,

07:58.000 --> 08:01.540
and I'd always beat her.

08:03.540 --> 08:07.790
But she'd always get so upset when she lost.

08:08.950 --> 08:13.090
Every time we fought, 
she got better and better.

08:16.680 --> 08:20.310
And after so many fights...

08:25.120 --> 08:27.170
It wasn't even close.

08:27.170 --> 08:29.640
She destroyed me.

08:30.860 --> 08:35.590
To be honest, I didn't feel 
like I could win anymore.

08:37.940 --> 08:42.280
When I thought about beating me 
every time going forward,

08:43.160 --> 08:46.770
I lost interest.

08:49.040 --> 08:52.250
And then I ended up quitting judo.

08:54.160 --> 08:57.340
Meanwhile, she's a candidate 
to represent Japan.

08:57.340 --> 09:01.600
We're in totally different worlds now.

09:02.220 --> 09:06.540
Well, since I know I'm going to lose, 
I'm just gonna go get it over with.

09:09.120 --> 09:11.230
That doesn't sound like you, Nagatoro.

09:14.790 --> 09:15.730
What?

09:17.040 --> 09:21.990
Who gave you the right 
to talk like you know me?

09:28.210 --> 09:29.150
No.

09:30.250 --> 09:33.510
You don't know if you're going to 
win or not until you try.

09:35.370 --> 09:37.690
Were you even listening to me?

09:37.690 --> 09:40.420
She could be representing Japan.

09:40.420 --> 09:42.390
I don't even stand a chance.

09:42.390 --> 09:44.350
You're strong, too!

09:45.230 --> 09:47.580
You're plenty strong, too!

09:52.330 --> 09:54.020
<i>Sh-Shoot!</i>

09:54.020 --> 09:56.360
<i>That came off condescending.</i>

09:56.360 --> 09:57.900
Senpai...

09:57.900 --> 10:01.000
That was pretty condescending.

10:01.450 --> 10:04.870
N-Nah, I'm just saying what I meant.

10:05.710 --> 10:08.370
I'll do my best, then.

10:11.880 --> 10:16.610
That is, if you win at least once, Senpai.

10:16.610 --> 10:17.380
Huh?

10:17.380 --> 10:19.470
Th-There's no way...

10:19.470 --> 10:20.510
Oh?

10:20.510 --> 10:24.660
I thought you don't know until you try.

10:25.390 --> 10:27.100
Oh, right.

10:27.100 --> 10:30.650
If you do manage to win one...

10:33.130 --> 10:35.240
I'll give you a kiss.

10:35.900 --> 10:38.450
Y-You don't need to go there!

10:39.250 --> 10:41.570
You don't have confidence, do you?

10:42.020 --> 10:43.900
<i>Confidence?</i>

10:43.900 --> 10:46.080
<i>Well... No, I don't.</i>

10:47.200 --> 10:51.920
<i>But I've practiced with Nagatoro, too.</i>

10:52.950 --> 10:54.650
<i>I'm sure I could get one win.</i>

11:25.140 --> 11:25.950
Begin!

11:28.230 --> 11:29.450
What a pain...

11:29.970 --> 11:31.710
Ooh...

11:31.710 --> 11:34.350
He has a nice body.

11:34.350 --> 11:36.210
Paisen's done.

11:36.210 --> 11:37.910
The end.

11:40.110 --> 11:41.430
Go!

11:41.430 --> 11:43.310
Don't die, Nao-kun.

11:43.890 --> 11:46.470
<i>I might be screwed.</i>

11:46.470 --> 11:49.320
All right, time to get this over with!

11:51.010 --> 11:53.020
Quit running!

12:03.300 --> 12:05.450
He's down.

12:07.340 --> 12:08.830
Nao-kun...

12:09.430 --> 12:10.350
Half point!

12:11.380 --> 12:12.830
Wasn't that a full point?!

12:12.830 --> 12:14.420
That was half-assed.

12:14.420 --> 12:15.160
He sucks.

12:15.160 --> 12:17.830
So he just threw him with brute force?

12:17.830 --> 12:20.620
Also, why don't you cheer for Paisen?

12:20.620 --> 12:23.090
Huh? Why should I?

12:25.230 --> 12:26.170
Begin!

12:33.360 --> 12:36.970
He's throwing him with brute force again!

12:36.970 --> 12:38.740
I can't watch.

12:38.740 --> 12:40.140
Never give up!

12:41.930 --> 12:44.680
Sasai, just pin him down already!

12:44.680 --> 12:46.110
Okay!

12:47.370 --> 12:49.390
Paisen, escape!

12:49.390 --> 12:50.740
Run away!

12:50.740 --> 12:53.750
I have no interest in hugging a dude, but...

12:55.770 --> 12:57.750
<i>He's so strong...</i>

12:57.750 --> 12:59.900
Pin-down.

13:00.670 --> 13:02.650
Two guys in an embrace!

13:02.650 --> 13:04.310
He's done for sure this time.

13:04.310 --> 13:06.380
Final end.

13:10.030 --> 13:14.940
Who gave you the right 
to talk like you know me?

13:16.750 --> 13:18.300
<i>She's right.</i>

13:18.300 --> 13:20.720
<i>I have the right.</i>

13:20.720 --> 13:26.800
<i>I gave myself the right to decide</i>

13:29.070 --> 13:32.700
<i>I don't want Nagatoro to look like that!</i>

13:38.410 --> 13:41.960
There are a few ways to break a scarf hold.

13:43.830 --> 13:48.070
First, push them forward.

13:48.920 --> 13:51.460
Or break it the opposite way.

13:52.350 --> 13:58.030
As you can see, you can always
 break free from a weak pin like yours.

14:01.110 --> 14:05.610
<i>He's just holding me down 
with sheer strength.</i>

14:06.180 --> 14:08.610
<i>Compared to Nagatoro...</i>

14:10.610 --> 14:13.120
<i>He's as light as a feather!</i>

14:13.120 --> 14:14.780
He broke free!

14:16.120 --> 14:17.520
Wow!

14:17.520 --> 14:18.970
Not bad!

14:18.970 --> 14:20.130
Revenge!

14:25.630 --> 14:27.280
Are you serious?

14:27.280 --> 14:28.760
Hold him down! Now!

14:29.860 --> 14:31.770
You got this, Paisen!

14:31.770 --> 14:33.640
Go for it!

14:37.300 --> 14:39.640
Get off me!

14:41.200 --> 14:43.200
<i>He's definitely strong.</i>

14:43.750 --> 14:45.650
<i>Way stronger than I am.</i>

14:46.280 --> 14:49.020
<i>And I have to keep this up forever?</i>

14:50.660 --> 14:53.470
<i>I can't go on any longer.</i>

14:55.160 --> 14:58.660
Senpai! Hang in there!

14:59.170 --> 15:00.420
<i>Nagatoro!</i>

15:05.670 --> 15:06.800
Get your leg free!

15:15.370 --> 15:16.440
Stop!

15:23.310 --> 15:25.740
Ran out of time.

15:25.740 --> 15:27.030
He loses?

15:27.030 --> 15:30.200
He almost had a pin-down.

15:30.200 --> 15:34.910
Wait, I thought you weren't 
going to cheer for him.

15:38.410 --> 15:40.600
Winner by referee discretion: Sasai.

15:42.030 --> 15:43.660
<i>I screwed up.</i>

15:44.640 --> 15:45.380
Yo.

15:47.030 --> 15:48.700
You're pretty good.

15:48.700 --> 15:51.340
Er, uh, thanks.

15:51.710 --> 15:52.830
I lost.

15:52.830 --> 15:54.340
All good.

15:54.340 --> 15:56.370
Nah, you did good!

15:56.370 --> 15:58.500
You've grown a ton.

15:58.500 --> 15:59.980
I'm proud of you.

15:59.980 --> 16:01.560
Who do you think you are?

16:28.710 --> 16:30.650
Looks like she's finally feeling it.

16:30.650 --> 16:32.120
Do it!

16:32.120 --> 16:33.630
Wreck 'em!

16:35.920 --> 16:37.140
I'm going.

16:37.510 --> 16:38.350
Yeah.

16:43.910 --> 16:45.720
Nagatoro of Class C.

16:46.860 --> 16:48.680
Orihara of Class B.

16:49.740 --> 16:50.540
Bow.

17:02.260 --> 17:03.290
Begin!

17:19.030 --> 17:20.750
Damn!

17:20.750 --> 17:22.810
They're nothing like the others.

17:22.810 --> 17:24.090
Holy!

17:25.520 --> 17:26.620
<i>Nagatoro...</i>

17:27.310 --> 17:29.900
Man, Orihara's something else.

17:29.900 --> 17:32.320
She's not a candidate for
 representing Japan for nothing.

17:32.320 --> 17:33.760
Here I go!

17:36.050 --> 17:37.070
She dodged it!

17:39.070 --> 17:40.630
Knee wheel!

17:43.620 --> 17:46.080
And then an inner-thigh throw!

17:53.410 --> 17:54.300
Half point!

17:56.300 --> 17:57.770
That was close.

17:57.770 --> 17:59.650
That combo's killer.

17:59.650 --> 18:02.250
That wasn't a full point, though.

18:02.250 --> 18:05.220
She barely saved it by twisting her body.

18:05.220 --> 18:06.910
That wasn't a full point?

18:06.910 --> 18:08.300
So close!

18:08.300 --> 18:09.810
She's almost there.

18:09.810 --> 18:12.880
I wish I could have seen 
Orihara score a full point.

18:15.690 --> 18:17.130
Stay calm!

18:17.130 --> 18:18.720
Go, go!

18:18.720 --> 18:20.820
Let's go, Nagatoro!

18:21.360 --> 18:22.600
<i>Nagatoro...</i>

18:23.260 --> 18:24.330
Begin!

18:26.790 --> 18:28.300
Orihara!

18:28.300 --> 18:30.260
Full point! Full point!

18:30.260 --> 18:32.340
Full point! Full point!

18:32.340 --> 18:50.100
Full point! Full point!

18:36.340 --> 18:39.340
Come on, it's like she's on the away team.

18:50.100 --> 18:52.110
Nagatoro!

18:52.110 --> 18:55.180
Go for it!

19:01.680 --> 19:02.680
Huh?

19:02.680 --> 19:04.800
Ew, is that her boyfriend?

19:07.450 --> 19:11.120
Go! Nagatoro!

19:35.860 --> 19:37.230
<i>Nagatoro!</i>

19:48.110 --> 19:49.570
Full point!

19:59.880 --> 20:01.880
Aw...

20:01.880 --> 20:03.410
I thought I had that one,

20:03.410 --> 20:06.070
but I was out of bounds and 
ended up losing by the ref's decision.

20:06.070 --> 20:08.570
I can't believe I'm in the same boat as you.

20:08.570 --> 20:11.450
S-Sorry you're in my boat.

20:12.450 --> 20:14.500
That was a shame, though.

20:16.660 --> 20:19.680
To be honest, I...

20:21.550 --> 20:23.740
Winner by referee's discretion: Orihara.

20:45.430 --> 20:47.180
I'm winning next time.

20:56.310 --> 21:00.160
I'm super pissed, so I'm 
getting her back next time.

21:00.160 --> 21:01.940
Y-Yeah?

21:05.010 --> 21:06.450
Senpai.

21:08.170 --> 21:11.570
If I beat her next time,

21:13.050 --> 21:16.280
will you reward me with a kiss?

21:19.460 --> 21:20.930
A kiss...

21:22.990 --> 21:24.640
Wh-Wh-What are you...

21:24.640 --> 21:26.100
A k-kiss?!

21:26.100 --> 21:28.800
H-Here you go again, messing with me!

21:29.700 --> 21:31.600
I'm not messing.

23:25.500 --> 23:26.780
Points of improvement for today!

23:26.780 --> 23:27.960
That was close today, Senpai.

23:27.960 --> 23:29.840
That wasn't an ideal opponent.

23:29.840 --> 23:31.960
You broke his pin, though.

23:31.960 --> 23:33.860
You were way heavier, though.

23:33.860 --> 23:35.180
Like I said...

23:35.180 --> 23:37.840
The pin is based on my technique! 
Skills! Abilities!

23:37.840 --> 23:39.140
S-Stop...
