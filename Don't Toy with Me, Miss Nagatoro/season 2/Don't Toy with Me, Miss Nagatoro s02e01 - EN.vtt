It's late.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:06.640
The handwriting is messy.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.230
You used the wrong format.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.620
Do it over, dumbass.

Are you listening to me?!

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.500
I-I'm listening, President!

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.310
Less yapping, more writing.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.740
Want me to shut that mouth of yours?

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.980
I'm late!

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.640
I slept in because the president 
had me working late.

'Sup?!

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.740
I bought new loafers!

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.400
I like sneakers for their comfort,

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.390
but a high school girl's gotta be 
able to wear loafers, am I right?

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.600
Ta-da!

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.490
What do you think, Senpai?

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.150
Is it electrifying?

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.670
S-Sure, they look good.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.380
That's a weak reaction.

Hey, is that <i>Slave of Love?</i>

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.670
I didn't know you read shoujo manga, Senpai.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.800
Wh-What's wrong with that?

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.500
I-I heard it's getting an anime adaptation, 
so I bought it out of curiosity.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.950
Oh, no.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.960
I never said there's anything wrong.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.830

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.260

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.390

President, are you listening?

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.210
But I feel weirdly close with 
the protagonist, Ai-chan.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.400
It cracks me up seeing the mega-sadistic 
four-eyes get all teary-eyed.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.650
<i>I'm sure it does.</i>

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.770
I bet you'd get all teary-eyed if 
a girl did this kinda stuff to you.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.720
No, not really.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.440
It's nowhere near as bad as 
how <i>someone</i> toys with me.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.000
If you're so sure, why don't I hit 
you with some <i>Slave of Love</i> play?

Man, that was crazy, even for you.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.690
I could totally report you to the police.

Moments away from an incident!

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.530
You're lucky I'm a nice girl.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:50.160
It's my duty as a citizen to report you, 
but I'll give you a little bit of leeway.

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:51.910
I-I wasn't...

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:58.290
I just noticed you, so I thought 
I'd talk to you. That's all.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:03.250
I see.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:04.540
All right.

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:09.300
I'll give you a lesson on how 
to talk to people, Senpai.

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.560
I'm good.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.290
Don't be so shy.

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:18.440
We're buddies, aren't we?

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.870
Senpai!

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.500
That's Type A.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.990
The most fundamental of all greetings.

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.410
That's a rather violent greeting.

00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:37.040
What are you talking about?

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.080
You're expressing true

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:01.170
Don't you have a more normal greeting?

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:04.580
There's no such thing as a normal

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:08.570

Nah, nah.

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:35.590
This is totally normal for high school girls.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:37.590
N-No way.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.520

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.270
<i>She's totally messing with me.</i>

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:44.420
Okay, your turn, Senpai.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.930
Try one on me.

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:47.690

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:58.670

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:01.890
Maybe I'll tell everyone at school, then.

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:03.610
T-Tell them what?

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:07.970
That I glomped you, and you got hard.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.250
Ew, Senpai!

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:12.580
You're so gross!

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.050

Okay, see you after school.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.760

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:36.990
<b><b>DON'T TOY WITH ME,
MISS NAGATORO</b></b>

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.490
<b>Art Room</b>

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:52.530
<i>The culture festival after-party...</i>

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:55.300
<i>I'm sure it's at the usual 
family restaurant, but...</i>

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.030
Senpai...

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.640
Is it just me, or is it cold today?

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:04.860
The AC is messed up.

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:06.640
Seriously?

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:09.150
It's ancient, so...

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.820
Well, whatever.

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:13.270
This calls for...

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:15.950
tights!

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:17.840
It's winter soon, after all.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.530
I bought them the other day.

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:20.970
Huh...

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:22.610
I'm surprised, though.

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:25.660
You didn't seem like the type to wear those.

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:32.410
Are you saying I'm like a grade-school kid 
who wears shorts and short sleeves all year?

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:34.920
No, not really, but...

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:37.920
Girls wear skirts for their uniforms,

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.930
so you'd think you'd be less 
prone to getting cold than guys.

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:42.530
Senpai...

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.930
Girls' fashion is all about grit!

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.260
On windy days, on snowy days...

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.090
Skirts are to be worn with willpower!

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:53.480
Huh... That's rough.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:58.440
But sometimes we want warmth, too.

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:09.830
I see...

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:11.110
Tights, huh?

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:14.460
You gotta do what you gotta do.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.460
"You gotta do what you gotta do"?

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:28.090
What do you mean by, 
"You gotta do what you gotta do"?

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:35.230
You mean you're disappointed, don't you?

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:40.230
You're disappointed you don't get to 
see my bare legs anymore, aren't you?

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:41.640
N-No!

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:45.240
Senpai's obsessed with my bare legs!

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.350
Ew! Creep!

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:47.620
I'm not!

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:52.420
Okay, you put these on me, then.

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:53.000
What?!

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:55.650
Wh-Why would I do that?

00:14:55.650 --> 00:15:00.380
So I can observe you up-close to see 
if you're obsessed with my bare legs.

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:06.220
Come on, Senpai.

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:09.280
Hurry up and put it on me.

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:20.530
You're taking forever, Senpai.

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:23.060
Couldn't you be a bit smoother?

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.650
Oh, right, you can't. You're a virgin.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.490
<i>Damn it...</i>

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:33.370
<i>Just pretend I'm bagging a daikon 
radish and get it done quickly.</i>

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.000
<i>So soft.</i>

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:42.880
<i>It's nothing like a radish.</i>

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:47.760
<i>It's soft and smooth, yet firm and supple.</i>

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:49.400
<i>A girl's leg...</i>

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:52.210
<i>Nagatoro's leg!</i>

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.240
What are you getting all tense about?!

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.190
Hurry up and put it on, please!

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:07.450
<i>Clear your mind...</i>

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:12.140
<i>So soft!</i>

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:13.120
<i>No!</i>

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.330
<i>Clear your mind...</i>

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:16.580
<i>So soft!</i>

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:18.210
<i>Clear your mind...</i>

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.590
That's enough!

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:28.500
I'll finish putting it on myself!

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:29.460
Okay!

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:30.850
Okay, already!

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:34.470
Your hand movements are way too pervy!

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:35.630
I wasn't trying to...

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:37.980
Ow, ow, ow!

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:41.590
What do you think?

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:46.610
I-I mean, they look okay, I guess.

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:51.070
Senpai, do you have a tights fetish?

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:53.100
N-No!

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:59.070
Gamo-chan says they're ready to go.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.590
<b>Fukkura Sushi</b>

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:06.820
I don't have much money.

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:08.250
Don't worry.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:10.530
We have the money from our straps.

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:12.650
You can eat all you want.

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:14.470
R-Really?

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.480
First bite's gotta be tuna, right?

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.600
Tuna!

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:21.530
The smoked salmon's good.

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:22.730
Salmon!

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:24.650
This is awesome.

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:26.570
I haven't had sushi in forever.

00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:27.990
Sushi!

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:30.990
<i>I feel so out of place.</i>

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:34.490
<i>I guess I'll focus on eating.</i>

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:37.010
Senpai, get me a negi toro.

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:38.320
S-Sure.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:41.380
Urchin for me.

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:43.220
Fries for me.

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:46.920
Bonito.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.050
Karaage.

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.430
Eel.

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:54.010
<i>Shoot!</i>

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:55.490
<i>This seat's a trap!</i>

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:56.890
Tuna!

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.640
<i>The lane side is the slave's seat!</i>

00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:58.440
Udon.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.530
Work!

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:07.400
<i>They invited me so they 
can work me to the bone!</i>

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:12.950
Senpai, what are you having next?

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:15.210
Amberjack, maybe?

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:25.070
Okay, amberjack. How much?

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:26.890
Thanks.

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:31.300
I'm going to treat you today.

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:33.800
I mean...

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:39.790
You were the one who worked the most 
at the school festival, Senpai.

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:44.060
So you're the star of the show tonight.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.280
Star here!

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.860
Treat him with respect, just for today.

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:49.130
A'ight.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:50.070
Got it.

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:52.560
Offerings for Paisen.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.080
Eat up, if you will.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.160
Karaage.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.270
Have some salad, too.

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:00.080
Th-Thank you.

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:04.270
Senpai's more of a fish 
type, don't you think?

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:05.560
Or an herbivore.

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:06.580
Sheep?

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.680
You should eat tons of fatty stuff.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.670
You're such a twig.

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:15.110
<i>I guess I had the wrong idea about them.</i>

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:17.940
<i>Looks like I can relax for today.</i>

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.100
Okay!

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.850
Special service for Paisen.

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:25.100
Put some salmon roe on top of the salmon...

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:26.510
Ta-da!

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:29.610
Salmon red caviar oyako sushi!

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:33.190
Try it, Paisen.

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.930
It's not bad.

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:41.490
They're the same species, so it makes sense.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:42.940
Right?

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:46.250
Doesn't it elevate it a bit?

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:48.500
I'm making some, too!

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:52.470
I put mayonnaise corn on 
top of a Hamburg steak sushi.

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:54.380
Give it a try.

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:01.330
It's pretty trashy, but it's good.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.180
Me, too! Me, too!

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.410
I put urchin on top of shrimp sushi.

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:09.440
I call it gorgeous nigiri!

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:14.300
Yum!

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:21.240
Senpai!

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:24.680
I'll make you a special, too.

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:28.550
Take half the cod roe off

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:31.000
and put soft roe on top.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:36.260
The cod roe and soft roe have a 
miraculous encounter in your stomach.

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:38.530
The preggers sushi!

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:41.780
You might get knocked up, Senpai!

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:49.910
Nasty.

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.850
Yeah...

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:54.650
Who makes dirty jokes with food?

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:57.020
It's a sushi violation.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:58.090
Too far.

00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:59.420
Sacrilege!

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:02.530
Hayacchi does that sometimes.

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:06.080
Cod roe and soft roe...

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.790
Pregnant?

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.360
Paisen went for it!

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.550
Wait, this is good.

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:24.070
The cod roe and soft roe go well together.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.030
It's good.

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:30.150
See?

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.370
That's Senpai for you.

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:35.570
He's a creepy creeper, but he's got good taste.

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:38.850
I have the approval of the star of the day!

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:40.290
Whoo!

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:42.120
Jeez, you're annoying.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.730
I'll make some, too.

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:46.830
Yoshi, cod roe and soft roe, please.

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:48.830
Don't copy me!

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:53.940
Okay, I'll use soft roe and soft roe 
to make creepy creeper sushi.
