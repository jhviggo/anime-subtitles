00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.230
<b>Art Room</b>

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.430
That was a refreshing nap.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.010
You're treating this room 
like your own home.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.370
True.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.030
This is my second home.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.570
Sakura and the girls want to hang out.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.840
Toying with Senpai is fun, 
but I think I'll make it a girl-talk day.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.220
Later, Senpai!

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.980
<i>Girl talk...</i>

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.190
<i>I wonder what they'd be talking about.</i>

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.770
I guess she'll come get it after school.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.800
<b>DON'T TOY WITH ME,
MISS NAGATORO</b>

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.800
<b>DON'T TOY WITH ME,
MISS NAGATORO</b>

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:39.010
<b></b><b>Senpai</b>... Were You... Listening to What I Said...?

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.420
<b></b><b>Senpai</b>... Were You... Listening to What I Said...?

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.030
<i>The first-years' floor...</i>

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.380
<i>I feel so out of place.</i>

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.030
<i>Stay calm.</i>

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.480
<i>Gotta give this back and 
get out of here quickly.</i>

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.760
<i>Wait...</i>

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.980
<i>Which class is she in?</i>

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.820
Need something?

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.050
O-Oh, er, well...

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.260
I'm looking for someone.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.290
Who?

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.120
N-Nagatoro is her name.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.120
Nagatoro?

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.950
She's not in my class.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.450
O-Okay.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.120
Thanks.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.010
Wait, hang on!

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.900
Nagatoro...

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.580
I think I've heard that name.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.800
What's her first name?

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.390
<i>Her name...</i>

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.430
<i>Come to think of it...</i>

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.020
<i>I can't believe...</i>

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.690
Hayacchi strips down for the team, too.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.070
H-Haya...

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.070
Haya...

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.070
Oh, Hayacchi!

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.070
Right, right.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.020
Yeah, now I remember her last name.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.890
Hayacchi is in Class 1-C.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.710
Th-Thanks.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.070
<i>Haya...</i>

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.300
<i>Haya...</i>

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.580
<i>Haya-what, I wonder?</i>

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.680
<i>She's not here.</i>

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.690
<i>What do I do?</i>

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.010
<i>I look suspicious standing here.</i>

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.100
Nice! Those are some good punches.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:11.980
<i>The friends!</i>

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.390
<i>Now what?</i>

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.180
<i>Do I give this to the friends and leave?</i>

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.360
<i>Although if they catch me...</i>

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.920
Come on, Paisen, stick around for a while.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:23.990
Stick around!

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.240
<i>Time to get out of here.</i>

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.420
So, anyway...

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.490
<i>More friends this way, too!</i>

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.690
'Sup?!

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:36.960
Hey.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.830
Have you had lunch yet?

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.400
I'm about to eat now.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.170
We'll be chilling in class, then.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.340
Wanna go to the window side?

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.510
<i>What the hell am I doing?</i>

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:51.610
Where's Hayacchi?

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:52.900
She said she's coming.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.410
I'm here!

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.000
<i>Nagatoro!</i>

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.730
<b>Tomato Juice</b>

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.730
Got Royal Tomato Juice!

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.840
Here we go with your weird drinks again.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.990
You really like tomato juice, huh?

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.630
Rabi-chan got a boyfriend, apparently.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.240
For real?!

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.240
For real?!

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.080
For real. The chad guy.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.720
But she said she couldn't stand chad types.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.010
He doesn't count. 
He's the good type of chad.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.940
Look at her, being so casual.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.530
Like she's already won at life.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.600
He's good-looking, so...

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.750
You can get away with most 
things if you're good looking.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.600
Nah, that doesn't really cut it for me.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.690
Well anyway, congratulations 
on getting a boyfriend.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.450
<i>I need to sneak out at some point.</i>

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.610
<i>Or I'm going to be stuck 
here until school's over.</i>

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.840
So, what are your types?

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.780
I like dependable guys. For sure.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.700
I'm pretty accommodating, 
so I'm okay with any type.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.370
So you're a whore.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.580
I can handle any kind of ball.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.020
Call me the guardian angel.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.580
The only problem is that she 
ends up crushing on everyone.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.760
What about you, Hayacchi?

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.730
You weren't really the dating type before.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.430
These days, you're pretty girly.

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.480
Right?

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.940
No way. No, I'm not.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.650
Come on! What's your type?

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.200
<i>Shoot!</i>

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.570
<i>I shouldn't be listening in on this.</i>

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.570
Come on!

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.600
Me?

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.380
Well...

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.160
Someone I like hanging out with, I guess.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:58.240
So plain.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.250
Yeah.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.280
Especially for Toro-chan.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.980
I don't think a normal 
guy can keep up with you.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.700
Wh-Why do you care?!

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:08.360
Huh?

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.740
What's wrong?

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:11.740
I can't find my phone.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:12.720
For real?

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.990
Did you drop it?

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:16.700
Maybe it's in the club room.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.560
Oh, yeah, maybe.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:24.310
Speaking of which, I heard you're 
spending time in a club room these days.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:25.380
I know.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.750
S-So what if I am?

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.760
Is it a guy?

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.840
It's a guy!

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.970
A guy!

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.970
N-No!

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:42.790
What was that?

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:44.850
I heard a noise just now.

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:45.920
Scary.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.060
Is it a poltergeist?

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.000
Or a ghost?

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.680
Of course not.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.070
Be careful, Hayacchi.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.620
Trust me, it's nothing.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.840
What are you doing?

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.980
You brought it here for me?

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:21.110
Hey, did you find anything?

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:22.850
Huh? No.

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.390
Wait, I see Sakura's guardian spirit!

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:26.030
For real?

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:26.940
For real?

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:31.120
You do, huh? She's a courtesan, you know.

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:38.010
Senpai, that was <i>actually</i> creepy.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:40.320
You were the Abominable Locker Monster.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.500
Sorry.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.250
It just kinda happened.

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:45.640
Anyway, it's fine.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.330
Thanks for returning my phone.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:50.830
Bye.

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.120
Senpai.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.770
Were you listening to what I said?

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:08.460
What are you talking about?

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:18.030
<b>For real?!</b>

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:18.030
<b>For real?!?!</b>

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:18.040
<b>DON'T TOY WITH ME,
MISS NAGATORO</b>

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:23.040
<b>DON'T TOY WITH ME,
MISS NAGATORO</b>

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.040
<i>The school marathon is tomorrow.</i>

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:33.420
Come after me if you're that upset!

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:37.050
Right, Maggot-senpai?

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:40.050
<i>I gotta try to impress her for once.</i>

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.640
I won't leave you behind. Don't worry.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:48.630
I hope you all remember the course.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.240
Yes.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.300
We're going to be outside. 
Don't make a lot of noise.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.090
Okay.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.790
<i>Seems like my foot's okay.</i>

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:00.160
<i>Oh, where's Nagatoro?</i>

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:06.540
Ready...

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.540
<i>Everyone's sprinting so hard.</i>

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:12.760
<i>I'm gonna go at my own pace.</i>

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.050
Senpai!

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.810
Let's race, Senpai.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.310
R-Race?

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:28.560
Race!

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.330
I-I'm not gonna race.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.780
I'll just run at my own pace.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:40.070
I know you're slow, 
but you might win if you keep it up.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:42.950
Like the tortoise and the hare.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:45.510
You might catch us off guard. Who knows?

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:46.630
A nap?

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:48.040
Like the hare?

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.700
N-Nah, you lot are more like cats than hares.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.350
"You lot"!

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:55.800
Toro Cats!

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:10.520
The hare!

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:11.880
Cosplay?!

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:17.280
N-No, the president is just 
doing it as performance art.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.780
We're gonna have to put our 
race with Paisen on hold!

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.030
Beat the hare!

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:24.410
Yeah!

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:27.820
S-Sure, good luck, I guess.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:32.040
The president's a good athlete, 
so you're going to have a hard time.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.060
What are you talking about?

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:38.640
It's the turtle that 
goes up against the hare!

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:40.650
I can't!

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:42.680
There's no way I can beat her!

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.120
You can!

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.810
We just need to ram all 
of our power into you!

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.150
No rest for the turtle!

00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:59.900
Our booster...

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.780
...got separated.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.710
You could have gone.

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:05.890
It was blinking.

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:08.910
Don't mind us. Just keep going.

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:11.110
Go! And catch her!

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:12.460
That's a death flag!

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.420
G-Guys...

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:16.210
We got this!

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:17.570
Let's go, Senpai!

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:21.130
S-Stop pushing!

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:22.930
I'll run as hard as I can.

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:25.300
Oh, fine.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.360
You've been practicing, huh, Senpai?

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.810
C-Can you tell?

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:43.070
That's not a bad effort, coming from you.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:47.520
Even though it's a creepy, squiggly run.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.370
I-I'm not <i>that</i> bad!

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:51.280
Nah, you're that bad.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.700
Squiggly, squiggly, squiggly, squiggly!

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:57.880
<i>Damn it, this kid...</i>

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:03.510
Senpai?

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:06.780
What's wrong?

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:10.050
Nothing, just my ankle...

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:11.470
Is it sprained?

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.000
No, well...

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.640
It's not really that bad.

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:17.340
I just twisted it a bit yesterday.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.880
You go ahead, Nagatoro.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.650
I'll take it slow.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.900
H-Hey!

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:30.660
Let's get back to the school, Senpai.

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:31.920
It's fine!

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.500
You don't need to do that for me.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.090
You can leave me here.

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:36.920
Are you trying to be 
considerate or something?

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:38.600
You don't get to do that, Senpai.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.000
N-No, it's not that I'm being considerate...

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.950
Quit groaning and let's go, Senpai!

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:57.150
This feels like a scene from a movie, huh?

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:58.520
A movie?

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.250
Like a war movie or something.

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:03.040
I'm not gonna make it.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.400
Leave me behind.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.100
Don't be stupid.

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:09.420
And they make it home together.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.440
You know what I mean?

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.160
It's a thing, right?

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.790
Sure, yeah.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:25.550
<i>Man, I can never understand 
Nagatoro's behavior.</i>

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:31.550
I know you're slow, 
but you might win if you keep it up.

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:36.160
<i>She's messing with me and joking 
around one moment, and...</i>

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:50.800
<i>It's starting to hurt a lot.</i>

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:01.430
Hop on.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.100
I'll carry you.

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.450
N-No, that's going too far.

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:12.820
Are you feeling responsible?

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.040
I mean, for my foot.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.180
Not really.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.730
It's nothing like that.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:23.230
It's because this is faster.

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:24.540
Hurry.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:29.360
Just shut up and do as I say, 
wimpy Turtle-senpai.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.430
E-Err...

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:34.940
I really don't know about 
climbing on a girl's back.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.020
Don't underestimate me.

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:44.380
Carrying a twiggy bean 
sprout like you is nothing.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.380
No, but...

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:47.520
Just do it!

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.220
O-Okay.

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:12.890
<i>Th-This is embarrassing.</i>

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:16.860
<i>And I feel really guilty.</i>

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:22.000
<i>And she's so tiny...</i>

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:25.000
You're amazing, Nagatoro.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.920
This is nothing.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.010
Nothing!

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:34.130
I-It's okay. I'll get off.

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:35.150
No!

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:37.510
Not until we beat that rabbit!

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:39.640
Let me down!

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:46.150
I don't want to risk getting you hurt.

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:49.020
Please.

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:54.400
That was slick!

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.090
Especially for you, Paisen.

00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:56.960
Yo!

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.030
Guys.

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:00.040
We'll take over from here.

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.040
Take a slow-ass turtle...

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:07.040
put boosters on it...

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:09.030
and it'll fly!

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.680
Y-You're going too fast!

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.090
Don't sweat it!

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.340
Don't sweat it!

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:23.180
<i>The cat-eared girl and her 
friends were no match for me.</i>

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:27.010
Prepare yourself, hare!

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.190
She's fast.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:35.800
Is this the end?

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:36.900
Not yet!

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:37.750
Yoshi!

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:38.950
Roger!

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:40.950
Change formation!

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:47.210
Slipstream!

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.210
<b>Slipstream</b>

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.020
She's blocking the wind.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.710
We're going faster!

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:03.350
The tortoise beat the hare, Senpai!

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:07.850
Y-Yeah!

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.740
Disqualified.

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:13.240
That's fair.

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:34.210
<i>Nagatoro hasn't been in here for two days.</i>

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:38.910
<i>She isn't messaging me, either.</i>

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:41.220
<i>O-Oh, no...</i>

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.110
Senpai...

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:46.230
I can't believe you were 
eavesdropping from the locker.

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:48.780
You're way too creepy.

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:50.880
I'm not coming anymore.

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:55.850
<i>I-I should ask her what's up.</i>

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:57.530
<b>How?</b>

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:57.740
<b>Creep</b>

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:59.240
So?

00:18:57.530 --> 00:18:59.240
<b>How?</b>

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.990
So?

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.830
<i>So...</i>

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:05.370
<i>So what?!</i>

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:10.370
Jeez, Yoshi!

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:14.150
Friends punch! Friends punch!

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:21.260
H-Hey!

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.220
Oh, Paisen.

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.200
Don't scare me like that.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:26.790
Sorry.

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:27.890
Don't.

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:32.090
You've never said hi to us before.

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:33.400
A rarity.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.790
What's this beat for?!

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:39.900
For real!

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:46.580
N-Nah, I just haven't seen Nagatoro 
in a while, so I was wondering...

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:48.430
Are you worried?

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:49.790
You're at that age?

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:52.340
N-No, not really.

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:54.510
Actually...

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:56.320
Yeah.

00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:59.870
She's at home with a cold.

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:02.180
I-Is she all right?

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:03.170
Yeah.

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:04.740
She's mostly better already.

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.630
She said she should be back tomorrow.

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:08.660
O-Okay.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:11.540
Paisen, do you know where she lives?

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.690
Y-Yeah, I do.

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:18.190
Trigonometric Functions

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:18.190
Equations Involving 180 - Θ

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:18.190
Trigonometric Identities

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:18.190
Use 1 and 2 to prove that 3 is true.

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:17.310
Here. Take this.

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:18.190
Huh?

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:20.240
Give this to her.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:20.800
Bye.

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:21.550
Bye.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.700
Thanks, Paisen.

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:24.940
Thanks!

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.240
<i>Here I am.</i>

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.880
<i>The Nagatoro House.</i>

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:35.420
<i>And I bought a gift.</i>

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:46.340
<i>No one's answering.</i>

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:49.370
<i>N-No!</i>

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:51.470
Senpai...

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:09.460
You there, hold still.

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:11.950
I'm gonna report you real quick.

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:13.840
N-No! Err...

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.470
S-S-Sorry!

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:18.280
I j-just thought she
 might have passed out!

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.610
Sure, sure.

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:21.590
You can tell the police all about it.

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:24.260
I-I-I'm from school!

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.220
I b-brought her homework!

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:27.680
And a gift!

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:29.220
You...

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:32.610
Are you Senpai-kun?

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.320
Yes. Probably.

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:39.280
I see, I see.

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.980
So you're the one.

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:45.320
You came to check up on my kid sister, huh?

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.450
Thanks.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:48.670
Kid sister...

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:51.370
Anetoro?!

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.620
Points of improvement for today!

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:29.600
That was some good running today, Paisen.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:30.340
Lightning!

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:31.720
You looked good.

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:32.890
F-Friends...

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:33.370
Thanks.

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:36.310
Should we go with no points 
of improvement this time?

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.930
Oh?

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:38.540
What about the trespassing?

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:40.020
New character!
