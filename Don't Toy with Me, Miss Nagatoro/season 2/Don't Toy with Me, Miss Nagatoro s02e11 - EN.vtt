WEBVTT

00:01.452 --> 00:03.404
I'll take judo seriously.

00:03.906 --> 00:05.280
But at the same time...

00:05.920 --> 00:08.100
I'll continue to tease my Senpai.

00:08.830 --> 00:11.703
Do you want everything you desire?

00:12.170 --> 00:13.288
Of course!

00:13.790 --> 00:15.249
Although he's not my boyfriend...

00:16.845 --> 00:18.710
I've figured it out.

00:18.936 --> 00:20.212
What is it?

00:20.812 --> 00:24.174
This art room is the love
nest of Senpai and the evil girl.

00:24.312 --> 00:25.592
Nest?

00:26.298 --> 00:30.984
Senpai and the evil girl have
secretly developed a forbidden love.

00:31.014 --> 00:33.559
No! That's not the case.

00:33.953 --> 00:35.811
But because you are on a different path,

00:36.204 --> 00:38.230
the love nest was forced to disband.

00:38.539 --> 00:39.106
Huh?

00:40.250 --> 00:41.525
What are you going to do now?

00:41.586 --> 00:42.234
Huh?

00:43.367 --> 00:45.404
Even if you say that...

00:45.852 --> 00:49.039
It has to be Senpai who captures it.

00:49.067 --> 00:49.908
Capture what?

00:50.132 --> 00:51.034
Love!

00:51.063 --> 00:51.785
Huh?

00:52.697 --> 00:54.454
As Sanae said before,

00:55.173 --> 00:58.333
love is something you have to pursue.

00:59.226 --> 01:00.294
Bucho...

01:00.641 --> 01:02.212
Indeed, that sounds like what she'd say.

01:03.251 --> 01:05.841
Don't care if this is love or not...

01:06.195 --> 01:07.301
Don't care?

01:07.774 --> 01:12.139
Although I feel a little lonely too...

01:12.658 --> 01:14.600
What should I do?

01:14.804 --> 01:16.724
Isn't it obvious?

01:16.835 --> 01:17.352
Huh?

01:18.623 --> 01:19.605
It's a date!

01:19.656 --> 01:20.272
A date?

01:20.831 --> 01:23.901
Date... Date!

01:36.821 --> 01:43.754
(Don't Toy with Me, Miss Nagatoro
2nd Attack)

02:57.777 --> 03:04.960
(Will Senpai Feel Lonely Without Me by His Side?)

03:24.473 --> 03:26.800
No way! We're not a couple.

03:26.855 --> 03:28.525
How can we go on a date?

03:29.481 --> 03:34.197
Well, we did go to the zoo together once.

03:35.105 --> 03:38.201
But, we were there for sketching...

03:39.520 --> 03:43.360
Anyway, if I were to ask Nagatoro

03:43.361 --> 03:46.690
to go on a date...

03:46.978 --> 03:50.358
How disgusting! You're my senpai,
why are you talking about a date?

03:50.414 --> 03:52.910
Please have a little self-awareness!

03:55.399 --> 03:58.096
It will just end with me
being teased like that.

03:59.015 --> 04:00.515
You have so many doubts.

04:01.140 --> 04:03.518
But unfortunately,
I don't know the answers.

04:04.219 --> 04:06.813
Because I don't know what love is.

04:07.466 --> 04:09.858
Huh? Sorry.

04:10.505 --> 04:12.155
I'm not pressuring you...

04:18.418 --> 04:19.993
It's quite late now.

04:20.820 --> 04:22.954
Is it okay not to contact your family?

04:23.443 --> 04:24.498
No problem.

04:25.141 --> 04:26.500
Someone is coming to fetch me.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.629
Really? That's great.

04:35.070 --> 04:36.843
B-Bucho...

04:38.720 --> 04:40.764
I haven't seen you for a while, Hachiouji.

04:41.700 --> 04:43.590
Long time no see, Bucho.

04:48.106 --> 04:49.523
You seem to have a bad mood.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.566
Is something bothering you?

04:52.612 --> 04:55.654
No, it's nothing.

04:56.610 --> 04:58.240
She is still as perceptive as ever!

04:58.664 --> 05:01.410
Things always get complicated
when it comes to Bucho.

05:01.884 --> 05:02.841
It's better not to talk about it.

05:03.601 --> 05:07.249
Oh, by the way, how are things
going with your university?

05:08.263 --> 05:10.460
After his love nest with
the evil girl is disbanded,

05:10.619 --> 05:13.296
they are now in a crisis of breaking up.

05:13.611 --> 05:16.716
The only way to break
the situation is through dating.

05:18.344 --> 05:19.511
I see.

05:20.427 --> 05:21.805
I understand the situation now.

05:24.111 --> 05:26.476
There's only one thing you can do.

05:27.619 --> 05:29.790
You have to listen to your own will.

05:31.695 --> 05:34.401
My own will...

05:40.511 --> 05:41.491
Well then, goodbye.

05:42.134 --> 05:43.034
Goodbye.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.162
Thank you for your help.

05:45.705 --> 05:47.938
Sunomiya, thank you too.

05:48.620 --> 05:51.251
Explain everything to me later.

05:53.076 --> 05:55.046
Things have gotten complicated.

06:05.099 --> 06:08.067
It seems like the judo club
is still practising.

06:19.809 --> 06:21.630
Let me wait for her for a while.

06:29.783 --> 06:30.832
Senpai!

06:31.649 --> 06:33.043
You've worked hard.

06:34.030 --> 06:36.505
Yes, you've worked hard too.

06:37.174 --> 06:39.549
Huh? Are you...

06:40.075 --> 06:43.428
Are you waiting for me?

06:44.030 --> 06:45.603
Huh, no!

06:45.604 --> 06:48.923
I just passed by and
thought to take a break here.

06:49.088 --> 06:52.521
Huh, why does your gaze
drift away from me?

06:52.611 --> 06:54.500
What's wrong with that?

06:54.957 --> 06:57.001
'What's wrong with that?'

06:57.080 --> 07:00.111
- How gross you are saying it like that!
- Ouch, that hurts!

07:02.930 --> 07:05.784
Sigh. It's been tough for you
to be pushed around so much.

07:06.040 --> 07:07.868
Yes, that's quite tough.

07:08.084 --> 07:10.511
Um, I mean pushed around

07:10.512 --> 07:12.374
in a non-sexual way.

07:12.397 --> 07:13.393
I know.

07:13.940 --> 07:15.335
How's everything going, senpai?

07:15.432 --> 07:18.290
Hasn't that little bunny-girl
been bothering you?

07:18.659 --> 07:19.923
We're doing well with the drawing.

07:20.557 --> 07:23.205
Sunomiya is working hard
on her drawings too.

07:23.992 --> 07:27.472
Are you guys working hard
towards any erotic direction?

07:27.619 --> 07:29.432
Like a nude model or something.

07:29.557 --> 07:30.850
No, not at all.

07:31.704 --> 07:33.031
Sigh.

07:33.032 --> 07:37.073
That's boring not being able to
play around with Senpai casually now.

07:37.602 --> 07:39.533
Don't simply play around with me.

07:40.544 --> 07:41.736
Senpai.

07:42.580 --> 07:45.532
Won't you feel lonely without me around?

07:47.023 --> 07:49.869
Hmm... A little, I guess?

07:50.287 --> 07:53.617
Huh? What do you mean?
Don't hide your feeling.

07:53.657 --> 07:56.001
- You're disgusting.
- Ouch, that hurts.

07:58.016 --> 08:01.083
If we were in the same grade,

08:01.084 --> 08:04.009
I could quickly play around
with you during the break.

08:04.350 --> 08:05.890
It would cause trouble
for those around us.

08:06.856 --> 08:09.296
Sigh, it would be great if there was
a place where we could stay together,

08:09.297 --> 08:11.808
other than the club room.

08:14.577 --> 08:15.655
It's a date!

08:17.880 --> 08:20.066
Listen to your own will.

08:24.829 --> 08:26.740
For example...

08:27.565 --> 08:29.034
I'm just giving an example.

08:29.323 --> 08:30.410
What is that?

08:31.111 --> 08:34.414
Is there any place
you want to go during the holidays?

08:35.032 --> 08:36.241
A place?

08:37.731 --> 08:39.920
A place that I want to go to?

08:41.158 --> 08:42.633
That means...

08:44.431 --> 08:45.550
I said it out.

08:49.650 --> 08:52.515
Sanae-san, your bunny helmet is great.

08:53.600 --> 08:54.267
Really?

08:54.972 --> 08:56.720
A place that I want to go to?

08:57.220 --> 08:59.230
That means...

09:01.071 --> 09:03.068
Wait! That means...

09:03.213 --> 09:05.987
Does that mean...

09:06.336 --> 09:08.740
What do you mean?

09:09.485 --> 09:12.285
Nothing. I was just asking randomly.

09:12.630 --> 09:15.246
Oh, you're just asking randomly.

09:15.681 --> 09:17.248
A place that I want to go to...

09:18.424 --> 09:21.328
A place that I want to go to...

09:23.070 --> 09:24.339
I want to go to Mount Everest!

09:24.547 --> 09:26.508
Mount Everest?

09:26.697 --> 09:28.055
K2 is fine too.

09:28.103 --> 09:31.846
I always aim for the world's highest peak.

09:44.830 --> 09:45.820
Senpai!

09:52.188 --> 09:53.201
What about others?

09:53.442 --> 09:55.290
That's true.

09:56.956 --> 09:58.998
The African savannah!

10:02.100 --> 10:04.754
I want to see lions up close.

10:11.180 --> 10:12.290
You will die!

10:14.475 --> 10:15.432
What else?

10:16.618 --> 10:18.017
Antarctica!

10:18.541 --> 10:20.687
I want to see penguins.

10:24.783 --> 10:25.900
Others?

10:27.190 --> 10:28.862
The Amazon rainforest.

10:29.474 --> 10:30.805
Anything else?

10:31.704 --> 10:33.283
Space!

10:33.938 --> 10:37.656
Senpai, any place you
would like to go together?

10:37.743 --> 10:41.805
- Huh?
- All of the places are inaccessible.

10:42.140 --> 10:45.795
Places like the world's deepest trench,
Mariana Trench, are also okay.

10:46.410 --> 10:49.340
I was just asking you randomly.

10:49.932 --> 10:51.634
Just forget it.

10:54.722 --> 10:56.015
But...

10:56.016 --> 10:58.224
Somewhere nearer would be fine too.

10:59.895 --> 11:01.405
Can you give an example?

11:02.784 --> 11:04.064
That would be...

11:04.577 --> 11:05.607
What would that be?

11:06.520 --> 11:09.300
You figured it out yourself, Senpai.

11:10.892 --> 11:11.613
But...

11:11.940 --> 11:15.550
What's wrong with you? Are you testing me?

11:16.001 --> 11:19.370
I'm not trying to test you.

11:21.320 --> 11:23.958
A nearby... Nearby...

11:24.306 --> 11:26.920
Like a movie theatre or something...

11:32.629 --> 11:36.012
Hmm... That's just normal.

11:36.391 --> 11:38.389
Sigh, as I expected.

11:40.620 --> 11:43.520
No, it's not like that!
That's not bad also!

11:43.654 --> 11:44.729
That's not bad!

11:45.356 --> 11:48.858
I just hope it can be a bit more exciting.

11:50.394 --> 11:52.112
Exciting...

11:52.512 --> 11:56.616
For Nagatoro, movies
are probably quite boring.

11:56.950 --> 11:59.828
Things that Nagatoro would be interest in...

12:01.079 --> 12:02.122
Horse racing!

12:04.699 --> 12:07.460
Go!

12:12.008 --> 12:14.551
My pocket money for this month...

12:14.799 --> 12:17.679
Hey, that's not a place for
high school students to go.

12:18.213 --> 12:19.222
You're right.

12:20.012 --> 12:23.810
I'm still ambiguous about
Nagatoro's preferences.

12:25.080 --> 12:26.996
Your direction is pretty good.

12:27.059 --> 12:28.356
After all, I like horses too.

12:28.810 --> 12:31.234
Just a little more.

12:33.613 --> 12:36.614
Do you mean picking somewhere
with animals is correct?

12:37.309 --> 12:40.599
In Japan, a place with animals
and excitement would be...

12:45.418 --> 12:46.583
A sudden inspiration?

12:47.505 --> 12:48.334
Dog fighting!

12:50.692 --> 12:53.006
Bite them!

13:03.330 --> 13:05.476
We've come to a fork in the road.

13:10.598 --> 13:11.316
Goodbye.

13:11.785 --> 13:13.026
Hmm... Yeah...

13:17.949 --> 13:19.991
I still couldn't invite her in the end.

13:22.298 --> 13:26.497
But, I can't even guess a place
Nagatoro would want to go.

13:27.301 --> 13:29.090
(The road ahead is under construction)
How dare I suggest a date!

13:31.191 --> 13:33.004
I want to go see penguins.

13:49.660 --> 13:51.481
Um...

13:57.940 --> 14:01.282
How about going to an aquarium?

14:08.153 --> 14:10.041
How about it? What am I doing?

14:10.450 --> 14:12.560
What am I talking about this suddenly...

14:14.273 --> 14:16.965
Sorry, I didn't mean anything...

14:19.790 --> 14:21.386
What do you mean by that?

14:23.432 --> 14:26.224
Nothing, how should I say it...

14:28.201 --> 14:31.896
If you have something to say,
just say it clearly.

14:35.184 --> 14:37.318
Follow your own will.

14:40.683 --> 14:41.531
Aqua...

14:44.690 --> 14:45.952
Aquarium...

14:46.956 --> 14:49.205
Next weekend...

14:51.105 --> 14:53.543
Do you want to go?

14:59.660 --> 15:01.092
Oh, I said it.

15:01.405 --> 15:05.221
Huh? Is it a date?

15:05.292 --> 15:09.100
You're just a Senpai! You're annoying!

15:14.927 --> 15:15.739
Okay!

15:16.514 --> 15:17.316
Senpai.

15:25.253 --> 15:27.076
It's unbelievable.

15:27.300 --> 15:28.286
Unbelievable.

15:30.105 --> 15:35.090
(Don't Toy with Me, Miss Nagatoro
2nd Attack)

15:35.112 --> 15:40.097
(Don't Toy with Me, Miss Nagatoro
2nd Attack)

15:42.625 --> 15:46.345
Annoying!

15:46.574 --> 15:49.823
Disgusting!

15:49.880 --> 15:51.434
What songs are you singing?

15:53.680 --> 15:56.230
It will sound better
if harmony is added here.

15:56.676 --> 15:59.233
Yoshi! Come on, sing a song!

15:59.425 --> 16:00.109
Huh!

16:00.950 --> 16:03.905
- Annoying!
- Annoying!

16:04.060 --> 16:06.032
The harmony is not accurate enough! Again!

16:07.818 --> 16:09.410
You're too excited.

16:10.274 --> 16:13.581
- Annoying!
- Annoying!

16:14.050 --> 16:16.293
(Art Room)

16:22.014 --> 16:23.704
Not paying attention...

16:24.683 --> 16:27.011
What happened to you, senpai?

16:28.244 --> 16:30.848
No, nothing...

16:36.104 --> 16:37.230
It's a date!

16:39.430 --> 16:44.028
After all, that's all
because of Sunomiya's words.

16:45.206 --> 16:47.323
This weekend,

16:47.575 --> 16:52.036
I'm going to the aquarium with Nagatoro.

16:53.761 --> 16:55.531
Congratulations!

16:56.303 --> 16:57.303
No, it's not like that!

16:57.304 --> 17:00.461
I'm not sure
if it's something to celebrate.

17:01.097 --> 17:05.758
It feels like I'm going to be teased by
her all day, and the date will end soon.

17:06.017 --> 17:08.845
Congratulations on your date!

17:09.357 --> 17:12.275
No, it's not a date!

17:12.300 --> 17:14.934
It's just something to change my mood.

17:15.863 --> 17:19.397
Senpai, the unpopular role model
is going on a date...

17:19.892 --> 17:21.065
I have mixed feelings.

17:21.094 --> 17:22.532
No, I told you that...

17:22.671 --> 17:24.485
Even if the girl you date
is the evil girl...

17:24.714 --> 17:26.529
I still feel a surge of emotion.

17:27.320 --> 17:29.699
I shouldn't skip telling that much...

17:30.222 --> 17:33.828
Anyway, thank you!

17:35.830 --> 17:37.331
You're welcome.

17:41.502 --> 17:42.638
Hey!

17:43.934 --> 17:46.257
Hey!

17:48.290 --> 17:49.260
Hayacchi?

17:52.180 --> 17:53.806
She's not looking at the outside world.

17:54.542 --> 17:57.059
She was so excited earlier,
but then this happened.

17:57.990 --> 17:59.896
A temperature difference
that will kill the peacock fish.

18:01.293 --> 18:02.565
Come back!

18:04.604 --> 18:05.735
Ah, Yoshi!

18:06.182 --> 18:07.028
Hey.

18:07.237 --> 18:08.696
Hey!

18:09.260 --> 18:11.157
Do you want to go say hi to Senpai?

18:11.675 --> 18:14.160
Since we have ended
the club activity earlier today.

18:21.070 --> 18:24.337
Never mind.

18:25.919 --> 18:27.673
Are you tend to ignore senpai?

18:27.948 --> 18:29.634
No, that's not it!

18:30.333 --> 18:31.219
You look...

18:31.707 --> 18:32.678
You look...

18:33.841 --> 18:36.641
Leaving something delicious for later!

18:37.278 --> 18:38.809
To savour it

18:39.248 --> 18:41.812
carefully later...

18:42.458 --> 18:44.398
But now, you plan to put it aside!

18:45.834 --> 18:47.762
This is not good.

18:47.840 --> 18:48.945
Why?

18:49.440 --> 18:50.821
You know it well.

18:51.646 --> 18:54.325
Senpai is about to lose his virginity!

18:54.637 --> 18:55.451
Huh!

18:56.061 --> 18:59.747
Annoying!

18:59.987 --> 19:01.624
Disgusting!

19:01.884 --> 19:04.840
- Gross!
- We have to go warn Senpai!

19:05.101 --> 19:06.045
Warning!

19:09.405 --> 19:10.591
Hey yo!

19:13.312 --> 19:15.429
Ey? Isn't Senpai here?

19:15.785 --> 19:17.181
It's just me today.

19:17.620 --> 19:20.726
Huh? Are you the legendary freshman?

19:20.840 --> 19:22.324
New partner!

19:24.517 --> 19:25.910
She's on guard.

19:25.964 --> 19:28.668
Yoshi, you're too casual.

19:28.705 --> 19:29.610
Huh?

19:30.068 --> 19:31.320
Could it be...

19:31.818 --> 19:33.155
The legendary...

19:34.457 --> 19:35.616
Bad students...

19:37.604 --> 19:39.731
We're friends

19:39.732 --> 19:42.206
with Senpai and Nagatoro.

19:42.522 --> 19:44.458
We're not strangers.

19:45.605 --> 19:47.211
The gang of the evil girl!

19:48.463 --> 19:49.964
So, where's Senpai?

19:50.270 --> 19:53.009
Hachiouji-senpai went out
to get the art supplies.

19:53.341 --> 19:54.427
Oh, I see.

19:55.732 --> 19:57.722
I remember it's tomorrow, right? Day X.

19:57.965 --> 19:58.681
What should we do?

19:58.916 --> 20:00.433
Senpai is in crisis.

20:00.570 --> 20:03.894
We have to monitor him now.

20:03.988 --> 20:05.104
Oh yeah!

20:06.549 --> 20:08.024
They're planning to interfere!

20:25.455 --> 20:29.337
It will be nice
if you were a little bolder.

20:30.075 --> 20:32.298
Sister, you go out!

20:50.992 --> 20:53.724
Will my clothes look weird?

20:54.998 --> 20:55.838
Hairstyle...

20:57.022 --> 20:58.232
Shoes...

20:59.666 --> 21:00.826
Smell...

21:01.839 --> 21:03.621
Senpai.

21:09.573 --> 21:11.837
Hey, Senpai.

21:13.580 --> 21:15.299
Ah, um...

21:17.110 --> 21:20.221
Senpai, where are you taking me today?

21:20.481 --> 21:22.181
Are we going to a naughty place today?

21:22.566 --> 21:25.017
No, I said we're going to the aquarium.

21:25.391 --> 21:29.340
Huh? Are you going
to show me the garden eels?

21:29.402 --> 21:31.023
How pervert you are!

21:31.102 --> 21:33.115
What the perverted part is!

21:34.195 --> 21:36.821
We'll protect Senpai's virginity!

21:48.195 --> 21:49.875
Senpai's love...

21:51.930 --> 21:53.421
I will protect.

23:26.020 --> 23:27.215
The reflection point of today!

23:27.247 --> 23:29.145
Senpai, what do you
have to reflect on today?

23:29.207 --> 23:31.309
- Huh? Even though there are many things...
- Many things...

23:31.360 --> 23:33.979
But, the important thing is that I want
to get to know Nagatoro a little better.

23:34.051 --> 23:36.520
Disgusting! Don't be too cocky.

23:36.583 --> 23:37.525
I'm not getting cocky.

23:37.571 --> 23:39.609
Anyway, stay tuned for that!
