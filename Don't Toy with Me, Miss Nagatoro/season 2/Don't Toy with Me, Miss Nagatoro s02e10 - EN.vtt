01:48.980 --> 01:50.200
<i>Animals?</i>

01:50.200 --> 01:51.400

Oh, hey.

02:16.570 --> 02:19.800
Will you reward me with a kiss?

02:37.480 --> 02:39.400
You thought I was serious?!

02:39.400 --> 02:40.340
That's creepy!

02:40.340 --> 02:42.760
You're so creepy!

02:44.060 --> 02:45.810
Senpai!

02:46.410 --> 02:49.160
You're looking as sus as ever.

02:49.160 --> 02:50.890
You're a third-year starting today.

02:50.890 --> 02:53.750
Why don't you try acting 
a little more proper?

02:53.750 --> 02:55.900
Stop it!

02:56.800 --> 02:57.510
Huh?

02:58.150 --> 03:00.650
You still haven't started anything?

03:00.650 --> 03:02.240
I-I haven't.

03:02.240 --> 03:05.330
I can't decide what to paint.

03:07.970 --> 03:13.170
Were you maybe hoping I would model for you?

03:13.470 --> 03:15.990
N-No, of course not!

03:19.030 --> 03:22.840
Well... actually, yeah.

03:23.660 --> 03:26.600
I-If you aren't too busy,

03:27.250 --> 03:30.980
would you mind modeling for me again?

03:33.360 --> 03:34.780
Oh, fine.

03:34.780 --> 03:38.730
I get to choose my outfit, though.

03:41.870 --> 03:45.090
The clothes she's wearing are fine...

03:53.700 --> 03:56.750
Your favorite, Senpai.

03:58.590 --> 04:03.010
The competition swimsuit!

04:03.010 --> 04:07.010
D-Do you always have that with you?!

04:07.010 --> 04:11.770
I thought this might happen someday, 
so I hid it in the prep room next door.

04:13.290 --> 04:18.680
B-But I don't know about painting a picture 
of a highly exposed girl at school, though.

04:18.680 --> 04:22.110
What?! Don't be so boring!

04:22.460 --> 04:27.160
There's tons of pervy art from all throughout 
history and all over the world, isn't there?!

04:28.030 --> 04:31.370
I think that's a bit 
different from pervy art...

04:31.740 --> 04:37.800
I guess it's too much for a virgin 
closet pervert like you, Senpai.

04:39.310 --> 04:41.120
Wh-Whatever.

04:41.120 --> 04:44.760
I wouldn't mind painting a swimsuit, I guess.

05:02.990 --> 05:06.250
Will you reward me with a kiss?

05:11.200 --> 05:13.530
<i>Wh-Why am I still thinking about that?</i>

05:14.400 --> 05:18.880
So it <i>is</i> too stimulating 
for my virgin Senpai.

05:18.880 --> 05:21.210
Your face is beet red.

05:21.210 --> 05:23.080
Wh-Whatever!

05:23.080 --> 05:24.740
I'm just painting you normally!

05:24.740 --> 05:26.090
Are you?

05:26.090 --> 05:27.470
Sorry!

05:53.570 --> 05:54.880
Thanks.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.380
You can take a ten-minute break.

05:56.380 --> 05:57.620
A'ight.

05:58.890 --> 06:03.250
My shoulders are stiff from you ogling me.

06:03.250 --> 06:05.760
I-I wasn't ogling!

06:05.760 --> 06:09.150
I-I was looking at you for 
the sake of making art.

06:09.150 --> 06:12.000
I wasn't looking at you for pervy reasons.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.430
Sounds like an excuse.

06:13.430 --> 06:14.880
I-It's not!

06:14.880 --> 06:16.110
Ow, ow...

06:17.180 --> 06:21.900
My back's messed up from you 
violating me with your eyes.

06:23.090 --> 06:24.270
Are you all right?

06:24.560 --> 06:26.150
All right how?

06:26.460 --> 06:31.410
I mean, I hear modeling is pretty hard work.

06:31.410 --> 06:34.950
Are you worried about me?

06:35.630 --> 06:37.040
I g-guess.

06:37.040 --> 06:38.790
I'm totally fine.

06:38.790 --> 06:41.910
I'm a spry high school girl over here.

06:41.910 --> 06:44.000
Unlike bean sprout Senpai.

06:44.420 --> 06:46.410
O-Okay.

06:46.410 --> 06:49.600
But if you care...

06:50.580 --> 06:53.610
You should give me a massage, Senpai.

06:54.700 --> 07:00.700
I th-think there are all kinds of problems 
with a boy massaging a girl.

07:00.700 --> 07:02.350
Ow, ow, ow!

07:02.350 --> 07:05.480
M-My back's getting worse!

07:07.120 --> 07:08.380
Senpai!

07:08.380 --> 07:10.840
Hurry up and rub my back!

07:10.840 --> 07:12.960
A-A-All right! Fine!

07:12.960 --> 07:14.150
Just a bit!

07:14.150 --> 07:15.370
Yay!

07:15.930 --> 07:19.820
I g-guess I've massaged you before.

07:22.020 --> 07:25.590
Y-You mean, while dressed like that?

07:25.590 --> 07:27.500
Please and thank you.

07:27.500 --> 07:30.340
It'll be easier to massage me, right?

07:30.620 --> 07:32.180
No, no, no...

07:32.180 --> 07:34.300
Some clothes won't make a difference.

07:34.300 --> 07:35.300
Ow!

07:35.300 --> 07:36.430
Ow, ow, ow!

07:36.430 --> 07:39.820
Hurry up and massage me!

07:39.820 --> 07:42.940
N-Not too much.

07:43.170 --> 07:44.530
Okay.

07:44.530 --> 07:47.940
Give it a good knead right here.

07:59.220 --> 08:00.330
Heungh!

08:00.330 --> 08:01.640
Heungh?!

08:01.640 --> 08:03.960
D-Don't make such weird sounds!

08:03.960 --> 08:07.250
Your kneading just felt really good.

08:07.250 --> 08:08.590
I couldn't help it.

08:08.870 --> 08:10.860
I think we should stop.

08:10.860 --> 08:11.560
Ow!

08:11.560 --> 08:12.720
Ow, ow, ow!

08:12.720 --> 08:13.850
Keep going!

08:13.850 --> 08:16.630
Continue! Please!

08:16.630 --> 08:18.260
Fine!

08:24.700 --> 08:26.280
<i>She's pretty stiff.</i>

08:27.100 --> 08:29.860
You're working hard, huh, Nagatoro?

08:30.800 --> 08:32.690
Wh-What's that about?

08:32.690 --> 08:36.490
I'm not going to do anything naughty
 just because you praised me.

08:36.490 --> 08:39.590
I-I wasn't thinking that!

08:40.660 --> 08:42.580
Thanks, Senpai.

08:42.580 --> 08:44.830
Th-That's it?

08:46.680 --> 08:49.040
I feel better.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.460
That's good.

08:53.320 --> 08:54.280
Senpai...

08:55.460 --> 08:58.760
I've decided to join the judo club.

09:00.160 --> 09:02.390
Y-You did, huh?

09:02.970 --> 09:05.930
I have a goal now.

09:05.930 --> 09:08.520
To beat that Orihara girl?

09:12.480 --> 09:17.560
To beat her and get your reward kiss.

09:18.540 --> 09:20.910
Y-You were serious?!

09:21.180 --> 09:23.430
I told you I was.

09:23.430 --> 09:25.410
I said I wasn't messing.

09:25.650 --> 09:27.920
J-J-Just a second!

09:29.450 --> 09:33.210
I n-never agreed to anything like that!

09:33.210 --> 09:34.670
Do you not want to?

09:36.050 --> 09:40.140
Do you not want to kiss me?

09:59.120 --> 10:00.480
N-N-N-No!

10:00.480 --> 10:03.910
It's not that I don't want to, but...

10:04.190 --> 10:09.910
It's not something you should 
treat like a g-g-game prize!

10:10.490 --> 10:13.710
It's a simple question, Senpai.

10:15.470 --> 10:19.050
Do you want to kiss me?

10:19.050 --> 10:21.800
Or do you not?

10:21.800 --> 10:23.990
That's all there is to it!

10:24.430 --> 10:25.370
Well?

10:25.370 --> 10:27.000
Which is it, Senpai?

10:27.000 --> 10:28.940
Do you want to kiss me or don't you?

10:28.940 --> 10:30.210
Well?

10:30.210 --> 10:31.560
Well?!

10:38.290 --> 10:39.980
Y-You're...

10:42.960 --> 10:45.420
It's been a while, Hachioji-senpai.

10:46.090 --> 10:48.410
I would like to join the art club.

11:12.610 --> 11:15.020
Y-You came to Kazehaya High School, huh?

11:15.440 --> 11:16.490
Yes.

11:16.490 --> 11:18.430
My cousin recommended it.

11:18.930 --> 11:21.660
Besides, you're here, Hachioji-senpai.

11:21.660 --> 11:24.190
I-I see.

11:24.720 --> 11:26.480
Uh... So...

11:26.480 --> 11:29.450
She was in my middle school art club.

11:29.450 --> 11:30.860
I'm Sunomiya.

11:30.860 --> 11:32.540
It's nice to meet you.

11:32.540 --> 11:34.670
Nice to meet you!

11:35.110 --> 11:38.000
You were in the same club, huh?

11:38.290 --> 11:38.980
Yes.

11:39.420 --> 11:43.330
I was a beginner, so he 
taught me hand-in-hand.

11:44.750 --> 11:47.140
Hand-in-hand...

11:47.560 --> 11:51.310
Hachioji-senpai taught me a lot.

11:51.680 --> 11:52.740
Hear that?!

11:52.740 --> 11:55.820
You're well-liked, Hachioji-senpai!

11:55.820 --> 11:58.580
N-Nah, it wasn't a big deal.

11:58.580 --> 12:01.320
You taught her hand-in-hand, huh?

12:01.320 --> 12:04.240
Nah, I just taught her the basics.

12:04.240 --> 12:06.950
She learned really quickly, so...

12:06.950 --> 12:09.520
Why are you being so squiggly?

12:10.470 --> 12:11.430
Gross!

12:13.050 --> 12:16.670
Um, would you please introduce her?

12:17.440 --> 12:19.250
Oh, sorry.

12:19.250 --> 12:20.680
Sorry.

12:20.680 --> 12:22.330
She's Nagatoro.

12:22.330 --> 12:23.930
She's a second-year.

12:28.790 --> 12:29.640
That's it?

12:30.570 --> 12:31.680
No.

12:31.680 --> 12:35.490
As you can see, she can look a bit scary,

12:35.490 --> 12:38.320
but she's not actually that 
harmful, like, I mean...

12:39.320 --> 12:43.780
Who do you think you are, 
toying with me, Senpai?!

12:44.700 --> 12:47.570
I'm not trying to toy with you!

12:48.360 --> 12:50.490
May I, both of you?

12:51.520 --> 12:53.760
Right. Go ahead.

12:53.760 --> 12:54.870
Go ahead.

12:54.870 --> 12:58.380
<b>Art Room</b>

12:55.310 --> 12:58.380
I apologize, but earlier while 
I was in the hallway...

12:58.380 --> 13:02.640
Do you want to kiss me or don't you?

13:02.640 --> 13:05.090
I overheard something about a kiss.

13:05.760 --> 13:08.470
Are you two in a relationship?

13:13.350 --> 13:15.610
Aw, shucks!

13:15.610 --> 13:17.230
I guess it looks like that, huh?

13:17.500 --> 13:18.890
That's gross.

13:18.890 --> 13:20.230
So gross.

13:20.440 --> 13:21.150
Huh?!

13:21.150 --> 13:22.630
No, we're not!

13:22.630 --> 13:23.900
It's nothing like that!

13:24.900 --> 13:28.900
It's not a romantic relationship 
or anything like that...

13:28.900 --> 13:30.370
It's, like...

13:30.370 --> 13:31.110
Punch!

13:31.110 --> 13:31.870
Ow!

13:32.280 --> 13:34.100
Wh-What was that for?

13:34.100 --> 13:36.050
You're being creepy, so I punched you.

13:36.050 --> 13:37.370
Don't punch.

13:37.660 --> 13:42.920
I ask Nagatoro to model 
for me sometimes, so...

13:43.400 --> 13:46.550
So she's not a member of the club?

13:47.310 --> 13:49.140
N-Not really.

13:49.820 --> 13:52.420
She's joining the judo club. Right?

13:52.420 --> 13:53.640
That's right.

13:54.090 --> 13:57.190
You've been coming here a lot,

13:57.190 --> 14:00.900
but I guess you're going to be 
focusing on that from now on, then?

14:01.360 --> 14:04.280
I guess... I am.

14:04.610 --> 14:05.960
Understood.

14:05.960 --> 14:07.980
Are there any other members?

14:07.980 --> 14:08.730
Huh?

14:08.730 --> 14:10.640
No, not really.

14:12.150 --> 14:18.960
So it's going to be just 
the two of us in the club?

14:22.580 --> 14:24.400
Y-Yeah.

14:24.400 --> 14:27.910
If we don't get any more members, I guess.

14:28.810 --> 14:31.870
Sunomiya-chan, you should be careful.

14:31.870 --> 14:34.130
About what, Nagatoro-senpai?

14:34.130 --> 14:37.710
Stay too long with this creepy 
creep of a senpai, and...

14:37.710 --> 14:38.810
And?

14:39.520 --> 14:43.200
You'll be infected with his 
creepy squiggly motions.

14:43.200 --> 14:45.440
Stop telling her nonsense!

14:46.690 --> 14:50.860
It's true that Hachioji-senpai 
has idiosyncratic mannerisms.

14:51.540 --> 14:52.430
Right?!

14:52.430 --> 14:56.650
But I have a way of finding beauty 
in all manner of oddities.

14:56.650 --> 14:57.290
Beauty?

14:57.290 --> 14:58.620
Oddities?!

15:00.420 --> 15:02.710
Please proceed with your squiggliness.

15:03.120 --> 15:04.460
She's squiggling!

15:08.590 --> 15:12.470
I lack experience, but I look
 forward to learning from you.

15:13.920 --> 15:16.420
No, same to you.

15:18.500 --> 15:19.730
'Sup?

15:20.780 --> 15:22.030
'S-Sup?

15:22.030 --> 15:23.100
'Sup?

15:23.460 --> 15:25.860
Hayacchi, we're going to our club meet.

15:25.860 --> 15:28.460
Were we starting today?

15:28.460 --> 15:30.190
It's our first day. We can't slack off.

15:30.190 --> 15:31.530
Let's go in strong.

15:31.530 --> 15:34.370
I don't care for that kind of enthusiasm.

15:34.780 --> 15:37.330
<i>So the friends have joined 
the judo club, too.</i>

15:43.740 --> 15:47.560
In that case, why don't 
we stop here for today?

15:47.560 --> 15:49.380
We can continue next time.

15:50.460 --> 15:52.160
Yeah, all right.

15:53.830 --> 15:57.280
Well, do you want to do some 
life drawings, Sunomiya-kun?

15:57.280 --> 15:58.770
I'd love to.

15:58.770 --> 16:00.990
We have plenty of subjects.

16:00.990 --> 16:03.670
Animals, plaster figures...

16:03.670 --> 16:04.780
Yes, sir.

16:08.630 --> 16:11.150
Paisen's switching to another chick!

16:11.150 --> 16:12.530
What?!

16:12.530 --> 16:13.720
No, no!

16:13.720 --> 16:14.960
"Switching"?!

16:14.960 --> 16:17.660
Please stop using weird phrases!

16:17.660 --> 16:20.260
We're just going to be 
working on our own stuff.

16:20.260 --> 16:22.160
That's all.

16:23.480 --> 16:24.890
Nagatoro-senpai.

16:25.920 --> 16:29.240
It looks like you've been 
modeling in a swimsuit.

16:33.900 --> 16:37.280
I'm prepared to become a nude model.

16:38.530 --> 16:40.070
Stop!

16:40.070 --> 16:44.640
The bunny lady finally graduated, and now 
we've got someone just like her again!

16:44.640 --> 16:45.390
You, there!

16:45.390 --> 16:46.520
Get dressed!

16:46.520 --> 16:48.270
Well, yeah.

16:48.270 --> 16:50.030
She's the president's cousin.

16:54.150 --> 16:55.740
Stop undressing!

17:02.740 --> 17:04.370
Your footwork is weak.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.160
Yes'm.

17:07.840 --> 17:10.090
Though it's been a while for you, hasn't it?

17:10.090 --> 17:11.270
Don't push yourself too hard.

17:11.270 --> 17:12.800
Yes'm.

17:16.110 --> 17:17.200
How'd it go?

17:17.200 --> 17:19.690
Man, I got tossed around.

17:19.690 --> 17:21.030
Same.

17:21.530 --> 17:22.530
'Sup!

17:25.150 --> 17:26.290
'Sup.

17:26.290 --> 17:27.560
'Sup.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.190
Looks like you're having a pretty hard time.

17:34.590 --> 17:36.590
<b>Art Room</b>

17:38.730 --> 17:40.080
I see.

17:40.080 --> 17:44.800
There's something I notice
when I line up your pieces.

17:44.800 --> 17:45.400
Huh?

17:45.970 --> 17:48.080
What do you notice?

17:48.620 --> 17:52.750
Compared to your old art, 
your new art is more colorful.

17:54.700 --> 17:58.800
If I may make some frank observations...

17:59.330 --> 18:03.680
You used more drab colors in middle school.

18:04.140 --> 18:07.850
It was impressive, 
but it seemed quite reserved.

18:08.980 --> 18:10.650
D-Did it?

18:11.310 --> 18:14.720
You've met her, haven't you?

18:16.560 --> 18:19.910
You've met the goddess 
who's changed your world!

18:22.370 --> 18:24.200
You're still a white belt, Gamo-chan.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.720
I think you're just not used to it yet.

18:26.720 --> 18:28.170
True.

18:28.170 --> 18:29.790
But you, Hayacchi...

18:30.160 --> 18:32.030
You're distracted, aren't you?

18:33.530 --> 18:35.120
Not really.

18:35.120 --> 18:37.920
I just haven't gotten back in the groove yet.

18:37.920 --> 18:40.270
Is something bothering you?

18:40.270 --> 18:41.800
Not really!

18:42.080 --> 18:44.490
Oh, yeah, totally.

18:44.490 --> 18:47.020
Her precious boyfriend 
might get taken from her!

18:47.140 --> 18:48.560
Huh?!

18:48.880 --> 18:50.400
Ooh, who is it?

18:50.400 --> 18:53.800
That guy who was cheering 
for her at the tournament.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.610
Oh, that guy.

18:55.610 --> 18:57.780
He's not my boyfriend!

18:58.300 --> 19:00.480
He's our senpai, and he's in the art club.

19:00.480 --> 19:04.670
She's been having fun 
killing time in the club room.

19:04.670 --> 19:05.560
Uh-huh?

19:05.560 --> 19:10.370
Now she's in this club, so she won't have 
too much time to be over there...

19:10.370 --> 19:14.750
And to top it off, 
a new challenger has appeared!

19:15.170 --> 19:17.580
That's not even any of my business!

19:17.580 --> 19:22.060
I was just hanging out to pass the time...

19:26.900 --> 19:31.600
No, like I said, she was just 
coming here to mess with me.

19:32.020 --> 19:35.430
She's not a goddess so much as a demon.

19:35.430 --> 19:36.440
A demon...

19:37.350 --> 19:41.150
Then why did you have so 
many pictures of a demon?

19:41.600 --> 19:46.530
She was kind of making me draw her, at first.

19:50.390 --> 19:53.740
But then it ended up being fun, so...

19:55.150 --> 19:56.210
I see!

19:56.210 --> 19:59.240
You're anxious because you're 
worried about your boyfriend.

19:59.870 --> 20:01.870
You're such a girly girl, Hayacchi.

20:05.680 --> 20:07.050
He's not my boyfriend!

20:07.050 --> 20:08.720
I'm not anxious!

20:08.960 --> 20:10.730
Will it be love? Will it be judo?

20:10.730 --> 20:14.100
Which will Hayacchi choose?

20:15.190 --> 20:16.000
Well?

20:16.180 --> 20:17.020
Well?

20:17.130 --> 20:18.480
Well?!

20:22.460 --> 20:24.850
I'm going to concentrate when I'm doing judo.

20:24.850 --> 20:29.580
But I'm going to go toy 
with Senpai just as hard.

20:29.860 --> 20:32.910
So you're taking everything you want, huh?

20:33.280 --> 20:34.870
Obviously!

20:34.870 --> 20:36.920
Not that he's my boyfriend, though.

20:38.380 --> 20:40.990
I'm not surprised she's like that. Right?

20:40.990 --> 20:42.000
Right?

20:47.070 --> 20:49.130
I understand now.

20:49.130 --> 20:50.640
U-Understand what?

20:51.010 --> 20:54.690
This club room is a nest of 
love for you and the demon.

20:54.690 --> 20:56.060
Nest?!

20:56.520 --> 21:01.280
You and the demon have been 
nurturing a forbidden love here.

21:01.280 --> 21:02.290
No, no, no.

21:02.290 --> 21:04.230
It's nothing like that.

21:04.230 --> 21:08.690
Alas, you've parted ways, 
and lost your love nest.

21:10.480 --> 21:12.000
Now, what will you do?!

21:13.280 --> 21:15.620
I don't know how to answer that.

21:15.620 --> 21:18.960
You must go grab it for yourself, Senpai.

21:18.960 --> 21:20.010
Grab what?

21:20.010 --> 21:21.260
Love!

21:22.600 --> 21:25.040
Sana-neesan said so.

21:25.040 --> 21:28.760
Love is to be sought and grasped.

21:29.110 --> 21:30.790
<i>President...</i>

21:30.790 --> 21:32.640
<i>That sounds like something she'd say.</i>

21:33.150 --> 21:36.130
Setting aside love and all that...

21:36.130 --> 21:37.400
Setting that aside?

21:37.780 --> 21:42.580
I m-mean, I do think I'd kinda miss her, but...

21:42.580 --> 21:44.640
But what do I do?

21:44.640 --> 21:46.820
Is it not obvious?

21:48.460 --> 21:49.670
Go on a date.

21:50.760 --> 21:51.560
<i>D-Da—</i>

21:51.560 --> 21:54.380
<i>D-D-D-Da—</i>

23:25.590 --> 23:26.840
Points of improvement for today.

23:26.840 --> 23:27.920
Here we go, mini bunny.

23:27.920 --> 23:30.820
Hachioji-senpai is unaware of 
his own love for the demon.

23:30.820 --> 23:31.340
Hey!

23:31.340 --> 23:31.980
Demon?

23:31.980 --> 23:33.830
Yes, I mean Nagatoro-senpai.

23:33.830 --> 23:36.520
Senpai, is that what you've been calling me?!

23:36.520 --> 23:37.310
N-No!

23:38.010 --> 23:39.930
So this is the way in which she's a demon.
