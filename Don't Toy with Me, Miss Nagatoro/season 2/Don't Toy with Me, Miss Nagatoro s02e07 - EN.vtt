00:04.670 --> 00:05.570
Huh?

00:05.570 --> 00:06.990
Which way does it go?

00:08.330 --> 00:10.420
How does this work again?

00:10.420 --> 00:12.990
It might tear if I keep messing with it.

00:14.290 --> 00:15.390
Nao-kun!

00:15.390 --> 00:16.700
Dinner's ready!

00:16.700 --> 00:18.300
I'll be right there!

00:18.300 --> 00:19.600
Damn it!

00:19.600 --> 00:21.680
How is this supposed to fit?!

00:34.840 --> 00:41.760
<b>DON'T TOY WITH ME,
MISS NAGATORO</b>

00:34.840 --> 00:41.760
<b>DON'T TOY WITH ME,
MISS NAGATORO</b>

01:53.090 --> 02:03.100
<b></b>I Figured That's How You'd Ski, <b>Senpai</b>.

01:55.550 --> 01:56.470
<b></b>I Figured That's How You'd Ski, <b>Senpai</b>.

01:59.050 --> 02:01.140
'Sup, Senpai!

02:01.440 --> 02:03.860
Y-Yeah...

02:03.860 --> 02:04.890
'Sup.

02:10.290 --> 02:11.800
Hey, look...

02:12.710 --> 02:14.650
Contact lenses!

02:14.650 --> 02:18.470
Wow, you're switching to contacts?

02:18.470 --> 02:21.160
N-No, well...

02:21.560 --> 02:24.080
Are you trying for a glow-up?

02:24.080 --> 02:28.160
Are you trying to stop being a 
four-eyed dork and become a gigachad?

02:28.530 --> 02:30.650
I-I'm not!

02:30.650 --> 02:33.190
It's just that glasses get annoying,

02:33.190 --> 02:35.840
so I figured I'd try contacts for a change.

02:36.380 --> 02:39.590
Why don't you try them on, then?

02:39.590 --> 02:40.510
Now.

02:41.580 --> 02:43.760
Nah, I dunno...

02:44.530 --> 02:46.280
Senpai.

02:49.190 --> 02:51.810
So you bought them out of curiosity,

02:51.810 --> 02:55.020
but you're too scared to put them in.

02:57.060 --> 03:00.270
You squeamish, chickeney little boy.

03:00.270 --> 03:03.320
You can't even put in contacts!

03:03.320 --> 03:06.160
Poor you, Senpai.

03:08.860 --> 03:10.560
Sh-Shush!

03:10.560 --> 03:12.000
Oh, you.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.540
All right, then.

03:14.240 --> 03:18.420
I'll put them in for you.

03:20.730 --> 03:23.200
Oops, my hand slipped!

03:25.630 --> 03:27.620
I-I'll pass.

03:27.620 --> 03:29.960
I'll try it myself someday.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.850
Stop being such a wuss.

03:32.160 --> 03:33.440
It'll be okay.

03:33.440 --> 03:37.510
My brother used to not want 
to put his contacts in either.

03:37.510 --> 03:40.390
So I put them in for him once.

03:40.390 --> 03:41.610
Huh.

03:42.110 --> 03:45.450
Believe it or not, I'm a veteran.

03:46.190 --> 03:47.630
<i>She's right, though.</i>

03:47.630 --> 03:51.150
<i>I'm never going to get them in by myself.</i>

03:53.150 --> 03:55.960
Well, could you, then?

04:09.620 --> 04:13.320
<b>Art Room</b>

04:10.340 --> 04:12.880
Okay, first, take off your glasses, please.

04:16.290 --> 04:18.620
Gimme a sec.

04:23.200 --> 04:27.440
<i>L-Look at me, not getting flustered 
over something like this.</i>

04:28.990 --> 04:30.040
<i>Clear your mind...</i>

04:31.020 --> 04:32.870
<i>Clear your mind, and...</i>

04:33.470 --> 04:37.380
Senpai, open your eyes, please.

04:44.140 --> 04:46.720
Don't move, all right,

04:47.690 --> 04:49.950
Senpai?

04:50.720 --> 04:53.200
W-Wait, hang on!

04:53.200 --> 04:55.000
Wait, please.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.760
Hold on!

04:58.670 --> 05:01.650
Why should I stop now?

05:05.510 --> 05:07.630
Ready?

05:07.630 --> 05:10.030
I'm putting it in.

05:25.240 --> 05:26.840
It's in.

05:32.860 --> 05:35.680
Don't say it like <i>that.</i>

05:35.680 --> 05:36.840
What's wrong?

05:36.840 --> 05:39.690
Are you crying, Senpai?

05:39.970 --> 05:42.320
I-I'm not crying!

05:43.850 --> 05:48.060
Okay, let's do the other side, then.

05:48.060 --> 05:50.010
O-Okay.

05:50.010 --> 05:53.510
All right, ready?

05:57.440 --> 05:58.600
How are they?

05:58.600 --> 06:01.380
Th-They're okay, I guess.

06:02.570 --> 06:07.060
Actually, I never knew everything 
could look so clear without frames.

06:13.980 --> 06:18.770
You can't do your usual thing if 
you're wearing contacts, though.

06:18.770 --> 06:19.380
Usual thing?

06:19.380 --> 06:21.660
Senpai, can I see your glasses?

06:21.660 --> 06:23.980
Huh? S-Sure...

06:38.870 --> 06:40.600
This thing.

06:40.600 --> 06:43.660
You always do this when you're tense.

06:47.380 --> 06:48.470
Huh?

06:48.470 --> 06:53.390
Hang on, Senpai, are you getting
turned on by seeing me in glasses?

06:54.210 --> 06:55.150
I-I'm not!

06:55.150 --> 06:56.170
See? Look!

06:56.170 --> 06:57.660
You're doing it!

06:57.660 --> 06:59.620
You're definitely tense, Senpai.

06:59.620 --> 07:00.520
I'm not!

07:00.520 --> 07:03.640
See? You're doing it even 
without your glasses!

07:03.640 --> 07:05.160
No, I'm just...

07:26.060 --> 07:29.650
Damn. I almost beat you, Hayacchi.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.180
You weren't even close.

07:31.180 --> 07:32.460
Amateur.

07:32.460 --> 07:35.220
Which course should we do next?

07:35.220 --> 07:36.590
Wow.

07:36.590 --> 07:38.850
They came down via the black course.

07:38.850 --> 07:42.010
Those popular-looking girls 
are first-years, aren't they?

07:43.360 --> 07:46.560
Meanwhile, we've been going 
to ski camp for two years,

07:46.560 --> 07:48.410
and we can barely do the beginner's course.

07:48.410 --> 07:49.780
We're pathetic.

07:49.780 --> 07:51.540
Don't say it.

07:51.540 --> 07:54.160
Must be fun being able to ski so well.

07:54.160 --> 07:55.370
Right?

08:05.140 --> 08:09.290
Looks like no one can keep up
 with me on this slope.

08:14.600 --> 08:15.960
Senpai?!

08:16.920 --> 08:18.700
Not bad, Senpai.

08:18.700 --> 08:20.600
Especially coming from you.

08:21.920 --> 08:24.260
This is nothing.

08:24.260 --> 08:27.620
All right, let's race to the bottom!

08:28.700 --> 08:29.860
Very well.

08:35.950 --> 08:37.500
You okay?

08:37.500 --> 08:38.400
Scary...

08:41.760 --> 08:43.650
Wanna take a break?

08:43.650 --> 08:46.440
It hasn't even been an hour yet.

08:46.440 --> 08:47.760
Why don't we go a bit more?

08:47.760 --> 08:51.250
Nah, we're hopeless, 
no matter how much we practice.

08:51.250 --> 08:52.580
Exactly.

08:54.380 --> 08:57.390
Hey, here comes one of the popular girls.

08:57.780 --> 08:58.580
Uh-oh.

08:58.580 --> 08:59.630
Have you done something?

08:59.630 --> 09:00.510
Dunno.

09:02.950 --> 09:05.010
'Sup, Senpai?

09:06.140 --> 09:07.860
'S-'Sup?

09:07.860 --> 09:08.610
What?!

09:08.610 --> 09:09.610
You know her?!

09:09.610 --> 09:11.780
Y-Yeah, I guess.

09:12.440 --> 09:15.030
Are you skiing with your friends?

09:15.320 --> 09:19.120
N-Nah, we aren't really skiing much.

09:19.120 --> 09:22.370
Mostly just chatting.

09:22.790 --> 09:26.120
Wanna stop wasting time and come ski with me?

09:26.700 --> 09:29.120
I-I guess I could.

09:29.960 --> 09:32.710
Okay, I'm taking Senpai with me.

09:32.960 --> 09:34.860
Sure, sure.

09:34.860 --> 09:36.210
Hurry up, Senpai.

09:36.210 --> 09:37.620
Hurry, hurry.

09:40.170 --> 09:41.820
Nao-kun, no way...

09:41.820 --> 09:43.310
Are you two going out?!

09:44.430 --> 09:47.160
N-Naw...

09:48.810 --> 09:49.860
Ew.

09:55.170 --> 09:58.880
Senpai, don't tell me...

09:58.880 --> 10:02.110
Did they think we're dating or something?

10:02.110 --> 10:04.360
Whâ€”I-I 'unno.

10:04.360 --> 10:07.290
"I-I 'unno," he says.

10:07.290 --> 10:08.620
Gross!

10:09.420 --> 10:12.500
Wow, the slope is so flat.

10:12.500 --> 10:16.520
Beginner courses are way too easy for me.

10:16.520 --> 10:18.860
But sure, I'll do it with you.

10:18.860 --> 10:20.400
Why, thank you.

10:20.400 --> 10:23.520
Come on, Senpai, let's go!

10:23.520 --> 10:24.980
R-Right.

10:33.620 --> 10:35.090
I-I can't stop!

10:35.090 --> 10:36.190
Senpai!

10:36.190 --> 10:36.960
Brake!

10:37.060 --> 10:38.590
Brake!

10:45.790 --> 10:48.020
Senpai!

10:50.250 --> 10:54.480
I figured that's how you'd ski, Senpai.

10:55.050 --> 10:56.570
Of course it is!

10:56.570 --> 10:59.630
You didn't think I could 
actually ski, did you?

11:00.540 --> 11:03.590
I mean, everyone's got 
something they're good at.

11:03.590 --> 11:06.020
I thought maybe you'd be a good skier.

11:06.020 --> 11:07.020
No way!

11:07.020 --> 11:09.440
Eh, you aren't worse than I expected.

11:09.440 --> 11:12.000
Just gotta practice, Senpai.

11:15.710 --> 11:18.160
Let's start with the basics.

11:18.160 --> 11:19.620
O-Okay.

11:20.090 --> 11:23.470
Angle your skis so you 
can brake using the edge.

11:24.850 --> 11:25.710
That's it.

11:25.710 --> 11:27.160
That's the idea.

11:30.220 --> 11:31.420
S-Sorry.

11:31.800 --> 11:33.110
As expected.

11:33.110 --> 11:34.910
Exactly as expected.

11:57.920 --> 11:59.090
Come on.

11:59.090 --> 12:01.180
You gotta get a move on.

12:07.770 --> 12:09.380
Hayacchi spotted.

12:10.450 --> 12:12.080
Hey!

12:12.470 --> 12:13.790
Break a leg!

12:13.790 --> 12:15.460
See you later.

12:15.460 --> 12:16.580
So long!

12:27.560 --> 12:30.570
Nao-kun, can you ski a little now?

12:30.570 --> 12:32.480
No, not at all.

12:32.480 --> 12:34.430
What are you doing?

12:34.430 --> 12:37.600
You even had a private instructor.

12:37.600 --> 12:38.980
You gotta do better.

12:38.980 --> 12:41.000
I'm trying.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.360
Oh, it's the night skiers.

12:47.450 --> 12:49.120
Senpai!

12:50.880 --> 12:52.620
You're coming night skiing, right?

12:53.080 --> 12:55.400
I'm going to teach you good again.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.250
You'd better be ready.

13:00.250 --> 13:01.060
Nah...

13:05.590 --> 13:09.900
My legs kinda hurt from all the skiing.

13:12.720 --> 13:14.670
I'll pass on the night skiing.

13:15.620 --> 13:17.640
Oh, really?

13:19.240 --> 13:21.160
Oh, well, I guess.

13:21.680 --> 13:24.500
I hope you get a bit stronger.

13:24.500 --> 13:25.280
Later.

13:26.480 --> 13:28.310
Y-Yeah.

13:28.310 --> 13:29.340
Later.

13:30.470 --> 13:33.770
Are you sure you wanna
 blow off your private instructor?

13:33.770 --> 13:35.220
What a waste.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.300
It's fine.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.530
Are you sure?

13:42.970 --> 13:44.540
More popular girls!

13:44.540 --> 13:45.550
Do you know them?

13:46.080 --> 13:48.550
Y-Yeah, kinda.

13:48.890 --> 13:51.990
You really want to go skiing 
with Hayacchi, don't you?

13:51.990 --> 13:53.200
Don't you?

13:54.830 --> 13:56.020
Nah...

13:56.020 --> 13:59.850
I'm sure she'd rather ski at her own pace.

14:00.320 --> 14:03.440
I'd just end up slowing her down.

14:03.840 --> 14:07.550
Sure, she's about the 
best skier in our grade.

14:07.550 --> 14:09.160
She's next level.

14:09.160 --> 14:10.450
Next level!

14:11.820 --> 14:13.450
Although...

14:13.450 --> 14:16.330
That's not really the point, is it?

14:17.970 --> 14:19.120
Later!

14:19.120 --> 14:20.200
G'bye!

14:31.450 --> 14:34.310
Nao-kun's on his way to 
becoming a popular kid.

14:35.030 --> 14:36.220
I'm not!

14:37.060 --> 14:42.070
<b>DON'T TOY WITH ME,
MISS NAGATORO</b>

14:42.070 --> 14:47.070
<b>DON'T TOY WITH ME,

14:52.280 --> 14:54.530
<b>Beginner Course</b>

15:32.170 --> 15:35.360
<i>I thought I didn't like this kind of thing.</i>

15:51.800 --> 15:53.160
Senpai!

15:54.130 --> 15:55.890
Not bad, Senpai.

15:55.890 --> 15:57.750
Especially coming from you.

16:01.030 --> 16:03.640
Guess I'll try a little more.

16:08.060 --> 16:09.990
I can't stop!

16:23.840 --> 16:25.330
I'm sorry!

16:25.330 --> 16:27.270
A-Are you all right?

16:27.270 --> 16:28.940
Y-Yes.

16:29.590 --> 16:32.130
Thank you for helping him.

16:32.130 --> 16:34.590
O-Oh, it's fine.

16:35.280 --> 16:37.410
Thank you so much.

16:41.900 --> 16:44.640
Well, guess I'll ski some more.

16:47.660 --> 16:48.920
I totally can!

16:48.920 --> 16:50.300
Legit?!

16:51.610 --> 16:52.990
Aw, shit!

16:53.850 --> 16:55.550
<i>H-He's headed straight for me!</i>

17:10.010 --> 17:11.820
Watch where you're going.

17:13.520 --> 17:15.280
S-Sorry!

17:19.970 --> 17:21.240
Thanks.

17:21.240 --> 17:24.360
The way you were skiing 
when you helped that kid...

17:25.860 --> 17:29.770
That was pretty good, Senpai.

17:30.560 --> 17:33.030
Y-You saw?

17:33.440 --> 17:38.530
Man, I can recognize you 
from way in the distance.

17:38.530 --> 17:43.160
You're all wobbly, like a drunk driver.

17:46.170 --> 17:47.970
So funny.

17:52.030 --> 17:54.170
H-Hey...

17:54.560 --> 17:56.760
Yeah? What's up?

17:56.760 --> 17:59.890
I-I still can't ski well.

18:02.090 --> 18:04.770
S-Since we're here...

18:05.140 --> 18:07.270
Since we're here?

18:08.000 --> 18:11.900
C-Could you...

18:12.440 --> 18:14.860
Could I...

18:17.850 --> 18:19.850
Teach me some more?

18:19.850 --> 18:20.940
How to ski.

18:25.110 --> 18:27.720
F-Fine, then.

18:27.720 --> 18:31.920
I'd feel bad leaving you all alone.

18:34.920 --> 18:36.920
<b>Beginner Course</b>

18:41.930 --> 18:44.950
Senpai, you're looking down 
at your feet too much.

18:44.950 --> 18:47.060
You gotta keep your eyes forward.

18:47.060 --> 18:48.030
Okay.

18:48.030 --> 18:50.150
I keep staring down.

18:50.150 --> 18:51.400
What do I do?

18:55.920 --> 19:00.390
Just watch me for now.

19:03.890 --> 19:05.040
That's it.

19:05.040 --> 19:06.760
That's how you do it.

19:12.680 --> 19:15.450
Senpai's gazing at me!

19:16.620 --> 19:17.830
I'm not!

19:21.520 --> 19:24.220
We only have the AM for skiing, huh?

19:24.630 --> 19:26.370
That went by quick.

19:27.290 --> 19:29.060
So, how'd it go?

19:29.060 --> 19:33.100
Can Paisen ski a little now?

19:34.830 --> 19:36.720
Hey, just watch him.

19:36.720 --> 19:39.860
Watch what I can do with Senpai.

19:40.610 --> 19:43.570
Nao-kun-sensei, teach me how to ski.

19:43.570 --> 19:46.620
Your private instructor 
taught you how, didn't she?

19:46.860 --> 19:47.590
Huh?

19:47.590 --> 19:49.120
N-Nah...

19:49.120 --> 19:52.170
I'm not good enough to teach anyone.

19:52.600 --> 19:54.290
Just teach us.

19:54.780 --> 19:57.100
I-I guess I can teach you a bit.

19:57.590 --> 19:59.160
It's like this, and...

20:02.800 --> 20:05.790
LOLOLOLOL!

20:11.960 --> 20:13.960
<b>Art Room</b>

20:13.940 --> 20:17.320
<b>Art School
Admission</b>

20:14.360 --> 20:16.620
Congratulations on getting accepted.

20:17.760 --> 20:21.280
Of course you'd make it into 
art school straight out of high school.

20:21.280 --> 20:22.570
You're amazing.

20:23.080 --> 20:26.490
This is but a single step.

20:26.490 --> 20:28.720
Don't count your chickens, et cetera.

20:28.720 --> 20:29.840
Uh-huh.

20:30.380 --> 20:32.710
And it's your turn next.

20:33.860 --> 20:35.820
Have you decided what you're 
doing after graduation?

20:38.700 --> 20:42.550
I still want to aim for art school, too.

20:44.020 --> 20:45.130
Oh?

20:45.720 --> 20:48.470
I-I-Is something wrong?

20:50.260 --> 20:54.760
I never thought I'd hear such 
a positive response from you.

20:54.760 --> 20:56.460
I'm slightly surprised.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.960
A-Are you?

21:00.480 --> 21:03.220
Is it the cat-eared girl's influence?

21:04.950 --> 21:07.480
I-It's not really...

21:14.200 --> 21:18.120
<i>It's been about a year since I met Nagatoro.</i>

21:20.160 --> 21:21.880
Senpai!

21:23.040 --> 21:25.260
<i>She messes with me every day.</i>

21:26.510 --> 21:30.750
<i>I guess she might be influencing me a bit.</i>

21:32.060 --> 21:37.420
<i>But what are Nagatoro's plans for the future?</i>

21:38.980 --> 21:41.420
<i>What are her career goals?</i>

21:47.970 --> 21:51.420
<i>I actually don't know anything.</i>

23:25.900 --> 23:27.430
Points of improvement for today.

23:27.430 --> 23:29.800
Man, I never knew Nao-kun had a life.

23:29.800 --> 23:30.920
I-It's nothing like that.

23:30.920 --> 23:32.140
So, how far have you gone?

23:32.520 --> 23:34.680
Those popular girls told me.

23:34.680 --> 23:38.080
You're making her model in swimsuits 
and making her wear leggings and stuff.

23:38.080 --> 23:40.060
You're not wrong, but you're wrong!
