00:02.761 --> 00:04.237
Erm... Sister.

00:04.373 --> 00:05.905
Yes? Hayase-chan.

00:06.466 --> 00:08.779
Regarding the Christmas present...

00:08.859 --> 00:10.506
Do you have any suggestions?

00:10.624 --> 00:13.580
Why? Is it for someone important?

00:15.333 --> 00:18.544
No... that's impossible.

00:19.239 --> 00:22.804
I see. Maybe something consumable.

00:22.963 --> 00:23.757
Consumable?

00:23.989 --> 00:25.884
A gift like a dessert or bath fizzers

00:26.032 --> 00:28.428
that leave nothing behind
after you use it.

00:28.882 --> 00:31.390
And it will be not a problem
for the receiver.

00:32.274 --> 00:33.420
Leave nothing behind...

00:33.484 --> 00:35.225
It will be a good choice

00:35.305 --> 00:37.103
if the present isn't for someone special.

00:37.146 --> 00:38.564
It's true though...

00:40.173 --> 00:42.773
Speaking of the lasting gift,

00:42.805 --> 00:46.947
maybe something
that can be used all the time.

00:50.597 --> 00:52.226
Thank you so much!

00:52.404 --> 00:54.496
You're welcome, Hayase-chan.

00:54.826 --> 00:55.948
By the way, I'm thinking

00:56.027 --> 00:59.042
of a gift that can last forever.

00:59.468 --> 01:02.585
A life-size doll of myself.

01:02.622 --> 01:03.520
Thanks a bunch!

02:45.306 --> 02:47.002
This is astonishing.

02:48.110 --> 02:48.985
Senpai.

02:56.538 --> 02:58.662
Erm... This is for you...

02:59.893 --> 03:01.372
For me?

03:01.879 --> 03:04.293
It's Christmas.

03:15.099 --> 03:17.431
Argh, another spooky dream.

03:21.400 --> 03:22.289
That brat...

03:25.031 --> 03:27.149
Wonder what face she will make.

03:43.305 --> 03:44.582
Senpai.

03:45.983 --> 03:48.919
Do you know what day it is?

03:49.390 --> 03:50.838
The end-of-term ceremony.

03:51.036 --> 03:52.723
Yes, it is.

03:52.804 --> 03:55.843
The assembly just finished.

03:56.816 --> 03:58.847
What else?

04:00.045 --> 04:01.769
Christmas...

04:01.848 --> 04:02.600
Eve!

04:03.280 --> 04:06.729
The biggest festival of love, Christmas!

04:07.111 --> 04:09.483
Couples declare their love to each other

04:09.658 --> 04:11.829
and exchange presents.

04:11.854 --> 04:14.780
This is it, Christmas Eve!

04:15.915 --> 04:17.199
She's too delirious, isn't she?

04:17.464 --> 04:20.451
(Thump  Thump)
I can tell she's going to torture me
with Christmas as an excuse.

04:21.517 --> 04:25.915
"However, only loneliness
and pathetic feelings await you."

04:26.190 --> 04:27.459
Are you going to say that to me?

04:28.218 --> 04:29.761
Anyway,

04:29.841 --> 04:31.922
it's true, isn't it?

04:32.129 --> 04:35.341
Are you not alone during Christmas, huh?

04:37.031 --> 04:39.346
I better give it to her now and go home.

04:41.028 --> 04:41.764
This is for you.

04:42.706 --> 04:43.297
Bye!

04:44.016 --> 04:45.976
You're so pathetic, Senpai.

04:46.127 --> 04:49.529
Do you really have no one
with you on that day?

04:49.547 --> 04:50.555
(Library)

04:50.588 --> 04:51.899
Hello, there.

04:51.978 --> 04:53.735
Talk about perfect timing.

04:57.826 --> 05:00.033
Girls will be spilt into two groups.

05:00.293 --> 05:01.487
Meaning to say,

05:01.940 --> 05:03.327
one side with boys

05:03.427 --> 05:05.372
and one without boys.

05:06.704 --> 05:07.708
Oh.

05:08.084 --> 05:09.918
I'm truly sorry.

05:10.206 --> 05:13.288
I really want to spend the night with you.

05:13.620 --> 05:15.798
But it's Christmas Eve.

05:17.259 --> 05:18.927
I have no choice.

05:19.144 --> 05:20.017
Right?

05:20.059 --> 05:21.596
They're showing off. Jeez.

05:21.666 --> 05:22.487
Bugger off.

05:23.107 --> 05:26.435
All right! The group without boys
is going to karaoke tonight.

05:26.932 --> 05:29.062
The land still stands
despite the kingdom being broken!

05:30.603 --> 05:31.939
In that case,

05:32.605 --> 05:35.634
I'm going to miss the chance
to hand over the present.

05:37.790 --> 05:39.656
That is...

05:41.507 --> 05:42.389
This can't be true!

06:06.213 --> 06:08.601
Hayacchi, you're joining us, right?

06:09.377 --> 06:12.713
Erm... well...

06:13.009 --> 06:16.610
But isn't that her boy
sitting right beside her?

06:19.663 --> 06:20.940
Gosh! No!

06:21.021 --> 06:24.158
I just like to mess up with him.

06:24.529 --> 06:26.495
If so, you're in for the Karaoke team.

06:34.216 --> 06:36.807
Senpai, you're joining us. Right?

06:39.199 --> 06:41.134
What do you say?

06:41.214 --> 06:42.134
What's your answer?

06:43.040 --> 06:44.512
No... I'm not.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.648
I left something in the club room.

06:48.829 --> 06:50.392
I need to go now.

06:51.762 --> 06:53.596
Oh, that's right.

06:53.750 --> 06:56.858
I left my belongings somewhere too.

06:57.043 --> 06:58.735
Let's go, Senpai.

06:59.089 --> 07:00.487
Huh? Um...

07:02.228 --> 07:04.740
- Run now!
- Don't push me.

07:04.906 --> 07:06.391
What a lame excuse.

07:06.425 --> 07:07.494
So lame.

07:07.721 --> 07:10.831
Forget it. At least it's the best excuse
Senpai has ever had.

07:14.011 --> 07:17.002
Senpai, have you found your thing?

07:17.129 --> 07:18.379
Erm...

07:18.915 --> 07:21.216
I will just grab pencils or something.

07:33.404 --> 07:35.230
Well...

07:35.985 --> 07:38.274
Yes? What's it?

07:49.571 --> 07:51.329
What are you doing here, Bucho?

07:53.394 --> 07:55.375
This is the last day
staying in the club room.

07:56.190 --> 07:58.665
So, I would like to embrace
the air here bare-skin.

07:58.716 --> 08:01.255
Would you graduate already,
you perverted rabbit?

08:01.511 --> 08:04.675
What are you doing here instead?

08:05.767 --> 08:06.785
A tryst?

08:06.865 --> 08:08.221
No!

08:08.305 --> 08:09.923
Let's go, Senpai!

08:11.540 --> 08:13.435
School is now closed for the day.

08:13.980 --> 08:18.230
Students, please leave
the premise immediately.

08:18.680 --> 08:21.317
What should I do?
Give her to present on the way home?

08:22.266 --> 08:23.235
No way.

08:23.824 --> 08:25.930
It's embarrassed if someone sees us.

08:26.802 --> 08:29.826
Is there a place where people rarely go?

08:32.330 --> 08:35.373
It's Mr. Yamaguchi who's rigid
and strictly abides by school rules.

08:35.491 --> 08:37.583
We'll be forced to leave if he sees us.

08:38.861 --> 08:40.128
(Infirmary)
Infirmary!

08:40.918 --> 08:41.673
Good call!

08:51.635 --> 08:54.392
Oh my, I'm lured to the infirmary.

08:54.589 --> 08:56.811
Are you going to do something lewd to me?

08:56.854 --> 08:57.812
I won't!

08:58.609 --> 09:01.658
Though it's kind of weird
to give her the present here,

09:02.357 --> 09:06.196
I won't get a better chance
after we leave here.

09:07.105 --> 09:09.282
Well...

09:09.631 --> 09:12.451
Yes? What's it?

09:12.984 --> 09:14.828
Stay still.

09:15.212 --> 09:18.832
Sakura, you're kind of aggressive.

09:18.922 --> 09:21.126
Am I?

09:21.599 --> 09:24.278
Perhaps we should wait a little longer...

09:24.385 --> 09:26.883
What an old hat.

09:29.785 --> 09:31.178
Hold... on...

09:49.278 --> 09:50.407
Go to the rooftop.

09:50.693 --> 09:51.573
Roger that.

09:55.653 --> 09:56.705
If we go to the rooftop,

09:58.153 --> 09:59.456
probably no one will get in our way again.

10:13.330 --> 10:15.472
Let's just stay here for a while more.

10:16.743 --> 10:17.808
Are we going back?

10:17.993 --> 10:19.893
You're right.

10:28.616 --> 10:29.908
Well...

10:36.950 --> 10:39.288
The weather grows cold, so...

10:43.298 --> 10:45.211
Can I open it?

10:45.427 --> 10:46.754
Yes...

10:56.607 --> 10:58.850

Senpai, do you visit the shrine
during the new year?

12:14.163 --> 12:16.927
No. I only went there when I was little.

12:17.010 --> 12:21.349
I can tell you're that type.

12:21.692 --> 12:24.394
Lazing around at home
and crouching in bed

12:24.479 --> 12:28.105
during the new year suits you better.

12:28.429 --> 12:29.125
What?

12:29.447 --> 12:32.134
Because you're like a cabbageworm

and keep rolling over

12:34.110 --> 12:36.041

- So, what do you mean by "not good"?
- Gross.

14:42.027 --> 14:45.047
Senpai, the first thing you need to do
after entering the shrine

14:46.107 --> 14:47.351
is to your wash.

14:47.626 --> 14:48.705
Ah. Well...

14:49.176 --> 14:51.832
After that, rinse your mouth.

14:54.669 --> 14:58.297
Is that really okay for you to be here
during your work?

14:58.729 --> 15:00.663
Yes, no problem.

15:00.744 --> 15:02.399
There are not many visitors now.

Besides, showing someone
who's not good like you

15:05.971 --> 15:09.182
about the proper way
is part of my job too.

15:09.466 --> 15:10.268
Hmph!

After cleansing your body,
the next step will be...

15:13.533 --> 15:14.721
(Sacred Lot)
drawing the sacred lot.

15:50.658 --> 15:53.394
It suits you quite well, Senpai.

15:53.586 --> 15:56.355
- You got the Misfortune.
- You're too loud.

15:56.384 --> 15:57.923
(LOVE)

15:59.860 --> 16:01.221
Oh, crap.

16:02.432 --> 16:04.279
The visitors are getting a lot more now.

16:04.945 --> 16:07.325
Well, don't let me keep you...

16:10.628 --> 16:11.245
See you.

16:12.792 --> 16:13.873
Fine.

16:14.594 --> 16:16.918
(Votive Offering)

16:21.048 --> 16:24.509
(Just Waiting Won't Take You in the Desirable)

16:30.106 --> 16:31.807
Two amulets, right?

16:32.501 --> 16:33.768
It's 400 yen.

16:34.135 --> 16:35.644
Thank you.

16:40.875 --> 16:41.989
What's wrong with you?

16:42.797 --> 16:45.529
Sigh, life is not all roses.

16:45.799 --> 16:47.197
Life, huh?

16:47.307 --> 16:49.741
Next customer, please.

16:56.643 --> 16:58.625
Why are you here, Senpai?

16:59.773 --> 17:00.336
Amu...

17:01.826 --> 17:02.462
Amu?

17:05.406 --> 17:07.551
Please give me one amulet.

17:08.548 --> 17:09.929
What am I saying?

17:10.625 --> 17:12.056
I should ask her directly.

17:12.486 --> 17:14.142
When are you off work?

17:14.711 --> 17:16.743
Do you want to go around here after work?

17:17.144 --> 17:18.688
I will wait for you.

17:18.768 --> 17:19.730
That's gross!

17:19.798 --> 17:22.357
No way! There's no way
I can speak such tacky things.

17:22.803 --> 17:24.234
It will be 200 yen.

17:28.006 --> 17:29.198
Thank you.

17:33.655 --> 17:34.369
I...

17:36.208 --> 17:37.539
I will wait for you.

17:47.528 --> 17:49.403
I will wait for you.

17:51.025 --> 17:52.387
Locking eyes with you.

17:52.424 --> 17:53.763
A stalker?

17:58.409 --> 17:59.954
Are you a stalker?

18:03.017 --> 18:04.817
(- Are you a stalker?
- I'm not.)

18:04.923 --> 18:06.829
(Staring)

18:09.314 --> 18:12.009
(Give me 20 minutes)

18:14.019 --> 18:16.496
(Votive Offering)

18:18.664 --> 18:20.025
Senpai!

18:24.138 --> 18:25.192
Oh gosh.

18:25.271 --> 18:28.633
Can you not just bolt
after leaving a word?

18:28.896 --> 18:29.717
I'm sorry.

18:30.096 --> 18:32.511
You're a potential stalker, huh?

18:32.577 --> 18:33.930
I told you I'm sorry about that.

18:35.984 --> 18:37.757
So, what's it?

18:37.836 --> 18:39.977
Are you waiting here for me?

18:41.961 --> 18:42.896
Um...

18:43.590 --> 18:44.231
Do...

18:44.607 --> 18:45.441
Do?

18:46.275 --> 18:49.487
Do you want to go around the shrine?

18:50.612 --> 18:52.073
With me?

18:52.857 --> 18:56.411
Erm... yes.

19:06.536 --> 19:08.673
Speaking of which, this shrine...

19:09.451 --> 19:11.509
(Match-making)
is actually a match-making shrine!

19:13.282 --> 19:16.220
Senpai, what are you going to pray for

19:16.299 --> 19:18.932
in a match-making shrine?

19:19.153 --> 19:22.769
No... it has nothing got to do with that.

19:22.984 --> 19:25.397
Oh, are you sure?

19:26.089 --> 19:27.692
Don't tell me

19:28.050 --> 19:30.443
you're going to pray

19:30.799 --> 19:33.185
for making me your girlfriend,

19:33.266 --> 19:35.199
a wish like that.

19:35.282 --> 19:36.325
What?

19:38.642 --> 19:40.821
Please have mercy on me.

19:40.856 --> 19:42.446
That's not true!

19:42.915 --> 19:45.737
Are you sure?

19:45.817 --> 19:48.211
I doubt that.

19:48.335 --> 19:49.914
Hypothetically...

19:50.159 --> 19:51.279
Hypothetically?

19:51.644 --> 19:53.134
I mean, hypothetically.

19:53.239 --> 19:55.469
Well, what's it then?

19:56.105 --> 20:00.932
If I want you to go... out...

20:01.376 --> 20:03.644
Go... out?

20:04.115 --> 20:06.689
Go out with me...

20:06.796 --> 20:09.432
You want me to go out with you?

20:11.241 --> 20:12.319
Go out with you?

20:12.846 --> 20:13.531
With you?

20:14.084 --> 20:16.740
I shouldn't rely on the deity

20:18.703 --> 20:21.494
but work my best instead.

20:24.900 --> 20:26.959
Though I only get to muster my courage
after reading the lot...

20:27.380 --> 20:30.371
Well, work your best then.

20:30.422 --> 20:34.095
No! It's just a hypothetical example.

20:34.169 --> 20:36.884
All right. Don't be persistent.

21:03.114 --> 21:06.957
So, what wish did you make just now?

21:07.455 --> 21:08.792
I wish my family be in peace.

21:09.122 --> 21:11.002
Wow, that's so common.

21:11.108 --> 21:12.755
Is there a problem with that?

21:14.151 --> 21:16.967
What about you, Nagatoro?

21:17.242 --> 21:18.259
Me?

21:20.353 --> 21:23.015
I wished

21:24.438 --> 21:26.143
that I can be

21:27.548 --> 21:31.315
Senpai's wife. Something like this.

21:33.336 --> 21:35.486
Huh?

21:35.800 --> 21:37.278
What did you just say?

21:38.525 --> 21:40.324
I lied.

21:42.153 --> 21:46.742
Do you really believe that?

21:46.815 --> 21:47.789
Not at all.

21:48.119 --> 21:51.669
Judging by your reaction just now,
I think you've taken it seriously.

21:51.737 --> 21:52.486
Not at all.

21:52.541 --> 21:54.422
Liar.

23:25.954 --> 23:27.337
Today's reflection!

23:27.368 --> 23:30.196
Senpai, no one would pray for
family's health in a match-making shrine.

23:30.277 --> 23:31.164
Well, there will be some.

23:31.198 --> 23:33.135
Instead, you should pray for something
that's likely to work out.

23:33.215 --> 23:33.736
What will that be?

23:33.760 --> 23:35.298
Praying for an unexpected romance.

23:35.323 --> 23:37.757
All I wish is to live a happy life
like last year.

23:37.792 --> 23:39.780
Jeez, quit pretending. That's gross!
