00:17.930 --> 00:20.870
What are you stealing glances for, Senpai?

00:21.100 --> 00:23.830
I-I'm not stealing glances.

00:23.830 --> 00:28.340
Are you getting psyched up at the
thought of going on a date with a girl?

00:28.590 --> 00:30.550
I-I said I'm not!

00:30.550 --> 00:32.940
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:32.940 --> 00:37.550
I'm just helping you <i>practice</i>
going on a date, Senpai.

00:37.810 --> 00:39.120
Practice?

00:41.560 --> 00:43.630
Bland, unimaginative outfit.

00:43.630 --> 00:45.140
Fifty points docked!

00:45.530 --> 00:47.520
I'm getting graded now?!

00:49.320 --> 00:53.280
We have to get you ready for the 
real date that you may one day go on.

00:53.590 --> 00:57.030
So I'm going to grade you strictly!

00:57.670 --> 01:03.790
Though, I don't think you'll
ever go on a real date.

01:03.790 --> 01:05.370
Your slouch is nasty!

01:05.370 --> 01:06.780
One hundred points docked!

01:06.780 --> 01:08.410
You're so lanky and gross!

01:08.410 --> 01:10.020
One hundred points docked!

01:10.020 --> 01:12.340
How am I supposed to even
make up for those points?

01:13.750 --> 01:15.900
Look at Hayacchi's eyes.

01:15.900 --> 01:17.550
She's all set to do it!

01:17.550 --> 01:19.460
Yup, all-in!

01:19.460 --> 01:21.220
Virginity in peril!

01:21.220 --> 01:22.100
Too early!

01:22.100 --> 01:23.580
It's too early!

01:23.580 --> 01:27.730
Paisen's virginity still
needs more time to ferment!

01:27.730 --> 01:29.480
Like, 300 years?!

01:29.480 --> 01:31.980
Even if he awakens today...

01:31.980 --> 01:33.300
Raze them!

01:33.300 --> 01:37.490
He's going to melt into nothing
after he fires his laser just once!

01:37.490 --> 01:38.940
It's rotting!

01:38.940 --> 01:40.490
It's too soon!

01:40.710 --> 01:46.040
And so, we're going to take a ton of embarrassing 
pictures and bring them to their senses.

01:46.040 --> 01:48.480
Fire the Gamosshie lasers!

01:48.480 --> 01:50.750
Cackle, cackle, cackle, cackle!

01:55.950 --> 02:00.000
The demons are the true evil, Sana-neesan.

02:00.000 --> 02:00.740
Yes.

02:00.740 --> 02:02.060
It seems so.

02:02.960 --> 02:05.330
I will protect Senpai's love.

02:06.120 --> 02:08.640
To that end, I will become a monster myself!

02:08.640 --> 02:10.360
Well said.

02:10.360 --> 02:13.830
The time has come to fight for love!

02:13.830 --> 02:14.590
Yes!

02:28.830 --> 02:35.750
<b>DON'T TOY WITH ME,
MISS NAGATORO</b>

02:28.830 --> 02:35.750
<b>DON'T TOY WITH ME,
MISS NAGATORO</b>

03:47.030 --> 03:57.090
<b></b>Wanna Do Something to Make It Not a Dry Run?

04:03.760 --> 04:04.430
Damn it!

04:04.430 --> 04:05.140
Where are they?!

04:05.140 --> 04:06.760
Target lost!

04:23.490 --> 04:25.280
Senpai, Senpai!

04:25.280 --> 04:26.080
What?

04:27.280 --> 04:28.600
Stop it!

04:31.570 --> 04:35.670
<i>I'm glad we got to see the
penguins like she wanted.</i>

04:35.670 --> 04:36.610
Senpai!

04:36.610 --> 04:38.420
Over here!

04:47.590 --> 04:49.330
You're so sus and creepy.

04:49.330 --> 04:51.250
Fifty points docked.

04:55.190 --> 04:56.320
Senpai!

04:56.320 --> 04:57.580
Look, garden eels!

04:57.580 --> 04:59.190
Garden eels!

05:00.060 --> 05:01.500
I get it.

05:02.270 --> 05:06.220
<i>What is this, though?</i>

05:09.280 --> 05:12.450
<i>She says it's a practice date for me...</i>

05:13.450 --> 05:17.210
<i>but I feel more nervous than usual.</i>

05:18.090 --> 05:20.960
<i>And Nagatoro feels closer.</i>

05:39.160 --> 05:40.330
Senpai.

05:40.330 --> 05:43.860
Don't you think there's something
you should be doing right now?

05:47.490 --> 05:49.870
Y-You're hungry? Is that it?

05:51.950 --> 05:55.750
You're steadily losing points right now.

05:55.750 --> 05:58.240
D-Did I make a mistake?

05:58.240 --> 06:00.220
Figure it out yourself.

06:03.520 --> 06:04.550
You're tired?

06:04.550 --> 06:05.920
Ten points docked.

06:05.920 --> 06:06.960
Bored?

06:06.960 --> 06:08.460
Twenty points docked.

06:09.030 --> 06:09.580
Bathroom!

06:09.580 --> 06:11.220
Thirty points docked.

06:12.750 --> 06:14.110
<i>What is it?</i>

06:14.110 --> 06:16.250
<i>I have no idea.</i>

06:26.960 --> 06:31.490
<i>Wh-Why are the friends and Sunomiya-kun
and the President here?!</i>

06:31.790 --> 06:34.880
Senpai, you're being pretty shifty-eyed.

06:34.880 --> 06:37.240
Have you figured out why
you're losing points yet?

06:37.240 --> 06:39.250
Um, well...

06:39.570 --> 06:42.680
What? Are you even trying to think?

06:42.680 --> 06:45.250
Do you <i>want</i> to lose points?

06:45.250 --> 06:46.780
N-No...

06:47.380 --> 06:49.880
I'm not really...

06:52.380 --> 06:54.510
Wh-What?

06:54.750 --> 06:56.300
Th-This way!

07:02.850 --> 07:04.650
What's this, Senpai?

07:04.650 --> 07:07.820
Are you taking me somewhere naughty?

07:08.460 --> 07:10.320
I-I'm not!

07:10.320 --> 07:13.020
You're so aggressive. It's gross.

07:13.020 --> 07:15.200
A hundred points docked!

07:15.200 --> 07:16.950
He noticed us!

07:16.950 --> 07:18.080
Run away!

07:19.520 --> 07:21.330
I won't let you!

07:21.610 --> 07:23.320
Th-The junior!

07:23.320 --> 07:25.670
I won't let you interfere with their date!

07:25.670 --> 07:28.980
H-Have you been following us this whole time?

07:28.980 --> 07:30.090
Scary...

07:30.450 --> 07:33.930
I've come to protect Senpai's love!

07:33.930 --> 07:35.180
What?!

07:35.180 --> 07:37.530
Who do you think you are, mini bunny?!

07:37.530 --> 07:38.680
Brat!

07:39.980 --> 07:41.040
What do we do?

07:41.040 --> 07:42.720
Wanna go?

07:42.720 --> 07:44.300
Wanna?!

07:45.430 --> 07:48.410
I've come to the assist,
in the name of love.

07:48.410 --> 07:50.440
Crap! Bad news!

07:50.740 --> 07:53.040
Damn it! We're falling back!

07:53.040 --> 07:54.540
Tactical retreat!

07:54.540 --> 07:55.360
Don't let them get away.

07:55.360 --> 07:56.010
Catch them!

07:56.010 --> 07:57.200
Understood!

08:00.770 --> 08:02.780
<i>They aren't here, are they?</i>

08:02.780 --> 08:05.790
Senpai, which one should we get?

08:06.070 --> 08:07.480
Um...

08:07.480 --> 08:10.660
I'll have a normal soft serve.

08:11.610 --> 08:13.380
I'll have...

08:13.380 --> 08:14.570
Wasabi soft serve.

08:14.570 --> 08:15.800
Wasabi?!

08:15.800 --> 08:18.080
I like spicy stuff.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.810
You must like a challenge.

08:19.810 --> 08:21.040
I do.

08:21.040 --> 08:24.110
Challenge everything, Senpai.

08:33.910 --> 08:36.010
Spicy!

08:42.400 --> 08:43.530
Senpai.

08:45.620 --> 08:47.460
Want a bite?

08:48.940 --> 08:49.820
Come on.

08:49.820 --> 08:50.720
Have some.

08:50.720 --> 08:52.780
I'll pass!

08:52.780 --> 08:54.000
What's wrong?

08:54.000 --> 08:55.600
You're acting so flustered.

08:55.600 --> 08:57.340
Is it because...

08:57.640 --> 09:02.220
you're afraid of an indirect kiss?

09:02.220 --> 09:03.600
N-No...

09:03.600 --> 09:07.730
Sheesh, you're in full virgin mode.

09:07.730 --> 09:09.410
I'm not!

09:09.410 --> 09:12.070
I-I just don't like spicy food.

09:12.500 --> 09:13.880
Hm...

09:14.700 --> 09:19.700
Maybe I'll just lick yours, then.

09:21.390 --> 09:22.200
No, no, no!

09:22.200 --> 09:25.040
I already had some of it!

09:34.830 --> 09:36.490
Well, Senpai?

09:36.490 --> 09:38.800
How does the indirect kiss taste?

09:38.800 --> 09:41.560
Wh-What do you even want me to say?

09:41.560 --> 09:43.470
Are you all right?

09:43.470 --> 09:46.560
You got my wasabi on yours.

09:46.760 --> 09:50.350
I-It's not so much that I can't eat it.

09:51.900 --> 09:55.940
<b>DON'T TOY WITH ME,
MISS NAGATORO</b>

09:55.940 --> 10:00.940
<b>DON'T TOY WITH ME,
MISS NAGATORO</b>

10:07.680 --> 10:09.710
Look at those huge jumps!

10:11.880 --> 10:13.710
<i>Looks like we managed to lose them.</i>

10:24.400 --> 10:29.330
<i>It seems like there's a lot of
 couples here enjoying themselves.</i>

10:31.450 --> 10:39.940
<i>Nagatoro's not any less c-cute
than anyone else, I think.</i>

10:39.940 --> 10:40.820
<i>But...</i>

10:43.660 --> 10:47.960
<i>I feel like I don't belong here with her.</i>

10:50.930 --> 10:52.830
What's wrong, Senpai?

10:52.830 --> 10:56.060
Are you broken because
you lost so many points?

10:56.060 --> 10:57.840
N-Nothing like that!

10:58.130 --> 11:04.790
Well, it's true that your point total
 is well into the negatives.

11:07.070 --> 11:08.230
But...

11:32.230 --> 11:34.960
<i>W-Was that uncalled for?</i>

11:40.720 --> 11:45.830
Senpai, don't you think you're
acting a little too cool?

11:56.440 --> 11:59.440
Top Prize

11:56.440 --> 11:59.440
Second Prize

12:10.400 --> 12:13.960
<i>That went by pretty fast.</i>

12:16.950 --> 12:17.980
Now, then!

12:18.990 --> 12:22.340
Time to announce your final point total!

12:23.680 --> 12:25.330
Are we actually doing this?

12:25.330 --> 12:26.850
We are!

12:27.300 --> 12:29.340
Minus fifty points for fashion.

12:29.340 --> 12:31.120
Minus one hundred points for slouching.

12:31.120 --> 12:33.440
Minus one hundred points for being lanky.

12:34.810 --> 12:39.690
And two hundred more
points lost along the way!

12:39.690 --> 12:40.820
That much?!

12:41.760 --> 12:44.610
I guess there's no redeeming myself.

12:45.740 --> 12:50.450
Th-Though, you tried your best
before the ice cream, so...

12:51.120 --> 12:52.830
Plus two hundred points!

12:54.780 --> 12:56.620
<i>Before the ice cream?</i>

12:57.130 --> 12:58.840
<i>Did I do something?</i>

13:06.640 --> 13:08.000
Also...

13:08.000 --> 13:11.570
It was hilarious when you got drenched.

13:11.570 --> 13:13.680
Plus three hundred points!

13:17.540 --> 13:20.770
Now, your total score is...

13:20.770 --> 13:24.530
Brrrrrr...

13:24.840 --> 13:25.660
Tsss!

13:26.000 --> 13:27.690
Fifty points!

13:28.530 --> 13:31.790
<b>50 Points</b>

13:29.580 --> 13:31.790
I'm not sure what to think of that score.

13:31.790 --> 13:34.710
Oh, it's out of a thousand.

13:34.710 --> 13:36.040
So low!

13:38.040 --> 13:42.380
Well, don't give up.
You're gonna have to keep improving.

13:47.550 --> 13:49.550
We've finally found them.

13:50.040 --> 13:51.990
They've got a good mood going.

13:51.990 --> 13:56.980
But we shall resort to force
to protect Paisen's virginity!

13:56.980 --> 13:58.560
Let's go, Yoshi!

13:59.980 --> 14:08.070
And I guess, if I have time,
I wouldn't mind helping you practice.

14:08.780 --> 14:12.220
Wh-What about you, then?

14:12.680 --> 14:13.960
What about me?

14:14.700 --> 14:17.380
Was that, like...

14:19.290 --> 14:22.380
G-Good practice for you?

14:31.400 --> 14:32.670
For me...

14:35.840 --> 14:37.870
That was the real thing.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.160
Me, too!

14:58.320 --> 15:01.600
I didn't intend for it
to be a dry run, either.

15:04.700 --> 15:07.940
What's that supposed to mean?!

15:07.940 --> 15:11.760
Were you planning on a <i>wet</i> run?!

15:11.760 --> 15:14.640
D-Don't make it sound so weird!

15:14.640 --> 15:16.530
Okay...

15:17.480 --> 15:21.340
Wanna do something that'll
make it not a dry run?

15:27.900 --> 15:30.110
All right, apprehend them!

15:30.110 --> 15:32.030
Don't mess this up, Yoshi!

15:36.400 --> 15:38.040
Yoshi.

15:39.570 --> 15:41.040
Let's not.

15:41.930 --> 15:43.440
Any more...

15:44.340 --> 15:45.930
and we'll be cock blockers!

15:47.430 --> 15:49.280
Yoshi...

15:54.190 --> 15:55.850
Yeah, you're right.

15:57.680 --> 16:00.780
It'll be more fun watching them from afar.

16:00.780 --> 16:03.300
They won't have the guts
to do it here, anyway.

16:03.300 --> 16:04.560
Limpy!

16:05.760 --> 16:08.500
I never thought you would
be the one to stop me.

16:12.560 --> 16:14.370
We've finally found you!

16:16.320 --> 16:20.320
Wh-What do you mean, make it not a dry run?

16:22.720 --> 16:25.170
Okay, quiz time!

16:26.750 --> 16:28.960
A. We hug.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.620
B. We kiss.

16:33.690 --> 16:36.180
Now, which is it?!

16:36.180 --> 16:38.000
Well? Well?

16:38.000 --> 16:38.930
Well?

16:39.280 --> 16:44.390
Y-You wouldn't go straight
to a k-kiss, would you?

16:44.390 --> 16:46.400
Which means...

16:46.400 --> 16:48.270
A hug?!

16:49.860 --> 16:51.970
Oh, fine.

16:51.970 --> 16:53.650
Okay, here you go.

16:53.650 --> 16:55.860
I-I don't know...

16:55.860 --> 17:01.160
Should we be doing that kind of thing here?

17:01.160 --> 17:02.620
What's wrong?

17:02.620 --> 17:04.790
I thought this wasn't a dry run.

17:04.790 --> 17:07.790
Was it just practice after all?

17:08.500 --> 17:14.200
I-I-If you're all right with it,
 I-I wouldn't mind.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.350
Seriously, you guys!

17:26.350 --> 17:28.850
I said we aren't going to do anything!

17:28.850 --> 17:29.810
Go away!

17:30.240 --> 17:31.870
I don't believe you!

17:31.870 --> 17:34.280
We will lay our doubts to rest here and now!

17:43.550 --> 17:44.970
Please continue.

17:44.970 --> 17:46.790
As you were.

17:53.170 --> 17:55.660
We were just in the middle of practice!

18:01.010 --> 18:02.250
I'm sorry.

18:09.350 --> 18:11.860
<b>Shop</b>

18:09.350 --> 18:11.860
Sandwiches

18:09.350 --> 18:11.860
Cheese naans

18:09.350 --> 18:11.860
Hamburgers

18:13.060 --> 18:15.640
You love that stuff, Toro-chan.

18:15.640 --> 18:18.340
I've been hooked lately.

18:18.340 --> 18:21.120
I think I'll try it out next time.

18:29.660 --> 18:32.290
Can't you forgive them already?

18:32.290 --> 18:35.060
They didn't mean any harm.

18:36.960 --> 18:42.170
They just miss you because you haven't been 
hanging out with them lately, Toro-chan.

18:42.170 --> 18:42.920
Right?

18:47.840 --> 18:50.650
It's been a while since
I ate in the club room.

18:51.720 --> 18:52.600
Wanna come?

18:55.050 --> 18:56.900
Let's go!

18:57.990 --> 19:00.120
Creepy! Creepy!

19:04.640 --> 19:07.680
No! I'll eat it by myself!

19:07.680 --> 19:09.790
Wait! Stop!

19:09.790 --> 19:10.920
Creep?

19:14.290 --> 19:17.300
Creepy, creepy!

19:17.550 --> 19:20.050
I-I was just...

19:20.050 --> 19:24.180
I like what you're doing there, mini bunny!

19:27.940 --> 19:29.900
So passionate.

19:29.900 --> 19:31.810
Did she make it for you?

19:31.810 --> 19:32.940
No!

19:33.730 --> 19:35.440
It's an apology.

19:35.440 --> 19:37.190
It's the least I could do.

19:37.610 --> 19:40.190
I put my whole soul into it.

19:40.190 --> 19:41.350
Oh?

19:41.350 --> 19:43.450
Your whole soul, huh?

19:43.750 --> 19:47.450
Y-You don't need to apologize.

19:47.930 --> 19:52.640
Good for you, being fed good food.

19:54.420 --> 19:59.410
S-Sunomiya-kun, that was
delicious, but I'm all full—

19:59.410 --> 20:00.060
Full—

19:59.410 --> 20:01.160
You're still growing.

20:01.160 --> 20:02.720
You need to eat.

20:02.720 --> 20:05.160
Paisen's been trained with food.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.560
She's going to fatten him up.

20:06.560 --> 20:07.720
Foie gras.

20:12.250 --> 20:14.190
I ate too much.

20:14.620 --> 20:17.940
Would you like French or Chinese tomorrow?

20:19.640 --> 20:22.460
My apologies continue for a week.

20:25.790 --> 20:29.330
Sunomiya-chan, he won't need any tomorrow.

20:29.330 --> 20:31.580
I'll be making his lunch.

20:33.750 --> 20:39.090
I mean, if Senpai absolutely insists, that is.

20:39.440 --> 20:40.980
Well, Senpai?

20:40.980 --> 20:43.150
Want some?

20:43.150 --> 20:47.850
Want some of my lunch?

20:50.850 --> 20:52.710
W-Well...

20:53.340 --> 20:56.040
Don't you have morning practice, Nagatoro?

20:57.170 --> 21:00.450
I don't want to be a nuisance.

21:12.600 --> 21:16.620
Whatever. You're right.

21:16.850 --> 21:18.720
Hey, Paisen.

21:18.720 --> 21:20.430
Stop trying to be courteous and—

21:20.430 --> 21:22.090
So tomorrow,

21:23.200 --> 21:26.340
I'll make lunch for you instead, Nagatoro.

21:28.340 --> 21:32.650
How about you make some for me the day after?

21:34.010 --> 21:38.860
I thought it might save you some
trouble if it's every other day.

21:41.980 --> 21:45.570
Okay, fine, then.

21:48.000 --> 21:52.520
Are you really, really
desperate for my lunch?

21:59.790 --> 22:01.020
I am.

22:12.780 --> 22:16.520
Okay, I'll make lunch tomorrow.

22:19.030 --> 22:21.200
Wanna finish what we started?

22:22.310 --> 22:23.340
What we started?

22:24.480 --> 22:26.360
The rest of the real date.

22:27.090 --> 22:28.530
Wanna?

23:10.090 --> 23:13.550
You're so creepily warm.
