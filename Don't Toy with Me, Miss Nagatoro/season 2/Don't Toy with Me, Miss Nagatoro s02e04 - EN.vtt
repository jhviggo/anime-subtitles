00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.080
You there, hold still.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.970
I'm gonna report you real quick.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.800
N-No! Err...

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.400
S-S-Sorry!

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.460
I j-just thought she
 might have passed out!

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.890
Sure, sure.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.610
You can tell the police all about it.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.370
I-I-I'm from school!

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.240
I b-brought her homework!

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.610
And a gift!

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.250
You...

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.580
Are you Senpai-kun?

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.340
Yes. Probably.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.180
I see, I see.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.470
So you're the one.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.380
You came to check up on my kid sister, huh?

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.530
Thanks.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.780
Kid sister...

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.010
Anetoro?!

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.520
Why don't you come inside,

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.260
Senpai-kun?

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.740

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.840
Sorry, she's still asleep.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.290
I-It's fine.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.870
Have some tea and stick around for a while.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.300
Th-Thank you.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.500
I've heard all kinds of things about you.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.050
I-I see.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.050
That you're doing naughty things.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.430
N-N-No way! I'm n-n-not!

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.690
I'm kidding.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.690
I heard you're a really amusing, Senpai.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.440
R-Really...

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.070
Are you curious?

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.960
N-No.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.210
Not really.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.560
I was actually going to tell 
you all kinds of stuff.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.350
All about her this and 
that and everything else.

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.180
Don't you want to find out?

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.760
<i>I've never had much interest in people.</i>

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.840
<i>I'd always be content 
so long as I could draw.</i>

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.400
Well? Tell me.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.650
Aren't you interested?

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.130
I-I guess.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.160
I guess...

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.770
You guess?

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.410
I-I'm interested.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.620
Onee-chan, did you buy me pudding?

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.270
Jeez!

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.850
Why are you even here?!

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.220
Couldn't you have said something first?!

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.390
By phone or by text?!

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.820
No, you didn't reply to my message, so...

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.580
I was sleeping!

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.240
S-Sorry.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.260
Hey, now.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.660
Senpai-kun's here to see if you're all right.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.870
You shouldn't talk to him like that.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.580
Stay out of this, Onee-chan.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.500
Where's the dryer?

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.880
On the shelf upstairs.

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:03.460
Click

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.460
Vweeee

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.460
Fzzz

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.110
Sorry she's so noisy, Senpai-kun.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.720
I-It's okay.

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.180
<i>I feel like I really shouldn't be here.</i>

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.080
How's her cold?

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.680
Oh, her fever's been gone since yesterday.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.940
She's fine now.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.440
I told her to stay home 
one more day just in case.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.130
Hi, Senpai.

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.570
H-Hey.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:36.580
I have some good news for 
my cranky little sister.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.180
Shut up, Onee-chan!

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.330
Calm down.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.840
This chemistry set of a pudding that
 I bought at the convenience store earlier...

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.120
has evolved into this firmer, 
more authentic pudding.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.590
The Lawman pudding!

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.550
Senpai-kun brought it as a gift.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.100
Now, cheer up, already.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.350
Oh, you're so stubborn.

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.830
Fine.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.200
Well, then...

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.940
We can take this authentic pudding...

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.780
Top it with some fruit...

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.950
Decorate it with whipped 
cream and ice cream...

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:18.870
And we have Onee-chan's 
special pudding Ã  la mode!

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.150
Go on.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.460
W-Well, I shouldn't waste food, 
so I guess I'll eat it.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.680
<i>She's completely playing Nagatoro.</i>

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.470
<i>Beware Anetoro.</i>

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.670
Here you are, Senpai-kun.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:34.160
Oh, thank you.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.970
Come on. Have a seat.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:42.480
Why don't we take this opportunity 
to talk about everything?

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.540
Over some pudding.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:46.860
Right?

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:52.610
<i>Anetoro's got the same aura as Nagatoro.</i>

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.870
We're eating in my room, Senpai.

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:57.620
O-Okay.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:00.620
Don't come with us, Onee-chan.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.540
You're so mean.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.330
You're making your sister lonely.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.630
You're just going to talk about 
stuff no one needs to hear.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.630
Oh, fine.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:14.220
Come on, let's go, Senpai.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:23.140
<i>I haven't been in Nagatoro's room for a while.</i>

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.200
<i>But...</i>

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.720
Um, I'm sorry.

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:35.780
I mean, I came unannounced.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.480
I-It's not your fault, Senpai.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.040
It just surprised me.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.290
O-Okay.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.270
Senpai...

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.220
Um...

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:51.630
Thanks.

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:52.800
For checking up on me.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.540
N-Nah, I needed to give 
you your homework anyway.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.570
This pudding is so good.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.460
Yeah, it is.

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.570
The fruit goes well with it, too.

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:25.790
Hey, hey, Senpai...

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:27.600
Here.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.070
Say, "Ahh."

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:32.260
Wh-Why now?!

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.420
To thank you for coming over.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.830
You don't need to be modest.

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:39.680
You like this, don't you, Senpai?

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:41.550
You're a closet pervert, after all.

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:44.810
W-Wait, what does that have 
to do with anything?

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.200
Just eat it!

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.940
<i>Here we go again with Nagatoro's usual thing.</i>

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:54.220
Come on, Senpai!

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.210
<i>Oh, well.</i>

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:57.820
<i>No one's watching.</i>

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.700
I brought juice!

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.480
Oopsie.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.460
Am I interrupting?

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:10.400
<i>She saw us!</i>

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.750
Stay out, Onee-chan!

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:13.910
Don't say that.

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:15.710
You must be thirsty.

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:18.470
Especially when it's just the two of you.

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:20.360
Get out!

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.850
Fine, fine.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.040
Well, Senpai-kun, enjoy your stay.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.600
N-Nah, I don't intend to stay that long.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.610
Oh, right, Senpai-kun...

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.360
We'll continue our talk another time, okay?

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:43.240
Since you seem to be all kinds 
of interested in my sister.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.240
Right?

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:50.860
"All kinds of interested"?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.010
<b>DON'T TOY WITH ME,
MISS NAGATORO</b>

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:04.010
<b>DON'T TOY WITH ME,
MISS NAGATORO</b>

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:15.820
<i>I never intended to pry into
 Nagatoro's personal life.</i>

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.070
<i>Damn it, Anetoro...</i>

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:25.800
<i>Now it's awkward.</i>

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:28.950
Thanks for the pudding.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.080
I shouldn't intrude for too long.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:33.880
I should probably...

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.460
Since you're here...

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.540
Since I'm here...

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.470
Wanna play a match?

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:53.480
S-Sure, a quick game.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.230
I'm not the same player I was back then.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.490
All right. I'm not holding back, then.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:04.790
That's the spirit.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:06.740
Come at me!

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:09.240
A-All right!

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:11.290
<i>Round 1.</i>

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:12.320
<i>Fight!</i>

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.630
<i>She's definitely gotten better.</i>

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:25.510
<i>She must have practiced a lot.</i>

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:26.570
<i>But...</i>

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.270
<i>She still lets her guard down.</i>

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:33.770
<i>Got a combo!</i>

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.280
<i>Now I just gotta get to an ultimate...</i>

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:41.030
Senpai, what were you and 
my sister talking about?

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.290
N-N-Nothing, really.

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:47.530
Are you sure?

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:50.040
<b>Whack whack whack whack</b>

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:50.040
Weren't you trying...

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.550
to learn my secrets...

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.040
<b>Whack whack whack whack</b>

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:53.160
<b>Pow</b>

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.090
while I...

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:53.410
<b>Pow</b>

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:53.660

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:59.260
was sleeping?!

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:00.990
N-No way!

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:07.470
I-I wasn't...

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:12.680
I don't pry without someone's permission...

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.300
One more match!

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:18.190
One more!

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.700
Huh? Sure.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:26.700
Time to show my wimpy senpai what I can do.

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:32.510
<i>She's actually really good 
once she's on the offensive.</i>

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.110
<i>I've never been good against 
this character to begin with.</i>

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.410
<i>KO!</i>

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:44.840
<i>Wimp! Wimp! Wimp!</i>

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:48.140
Senpai's a wimp! Wimp! Wimp!

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:49.850
What did you expect?

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:52.150
I haven't been playing lately.

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:57.220
Oh, I know!

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.280
If you can beat me...

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:07.610
I'll tell you one of my secrets. 
Anything you want to know.

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:11.580
Well?

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:16.000
You want to learn about 
my secrets, don't you?

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.240
N-Not really.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.500
You don't really have 
any big secrets, do you?

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:26.910
B-But I guess, if you insist...

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:29.840
I wouldn't mind playing along.

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:33.160
You're so shy.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.150
Here we go, then.

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:36.520
Ready...

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:37.660
Fight!

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:42.610
Senpai...

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:46.880
If you do beat me...

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:49.800
What do you want to know?

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:53.440
Which one of my secrets?

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:58.120
Th-There isn't really anything I want to know.

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.170
Oh, then maybe...

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:05.170
my cup size?

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:07.570
N-No!

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:09.170
Are you sure?

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:12.510
My hip size, then?

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:13.140
No!

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.500
What, then?

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.930
Something even more pervy?

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.000
What? What?

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.970
What do you want to know?

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:23.690
Well?

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:27.560
Your first name... I guess.

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:35.740
<i>Sh-Shoot!</i>

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:36.830
<i>Bad idea.</i>

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.830
<i>I didn't mean to ask that.</i>

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:49.340
Come to think of it, I guess 
I haven't told you my first name.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.090
Y-You haven't.

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:54.840
I wouldn't mind. That's not a big deal.

00:15:58.170 --> 00:15:59.840
Though, Senpai...

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:05.360
You want to know my name, huh?

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.520
I mean, well...

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.610
It would be easier to address you
 if I knew your first name.

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:16.600
That was bothering you, Senpai?

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:20.520
Does it matter what you call me?

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.710
M-Maybe not, but...

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:28.710
<i>Time up!</i>

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:30.260
<i>All talk.</i>

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:35.390
<i>I-I won.</i>

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.100
Aw, shucks. I lost.

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:42.520
Well, fine, then.

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:47.110
It was my fault for losing.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:52.860
My...

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:57.870
name is...

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.870
No, never mind!

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:10.130
Oh, no, it's not that I don't want to know.

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:21.620
Having you tell me your name because of a
 bet on a game doesn't quite feel right.

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:29.770
You're such a pain.

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:31.440
Y-Yeah.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.780
That might be true.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:38.280
But if I want to know name,

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:42.950
I'll come out and ask you properly.

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:47.560
You're such a pain!

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.960
You creepy creep.

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:54.220
But, yeah, okay.

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:55.270
Someday.

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:56.920
Y-Yeah.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.100
Hayase-chan!

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.350
I brought your album!

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.980
Kazehaya Elementary School

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:10.730
Let's go through it with 
Senpai-kun, Hayase-chan!

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.390
What's the matter?

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.860
Onee-chan, get out!

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.730
Oh, come on, don't be like that.

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:22.900
This is her on her first day
 of elementary school.

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:24.740
You must be interested, Senpai-kun.

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.240
No, er...

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.820
All right, then!

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.810
Let's get to the really good ones.

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:31.790
This is when she wet the bed, and...

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:33.420
Stop it!

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.150
Thanks for coming today.

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:44.760
I'll be at school tomorrow.

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:47.520
Y-Yeah.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.480
Bye.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.660
Senpai.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.840
I'm going to start toying with 
you again starting tomorrow.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.030
You'd better be ready.

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:04.910
Have some mercy.

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:22.890
<i>Hayase.</i>

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:02.990
<b>Art Room</b>

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:07.990
Senpai!

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.260
N-Nagatoro?

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:11.870
Are you feeling better?

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:13.630
All better.

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:15.810
Feeling perfectly well.

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:17.070
Okay.

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:20.130
You should go home early today, though.

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:22.250
You're so boring.

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:24.420
I thought you might have been feeling horny

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.390
since you haven't gotten to draw 
a high school girl in a while.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.880
S-Say what?!

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.280
Oh, please.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.140
You can be honest.

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.960
I'll model for you.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.650
To thank you for checking up on me.

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:43.650
What about this pose, Senpai?

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.610
I-I don't know...

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.410
Your face is beet red!

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:53.660
Was that too much stimulation for you?

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:56.000
N-Not really.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.260
Especially since you're a virgin.

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:00.080
Wh-Wh-Wh-Why does that matter?!

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:03.180
"Wh-Wh-Wh-Why does that matter?!"

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:08.620
Well, how about this pose, then?

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:12.810
Wh-What's kind of pose is that?

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.060
It's, like, a Bruce Lee kick.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.060
I-I see.

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:21.720
Okay, let's go with that.

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:40.040
Wh-What's wrong?

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:44.260
M-My thighs are going to burst.

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:47.670
We should really take a break.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:48.880
No...

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.300
I've got pins and needles.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:51.820
I can't move.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:53.930
Careful!

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.860
S-Senpai, did you break my fall?

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:10.700
I-It's nothing like that!

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:16.720
Were you trying to get lucky, then?

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.940
You closet perv!

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:22.020
A-Achoo!

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.760
Points of improvement for today!

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:28.420
Anetoro?!

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.820
You call me Anetoro, huh?

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:31.880
N-No, well...

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.320
Want me to tell you my name, too?

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:34.970
Um...

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:36.430
Onee-chan! What are you doing?!

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:37.270
Nothing.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.020
Well, see you around, Senpai-kun.
