00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.170
That was pretty impressive.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.740
Senpai, say, "Ahh."

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.750
Eh, I'll pass.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.910
Come on. Just do it.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.310
Give me a second.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.990
Okay, say, "Ahh."

I'm just not feeling it lately.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.840
Th-This is...

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.110
I knew it.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.230
You've been slacking off lately.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.850
I'm sorry.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.200
I'm not angry.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.990
We've just finished the huge event 
that is the cultural festival.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.590
You must be feeling burnt out.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.110
Right.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.730
Do you remember what I said was the 
most important aspect of making art?

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:00.990
Um...

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.080
Love.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.620

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.540

A ticket for the zoo?

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.280
Do life drawings as you take 
in your natural surroundings.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.020
That might be a good idea.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.510
When I'm exhausted from drawing 
college entrance pieces,

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.010
I free myself in Mother Nature 
and refresh both mind and body.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.950
The outdoors are great.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.890
<i>I probably shouldn't make any comments.</i>

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.560
Th-Thank you.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.250
I'll check out the zoo.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.150
Huh? But there are two here.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.930
Why don't you invite the cat-eared girl?

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.610
She's here all the time
 despite not being part of the club.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.660
You may as well make her draw a little.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.260
Creepy, creepy, creepy-py.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.170
Got it? Invite the cat-eared girl.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.630
Make her come with you!

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:58.420
Yes, ma'am!

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.680

If there's somewhere you 
want to go with someone,

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.880
you could always try asking them.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:20.880
Do you...

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.400
like animals?

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.140
Yeah!

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.590
I love animals!

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.420
I-I see.

What? What's up?

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.090
What about animals?

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.980
Aside...?

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.990
Do you like drawing at all?

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.650
Drawing?

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.990
Not really.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.920
Oh.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:54.510
Wait, wait!

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.000
I'm doing fine arts for my elective, 
though, so I do draw for class.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.840
I shall teach you.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:09.260
Wanna go to the zoo to do some sketching?

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.260
<i>That's so condescending.</i>

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.640
<i>And imposing!</i>

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.520
Oh, actually, though, 
I'm not that good at drawing.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.800
You should teach me sometime, Senpai.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:33.160
So I'm going to the z-zoo.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.540
That came out of nowhere.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:37.660
Sorry.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:38.950
Sorry!

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.540
Please continue.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.820
I have two tickets.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.670

w-wanna go together this Sunday?

You're inviting me, Senpai?

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.440
You're so creepy!

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.590

I'm here.

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:50.560

since elementary school.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.620

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.890
I'm kinda excited.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.120
Oh, yeah.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.620
I need to give you this first.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:07:59.760
Here.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.210
A sketchbook.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.160
What's this for?

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.340
What do you mean, what's it for?

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.840
Why else would I have made you come?

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.660

Senpai!

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:56.880

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.600
Holy crap!

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.850
It's standing upright!

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.370
Sorry.

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:18.690
I never told you we would be life drawing.

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:20.300
It's fine.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.870
I know you can be like that.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.470
<i>I guess most people wouldn't really 
get that excited about life drawing.</i>

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:32.960
Sorry.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:37.260
We can just walk around instead if you want.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.240
Eh, it's okay.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.760
I wouldn't mind putting 
up with you for a day.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.720
It's a rare opportunity, after all.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.180
Let's draw!

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.100
Oh.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.520
Good.

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.530
But now that I am...

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:57.820
You'd better teach me step by step, 
hand in hand, Senpai.

00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:59.570
R-Right.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.900
Senpai...

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:09.500
Kojiro-kun won't stay still. I can't draw him.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.310
It's just a sketch.

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:15.540
You don't have to make it too accurate.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.010
Just make a vague outline of the shapes.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:24.010
Make observations and draw in 
the bare minimum of details.

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.520
It's Kojiro-kun!

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.930
G-Give it a try, like that.

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.030
Hand in hand.

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:44.940
You promised you'd teach me 
each step hand in hand.

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:46.910
Huh? Yeah.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:52.620
Well, take my hand and 
teach me how it's done.

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:56.260

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.090

W-Wait!

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.310
I didn't mean that!

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:07.010
What's wrong?

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:09.560
Were you lying?

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.860
Was that a big, fat lie?

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.190
It wasn't!

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:15.210
Meh.

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:18.440
I didn't expect a virgin sea louse like you...

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:26.330
to take a girl's hand to teach her anything.

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:30.260
I-I can do that much!

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:32.030
Okay.

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:36.590
Please and thank you, Senpai.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.940
<i>I-It's not a big deal.
 I'm just taking her hand.</i>

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.080
S-Something like this.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.040
Oh?

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.800
M-Make broad outlines.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.810
Uh-huh.

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:03.740
S-Sketch it out.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.910
Senpai, your voice is cracking.

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:10.120
Th-Th-That's not really...

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.370
That aside...

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:15.380
That aside...?

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:20.380
C-Compare the figure to your 
drawing and add details.

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:24.880
Senpai, you're so floppy all of a sudden.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.980
Wh-What do you expect?!

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.250
I'm drawing using someone else's hand!

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:31.110
I know you are.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:33.500
Huh?

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.560
That's it?

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.900
I-I've done the broad strokes.

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:39.800
Do the rest yourself.

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:44.840
Thankies, Senpai!

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.270
Now that we compare...

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.270
I'm pretty bad at this.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:21.530
No, that's not true.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.280
You're getting better and better.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.400
Really? Am I?

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.740
Y-Yeah.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.990
But yours are kinda...

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:35.500
Lively? I think?

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:38.960
A-Are they?

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.030
So!

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:42.000
What exactly is the trick?

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.460
The trick?

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:53.180
Do you remember what I said was the 
most important aspect of making art?

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:54.570
Um...

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:56.410
Love.

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:04.860
So, like, an interest in what 
you're drawing, or something.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.320
Having positive emotions is important.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.910
I think.

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:15.970
I'm going to the washroom.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.590
O-Okay.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.640
Man, zoos are so... y'know?

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:36.500
Stinky?

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:37.520
Exactly.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.060
The animal stench, right?

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:40.950
Also, shit.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.660
Gross, right?

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:46.950
Holy crap, seriously.

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:48.780
H-Hey!

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:52.000
You're Hayacchi's senpai, aren't you?

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.160
Huh? Er, yeah.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.390
Remember me?

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:56.260
It's me.

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:57.800
We met at the park.

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:04.010
<i>I feel like we met somewhere, 
but I don't remember.</i>

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:06.650
<i>I'm not good at remembering people's faces.</i>

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:08.490
Who's he?

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:09.280
Do you know him?

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.010
No.

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:11.940
Someone who knows someone I know.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:14.050
<i>Get lost already!</i>

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:15.560
What's this?

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.810
Are you drawing?

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:20.040
Really?

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.920
Drawing at the zoo?

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.520
Club work, maybe?

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:31.000
<i>This calls for an emptying of the mind 
and patience until the storm passes.</i>

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.490
Wait, this is pretty good, isn't it?

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:35.680
Huh?

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.970
Although this one's pretty bad.

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:42.600
Really?

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.670
Really.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:46.650
Holy crap, that's hilarious.

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:47.530
Right?

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.420
That's way too crappy.

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.430
Must be a grade school kid's homework.

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:07.200
D-Don't laugh at art that 
s-someone worked hard on!

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:21.610
Yo, what'd you say just now?

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:22.900
Tell me.

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.930
Tell me what you just said.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:29.460
I'm back, Senpai.

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:43.230
'Sup?

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:46.290
Oh, you're here.

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:47.860
'Sup?

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:52.520
I drew that, you know.

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:53.490
Really?

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:55.690
Oh, you did?

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:56.580
Wow.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:59.740
I mean, this isn't all that bad, right?

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:01.040
Right?

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.750
It's kinda got mascot-y vibes, right?

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:08.180
Nah, that was supposed to 
be a pretty serious drawing.

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:09.470
Really?

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:11.000
That's hilarious.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.840
Anyway, that aside...

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.770
That aside?

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:22.890
Did you need something from my senpai?

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:27.920
Nah, nah!

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.420
We were, like, "Dude, he's good!" Right?

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:32.280
Yeah, legit good.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:38.520
I mean, yours is good, too, Hayacchi, 
but Senpai's is, like, next level, right?

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:39.940
Yup, yup.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:41.200
He's so pro, right?

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.650
We were just looking at it like, damn!

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:47.840
I know, right?

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:50.520
No, seriously.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.790
It's awesome.

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:53.280
Seriously.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.050
Anyway, we'd better get going.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.320
Later.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:58.780
Bye-bye!

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.810
Th-Thanks.

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:05.600
No worries.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.940
You're such a wimpy wimp.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.890
Wimpy wimp!

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.100
Wimpy wimp!

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:13.190
Wimpy wimp!

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:14.880
Though...

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:18.700
I have to do better.

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:31.760
D-Don't laugh at art that 
s-someone worked hard on!

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:48.360
Nah, I mean, I think that's 
a good look for you.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.950
It's a good look.

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.540
Sure.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:54.640
Fine.

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.750
Yup, yup.

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:04.960
Well it's getting pretty late.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.230
Why don't we draw one more and call it a day?

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:08.750
Okay.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:13.750
<b>Zoo Map</b>

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:10.620
What should we draw?

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.750
Let's see...

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.510
Your favorite animal, then.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:20.080
Animal...

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:25.870
What do you like?

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:27.520
That one.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.400
You like sloths, huh?

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.870
Nah, actually, anything's fine.

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:38.280
Uh-huh...

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.260
Come on, Senpai!

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.220
Don't just stand there! Start drawing!

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:45.530
Okay, okay!

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:55.040
<i>Why is she drawing from so far away?</i>

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.820
What are you doing, looking away?!

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.290
Keep your eye on it and draw!

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:21.820
R-Right.

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:28.120
Okay.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.700
<i>It looks pretty good.</i>

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:32.730
I'm done.

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:33.680
What about you?

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.210
Done.

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:38.940
By the way, can you guess what I drew?

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.210
The sloth, right?

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:44.080
That's right, a sloth.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:47.220
But a specific kind of 
sloth that lives in Japan.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.220
The five-fingered sloth!

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:55.110
It's so lazy and wimpy that 
it's about to go extinct.

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:59.270
And it's got such a weak presence, 
it's extremely rare to spot it.

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.530
<i>There she goes again, 
drawing me just to toy with me!</i>

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.490
<i>It's not good, but it's 
drawn really carefully.</i>

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:13.500
<i>And...</i>

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.350
<i>It's...</i>

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:20.090
Do you remember what I said was the 
most important aspect of making art?

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.880
Love.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.370
<i>No, no, no!</i>

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:28.890
<i>What am I thinking?</i>

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:34.890
Why are you gazing at it for so long?

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:36.370
You creep!

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:38.710
Are you violating my drawing with your eyes?

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:39.400
N-No!

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.700
Look at you, 
violating my drawing of yourself.

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:44.400
You're such a pervert.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.900
No!

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:50.750
Jeez, Senpai, you're such a creepy creep!

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:27.150
Points of improvement for today.

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:29.350
I think you're the one who 
can stand to improve today.

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:31.780
What?! What did I do?

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:33.720
I think you had a misunderstanding.

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.180
Misunderstanding between what and what?

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:38.310
Well? Well, Senpai?

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:39.930
I-I'm sorry!
