A-A day in Nagatoro's life, I guess.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.950
Man, this is such a...

Hey, it was a pretty good effort,
coming from you.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.290

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.190

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.250
Don't worry, though.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.000
Hayacchi strips down for the team, too.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.840
No, again, I don't need that.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.620
Indeed.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.420
we have to take advantage 
of her weak bits, too.

Good for you.

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:06.870
You got a lot of attention from the girls.

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:08.270
What?

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:12.580
Has spring come for you, 
the unpopular loner louse senpai?

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.840
What do you mean, "spring"?

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:18.050
Who do you think you are?

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:18.880
Creep.

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:24.760
I got a lot of compliments.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.210
But that was because the 
paintings turned out well.

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:32.930
And that's because you modeled for me.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.780
Are you trying to kiss up to me?

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:41.140
No!

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:42.530
That's not it.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:47.260
It wouldn't have turned out like 
this if I'd done it by myself.

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:50.750
Thanks.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.940

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:24.510
All right, let's wrap up the
 rest of the day, Senpai!

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:25.830
Y-Yeah.

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:27.720

Please come to the student guidance office.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:53.720
We said we would decide depending on 
the response on the day of the event.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.810
This may be art, but we are at school.

right to free expression.

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:14.200
I think this means we win.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.250
That was kind of anti-climactic.

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:25.010

your piece during the culture festival.

What's wrong with the president's piece?

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.520
It was fine last year.

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:46.570
We received a report that she was using it 
to play with the male students' lust.

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:48.500
We can't allow that to happen.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:49.580
B-But...

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:50.530
Enough.

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:55.440
It just means my art didn't have the 
power to sway the viewers' hearts.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.030
That's not true!

00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:05.420
I-I'm always struggling to figure out how 
make art the way you do, what I should draw.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:11.680
B-But that's how I came to realize that 
what I really want to draw, deep down,

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.680
is Nagatoro.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.190
Just what is your point?

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.980
Oh, er, um... Well...

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:26.440
You're up. Go help him out.

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:27.940
Hey!

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.450
I don't know anything about art,

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.950
but even as a woman, I think it's pretty.

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:42.360
That's an entirely subjective opinion.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.710
It doesn't mean anything.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:46.360
Yoshi.

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:55.320
U-Um...

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:01.890
Th-There were some people who were 
looking at it with sketchy eyes,

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:05.890
but there were lots who took it seriously, too.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.160
It's...

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:12.110
uh... amazing.

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:20.540
Whew...

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:23.500
It's not looking too good 
for the president, is it?

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:27.540
That discipline committee president 
seemed pretty stubborn.

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:29.400
Sh-She's coming!

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:35.300

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:52.320

of the viewers and produce a report.

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:55.570

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:07.020
We win now, right?

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:07.960
Right?

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.480
