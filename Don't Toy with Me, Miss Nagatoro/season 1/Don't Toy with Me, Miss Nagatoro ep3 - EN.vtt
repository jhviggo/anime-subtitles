WEBVTT

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.120
Senpai, want me to model for you?

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.290
N-No, thanks.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.120
I prefer drawing still lifes to people.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:38.390
Senpai, I can help you get a leg up.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.190
W-Wait!

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.640
You sh-shouldn't do that kind of thing!

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.690
What kind of thing?

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.300
Like this?

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.280
The swim team wanted me to help out,

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.440
so I was seeing if this hand-me-down
swimsuit would fit me.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.160
What were you expecting, Senpai?

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.010
You closeted perv!

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.810
DON'T TOY WITH ME,
MISS NAGATORO

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.330
<b>DON'T TOY WITH ME, MISS NAGATORO</b>

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:46.260
<b></b>Let's Play Again, <b>Senpai</b>

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.830
<i>I was looking forward to</i>

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.020
<i>working on my manga at
the family restaurant in peace.</i>

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.020
Hurry up, Senpai.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.030
<i>Why does this always happen?</i>

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.600
Hurry! Hurry!

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.530
You're going to get soaked!

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.560
I already am.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.200
Don't mind me.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.800
Go without me.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.570
He's trying to sound tough.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.180
No, it's just...

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.210
Why don't we wait out the rain
over there, then?

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.010
I'm soaked.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.010
The forecast said it was
supposed to be clear.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.560
It's what they call a
passing shower, I guess.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.700
It should clear up in a bit.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.240
That's true.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:54.700
Hey, Senpai...

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.590
Wait, don't look this way.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.590
Wh-Why not?

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.120
Because...

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.340
My uniform's really see-through right now.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.850
<i>See... through...</i>

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.560
You might be dying to see,
being a closeted perv and all.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.680
No, I won't.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.780
I won't look.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.360
Are you sure?

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.480
I-I'm not a closeted perv or anything.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.240
I bet you're going to try to steal glances.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.490
He's going to violate me with his eyes!

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.490
I'm not!

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.130
<i>Damn it, Nagatoro keeps messing with me.</i>

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.250
<i>Wait a second...</i>

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.650
Too bad for you!

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.200
I was wearing a swimsuit underneath!

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.950
<i>That's got to be it.</i>

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.700
I know.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.820
By see-through, you mean to your swimsuit!

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.900
S-Sorry.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.860
See? I knew you were a closeted perv.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:14.940
No!

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.250
You took a long, hard stare
at my see-through uniform.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.420
I-It was a mistake.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:23.660
What? What?

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.000
I couldn't hear you.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.930
Say it louder, Senpai.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.440
It's going to blow me away!

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.690
Are you all right?

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.680
S-S-Sorry!

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.400
Oh, no!

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.190
You saw me again!

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.610
You're so horny, Senpai.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.650
It's getting kind of cold.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.140
It doesn't look like it's
going to stop raining.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.340
We might have to run home.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.100
Where do you live, Senpai?

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.710
I take a turn at the intersection
and then go through the tunnel.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.220
That's pretty far.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.220
What about you?

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.230
Past the convenience store there.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:13.100
Huh...

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.730
That's pretty close.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.440
Hey, Senpai...

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.490
Want to stop by my place?

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.340
Come in, Senpai.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.370
Th-Thanks for having me.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.000
Welcome home!

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.010
Well, well, have you brought a friend?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.280
Not really a friend...

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.100
More like a toy.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.280
My, my, what a shabby toy.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.210
I thought you brought home
a scarecrow or something.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.620
He's pretty fun to play with, though.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.790
Wait! Stop!

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.290
This is quite a fun toy.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.300
Oh, my, his eye is twitching.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.010
I know, right?

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:31.550
And after that...

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:37.810
See? This toy starts crying.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.630
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.720
What's wrong? You seem really on edge.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.960
N-No, it's nothing.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.430
Um...

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:50.520
What about your family?

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.540
No one's home right now.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.200
My whole family's going to be out late today.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:56.840
I-I see.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.450
Well, come in.

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:01.330
N-No, I'm just going to wait
for the rain to stop.

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:05.430
You're going to catch a
cold if you don't dry off.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:13.230
That's my big brother's,
so it might be a bit big on you.

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:15.400
You can use this, too.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.330
Right.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.390
Thanks.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.280
Leave your wet clothes there.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.140
I'll run the dryer. It won't take long.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.310
Got it.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.200
<i>Could this be...</i>

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:38.780
<i>the towel that Nagatoro used?!</i>

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:44.730
N-N-No, I...

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:46.600
Too bad!

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.800
This is the towel I used.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.120
Enjoy.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:07.950
Senpai...

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.530
You're acting twice as sus as usual.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:15.400
Is this your first time in a girl's room?

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:18.660
Th-That's a secret.

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:20.910
A secret?!

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:22.160
That's hilarious.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.600
Okay, I have a question for you.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:34.420
What's the thing guys do when
they're at a girl's place?

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.120
Wh-What <i>"thing"?!</i>

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.540
What?

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.430
S-Study? And stuff?

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.360
Study?

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.570
We don't even have any tests coming up.

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:56.370
You use your fingers to prod and parry.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:57.720
Wait, that's...

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:02.540
And then you become vigorously intertwined.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.200
N-No! We can't!

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:07.120
Huh?

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:09.580
I mean this.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.140
What did you think I meant?

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.340
Th-That's a secret.

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:19.250
Yeesh, you're such a perv.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:21.860
So nasty.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:26.560
Huh...

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.020
<i>JusGear</i>, eh?

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.390
It's my brother's.

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:30.730
Do you know how to play?

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.730
Yeah, I used to play quite a bit.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.850
You're an otaku, so you shouldn't have to
be so awkward if we're just gaming, right?

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:43.040
I'm pretty good at this game.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.620
Take my powerful punch!

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:56.000
Here goes my special punch!

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.730
<i>Nothing but a big mouth.</i>

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.140
<i>Shoot!</i>

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:19.400
<i>I took the game way too seriously
against an obvious beginner.</i>

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:21.960
<i>Wait a second...</i>

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:29.160
<i>In a sense, this is kind of what Nagatoro's
been doing to me this whole time.</i>

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:44.720
<i>Have some pain for once!</i>

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.230
<i>I'll finish you off!</i>

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.540
You're mine!

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.400
Scrub!

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.370
Senpai's a scrub!

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:15.960
That was cheating!

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.180
No, it wasn't!

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.420
It's a battle strategy!

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:22.020
Let's play some more, Senpai.

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:27.680
Senpai, you pervert!

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.150
Senpai's a super scrub in real life, too.

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:44.390
Thanks for having me over today.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:45.700
You're welcome.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.210
I had f-fun gaming.

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.710
Let's play again, Senpai.

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.370
I'll destroy you next time, too.

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:03.740
Don't cheat next time.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:07.970
I know you're really hoping I do,
Senpai, you closeted perv.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:10.070
I'm n-not!

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:19.980
<b>They're exactly alike...</b>

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:24.990
<b>He looks nothing like him...</b>

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:28.990
<b>Dining Hall
Today Only Gorgeous Karaage Lunch</b>

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:35.000
<b></b>Over Here, <b>Senpai</b>!

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:32.350
<i>It's been a while since
I came to the dining hall.</i>

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:35.220
<i>I was expecting to eat alone, but...</i>

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:40.140
<i>There's nowhere to sit!</i>

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:48.510
Senpai! Over here!

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:50.850
Come on.

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:53.350
There's a seat next to me.

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:06.110
<i>That's the worst spot ever.</i>

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.610
<i>But...</i>

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.080
<i>There aren't any other open seats.</i>

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:17.120
<i>I'm going to have to eat
as fast as I can and run.</i>

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.150
P-Pardon me.

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:30.140
Your boyfriend?

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.640
N-No!

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.640
Yup.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.640
We're going steady.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.760
Right, Senpai?

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.640
Stop! Don't!

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:46.800
That's hilarious.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.660
So how far have you gotten with her, Paisen?

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:56.410
H-How far? I d-don't know
what you're talking about.

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.430
You're all red, Paisen.

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:00.920
Beet red!

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.170
Okay...

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.090
Want to go out with me, too, then?

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.090
S-Stop!

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.120
You can totally tell he's a virgin.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.240
You want him to have a girl on the side?

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.850
On the side! That's so funny.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:17.220
So funny.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.020
He doesn't seem like a boyfriend...

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:22.020
So much as a pet.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.230
A pet!

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.890
He does kind of seem like a pet.

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:28.740
He's all fluffy and stuff.

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:31.150
Stop it!

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:32.740
Fluffy!

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:38.500
Senpai's head is all sticky.
You don't want to touch it.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.340
Uh... Yeah.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.360
Who are you calling sticky?!

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.790
I wash it every day!

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:50.010
Are you sure?

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.200
He doesn't even seem like a pet.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.760
He doesn't.

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:55.820
A slave?

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:56.890
A slave!

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:00.740
Slave! Did you hear that, Senpai?

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.230
Who are you calling a slave?!

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:04.460
Hurry up and finish eating!

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.270
And get back to work for me!

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:09.310
Work!

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.500
Man, this is great.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.170
He doesn't fight back at all.

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.460
He's not even a slave...

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:31.420
More like a bug?

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:36.430
Seriously, you can't be like that as a guy.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.610
That's taking it too far.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:51.070
Sorry I dissed your boyfriend.

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.570
That's not the point.

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:03.580
<i>Is Nagatoro getting angry on my behalf?</i>

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.080
<i>No... No way.</i>

00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:12.800
H-Hey...

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:16.560
I-I...

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.800
I'm not Nagatoro's boyfriend, but...

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:36.570
That's it?!

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:41.120
You were supposed to say something good.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.080
You had nothing in mind?!

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:45.590
No, well...

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:49.580
I j-just wanted to say I'm not her boyfriend.

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:55.210
You're so funny, Paisen.

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:56.490
So funny.

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:05.430
You never fight back, do you, Senpai?

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:06.490
Huh?

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:10.440
You never have a comeback
when you get dissed.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.160
I-I suppose.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:12.940
Which is why...

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:15.220
You have to smack them.

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:21.830
By turning it into slapstick,
you can turn a diss into a derp.

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:22.780
You're gross.

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.210
Shup!

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.300
I don't know if that would work so well.

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:28.300
It will.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.620
Come on.

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:33.670
Stand over there, Senpai.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Thank you! Thank you!

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.310
So the other day, there was a scarecrow
standing in the middle of the road.

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:42.380
A comedy sketch?

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.870
I thought, why is a scarecrow standing here?

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:47.440
Weird... I wonder why...

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.100
So I took a closer look, and...

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.110
It wasn't a scarecrow, it was Senpai!

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:57.890
"Who you calling a scarecrow?!"

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.740
See? Easy, right?

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:04.660
That's all it takes?

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:08.840
You aren't a comedian. You don't
have to do anything special.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:12.670
Just go with the flow and give them a slap.

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.720
<i>I see.</i>

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:19.040
You're so creepy, Senpai.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.920
So creepy.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.050
So creepy.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.520
Shup!

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:34.830
<i>I think I can fight back a bit.</i>

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:36.730
Okay, let's keep going.

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:39.870
You have to do it yourself this time.

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:41.430
O-Okay.

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:45.290
Thank you! Thank you!

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:49.460
Sorry for calling you creepy earlier, Senpai.

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.930
It's fine.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:57.280
You're not so much creepy as you are funny.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.360
Your hair's funny, too.

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:00.520
It's so fluffy.

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.720
Like a sheep that's about
to get eaten by a wolf.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:06.720
Is it shearing season yet?

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.250
Want me to help you?

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.280
I'll go through it with electric clippers.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:12.320
Fluffy, fluffy, buzz!

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:13.620
Fluffy, fluffy, buzz!

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:14.890
Fluffy, fluffy, buzz!

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.070
Fluffy, fluffy, buzz!

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:17.570
Fluffy, fluffy, buzz!

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.240
Come on, Senpai!

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:20.740
Smack me!

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:23.960
Senpai?

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:33.500
Y-You didn't have to take it so far.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.380
Sorry.

00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:59.920
What's wrong? Why so pouty?

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.280
You <i>are</i> kind of gross, Senpai.

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:05.890
What's this? Are you crying again?

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:07.660
I-I'm not crying.

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:10.160
Come on, the smack!

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.910
You have to go at it!

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.730
Come on, Senpai!

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.420
Shut up!

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.930
S-S-S-Sorry!

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:35.390
I-I knew you could do it, Senpai.

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:37.440
But you're supposed to smack here.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.330
Or did you...

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:42.090
hit me there on purpose,

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:44.440
you pervert?

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.810
N-No...

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:48.000
C-Come on, that's where you're
supposed to give me a smack.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.870
"Hell, no!"

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:53.460
Spare me, already!

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:27.240
Points of improvement for today!

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:30.800
You said you aren't my boyfriend,
but what are you, then?

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.230
Well... friends or something.

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:35.730
Would you look at your friend's underwear,
go to their place, or expect a kiss?

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:36.100
Well...

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:39.620
Would you expect something
sexy from your friends? Well?
