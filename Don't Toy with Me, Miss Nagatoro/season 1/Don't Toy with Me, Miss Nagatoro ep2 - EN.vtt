That looks good.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.990
Senpai!

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.880
What do you think of my hip motions?

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.050
Come in, now!

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.640
Find the right moment and slide in!

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.310
Come on, hurry up!

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.250
No, but when?

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.170
You're such a pervert!

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.870
DON'T TOY WITH ME,

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.870
DON'T TOY WITH ME,

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.870
DON'T TOY WITH ME,

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.870
DON'T TOY WITH ME,

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.870

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.420
'Sup?!

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.670
Er, 'sup?

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.700
What were you eating all by yourself?

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.760
Y-Yakisoba.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.020
Want some?

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.610
Why would you offer that to a girl?

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.560
That's why you're not popular with girls.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.950
Anyway...

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.570
Was it just me, or did you have
 a sketchy look in your eyes earlier?

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.120
Wh-What are you talking about?

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.660
You were like this.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.580
I got creepy vibes from you.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.200
I-I don't know what you're talking about.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.830
You were looking at something pervy.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.900
Let me see!

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.760
It's nothing pervy!

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.420
You're so obvious.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.600
You're a closet perv.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.130
You like sexy stuff.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.930
I-I-I-I'm not like that.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.190
If that's what you want, I can let you do it.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.150
D-Do it?!

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.820
Gotcha!

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:23.200
Hey!

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.760
Give it back!

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.720
Give it back!

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.370
Give it back!

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.980
Give it back!

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.160
Give it back!

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.080
You're so easy, Senpai.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.990
No way I'd do it with you.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.310
Did you get your hopes up?

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.140
You need to know your place, pervy Senpai.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.590
<b>What!?</b>

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.220
I knew it! It's a pervy thing!

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.510
No! Those kinds of sexy scenes have 
always been a staple in shonen manga.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.610
I always buy it for the story!

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:59.850
I mean, like, er, um...

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.320
Now you're fast talking all of a sudden.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.040
You're so gross, Senpai.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.600
No, I...

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.240
You say all that...

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.620
<b>Ack!
Kyaa!</b>

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.620
<b>Crash</b>

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.620
<b>Squish</b>

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.620
But this is what you like, isn't it?

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.600
What is this? Accidentally lucky?

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.870
Th-That's...

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.000
You want to play with someone's boobs right 
as you're falling, don't you, Senpai?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.050
S-Stop confusing fiction and reality.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.380
Senpai, you pervert.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.560
Th-That's just a silly bonus chapter.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.890
It's the main vampire story
 that I want to read.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.390
Vampire story?

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.430
It was pervy, but it was 
actually pretty good.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:06.260
Right?

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.340
Love and romance with an immortal.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.140
I love vampire stuff.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.140
But one of the characters kind 
of resembles you, didn't he?

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.260
He runs around holding a bunch of 
garlic, which doesn't even work.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.580
He falls victim to the vampire's fangs...

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.910
and gets the life sucked out of him.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.800
H-He's nothing like me.

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:49.680
You'd be all right if you were 
attacked by a vampire, though.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.930
Huh? Why?

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.800
Because you're a virgin.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.070
If you weren't a virgin...

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:02.880
You'd end up a ghoul!

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.570
A mindless ghoul!

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.940
But you'll be fine.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.450
Good thing you're a virgin, huh?

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.570
Shut up!

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:18.350
H-How do y-you know I'm a v-v-virgin?

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.240
You'd have to be a vampire or something.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.390
That's true.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.620
Want to find out, then?

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.850
I'm kidding.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.300
R-Right. Of course.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:50.530
Can I try...

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.030
Can you try...?

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.040
...taking a bite?

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:55.740
No!

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.340
I won't suck.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.810
I just want to try biting down.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:07:59.810
What is wrong with you?!

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:01.660
Are you giving up on being human?

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.520
I'm just pretending to suck your blood.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.510
Just pretending.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:09.300
See? My canine teeth are pretty sharp.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.050
I just want to try giving 
you a prick with this.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:23.390
I feel like I'm actually a vampire.

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:25.720
Cut it out!

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:35.520
G-Get off me.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.900
Nope.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.800
You're my prey now, Senpai.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.670
S-Someone would get the 
wrong idea if they saw us.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:45.650
Is that what you want?

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.100
What do you mean, the wrong idea?

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.340
W-Well, things and stuff.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.640
You have such a thin neck, Senpai.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.280
Stop! Stop it!

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.640
H-Hang on!

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.370
Why don't you shove me 
aside if you don't like it?

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:10.000
Not that you could do it.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:17.410
Wait!

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:21.910
Gross!

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:23.640
Garlic breath!

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:25.750
You're not getting away!

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.200
Ow...

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.200
You got your wish, Senpai!

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.520
You got accidentally lucky!

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.510
That's not how it works!

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.020
<b>Garlic</b>

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.020
<b>Yakisoba</b>

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.240
Hey, hey, Senpai, was that the 
first time a girl touched you?

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.250
Huh? T-Touched? Touched what?

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:15.590
Well, was it?

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.630
I-I don't know!

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.510
You're beet red, Senpai.

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:23.510
Let me guess...

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:25.640
Did you get hard?

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.620
Shut up!

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:33.320
Want me to squeeze it again?

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:43.490
Ow...

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:46.540
Hey!

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:54.670
See you, Senpai.

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:07.720

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:10.980

Here.

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:18.140

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.640
Okay, let's get started.

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:48.990
Hello, Senpai!

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:51.650
Wh-Why are you here?

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:53.440
I was about to start drawing.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.900
Let's play a game.

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:57.650
A game?

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:01.700
The nipple guessing game!

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:04.190
The rules are simple.

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:07.200
You have to guess where the other person's 
nipples are from over their clothes.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.620
There!

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.320
That's all you have to do.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.320
Okay?

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.050
How is that okay?!

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:24.290
B-Besides, guessing where
 a girl's n-nipples are...

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:26.000
I'm not a groper.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.810
You react like such a virgin, Senpai.

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.120
Wh-What does being a virgin 
have to do with it?

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:35.740
There's no point in playing, even if I win.

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.060
No, there is.

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.260
A grand prize.

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:48.070
<b>You can ask me to do anything ticket</b>

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:48.070
A you-can-ask-me-to-do-anything ticket.

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:50.780
Whenever I'm toying with you...

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:56.930
You can use this...

00:12:57.930 --> 00:12:59.120
Stop!

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.340
Okay.

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:03.340
You can make me stop, just like that.

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:06.590
<b>You can ask me to do anything ticket</b>

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.180
It doesn't have to be such 
a boring order, either.

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:10.350
You can use it to make me
 do something crazier.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.460
Something crazier?

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:17.540
What? You want me to wear my swimsuit 
in the club room, you say?!

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:18.970
I never said that!

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:23.440
What? You want me to be a nude model?!

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.610
You don't have to do that!

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:26.950
I don't know...

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:28.960
Why would you use the ticket like that?

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.850
You're so nasty, Senpai.

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:32.690
You're so nasty, Senpai.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.620
<i>I don't care about using it
 for "crazy stuff,"</i>

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.620
You're so nasty, Senpai.

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:38.630
<i>but if I can use this to make her stop...</i>

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.450
You're so nasty, Senpai.

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:40.450
F-Fine.

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:41.730
I'll play.

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:43.180
That's the spirit, Senpai.

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.960
That's what I wanted to hear.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.450
Okay, here we go.

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:52.390
I-It's sudden death, all right?

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.020
<i>I-I can do it.</i>

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.030

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:36.680
B-Bulls-eye!

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.640
<i>Wait, she missed.</i>

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.260
<i>She's off by just a bit.</i>

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.690
<i>I'm not sure, but it's self-reported,</i>

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:50.400
<i>so I can just tell her she missed.</i>

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.300
Y-You missed.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.100
Well, Senpai?

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.790
Did I get you?

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.140
N-No!

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:02.740
Did I miss?

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:03.960
You m-m—

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.060
Well?

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:08.970
Did I get you? Senpai?

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:12.970
Senpai!

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:16.240
You got me!

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:17.720
You got me!

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.730
Okay, your turn, Senpai.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.490
Not that you have the guts to do it.

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:34.850
Well, the you-can-ask-me-to-do-anything 
ticket is mine, then.

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:36.420
What should I use it for?

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:37.490
I'll do it.

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:39.760
Are you sure you can?

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.430
I said I'll do it.

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:44.830
I see.

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:48.100
Okay, go ahead.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:18.960
Time's up!

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.630
Huh?!

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:22.290
You never said anything about time!

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:24.850
I forgot I was meeting my friends!

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.790
H-Hey...

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.510
<b>Family Restaurant</b>

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:38.810
<i>One of my favorite family restaurants, 
away from my school route.</i>

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:43.360
<i>I can finally relax and work on my manga.</i>

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.060
Oh, damn, I think we have the 
whole place to ourselves.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:47.460
I told you.

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:52.320
<i>Nagatoro!</i>

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.740
Where should we sit?

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.060
How about over there?

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:06.330
Huh, you have Koba-sensei for contemporary 
literature, too, Nagatoro-chan?

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:09.860
He never stops talking, does he?

00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:14.090
<i>Those boys are from the class next to mine.</i>

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:18.480
I heard you're in a band, right, Senpai?

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.790
Yeah. He's writing these awesome songs.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:23.560
Don't tell them.

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:27.100
Is it like Yaba P?

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.420
Nah, it's not like that.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:34.580
If I had to describe it, 
it's like an extension of art.

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:37.860
Want to give it a listen?

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:42.610
It's not the kind of simple crowd-pleasing
melodies that you hear all the time.

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:47.870
My music incorporates the kind of artistic 
elements that come out of soul and hip-hop.

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:52.160
I'm going to the drink fountain.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.220
Me, too, then.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.900
Later.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.980
Anyway, I think art is 
never really understood.

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.850
In fact, it's art <i>because</i> it's 
not understood, you know?

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:08.650
<i>Nagatoro looks pretty annoyed.</i>

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:13.400
<i>I don't think that guy 
knows how sadistic she is.</i>

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:16.080
He's like a moth to the flame.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:17.420
Huh?

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.030
This is music?

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:21.920
I thought it was some kind of weird bug.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.410
<i>Let's watch how she messes with you!</i>

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:32.530
I don't get it.

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:33.420
<i>Huh?</i>

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:35.120
R-Really?

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:37.800
I guess it might have been 
a bit too sophisticated.

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:40.270
It's not so much sophisticated as...

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.590
I didn't really feel anything.

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:47.930
It sounds like you aren't really into it.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.940
Am I wrong?

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.440
W-Well...

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.580
<i>That wasn't really the 
reaction I was expecting.</i>

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.010
I'm going to the bathroom.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.200
Say what?

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:04.820
Sorry about him.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:07.170
He isn't really good at reading the room.

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:11.960
I wasn't going to bring him, 
but he insisted on coming.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:16.210
You're pretty guarded, huh, Nagatoro-chan?

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:17.960
Am I?

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:21.460
You don't have to be so cautious around us!

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:23.240
<i>This guy's persistent.</i>

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:24.040
I went to a boys school for middle school,

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.470
so I don't really know 
how to deal with girls.

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:30.230
I've never played with a girls boobs, even.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.140
I'm serious.

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:33.860
What?

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:36.280
<i>You have no idea what's coming!</i>

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.430
<i>I don't know if you're trying 
to take her guard down,</i>

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:40.240
<i>but you've just made 
yourself vulnerable.</i>

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:42.250
Seriously?!

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:45.860
You're <i>that</i> old and you've never touched 
a girl's boobs before? That's harsh.

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.890
Go play with some konjac jelly or something.

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:49.500
It would suit you.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:53.000
<i>Get bullied and cry as I have!</i>

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:59.010
I'm not sure that's appropriate to say to 
someone you're meeting for the first time.

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:07.970
I-I'm going to the bathroom.

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:12.560
Huh?

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:17.660
Toro-chan, are you not interested 
in guys or something?

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:19.040
Not really.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.860
It's just that those guys are boring.

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:25.330
I think they have a thing for you.

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:27.940
That's why I set you up with them.

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:32.610
I told you to stop doing that!

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:33.650
Jeez!

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:36.040
But they're so good-looking!

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:46.180
<i>Hold on...</i>

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:50.520
<i>Am I the only one Nagatoro toys with?</i>

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:55.070
'Sup, Senpai?

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:57.190
Are you on your way home, too?

00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:58.750
Y-Yeah.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:03.230
You have such a unique silhouette, Senpai.

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:05.650
I can tell it's you from really far away.

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:08.920
Like, "Look at that creepy thing over there!"

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.790
Stop calling me creepy!

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:15.730
You're really squiggly.

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.040
Squiggle, squiggle.

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.540
Squiggle, squiggle.

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:20.770
Squiggle, squiggle.

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:25.680
Squiggle, squiggle.

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:25.680
Hey, Nagatoro...

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:28.850
What is it, Senpai?

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:30.680
No, it's nothing.

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.430
What? What?

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:33.430
I want to know.

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.350
I s-said it's nothing.

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:38.490
Ew, he's squiggling again.

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:39.470
Gross.

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:41.940
Sh-Shut up!

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:43.940
Senpai's so gross.

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:47.940
So gross!

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.790
He's so gross!

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:52.020
Stop calling me gross!

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.170
He's so gross!

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:54.950
He's going to be gross tomorrow, too!

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:27.450
Points of improvement for today!

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:28.710
Are we doing this every week?

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:30.500
Is that the kind of manga you draw?

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:31.680
It's similar.

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:37.030
I bet the protagonist is like you, 
and he gets sucked on by a vampire all over.

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:37.990
N-No...

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:39.990
You're so obvious, Senpai.
