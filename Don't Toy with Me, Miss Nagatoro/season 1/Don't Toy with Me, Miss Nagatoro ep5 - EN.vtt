<b>Art Room</b>

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.900
Hey, Senpai.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.310
You're looking as gross as ever.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.080
Gross! Gross! Grossy-gross!

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.560
Gross! Grossy-gross!

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.730
You're so gross, Senpai.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.420
He's not <i>that</i> gross, is he?

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.420
Not gross.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.680
Let's go hang out, Paisen.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.170
It beats being around Hayacchi and
being called gross, doesn't it?

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.560
Doesn't it?

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:45.490
True.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.060
It does.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.820
That's the spirit.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:54.820
The spirit.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.060
Later, Nagatoro.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.340
I-Is something wrong?

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:14.820
Nothing.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.220
Did you bring this here for me?

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.360
I-I couldn't have you catching a cold.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.980
Th-There happened to be a spare sheet, so...

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.940
You're not that gross today, Senpai.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.980
Is that supposed to be a compliment?

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.840
DON'T TOY WITH ME,
MISS NAGATORO

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.360
<b>DON'T TOY WITH ME, MISS NAGATORO</b>

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:19.050
<b>Senpai</b>'s Poofball

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.970
<i>She's looking at me!</i>

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.030
<i>She's going to say something weird again.</i>

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.470
I bet you're sensitive, Senpai.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.100
H-How?

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.860
In more ways than one.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.360
You're a virgin, too.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.360
You'd probably make funny
noises if I tickled you.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.670
Like that.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.760
What? I'm p-pretty ordinary.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.610
I'm ordinary.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.120
Shall we find out, then?

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.540
Wait! S-S-Stop!

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.720
I knew it. Senpai's sensitive.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.440
What? What about you, then?

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.020
I'm not ticklish at all.

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.950
Want to find out?

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.300
Then again, there's no way
you're going to tickle a girl.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.110
That's way too much for a virgin
like you, right, Senpai?

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.210
I-I could tickle you, no problem.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.290
Oh, really?

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.480
Okay, go ahead.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.990
You can tickle me, Senpai.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.160
Mercy!

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.680
Just kidding!

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.650
Let's not.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.320
You had creeper eyes.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.900
Oh, yeah. There's a video
I wanted to show you.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.350
Wh-What video?

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.290
Doesn't this video give you the feels?

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:51.870
A sheep?

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.400
Look at all that poofy wool get sheared off.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.570
Isn't there something thrilling about it?

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.720
I-I guess it's kind of satisfying to watch.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.760
Right?

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:06.630
The feels!

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:07.520
The feels!

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.580
Your hair's getting pretty long, too, Senpai.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.530
Yeah.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.300
I haven't been to the barber shop in a while.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.840
Do you ever get your hair sheared?

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:36.500
What?!

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.080
I'm not a sheep!

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.420
I mean, you kind of are.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.960
You're going to have a hard time seeing
if you don't do something about it.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.470
I'll go to the barber shop tomorrow.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.470
The <i>barber shop?</i>

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.020
Jeez.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.090
I'll give you a hand.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:00.900
With shearing.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.730
Why do you have that?!

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.410
I borrowed it from my brother and just
happened to have it with me.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.010
That's all.

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:11.990
Lies!

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:20.000
Imagine how satisfying it'd be to
shear off all of Senpai's poofball!

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.500
I said I'm not a sheep!

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.250
Can't I? Please?

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.380
No!

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.890
Just a little bit?

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:31.820
Just the tip! Come on!

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.670
No way!

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:37.140
I've never had my hair cut so short at
the barber that they'd ever use a shaver!

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.530
Nuts.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:47.150
Fine, with scissors, then.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.360
I-I don't think that's a job for a beginner.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.130
I'm pretty good at cutting hair.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:56.160
Are you sure?

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.160
I'm sure.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.250
I cut my brother's hair at home sometimes.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.510
But it's a lot of work.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.940
I can't ask you to do that.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.350
It's fine.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:09.100
It'll be quick.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.150
I'll just give you a trim.

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:15.760
<i>Nagatoro...</i>

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.340
<i>Cutting my hair...</i>

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.850
I guess just a trim wouldn't hurt.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.960
I've got this!

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.960
I'm only going to improve
your hair just a little.

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:32.660
I feel sorry for you having
to walk around like that.

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:34.480
You didn't need to say that!

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:37.350
Okay, let's start.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:41.920
Hello?

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.060
<i>Hayacchi? I'll return those
math notes I borrowed off you.</i>

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.280
<i>Return!</i>

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.290
Oh, you can give them back to me tomorrow.

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:50.230
<i>We'll be waiting in class.</i>

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:51.280
<i>We'll be waiting—</i>

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.560
If you have to be somewhere,
we can do it next time.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.160
Just a second.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.210
I'll be right back.

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:02.470
O-Okay.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.500
Art Room

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.490
<i>She's right, though. It's gotten pretty long.</i>

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:22.920
Eh? That was fast—

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:24.440
'Sup.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.870
'Sup, Senpai!

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:28.380
<i>Nagatoro's friends!</i>

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.950
Um, Nagatoro's not here right now.

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:33.600
I know.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.050
Why are you here, then?

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:37.770
Sniff, sniff...

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.640
This love nest sure does smell weird.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.080
A nasty smell?

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.520
It's the smell of oil paints!

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.200
A shaver?

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.640
Nagatoro said she'd cut my hair.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.450
We'll give you a hand.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:06.120
We will!

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.780
No, er...

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:14.300
Huh?

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.060
Gamo-chan? Yoshi?

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.370
W-Wait!

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.090
H-Hey!

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:27.380
Your phone!

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:29.440
Your phone's ringing!

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.020
It's okay.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.010
It's not an important call.

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:34.190
Nope!

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.540
Stop!

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:42.540
Don't worry. I'm just going
to trim the edges.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:44.300
Like Xavier!

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:52.000
He's spinning! Really fast!

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:52.760
He's a dog!

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:55.250
Damn it! Hold him down!

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:56.090
Got it!

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:58.930
N-No!

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:02.090
I said s-stop!

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:11.350
N-No! I promised Nagatoro
that sh-she could cut it!

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:14.050
You keep saying "Nagatoro"...

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:16.880
Do you really deserve that?

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.360
Do you?

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.370
Ahem.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.130
N-Nagatoro...

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.140
U-Um...

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.970
I don't know what's going on,
but please don't fight.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.860
Have it.

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.240
Let's bounce!

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.020
Let's bounce!

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.050
Don't cut it too short.

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:24.180
I know.

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:27.050
How about like Ikkyu-san short?

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:28.500
That's way too short.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.130
How's about that?

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:35.890
Well?

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:37.140
Y-Yeah.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.400
I think that looks good.

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.150
Th-Thanks.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:54.920
Although a little bit of a haircut isn't
going to change how creepy you are.

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:57.580
Oh, shut up!

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:19.900
<b></b>Thanks, <b>Senpai</b>!

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:26.920
It's so hot...

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:27.640
Yeah...

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.400
Weren't you just being worked
really hard at your club?

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.000
You should take it easy.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.460
I know, Senpai!

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:35.750
Let's go get some shaved ice.

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:37.670
Shaved ice, huh?

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:38.840
That sounds good.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:42.430
There's a shop I like that way.

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:49.460
The fluffy, poofy ice towering
over you is like...

00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:02.730
The Mt. Everest of shaved ice!

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:15.840
It wasn't anything like
this last time I was here!

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:20.600
This shop was featured on TV yesterday.

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:21.750
<b>Asanandesu</b>

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:21.750
<b>Top 100 shaved ice shops
Number 1!</b>

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.750
Seriously?!

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.470
It was a great hole-in-the-wall...

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:29.010
but now everyone knows about it.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:31.760
What do we do?

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.840
I don't feel like getting in this huge line.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:40.380
We're lining up, Senpai!

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.900
H-Hey!

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:44.360
It's for fluffy shaved ice!

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.570
We'll survive it through sheer force of will!

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:51.070
I wouldn't mind just getting
convenience store ice cream.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.600
Convenience store ice cream?

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.700
Made with Natural Water

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.700
Shaved Ice

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:04.860
F-Fine.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:05.900
We'll line up.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.440
The line hasn't moved at all.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.800
Willpower!

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.110
Endure it with willpower!

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:29.230
<i>There's a lineup behind us, too.</i>

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:03.850
Are you all right?

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.540
Maybe you should leave the
line and rest in the shade.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:13.740
No, I can still manage.

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.260
H-Hey! Senpai!

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.740
What are you doing?!

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:49.470
H-Here.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:54.780
Y-You need to stay hydrated,
or you're going to get heat stroke.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.450
Y-Yeah.

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:01.040
Thanks, Senpai.

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.410
Fully charged!

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.890
Fluffy shaved ice...

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:24.140
Want to line up again?

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:27.210
Nah, I'll give up for now.

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:29.900
Let's come back when it's not as busy.

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:33.810
Senpai, wait here for a bit.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:59.300
You're so sensitive, Senpai.

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:00.100
Here.

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:04.640
This is for earlier.

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:10.860
Thanks.

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:17.530
In blazing sunshine

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.100
Convenience store ice cream

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:20.800
Is unbeatable.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:21.910
A haiku?

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.040
Here, Senpai. Say "ah."

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.320
I-It's fine.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.010
I can feed myself.

00:18:30.010 --> 00:18:31.920
Senpai's embarrassed!

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.000
Summer break starts tomorrow.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:41.860
Yeah.

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:43.010
It is.

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:47.040
Now that I'm helping out with the swim club,

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.650
that's going to be my life
for the whole summer.

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:50.940
Oh, yeah?

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:54.320
<i>Summer break, huh?</i>

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.940
<i>What should I do?</i>

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:58.390
<i>I played the newest </i>Last Quest<i>.</i>

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:00.900
<i>And I need to watch Season 2 of </i>Yuramiko<i>.</i>

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:04.560
<i>And I need to finish my oil paintings.</i>

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:09.710
<i>I guess this girl won't be messing with
me anymore once it's summer break.</i>

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:14.020
Can I have some tea?

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:20.000
Hitoen

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:20.000
Tea

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.140
Thanks.

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:29.350
S-Sure.

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:31.520
Hey, Senpai...

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:35.450
Want to exchange contacts?

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.420
I-I wouldn't mind, I guess.

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:44.280
I don't do this kind of thing much.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:49.220
It seems like a pain dealing with read
notifications and not ignoring them and stuff.

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.160
I thought you wouldn't, since you're a loner.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.620
Shut up.

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.760
Here.

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:57.800
There we go.

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:01.050
I got a loner's ID!

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:05.300
Y-You're not going to get anything
good out of connecting with me.

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.740
I don't think that's true.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.980
I added the loner's ID to my favorites.

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:31.820
So now, if I ever get the sense that
you're thinking about something pervy...

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:35.830
I can send you this sticker!

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:38.600
<i>Perv!</i>

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:41.840
<b>Perv!</b>

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.530
Isn't that awesome?!

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:41.840
That's just annoying.

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:49.500
See you, Senpai.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.540
Yeah, l-later.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:22.630
<i>No, this was mine to begin with.</i>

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:33.640
Perv!

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:39.650
You're such a perv, Senpai.

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.490
I-I'm not a perv!

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:47.420
I haven't done anything pervy!

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:49.760
Are you sure?

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:50.660
Y-Yes.

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.620
Are you <i>sure?</i>

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
What do you need to improve on today?

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:28.820
Wh-What?

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:31.470
Your "aiee!" scream was so creepy.

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:32.470
Shut up.

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:33.970
Can I hear it again?

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:34.680
Come on!

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:37.740
Are those guys okay?

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:39.010
C-Crazy...
