00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.980
Wh-What?

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.920
Want a little treat?

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.750
Huh?

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.240
Wh-What?

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.990
I got some really steamy snaps.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.000
S-Snaps?!

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.930
They're super steamy. Piping hot.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.250
<i>P-Piping hot?!</i>

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.200
And they're all natural.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.500
<i>A-All natural?!</i>

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.010
I-I can't look at those.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.770
Snap-Sizzle-Pop Chicken Bites.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.430
What did you think I meant?

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.770
I-I wasn't expecting anything.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.430
Why are you so red, then?

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.340
You were expecting something lewd, huh?

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.680
Weren't you, pervy Senpai?

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.460
Here. Say, "Ah."

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.790
I'll... I'll eat it myself.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.360
It's crazy good.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.440
Made fresh and steaming hot.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.410
Y-Yeah?

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.810
DON'T TOY WITH ME,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.810
DON'T TOY WITH ME,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.810
DON'T TOY WITH ME,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.810
DON'T TOY WITH ME,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.810
MISS NAGATORO

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.810
MISS NAGATORO

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.810
MISS NAGATORO

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.810
MISS NAGATORO

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.330
<b><b>DON'T TOY WITH ME, MISS NAGATORO</b></b>

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.330
<b><b>DON'T TOY WITH ME, MISS NAGATORO</b></b>

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.330
<b>DON'T TOY WITH ME, MISS NAGATORO</b>

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:53.020
<b></b>You Seem Pretty Stiff, <b>Senpai</b>

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.750
<i>I hate this.</i>

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.520
<i>I can't stand marathons.</i>

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.110
The second-years are doing a marathon.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.030
There's Senpai!

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.330
He's way in the lead!

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.030
I'm pretty sure he got lapped.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.910
What's this? Senpai's falling behind!

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.380
I saw you, Senpai.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.050
What was that flimsy running?

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.180
Sh-Shut up!

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.310
I'm embarrassed that you're my senpai.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.800
I can't help it.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.810
I'm bad at running.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.360
Sure you can help it.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.120
Even you can learn to run if you practice.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.120
No way.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.320
Everyone's got their 
strengths and weaknesses.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.060
I'm not good at anything besides drawing.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.700
You won't know until you try.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.960
Practicing only helps if 
you already have talent.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.640
There's no point if you aren't 
cut out for it to begin with.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.460
I don't want to hear your groaning!

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.470
Fine! We're having secret training 
sessions starting tomorrow.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.470
I'm going to slap that 
rotten attitude straight!

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.980
Like in a sports anime?!

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.590
Like in a sports anime!

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.210
So sleepy.

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.190
<i>There goes my weekend.</i>

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.960
<i>Why do I have to run?</i>

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.500
Senpai!

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.430
Good morning!

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.250
M-Morning.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.100
That was kind of creepy, Senpai.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.680
Hey!

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.000
Stop it!

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.760
Let's go, Senpai.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.910
Sports anime time!

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.930
This is way too intense.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.260
<i>My stomach's cramping up.</i>

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.110
<i>This is the least fitting 
thing I could be doing.</i>

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.240
You're falling behind, Senpai.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.440
You wanna go, Senpai?

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.930
You aren't beating me!

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.930
You don't need to race me!

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.460
I'm spent.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.880
Oh, come on.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.670
We're only halfway there.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.070
I'm good.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.330
I don't think this is for me.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.790
You can go ahead.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.330
I see.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.340
You sure are...

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:05.560
a wimp.

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.090
<b>Wimp</b>

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.340
<i>Wimp...</i>

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.800
I knew you weren't very gutsy, 
but I didn't realize it was this bad.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.600
A grade schooler has more guts than you.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.200
You have less guts than 
a puppy, or even a bug.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.380
What's wrong?

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.420
Feeling insulted?

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.920
Does being laughed at by a 
younger girl make you feel insulted?

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.620
Come after me if you're that upset!

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.870
Right, Maggot-senpai?

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.380
You didn't...

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.880
You didn't have to say it like that!

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.720
I'll promote you to human 
if you can finish the run.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.840
Until then, you're Maggot-senpai.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.860
Who are you calling a maggot?!

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.480
I made it.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.150
I ran five kilometers.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.840
I knew you could do it if you tried.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.100
I wouldn't mind taking back "maggot," Senpai.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.160
Why, thank you.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:17.410
Well, then, now that we've ran a ton...

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.520
It's time to stretch.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.130
You have to take your time to 
really stretch your muscles.

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.000
That'll lessen your muscle 
fatigue for tomorrow.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.260
You do it too, Senpai.

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:36.510
You seem pretty stiff, Senpai.

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.850
Can you even bend forward?

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.850
Like this.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:49.670
What are you daydreaming about?

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:50.990
N-No...

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.320
You're doing it, too, Senpai.

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:58.810
Oh, jeez.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.120
You're way too stiff, Senpai.

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:03.870
Sit down for a second, please.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.380
I'll help you out.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.520
I-It's fine.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.600
I'll do it myself.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.790
It's more efficient when you do it together.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.440
All right. Now, stand up.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.640
We'll do some side stretches.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:26.080
Here we go!

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.230
Ow, ow, ow!

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:31.240
Take it slower!

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.490
Don't be such a baby!

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.490
That hurts!

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.000
Fusion?

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.500
<b>DON'T TOY WITH ME,

00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:01.010

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:03.770

<b></b>I'll Do It For You, <b>Senpai</b>!!

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.770
Who should I get to model?

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.740
I'm not good at self-portraits.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.520
I might have to ask the club president.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.320
Senpai!

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.780
Looks like you've got something on your mind.

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:19.780
What's the matter?

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:22.510
What was that about a model?

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.760
I heard you.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.120
No, um...

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:29.290
I see.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.980
You haven't been able to find a model 
for your piece for the culture festival.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.080
Poor you, Senpai.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.580
You don't have any friends, do you?

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:40.800
Shut up!

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:48.310
I mean, if you're <i>really </i>
desperate, I'll do it for you...

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:49.060
No thanks.

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:54.470
But I'm offering!

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.820
A cute younger girl!

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:01.580
I've decided I'm going 
to draw a guy this time!

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:05.530
Why?

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:07.080
"Why?"

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:09.080
Because...

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.090
Because it's hard to draw the 
person face-to-face otherwise.

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:24.470
Even though you draw this 
kind of stuff all the time?

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:29.330
This is what you <i>really</i> want to 
draw, isn't it, you closet perv?

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:30.320
N-No!

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.060
Th-That's just a d-d-d-doodle 
I made because I was bored.

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:35.510
Liar! Liar!

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.490
You drew such a detailed character.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:43.800
Fine.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:44.890
I'll draw you.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.430
But you have to prepare your own outfit.

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:52.170
I don't have any girls' clothes.

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.880
That's the condition.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.680
Sure thing.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.400
What kind of clothes would you like?

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.770
A swimsuit, I bet, right?

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.890
Senpai's such a pervert.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:07.640
No, I want to draw <i>that</i>.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.130
<i>You aren't going to find an outfit 
that came from a drawing.</i>

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:21.360
<i>It's the Folding Screen Tiger strategy!</i>

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.180
I kind of feel bad about 
what I did the other day.

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:37.000
She offered to model for me.

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:52.300
<i>She actually found the outfit!</i>

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:59.460
I had the needlecraft club 
put it together for me.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.030
What do you think?

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:10.290
Say something!

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.290
You were the one who made me do this.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:16.760
I-It's not bad. I think.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.790
The fabric is well-done and stuff.

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:21.800
<i>That's</i> your compliment?

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:26.780
I mean... I think it looks good on you.

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:36.240
Creep! Creep! Creep! Creep! Creep!

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:43.780
Make me look sexy, Senpai.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.820
S-Sexy?

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:49.500
I-I'm just going to draw you normally.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.320
Paisen's beet red.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.460
Beet red!

00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.580
That's so hilarious.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.590
Oh, yeah, the culture festival 
starts next week.

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:00.160
Yeah.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.590
It does.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.260
My club's running a yakisoba stand.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:11.770
Yakisoba
<b>300 yen</b>

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:17.150
<b>Yakisoba</b>

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:17.150
<b>Swimming Club</b>

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:17.150
<b>Specialty!!</b>

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.020
Come and get it!

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:08.820
It's a specialty dish served by the

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.600
Kazehaya High School Swimming Club, 
with a twenty-year history.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.940
You aren't even a club member.

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:14.820
Shush.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.480
Helpers are members, too.

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:24.360
<b><b>Haunted House</b></b>

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.810
My class is doing a haunted house.

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:22.390
It's scary as hell.

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:24.360
Too scary even for Junji!

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:29.010
I think I'm going to be 
helping the gaming club.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.140
You mean the one from the dining hall?

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.430
You're still with that club, Sakura?

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:34.370
Yeah.

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:38.720
We all made up and decided 
to have fun together.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.380
I-I see.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.130
What's the art club doing for the festival?

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:51.890
The color's getting muddy there.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:53.510
Right.

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:58.080
Let it dry out and work on 
something else in the meantime.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.010
Okay.

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:00.080
Don't get lazy.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:00.900
O-Okay.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.490
That frame is tilted to the right.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:06.680
Fix it for me.

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.150
Okay.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:10.660
<b>Kazehaya High School Culture Festival</b>

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:13.660
<b>Art Club Exhibit</b>

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:12.320
That was good.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.660
It was.

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:17.660
Art
Club

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:16.740
We got a lot of visitors.

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:17.660
Yeah.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:23.920
<i>I think it turned out a lot better to look 
at since we followed the president's opinions.</i>

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.170
<i>She's pretty amazing.</i>

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:30.530
Well done.

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:33.380
We put together a good memory.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.520
We second-years are going to 
be studying for art school.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:41.560
We won't be showing up 
at the club for a while.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.900
I'm counting on you to 
take care of the art club.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:48.900
Okay.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.360
Senpai looks pensive.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.350
Gross.

00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:00.410
Right. The art festival.

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:04.840
I guess I'll probably do an art 
exhibit like we did last year.

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.420
So lame.

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:09.050
I bet no one's going to come.

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:10.640
That sounds boring.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.880
Gloomy!

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:15.180
I guess that suits you, though.

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:18.360
We'll help you out.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:22.160
Let's make it more hype.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.720
What do you mean, "more hype"?

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.860
Like...

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.680
Whack-a-Senpai!

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.860
Cackle, cackle, cackle!

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.860
Or...

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:35.310
Pop-up Senpai!

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.150
Cackle, cackle, cackle!

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.370
You're about the only ones 
who would enjoy that!

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.620
Something a bit easier to understand, then.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:45.750
Tea

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.820
A cat café.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.220
Here you go, meow.

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:49.790
H-Hey!

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:51.130
You're so close!

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.850
You're so red.

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:55.990
Paisen's really enjoying it.

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:57.420
Totally enjoying it!

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:58.640
I'm not!

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:03.180
Maybe the reverse works, too.

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:04.150
Reverse?

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:06.520
Like a drag café.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.010
Not happening!

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:09.370
That might kinda work.

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:10.240
It might work.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.650
I think it would be popular.

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:15.990
You might end up really popular, Senpai-kun.

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.990
Nope!

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:18.410
That's too creepy!

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:21.360
Maybe yes?

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.360
Yes!

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.400
No means no!

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.920
<i>Jeez, these girls...</i>

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:34.680
<i>Those footsteps!</i>

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.130
Stay in the next room for a while.

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:43.930
Hurry!

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.940
What for?

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:48.190
I'll explain later.

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:49.820
H-Hurry!

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.400
This is so annoying.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.850
It reeks of oil.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:54.800
Gross.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.300
Senpai's going to lock us up.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.830
N-No!

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.210
P-President...

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.890
What brings you here oday?

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:27.480
Does a club member need a 
reason to show up to the club?

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:29.730
No.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.700
That's gotta be his ex.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.180
There's no way!

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:36.070
Maybe he likes older women.

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:37.220
No!

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:37.840
Actually?

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.490
I said no!

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:45.500
I thought I'd do something 
for the culture festival.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.520
An exhibit again, right?

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.880
I've left you in charge of the art club.

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:54.260
It's up to you to decide.

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:58.200
I-I've been thinking of doing an exhibit.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.260
It'd be great if you could 
present something, President.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:13.130
There's another reason I came here today.

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:16.040
I've heard some unsavory rumors lately.

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:21.910
That the art club room has become a 
gathering place for some nasty characters.

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:28.650
I can't imagine that you'd 
invite people here to party.

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:32.420
But the club room is not 
a place for merrymaking!

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.230
The president's so scary.

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:39.880
Paisen's getting wrung out.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.190
Seems like it's our fault, though.

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:43.890
Sorry...

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.230
The student council's given me a warning.

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:53.110
I came to see how seriously 
you've been taking the art club.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.160
What is this, the manga club?

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:03.160
N-No...

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.910
I've been thinking that if you don't 
care to take the art club seriously...

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:10.670
<b>Club Termination Form</b>

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.670
I ought to shut down the club.

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:16.260
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:23.260
If not, I'll go submit this 
to the student council.

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.060
Wa...

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:27.810
Wait a second.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:40.820
Who are you?

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:43.000
W-Well...

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.300
She's a f-first-year who's 
been modeling for me.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.330
President...

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:51.080
Don't you think that's a bit selfish?

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:52.830
What?

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:57.000
You've neglected the club all this time.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.590
Now you show up out of nowhere 
just to shut it down?

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.020
Don't you think that's a bit much?

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:04.770
If the club members aren't
 taking the club seriously,

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.350
there is no reason to continue activities.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:10.660
You don't...

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:17.110
You don't know that he's 
not taking the club seriously.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.610
Senpai's been on his own.

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:22.860
Always...

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:27.050
Always...

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:32.740
Always...

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:38.260
drawing like a keener.

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:51.790
If you're so sure that he's 
been taking it seriously,

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.510
I'd like to see his work 
at the culture festival.

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:57.820
As an art club exhibit?

00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.440
No.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.970
I may have half-quit the art club,

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:07.380
but I'm still the president.

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:10.500
If you insist on going against me,

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:15.780
I'll have you put together your own
 exhibit separate from the club's.

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:20.710
<b>Kazehaya High School Award!</b>

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:20.710

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:20.710
<b>Cast your vote!!</b>

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.720
I won't shut down the club.

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:41.000
M-Me? Take on the president by myself?

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.220
I can't.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.990
You've got this.

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:50.670
Let's do it, Senpai.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.460
Points of improvement for today!

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:29.280
You look iffy in a maid outfit, Senpai!

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:30.240
That's your complaint?!

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.720
Welcome home, Master.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:33.550
Say it.

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:35.280
Th-That's a lot of talking.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:38.200
Welcome home, Master.

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.340
H-He did it!

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:40.030
Yes.
