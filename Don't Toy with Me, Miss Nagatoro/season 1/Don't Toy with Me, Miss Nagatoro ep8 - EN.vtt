00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.870
Yeesh.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.650
Your arms are so thin.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.880
No wonder you get shoved
around by girls, Senpai.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.650
Shut up.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.540
I know I'm a flimsy bean sprout.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.160
Look at Senpai,
feeling sorry for himself. Gross!

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.920
Don't be so down, though.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.420
Let's do some muscle training!

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.010
Really?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.340
Keep it up for a few months,

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.430
and you might go from
Bean Sprout Senpai to Daikon Senpai.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.320
Let's do it! Muscle training!

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.930
No.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:41.910
Too much work.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.690
You'd have to put up with a lot of pain,

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.690
doing push-ups and sit-ups and stuff.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.820
That's too much work.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.450
Man, you're such a loser, Senpai.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.950
I wouldn't mind doing it if there's training
you can do without moving, though.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.580
There is.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.760
First, get on all fours.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.790
What?

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.220
On all fours.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.580
On all fours.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.720
Fine! Fine!

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.730
Well? What now?

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.730
H-Hey!

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.490
Wh-What are you doing?!

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.490
Strength training that
doesn't require you to move.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.030
All you have to do is hold
still in this position.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.370
This isn't too much work, is it?

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.000
I'm pretty sure this isn't a thing.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.220
It's my original regimen.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.450
It should really work your triceps.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.570
Let's keep at it for ten minutes or so.

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.270
Your arms are already trembling.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.480
You've gotta hold on for at least five minutes.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.690
I-I can't!

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.470
My arms!

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.700
Senpai, you're so pitiful.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.950
I'll pull you along.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:26.570
Go!

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.000
Keep it up! Keep it up! Senpai!

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.500
Keep it up! Keep it up! Senpai!

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.000
Keep it up! Keep it up! Senpai!

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.920
Keep it up! Keep it up! Senpa...

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.990
...i...

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:05.870
DON'T TOY WITH ME,
MISS NAGATORO

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.390
<b>DON'T TOY WITH ME, MISS NAGATORO</b>

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:31.950

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.630
<i>I can't.</i>

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.190
<i>I'm so sleepy.</i>

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.500
<b>Gunpyou Yagura</b>

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.500
<i>The game that came out just
last week was so good,</i>

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.410
<i>I skipped studying for the tests
and gamed day in and day out.</i>

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.360
Senpai.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.710
Senpai.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.240
Senpai!

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.370
Are you studying properly?

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.760
Huh? What?

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.020
The midterms are coming up in four days.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.180
I-I think I'll be all right.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.340
I feel pretty good about it.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.720
Something's fishy.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.350
You've been gaming or something, haven't you?

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.910
Senpai, the fool who got hooked
on a game right before exams.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.790
As a result...

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.300
He fails!

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.550
And he does that every
time there are exams...

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.050
And he has to repeat the grade!

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.730
No way.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.550
I'd never have to repeat the grade.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.050
Are you okay with this?

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.200
Are you okay with repeating?

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.040
Are you?

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.100
Are you okay with repeating?

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.990
Hey, Senpai.

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.800
Hey, hey.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.800
Wh-Whatever.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.190
I wouldn't mind if that happened.

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.710
It'd just mean I have
another year of club work.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.700
Repeating might be okay.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.440
Don't you get it, Senpai?

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.700
If you repeat the grade...

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.460
when spring rolls around for
your repeated second-year...

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.630
we'll be in the same class.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.100
'Sup?

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.470
We're going to be in the
same class this year,

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.350
Ex-Senpai.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.850
For example, in English class...

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.140
You forgot your textbook again?

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.480
What do we do with you, Ex-Senpai?

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.240
Here, I'll share mine.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.120
Move your desk over.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.120
And in phys ed...

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.560
You're a lap behind!

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.730
Aren't you sad, being left in the
dust by a former underclassman?

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:50.630
Come on, Ex-Senpai!

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.640
And after school...

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.860
I can't figure this part out.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.190
Huh?

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.480
You can't, either, Ex-Senpai?

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.590
Isn't this your second time?

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.900
Get a grip, Ex-Senpai.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.400
That's hilarious.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.990
It might actually be fun, Ex-Senpai.

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:22.780
Yeah, it won't be boring,
at least, with you around.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.820
What was that creepy comment just now?!

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.800
I'm obviously kidding!

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.910
Why would I want to see your
gross face every morning?

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:39.560
That's too much grossness to handle.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.870
I don't want to repeat, either.

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:45.210
Yeah, yeah, so get studying!

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.280
Gross! Gross!

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.300
Gross! Gross!

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.570
Gross! Gross! Gross!

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.830
And so, Senpai has started
studying like crazy.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:04.560
Paisen's so desperate.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.050
Desperate!

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:10.090
You know, though, it'd be fun
to see Paisen in our year.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:11.440
Right?

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.340
Double time?

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.340
That's not going to happen.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:18.120
And they say that what happens
twice happens a third time, so...

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.860
Paisen would repeat twice.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:21.910
He could.

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:22.850
Triple?!

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:24.730
No way!

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.730
If you had to do it three times...

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:31.860
That would make us your senpai, Paisen.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.870
<b>Upperclassmen</b>

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.740
Come on, Ex-Senpai! Massage me.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:47.250
Yes, ma'am.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.720
My muscles are aching from club work.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.290
Oi, over here.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:53.760
Y-Yes, ma'am!

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:55.620
They're stiff, aren't they?

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.370
Don't half-ass it.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:58.210
Yes, ma'am.

00:08:58.210 --> 00:08:59.290
Me, too!

00:08:59.290 --> 00:08:59.760
Yes, ma'am.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.140
That's the spot.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.150
Touch me in the wrong spot,
and I'll punch you.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:04.770
Yes, ma'am.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.770
Ex-Senpai, buy me an red bean bun.

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:12.150
Buy me those mushroom snacks.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:15.530
Buy me those crunchy panda snacks.

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:17.000
Be back in three minutes.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.360
Yes, ma'am!

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:19.940
You're paying for them
if you're even a second late.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.030
You're paying!

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:29.290
Why would you buy chunky red bean?!

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:34.050
I obviously want my red bean buns smooth!

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:36.340
I said <i>mushrooms!</i>

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.780
Why'd you go and buy bamboo sprouts?!

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:40.190
Pandas!

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:42.780
Not koalas!

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:46.560
Yum.

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:54.900
Oh, man!

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.400
<i>I should study.</i>

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.740
Senpai-kun.

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:05.070
You don't have to worry.

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:09.790
English

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:09.810
We're all doing make-up exams,
except Toro-chan.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:17.380
We might be more likely
to repeat than you.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:18.860
Later.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.840
Guys, stop worrying about me and go study.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.310
I don't have make-up exams.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.680
Help us study, Paisen.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.920
Help us.

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.290
You did pretty well.

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:44.950
I worked hard.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:49.270
Are you <i>that</i> much against
becoming my classmate?

00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:00.970
<b>Baby boba!</b>

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:10.940
<b></b>Let's Play Rock-Paper-Scissors, <b>Senpai</b> ! !

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:10.340
We can't have Hayacchi seeing you like this.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.450
H-Hey, wait!

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:17.730
It's fine. You want to
feel better, don't you?

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.700
You always do this on
your own, don't you?

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.000
Yeah!

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.740
B-But having someone else do it
for me s-seems a bit scary...

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.420
Don't worry. She'll be gentle.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:32.850
Gentle!

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:35.540
Okay, you're going to feel a touch.

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.130
H-Hey, wait...

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:39.600
Stay still, Paisen.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.390
Waiâ€”

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:46.760
Come on. Stop squirming.
I'm trying to be gentle.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.820
B-But...

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.560
Just shut up and let yourself go, Paisen.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.180
Body and soul!

00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:01.000
Aw, you moved so much that
my hand's in a weird position.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.730
B-But if you hold it like that...

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:05.630
Quit resisting!

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:07.490
B-But any more and I'm going to...

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:11.560
Don't worry. You'll feel so much
better when you get it all out.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.870
B-But wait, no...

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.250
Stop!

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.740
H-Hey, we were just...

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:38.020
We just thought we'd help
him pull out this splinter.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.200
You're nice, aren't you, Senpai?

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.220
Wh-What brought that up?

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.980
You don't mind carrying a cute girl's stuff,

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:16.600
even if it's not that heavy.

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:20.610
I-I was just passing by, and she asked me.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:21.680
Here.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:25.240
The stacked ones looked pretty heavy.

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:28.740
Who wouldn't help carry stuff?

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.180
Okay...

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:32.740
Carry mine, too, then.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.000
Why would you say that?

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:38.140
Fine.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.520
Let's play rock-paper-scissors, then.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.490
Wha?

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:44.530
The loser has to carry the winner's bag.

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:46.270
Up to the three-way ahead.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:48.010
What are we, in elementary school?

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:50.270
Start with rock.

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:51.540
Rock, paper, scissors...

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:52.400
Wait...

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.820
Shoot!

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.970
<i>She did this to herself.</i>

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.860
<i>I haven't done anything wrong.</i>

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.040
<i>Yet I can't help but feel guilty.</i>

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.100
It must be pretty easy for you,

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:27.620
having a younger girl carry your stuff home.

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:30.050
We can switch if you're getting tired.

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:31.100
It's fine.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.800
This is what I get for losing.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.860
Next, we're going up to the four-way.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:43.820
W-We're still doing this?

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:50.070
<i>I have a feeling I'll be
in trouble if I win twice.</i>

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:52.510
Start with rock.

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:58.330
Rock... Paper... Scissors...

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:07.040
Shoot!

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:17.770
I win!

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:22.680
<i>I guess I'm trying to be considerate.</i>

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.650
Man, this is so easy.

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:30.610
Heavy.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:35.040
This is perfect for you, though, isn't it?

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:35.870
How?

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:39.340
You know how it is in manga and stuff...

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:43.200
You're always carrying
heavy stuff around, and...

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:46.810
Time to show you my true potential.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.360
Now...

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:01.270
I can fight at full strength!

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:08.200
You know how they get really strong?

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.860
Who are you fighting?!

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:18.830
This is our last one.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.330
<i>No more being considerate!</i>

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.630
Start with rock.

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.520
Rock, paper, scissors...

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:26.630
Scissors!

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:29.220
Yay!

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:30.750
All right, then.

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.220
Give me your bag.

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:34.760
No, don't worry about my bag.

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:37.100
Instead...

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.970
I'm your luggage.

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:41.830
What are you doing?!

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:44.480
What if someone sees us?

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:46.440
It's all right.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.860
There aren't that many people around here.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:50.610
B-But...

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.240
Come on. Let's go!

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:05.370
Senpai, you're beet red.

00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:09.590
Have you never carried a girl before?

00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:12.490
G-Gee, who knows?

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:14.990
"Gee, who knows?"

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:16.540
Hear that?!

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:19.070
Of course you haven't!

00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:20.580
Look at you, trying to look cool!

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:23.120
Gross! Gross! Gross!

00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:24.220
Hey! hold still!

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.650
Okay.

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:32.530
<i>So heavy...</i>

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.100
<i>I mean...</i>

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:38.940
<i>Considering everything that's on me...</i>

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.910
<i>Worse than that, though...</i>

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:47.510
<i>Crap...</i>

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:49.920
<i>I'm going to drop her!</i>

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.220
U-Uh... Sorry...

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:03.970
I'm going this way.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:14.200
<i>Did I upset her?</i>

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:44.470
I'm gaming. What kinda game?
A dating sim? It's a fighting game!

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:47.140
You're so creepy, Senpai
I'm going to bed

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:49.890
See you tomorrow, Senpai

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:51.650
Thanks for holding my stuff
What are you up to right now?
Are you all by yourself, doing nasty things?

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:51.650
<i>Nasty!</i>

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:56.180
<i>I'm doing my homework.</i>

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:59.930
<i>Yeah? Okay, pop quiz time.</i>

00:18:56.650 --> 00:19:03.660
I'm doing homework.
Yeah? Okay, pop quiz time.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.100
<i>What am I doing right now?</i>

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:08.660
<i>Watching TV or something?</i>

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.100
<i>Wrong.</i>

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:14.670
Nagatoro

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:22.680
The answer is...

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:25.520
Taking a bath!

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.480
You freak out so much.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.690
I-I-I-I'm n-not f-f-freaking out!

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:40.160
<i>Lies.</i>

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.910
<i>Your voice was totally freaked out.</i>

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:47.330
<i>Was that too much for a virgin like you?</i>

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:51.150
I-It wasn't too much of anything!

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:52.210
I only hear your voice.

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:55.400
You probably have a really
strong imagination.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:59.960
I bet you see me naked
in your head right now.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.060
I don't see anything!

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:04.960
I'm busy studying right now.

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:06.870
Oh, no!

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:10.400
Senpai's defiling me in his mind.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.480
<i>I'm not doing that!</i>

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.450
Senpai, you pervert!

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:18.360
I'm not a pervert!

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.980
<i>Mega-perv, then!</i>

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:21.840
<i>Stay calm.</i>

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.990
<i>Stay calm, stay calm.</i>

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:25.680
<i>Stay calm.</i>

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.320
<i>Don't let Nagatoro take control.</i>

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:38.880
<i>She turned on her camera?!</i>

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.480
You're freaking out too much, Senpai.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:48.670
Did you see me naked with your
overwhelming power of imagination?

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:50.900
<i>I-I saw...</i>

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:53.340
<i>Y-You're on v-video!</i>

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:20.100
A-All I saw was from your shoulders up.

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.440
I didn't see anything else,
so it's okay, I guess...

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.750
I guess it's not really for me to
decide if it was okay or not...

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.260
<i>S-Sorry.</i>

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.270
Y-You don't need to apologize.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:38.440
It wasn't a big deal for me.

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:27.270
Points of improvement for today.

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:29.980
Too bad you didn't get to
have Sakura do it for you.

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:31.790
It was just a splinter.

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:34.410
You were making some really
nasty voices, though.

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:37.720
I was glad I had you do it, though.

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:38.790
Nasty!

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:48.790
The splinter, I mean!
