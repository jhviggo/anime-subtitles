00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:03.980
Wake up.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.340
Wake up, Senpai-kun.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.990
You're finally awake.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.980
Wh-Where am I?

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.080
This is Chichibu Nagatoro.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.820
Congratulations.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.440
You have been chosen to be
the savior of this world.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.860
What?

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.160
Who are you?

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.320
Savior?

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.000
What are you talking about?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
There's a really bad demon lord on the loose.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.760
Things are looking pretty bad.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.820
Help us.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.710
Sorry, but I don't have any suitable powers.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.660
Sniff, sniff...

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.370
Wow!

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.480
You're qualified to become a great wizard.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.720
A great wizard?

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.570
Yup.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.730
You have a unique skille
called "Virgin for Life."

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.460
I'm not happy about that at all.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.280
So, anyway, here.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.900
Wh-What do I do with this?

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.990
Quit grumbling and go help us!

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.610
Off you go.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.850
DON'T TOY WITH ME,
MISS NAGATORO

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.370
<b>DON'T TOY WITH ME, MISS NAGATORO</b>

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:32.060
<b></b>You're a Wimp, <b>Senpai</b>â™¥

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.460
What do I do?

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.990
I don't even know how to use magic!

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.340
Was that magic just now?

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.110
Wh-Where am I?

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.120
G-Go away!

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.460
Damn it!

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.380
Did that do it?

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.390
I-It didn't work.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.770
Nekotoro's on the scene!

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:30.850
Nagatoro?

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.890
It's <i>Nekotoro</i>.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.110
Wh-What?

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.470
You seem kind of flimsy.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.490
I feel bad for you, so I'll
stick around for a while.

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.580
Come on. We have to get going.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.490
We're going on an adventure to
defeat the demon lord. Let's go!

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.150
H-How do you know about that?

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.250
It's common sense!

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.780
Here I go, Senpai.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.270
R-Right.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:48.380
Look out!

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.330
Senpai...

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.430
Let's counterattack.

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:25.500
All right!

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.280
Senpai, that was badass.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.810
N-No, I just...

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.410
Let's keep going until we
beat the demon lord, Senpai.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:17.420
D-Do you think we can?

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.350
Of course we can, as long as we're together.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.450
Ow, ow...

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:24.350
You kicked me so hard.

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:33.180
Gamo-chan.

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:39.800
I see.

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.580
She'd been turned into a monster by magic.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.520
The demon lord might be tough,
but if three of us join forces...

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:46.630
Not three.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:47.800
Four.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.630
Four?

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:03.140
Yoshi hatches!

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:07.440
Uh...

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.320
Looks like the demon lord's not here.

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:53.720
She is.

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:18.070
Ta-da.

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:20.340
I'm Demon Lord Magatoro.

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.850
Demon Lord Magagamo.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:29.850
Demon Lord Magayoshi here.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.390
You're not getting out of here alive, Senpai.

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:43.840
Y-You tricked me!

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.630
"You tricked me!" he says.

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:48.160
What a wimp.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.620
What a wimp.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.630
Damn it!

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:58.630
No...

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:08.070
Did you think I was in love
with you or something?

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:11.400
Because I kissed you on the cheek?

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.930
Ew, what a creep.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:19.940
What kind of woman would fall
for a creepy loser like you?

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:20.900
Yeah!

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.510
Give me a break, Senpai.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:31.420
<i>I never should have opened up
to the likes of her.</i>

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:38.840
You're going to be our toy forever, Senpai.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.430
You'd better make it fun.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.250
Hey, it's Senpai.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.100
'Sup, Senpai?!

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:06.870
'Sup...

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.850
What are you doing here?

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:11.730
My summer homework.

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:13.620
Why are you hiding it?

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.250
No reason!

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.480
What a poser, doing homework
at a family restaurant.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.940
Poser!

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.460
Senpai!

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:37.400
What's this?

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.980
What is this?

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:43.120
I-I don't know!

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.280
It's not mine!

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.520
These are definitely your drawings, Senpai.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:48.720
N-No, they aren't!

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.890
What's this? Cat ears?

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:52.410
Is this me?!

00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.220
I said...

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.550
it's not!

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.900
I'm taking this notebook, then.

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:10.290
D-Don't!

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:31.990
<b>Senpai</b>! Let's Go to the Beach!!

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:32.630
<i>It's blazing hot today, and the
beach is bustling with people.</i>

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:37.170
<i>It's summer break. You gotta hit the beach!</i>

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.920
<i>It's hot, but beaches are the best.</i>

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.280
<i>I know, right?</i>

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.200
<i>Right?</i>

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:43.460
<i>Right?</i>

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:46.520
No way.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.940
The beach in the summer?

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.750
Thank goodness for air conditioning.

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:52.720
Calling

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:52.720
Nagatoro

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:58.230
H-Hello?

00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:59.330
<i>Senpai!</i>

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:04.420
<i>I bet you're wasting your summer
watching TV and eating an ice pop.</i>

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:06.220
Wh-What do you want?

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:10.240
<i>Summer's going to be over before you know it,
and you'll have done nothing.</i>

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:19.540
<i>In light of that, let's go to the beach!</i>

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:32.460
Senpai!

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.470
Over here.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.470
Wow, Paisen actually showed up.

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:38.640
That's hilarious.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.480
Her friends are here, too.

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:46.480
Man, you're the last person I'd
expect to see on the summer beach.

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:47.550
Out of place!

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:48.520
Out of place!

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.120
Shut up.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.050
Nah, not necessarily.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:57.330
Senpai would be like those things
scuttling around the rocks.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:58.690
Sea lice!

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:01.500
Cackle! Cackle!

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.280
Hear that? Sea Louse Paisen.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.840
Sea Louse Senpai!

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.510
Who are you calling a sea louse?

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:11.560
Oh, my bad.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.390
Sea lice live in groups.

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:15.760
Unlike loners like you, Senpai.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:18.560
You're one of the odd ones out.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.820
Loner sea louse!

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:21.770
Cackle! Cackle!

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:23.340
Loner Louse Senpai!

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:24.420
Loner Louse!

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:27.520
Loner Louse! Loner Louse!

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.030
<i>They're so excited.</i>

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:33.720
<i>Maybe coming close to the beach
brings out their popular kid spirit.</i>

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.530
Loner Louse!

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.100
Splash!

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:46.080
<i>I'm actually here.</i>

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.090
<i>The beach in summer.</i>

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:53.860
There we go.

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:03.440
What are you looking at, Paisen?

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.260
I-I'm not looking!

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:09.240
Don't you think that's a bit too
much ogling, even for a virgin?

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.440
Ogling!

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.570
N-No! I'm not...

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.070
What?

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:17.680
I couldn't hear you.

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:19.800
Boo!

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:23.580
He's, like, "Uwah!"

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:25.030
So funny.

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:26.820
I-I'm going to buy drinks.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.840
Get me something, too.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.180
Me, too.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:31.790
Senpai.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.850
Something for me, too.

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:43.340
R-Right.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.320
All right, let's swim.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.130
Swim! Swim!

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:55.360
Come on, Senpai! Let's swim.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.870
I-I'm not swimming.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.200
What?!

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:05.360
Yup, he's definitely...

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.020
<i>...a loner sea louse.</i>

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.380
Go, go, both of you!

00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:24.390
Hayacchi wins!

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:29.090
Yeah!

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.470
Damn it!

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:33.880
You didn't actually think you'd
beat a swim club member, did you?

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.040
You're just filling in.

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.400
I'll race you, too.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.410
All right, it's on.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.180
Let him be.

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:45.790
He wants to be a loner louse.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.290
<i>What the hell am I doing?</i>

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:54.300
<i>This is a hangout for popular kids.</i>

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.300
<i>There's nothing good about being outside.</i>

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.950
What's up, Senpai?

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:06.020
I'm sketching.

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:10.310
Hey, do you not know how to swim?

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:11.540
W-Well...

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:14.010
I can swim, kinda.

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.320
I just hate how it hurts
when you get sunburned.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.360
That's true.

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.610
You're a pale bean sprout.

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:22.080
Who are you calling a bean sprout?!

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.830
Don't worry about sunburn, though.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.760
I'll put some sunscreen on you, Senpai.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.580
I-It's fine!

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:36.090
Hey, you <i>did</i> bring your swimsuit.

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.840
It's only just in case!

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.980
This <i>is</i> that case.

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:47.310
Okay, lie down flat.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:48.900
<i>This is bad.</i>

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.860
<i>She's going to put sunscreen on me, and...</i>

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.360
S-Stop!

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.860
She's dragging me into the water!

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.380
It's okay.

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:10.530
I'll put it on gently.

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:11.870
W-Wait!

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:16.880
Isn't that s-something you do
with someone you're dating?

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:23.060
Y-You and I aren't like that.

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:27.190
Besides, if the kids from school found out,

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:28.890
they're going to give you hell, too.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.890
You're right.

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:35.700
We aren't dating or anything.

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:46.380
I guess I'll put it on rough.

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:47.880
Wh-What are you...

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:54.420
You deserve to be treated rough, Senpai.

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:05.530
You look so pathetic, Senpai.

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:11.010
What?

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:13.690
N-Nothing, it just looked kind of fun.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.850
I'm not having fun.

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:17.150
Are you sure?

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:22.970
Stop that!

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:24.200
Oh, come on.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.200
Come on!

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:27.290
I said, no!

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:29.880
Why not? Just a little.

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:30.770
Just a little!

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:31.820
No!

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.310
He's going to break.

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:36.960
Just get off of me, already!

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:41.060
We used up the whole bottle.

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:45.470
That should be enough for Bean Sprout Senpai.

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:49.720
Come on, Senpai. Now that you're
all set, we're going swimming.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.990
See you.

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:50.770
See you.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.470
Hey!

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.690
Paisen's floating.

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:58.460
I thought he'd sink.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:01.990
It's easier to float in
seawater than freshwater.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.680
I see.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:20.880
So tired.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.060
There!

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:26.380
<i>They're so full of energy.</i>

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.390
<i>Senpai, did you get sunburned?</i>

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:35.870
Not with all that sunscreen.

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:39.030
It's the muscle aches that are killing me.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.400
<i>You're out of shape, Senpai.</i>

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.360
<i>What did you think, though?</i>

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.830
<i>Wasn't it fun being on
the beach in the summer?</i>

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:49.410
Y-Yeah.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.750
For a change, I guess.

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:28.000
Points of improvement for today.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.550
You're that mage.

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.640
Senpai-kun, let me tell you a secret.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:33.840
What secret?

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:38.120
Stay at this inn, and you'll
attain "Virgin for Life EX."

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.420
That's an upgrade!
