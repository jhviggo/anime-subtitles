00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.820
I'm still the president of the art club.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.760
If you insist on going against me...

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.750
I'll have you put together your 
own exhibit separate of the club.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.750
She really did sound scripted.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.120
Right?

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.510
Everything she said sounded so fake.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.940
The club room is not a place for merrymaking!

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.090
Is not!

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.510
Don't talk down about the president too much.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.420
Check it out! 
Paisen's defending the president!

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.480
So she <i>is</i> his previous girl.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.410
Your ex?!

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.520
No!

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.530
You have to admit that we were the ones...

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.900
who were in the wrong.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.730
Did you hear that? He said "we."

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.780
He's lumping us in with him.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.600
Together!

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.570
Ew.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.790
Gross.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.710
This is getting fun, though, with your 
battle with the the president and all that.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.790
You only say that because 
it's not your problem.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.970
So, what do you think your odds are?

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.830
Zero.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.970
There isn't the slightest chance 
I'm going to beat the president.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.560
You're as negative as ever.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.190
Although, if you don't want to go up against 
her alone, I wouldn't' mind helping.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.530
She's right.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.570
I hate to say it, but it's an 
art club exhibit, isn't it?

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.440
You could always just do a kitty 
cat cosplay art café or something.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.070
Meow!

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.870
I'm sure you'll win.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.200
Right?

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.830
You're underestimating the president.

I think we ranked around 11th.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.740
That's not it.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.740
The president's been winning
 all kinds of competitions.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:46.510
<b>Winner</b>

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.900
She was one of the top contenders in a 
competition that included college students.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.850
She's just really amazing.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:52.640
I see.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.760
He sounds like a cultist.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.830
President cultist.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:55.750
Presidentist!

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.790
I get that the president's amazing, 
but at the end of the day,

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.290
they're just drawings, aren't they?

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.010
How could it be so popular?

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.250
W-Well...

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.920
You could say I had a bit of a different 
take than what the president was expecting.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:17.710
Found it.

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:18.970
Found what?

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.210
The painting the president did last year.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.820
This is the president?

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.530
Y-Yeah.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.040
Muh...

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.470
Muh...

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:33.540
Muh?

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.040
The president is standing 
next to her own piece, right?

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.630
Well, damn, no wonder it was popular.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.940
Sixth place for sure.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.550
She's going to kill some virgins.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.010
So you've been keeping this 
nasty drawing, huh, Senpai?

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.050
N-No!

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.500
This is nothing but a piece of art!

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.810
I-It's not nasty!

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.300
Stare...

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.070
It won an award in a famous exhibition, even.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.780
Th-That's why the school 
allowed it. Because it's art.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.650
I don't care about that.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.330
What do <i>you</i> think of it, Senpai?

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.020
I just think it's amazing.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.450
Amazingly hot?

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:16.320
No!

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.380
A solid foundation of life drawing skills! 
A masterful command of the oil medium!

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.730
A perfect sense of composition!

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.900
And a selfless commitment to art!

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.340
It's amazing for all those reasons!

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.270
Are you sure?

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.800
He's hilariously desperate.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.640
You're way too sus.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.890
Super sus!

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.350
You're just going to have to draw something 
amazing to compete with her, Paisen.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.860
Sure.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.000
I wouldn't mind modeling for you.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.200
If you <i>really</i> insist, 
I wouldn't mind wearing my swimsuit.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.860
No way!

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.730
I don't stand a chance!

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:49.960
Yeah, right.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.360
You really want to draw 
something pervy, don't you?

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.620
Th-That's not the point.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.130
What, then?

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.130
I'm just not confident that I can
 draw anything that can compete

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.880
with quality of the president's work.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.880
That's all.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:06.880
He's right. He can't.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:09.970
She's way ahead.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.350
She's got more to work with.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:19.900
Excuse me?

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.530
Don't get so upset.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.950
I'm just talking in terms of what sells.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.120
I'm not dissing you, Hayacchi.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.490
You are dissing me.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.470
No, I mean, there's definitely 
a market for slender girls.

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.820
But you're modeling for 
a piece for the masses.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.250
And especially if there's going 
to be a popularity ranking...

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.880
Shaky, shaky!

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.840
Power is might!

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.240
You just don't have enough power, you know?

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.000
Shaky, shaky!

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.040
Just look at the president's figure.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.000
Her boobs.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.880
Her ass.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.000
And her slim waist.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.510
She's got insane curves.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:57.140
You need power to win a battle.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.230
Justice!

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:03.000
Being a little cute is no match
 for overwhelming power.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.280
But a speck in the dust.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.410
How insignificant you are.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:09.520
Just scum.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.780
Just trash.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.530
Th-That's uncalled for!

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.380
I don't think less of Nagatoro 
than I do the president.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:25.790
The president has her charms, 
and Nagatoro has hers.

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:29.120
Well? Well?

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:29.870
Did you hear that?

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.230
That's coming from an actual virgin!

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:33.790
Apologize!

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:35.080
Sure, sure, sorry.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:35.840
Sorry.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.810
Sorry.

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.530
Jeez, you could just be more honest.

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.310
I just meant that as someone 
who knows about art.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:45.110
Still, though, you don't have enough power.

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:46.680
Like, you don't have impact.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.820
Maybe a nude, I guess.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.800
Th-That won't do!

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.070
Cosplay, then?

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.100
I don't have any costumes.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.620
What do you think?

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.830
Costumes galore!

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.160
Damn.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.710
Where did you get all this?

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:03.580
I borrowed it from the needlecraft club.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.860
I-I bet you like this one.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.280
Like what?

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.560
Clothes you can't see if you're a virgin.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:12.590
I can't draw that!

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:15.130
Well, good luck.

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:19.130
If you don't beat the president, 
the club's shutting down.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.620
<i>I have to beat the president, 
or the club's shutting down.</i>

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:35.100
<i>But how do I beat her?</i>

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.120
This is going to be brutal.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.380
Hey, officer!

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.770
There's a suspicious creeper over here!

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:08.980
Wait! Stop it!

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:10.580
He's defiling a high school 
girl with his eyes!

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.830
Are you sure that's going to cut it, though?

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.290
Can you really compete with the aggression 
of her sexy art with that plain drawing?

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.290
But I think the everyday is fine.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.200
Don't worry.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:40.250
I'll make sure you win, Senpai.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.810
What do you think?

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.330
Yeah.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.230
You aren't making any progress.

00:09:59.050 --> 00:09:59.820
Sorry.

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:02.400
I couldn't figure out the composition.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:04.630
It's okay.

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:06.060
Let's move on.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:12.160
Are you done drawing?

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.340
Yeah, kinda.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.640
You took plenty of time.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.950
I mean, cosplay is...

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:24.970
All right.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.480
If nothing else works...

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.480
How's this?

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.040
Y-Yeah...

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.230
You're still being iffy.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:39.990
How much do I have to undress?

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:41.950
'Sup?

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:44.340
Oh, man.

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:45.680
Sexy.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.970
Wow!

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.000
You might actually beat 
the president with this.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.120
The angel's cleavage!

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:55.750
Hey!

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:56.470
What a huge rack!

00:10:56.470 --> 00:11:00.970
An eye for an eye, lewds for lewds!

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:03.150
Stop it! Jeez!

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:04.760
Sorry.

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.710
I really think she can just be her usual self.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.890
Huh? What are you talking about?

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.640
Look at how much effort 
Hayacchi's putting in for you.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.430
You're just asking for misfortune.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:18.400
Sorry, I'm done with that kind of thing.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:21.660
What are you doing, then?

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:24.370
Well...

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:26.410
You're going to lose, you know?

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.160
If you don't care to take 
the art club seriously...

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.420
<b>Club Termination Form</b>

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:34.420
I ought to shut down the club.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.950
Sorry, but I'm going to 
draw on my own this time.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.430
If I get Nagatoro involved in a 
competition and lose horribly,

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:49.000
it's going to humiliate Nagatoro, too.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.750
I'm not bothered by that.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:52.690
No.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.190
This is between me and the president.

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:00.190
Fine.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.450
It's president this, president that...

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.900
Why don't you just have 
the president model, then?

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.640
Uh-oh.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.120
She left dressed like that.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.120
She'll find somewhere to get changed.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.460
Okay, let's go, guys.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.400
Senpai, you loser.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.420
Loser!

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:37.980
<b>DON'T TOY WITH ME,
MISS NAGATORO</b>

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:47.990
<b></b>You Could Be More Honest, <b>Senpai</b>♥

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.750
Art Room #1

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.750
(Second and first-years enter through other door)

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:52.750
What's this?

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.860
<i>She's splitting up our 
working area, too, huh?</i>

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:05.760
<i>The president sure is quick to act.</i>

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:09.150
<i>I don't want to lose the club.</i>

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:10.760
<i>I gotta do what I can.</i>

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.520
<i>Time to give it a shot.</i>

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.550
That's a dull piece you're working on.

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:45.870
P-President!

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.820
And why are you dressed like that?!

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:52.560
I was taking pictures for my new piece.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.440
Is it no good?

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.110
Yeah, it's no good.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:06.000
When you're presenting to a large audience,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.070
it's not the practice, but the piece.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:12.290
What is the most important thing for a piece?

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.830
Um...

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.320
A theme, I guess?

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.460
No.

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:22.960
Love.

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:24.210
<i>Love?!</i>

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.030
That's a big one.

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:34.470
The only passion you have in this piece 
is to make it look nice and tidy.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:38.680
Hey...

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.460
How are you doing—

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.990
No, the president's not modeling!

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.020
She's just here to check on me!

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:06.840
After her!

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.760
Art is thus to pursue!

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:14.890
Don't lose her!

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:21.140
<i>The president's talking 
way over my head, but...</i>

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:27.380
<i>Nagatoro...</i>

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.470
Nagatoro!

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:52.430
What do you want?

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:58.990
<i>I chased her down, 
but what am I supposed to say?</i>

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:02.710
<i>No, what am I even trying to do?</i>

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:05.360
Hey, it's Hayacchi.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.690
Hey.

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:08.080
'Sup?

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.440
Oh, are you two busy?

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.450
Is he hitting on you?

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:14.450
No.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.630
He's a creepy stalker.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.500
N-No!

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:22.520
Bleah!

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.050
Should we tell a teacher?

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:27.840
Y-Yeah...

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:30.200
<i>Damn her!</i>

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.260
I'm a first-year.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.160
Are you a second-year?

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.720
Y-Yeah.

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:44.660
You're my senpai, then.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.260
Call me Nagatoro from now on.

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:53.900
Let's get to know each other, Senpai.

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:56.150
G-Get off me.

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.530
Nope.

00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:01.450
You're my prey now, Senpai.

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:12.960
Y-You're not going to get anything 
good out of connecting with me.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.510
I don't think that's true.

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:28.520
If there's somewhere you 
want to go with someone,

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.980
you could always try asking them.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.590
What's this? What is this?

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.310
See you, Senpai.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.240
Nagatoro.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.000
Hey.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.220
I still think...

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.180
Nagatoro! Please!

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.390
I want you to model for me.

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:58.280
Have the president do it.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.390
N-No, I want to draw...

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:05.610
Just go make some nasty art of the president!

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.640
I want to draw you!

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:30.580
Just the way you always are!

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.520
Why me?

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.820
And what do you mean, 
"the way you always are"?

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:43.100
Because the way you always are...

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:47.330
is what's the most attractive to me.

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:54.830
Seriously, Senpai...

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.040
You're a creep!

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:25.220
You creep!

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:03.340
How's it going?

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:04.630
Is it going to turn out good?

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:11.730
Yeah, pretty good.

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:12.970
Really?

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:17.280
I don't really get it, though.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.380
What's so great about my usual self?

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:23.900
I still recommend some flashy cosplay.

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:31.040
That's good, too, but so are things 
you notice in ordinary times.

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.300
Like what?

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:35.690
Like how cute you are.

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:52.650
What?

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:54.540
What did you say just now?

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:55.680
N-No, I...

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:57.130
C? C?

00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:57.600
Cu?

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.680
N-N-Nothing!

00:22:58.770 --> 00:22:59.670
Cu?

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:02.250
Nothing!

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:03.560
Cu?

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.690
Nothing!

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.550
I see.

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.730
I understand your position.

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:19.180
Either way, we'll make a decision 
on the day of the event.

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.510
Points of improvement for today.

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:29.590
The next one's the last one, Senpai.

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:31.340
I'll finally be free.

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:32.500
Are you happy?

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:35.380
Are you happy that you'll be free from me?

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:36.430
No...

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:38.350
I think I'm sad.

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:39.980
Senpai, you're a creep.
