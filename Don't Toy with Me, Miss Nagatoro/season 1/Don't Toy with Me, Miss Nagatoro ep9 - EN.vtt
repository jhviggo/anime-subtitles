00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.230
What are you doing?

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.940
Shadow boxing.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.970
I've been hooked on boxing ever 
since you lent me that Ippo show.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.080
<i>I probably shouldn't have showed her that.</i>

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.840
Senpai...

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.860
Be my sparring partner!

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.350
I-I can't box!

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.140
It's fine!

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.040
You just have to stand there.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.560
Like a punching bag?!

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.360
Boxers aren't supposed to 
hit anyone outside the ring.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.640
I know that.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.560
I'll stop right before I hit you.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.700
Like this!

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.970
Come on. You can hit me back.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.540
What am I supposed to do?!

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.560
Come on, come on!

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.220
Senpai!

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.540
H-Hey! You're h-hitting me!

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.290
S-Sorry!

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.990
<i>Sh-She's going to beat me to death.</i>

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.330
Of course you would put me in a 
clinch right off the bat, Senpai.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.140
So that happened.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.840
Who does he think he is, 
putting me in a clinch?

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.970
It's so creepy, it's hilarious.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.580
Clinch!

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.970
So skeevy.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.540
Huh?

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.070
The clinch is a perfectly 
fine fighting technique.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.980
Still, it's pervy.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.430
I want to give him the clinch, too!

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.860
I don't know about clinching...

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.930
but I might want to try pinning him.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.370
I give! I give!

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.190
Pinning isn't a thing in boxing.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.120
Just a little!

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.120
No!

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.880
All right, let's go spar with Paisen.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.220
Sparring!

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.380
Yay!

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.980
Hold it!

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:38.880
What's wrong?

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.890
You're not supposed to hit 
anyone outside the ring.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.680
Um, what about you?

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.900
I know how to hold back.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.660
I'll hold back, too.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.250

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.500
Senpai, run away!

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.840
Paisen! Let's spar!

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.750
Clinch!

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.880
Pincer!

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.630
Wha?!

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.820
Senpai, I'll take care of this!

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.880
Wanna go?

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.470
Go, go!

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.480
<i>She sounds badass, but...</i>

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.590
<i>I bet this was her fault, wasn't it?</i>

Seriously?!

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.140
A nude! A nude!

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.020
Let me see.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.000
I'm buck naked!

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.320
Put some clothes on me.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.110
But it's art.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.460
It's Senpai!

<i>is being occupied.</i>

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.010
Why'd you come to my club 
room just to make a racket?

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.510
Well, we usually hang out
 in the dining hall,

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.010
but there's been this annoying 
group lately that won't shut up.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.770
Hey, could you keep it down a bit?

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.920
Sure, sure.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.660
There.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:22.780
Bam.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.120
They pretend to listen, 
then they go right back to it.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.080
They're so annoying.

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.790
So we decided to chill here instead.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.290
This is the art room!

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.540
I'm surprised, though.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.920
I didn't think you'd back 
down without a fight.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.880
I thought you would have 
made them shut up.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.100
You don't get it, Senpai.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.280
There's a better way to handle 
it than doing it directly.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.440
Yup.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.440
A better way?

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.460
We sent in a saboteur.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.080
Dude, why wouldn't you save?!

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.200
Why would I?

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.320
Hey, hey...

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.710
What are you guys up to?

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.600
Gaming?

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.710
Teach me! Teach me!

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.430
Wow!

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.560
You're too good at teaching.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.970
N-Nah, I'm not, really.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.520
You're so good.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.250
Let's play by ourselves sometime.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.910
Sure, I guess.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:42.860
You're so awesome.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.530
I think I might fall for you.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.590
Y-Yeah?

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.500
Hey, hey, are you in a relationship?

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.260
N-No, I'm not.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:08:00.250
Give it a week, and the group will implode!

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.950
Then we'll be back in the dining hall.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.130
So don't worry, Paisen.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.620
Men are pitiful creatures, always at
 the mercy of their own horniness.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.630
So sad!

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.350
<i>I need to make sure I never 
get on their bad side.</i>

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.340
Senpai doesn't seem horny, though.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.230
He's the very picture of an herbivore.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:26.400
A sheep?!

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.480
Nah.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.080
Senpai's horny as hell.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:37.140
He gets all red as soon as you 
tease him even just a little.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.240
Wh-What are you...

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:42.540
Senpai, want me to kiss you?

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:44.430
Wh-What...

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:45.890
Just kidding.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.370
See?

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.860
He's beet red thinking 
I was about to kiss him!

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:56.180
Senpai's such a closet perv.

00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:00.930
Nah, he's just acting 
awkward like all virgins do.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:02.470
He's an herbivore!

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:03.860
He has no libido!

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:04.940
None!

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:05.940
He does, too!

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.190
Nope.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:08.190
He does!

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:09.190
Nope.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:10.690
Yes, he does!

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:16.700
Ow!

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.120
Want to make a bet, then?

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.200
A bet?

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:25.660
Senpai is hiding...

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:28.290
dirty books in this room!

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:29.260
Huh?!

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.800
If I find it, I win.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.960
The loser has to buy pancakes.

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:35.510
That sounds fun.

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.320
Challenge accepted.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.480
Y-You're not going to find any dirty books!

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.260
That was a suspicious reaction.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:58.240
Announcer

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.670
What do you think, commentator Gamo-chan?

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:55.160
He's clean.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.240
Paisen is just acting sus, like usual.

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:00.240
No!

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.080
He's freaking out because
 I'm about to find his dirty books!

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:04.710
What's your take?

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:05.830
No way.

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:07.080
It's not possible.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.440
Yes, it is!

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.830
I'm going to find it!

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.340
<i>I kind of do have a dirty book.</i>

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:18.260
<i>It's called </i>Paraiso Harem<i>.</i>

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:22.350
<i>It's an ongoing series in what's, technically, 
a young adult magazine, but really...</i>

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.860
<i>It's basically hentai manga.</i>

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:31.640
<i>I just enjoy Yagami Rintarou-sensei's beautiful 
artwork and the orthodox fantasy plot.</i>

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:35.600
<i>I'm definitely not reading 
it for the sexy stuff.</i>

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:39.110
<i>And I keep it...</i>

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:44.120
<i>...in the prep room next door.</i>

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:51.860
<i>So there are no dirty books in this room.</i>

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.440
It's been about fifteen minutes.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.010
She's just wasting time looking for it.

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:00.510
I'm sure he has something!

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.940
Just admit it.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:06.010
Paisen's an herbivore.

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:07.670
Herbivore!

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.870
Why don't you give up, already?

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:16.890
Paisen's a sheep.

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.320
Sheep!

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.490
Too bad for you, Nagatoro!

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.710
You'd never find dirty books here.

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:38.460
It's a dirty book!

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.040
Perv! Creep! Perv! Creep!

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.010
Oh, no! Stop it!

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:00.670
I reopened it with this.

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:02.720
That sounds painful.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.820
It's not painful at all.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.680
A little prick, maybe.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.850
Wh-What?

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.850
Want to try getting your
 ears pierced too, Senpai?

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:19.740
Do you afraid of pain?

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:22.920
No, it's not even about the pain.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:26.430
It'd be so weird for someone 
like me to have an earring!

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.200
See?

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.920
Nah, it wouldn't be weird.

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:41.260
You could wear it just when you're 
inside, if you're embarrassed.

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:43.760
A matching earring.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.340
<i>Matching earrings.</i>

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:55.520
Well?

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:58.330
Don't move. It's dangerous.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.270
Don't worry.

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:04.310
It's just a little prick...

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.060
W-Wait!

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.790
She opened a hole.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.720
I've been defiled...

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.210
by Nagatoro!

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:21.290
Submit!

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:25.800
<i>Huh?</i>

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:30.300
<i>Huh?</i>

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:37.810
I just pinched you!

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:42.810
Wait, you seem a bit disappointed, Senpai.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.700
No, not really.

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:48.830
Do you really want a piercing?

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:49.880
Ow, ow, ow!

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.320
I-I don't!

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.580
Senpai-kun, help me.

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.380
<b>Family</b>

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.380
<b>Restaurant</b>

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.430
A stalker?

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.510
Yeah.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:15.970
You were trolling that club,

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:20.600
and one of them started 
following you around like a stalker?

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:22.560
That's bad.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.110
Yeah, bad.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:28.110
He's still doing it.

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:32.700
Oh, man!

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:35.700
I'm scared!

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.490
What do you think, Paisen?

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:41.200
You guys did it to yourselves.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.210
This is what you get for 
messing with people's heads.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.880
Look, Paisen made her cry.

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:53.780
Hey...

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:59.470
Senpai-kun, could you do something for me?

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:06.400
Could you pretend to be my boyfriend?

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:14.540
I think he might give up
 if he saw us flirting.

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:17.900
Wh-Why should I?

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.520
I'm single right now.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:25.720
You're about the only person 
I can ask to do that.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.460
B-But...

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.460
P-Pretend to be your boyfriend?

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:32.320
Why not?

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.620
Paisen would be harmless.

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:36.130
Totally harmless!

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:37.500
No, he's not.

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:40.970
He's <i>super</i> harmful.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.930
He's like a harmful insect.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:50.190
Let this creepy senpai pretend 
to be your boyfriend,

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:52.420
and forget about losing your stalker...

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:53.990
You'll have twice as many!

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.780
No!

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:58.380
No!

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:01.490
No!

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.550
That's crazy talk!

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:07.000
I'd never do such a thing!

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:11.630
Then could you please 
pretend to be my boyfriend?

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.140
Sure, I guess.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.900
<i>I couldn't really say no...</i>

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:38.320
<i>But what are you supposed to do on a date?</i>

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.390
<i>I mean, I guess it's just pretend.</i>

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:42.540
<i>We can just wander around.</i>

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:44.830
Senpai-kun.

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:49.290
Sorry, were you waiting long?

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:52.300
No, not really.

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:55.740
Okay, let's go.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:57.860
S-Sure.

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.680
Senpai-kun, are you nervous?

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.540
N-Not really.

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:14.300
Don't worry.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.320
I'll take the lead today.

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.090
<i>The lead?</i>

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:43.850
Paisen's awkward as hell.

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:54.850
Isn't this the kind of thing you might 
see in those anime shows Paisen likes?

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:56.610
Totally!

00:18:56.610 --> 00:19:00.790
For some reason, they have 
to pretend to be on a date.

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:02.620
But...

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:09.000
But the act becomes real, 
things start heating up, and...

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.120
And...

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.880
What they thought were 
fake feelings become...

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.600
An actual date!

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.720
A date!

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.380
There's no way he could 
make it a proper date!

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.760
Why so mad?

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:24.390
I'm not mad!

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:27.440
About that thing I asked you...

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.760
Are you sure you're okay with it?

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:32.270
What do you mean?

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.150
Isn't there anyone you 
want to go on a date with?

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.660
N-Not really.

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.390
Yeah?

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:58.180
S-Speaking of which, where's the stalker?

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:01.360
I haven't seen him.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.810
Ow! Ow!

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:07.930
Nagatoro!

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.430
When did that happen?!

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:13.440
I'm sorry!

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.650
I won't do it anymore!

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:16.130
Forgive me!

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:19.970
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:24.450
Now we can end this charade.

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.210
Yeah...

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:27.980
What are you doing?!

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:29.040
You ruined it!

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.830
It's better to solve the problem
 sooner rather than later, right?

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.840
But the photo ops!

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:35.150
The photo ops!

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:36.660
What photo ops?!

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:37.460
I'm out!

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:40.740
I'm sorry! I won't do it again!

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:46.160
Okay, let's go home.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.900
Okay!

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.670
Let's go home, Senpai.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:54.350
Yeah.

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:57.840
Sucks to be you, Senpai.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.910
There goes your much-anticipated first date.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.990
I-It's fine.

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:05.080
It was just pretend, anyway.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:07.350
That's one less thing to worry about.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:08.760
Yeah, right!

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:11.670
You were having pervy thoughts, weren't you?

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:14.520
Like, you lock arms with her,

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:19.390
her breast touches you, and if you're lucky,

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:20.880
you might even lose your virginity.

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:23.880
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What are you talking about?!

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.880
Pervert!

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.810
You're such a pervert, Senpai!

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.970
Th-That would have never happened!

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:35.980
You're not ready for going on dates, are you?

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.990
I guess you're right.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.280
You're so gross, Senpai.

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:27.920
Points of improvement for today!

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.760
Senpai, I heard you cheated 
on the dirty book hunt.

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:31.530
Cheater!

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:32.720
No, I...

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.890
Why don't you two go out already?

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:37.010
Let's go home, Yoshi.

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:37.720
Roger!

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:40.030
Wait, at least toy with me or something!
