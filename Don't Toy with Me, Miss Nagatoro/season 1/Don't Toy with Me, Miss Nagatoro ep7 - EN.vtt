WEBVTT

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.360
DON'T TOY WITH ME,
MISS NAGATORO

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.880
<b>DON'T TOY WITH ME, MISS NAGATORO</b>

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:40.030
<b>Senpai</b>, Want to Go to the Festival?

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.750
Do you think they'll have candy apples?

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.240
Yeah, I'm sure they will.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.880
<i>Oh, yeah, the summer festival's today.</i>

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.150
Senpai, want to go to the festival?

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.680
I feel sorry for you being so alone.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.760
So I feel like I have to invite you.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.270
<i>I have a feeling Nagatoro's
going to make me go again.</i>

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.560
<i>KO!</i>

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.880
<i>Round 2! Fight!</i>

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.560
<i>Maybe I should be the one...</i>

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.300
<i>to invite her for once?</i>

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.540
Ow...

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.900
Senpai, you're such a creep.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.810
You're a total creep.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.420
Creepy, creepy.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.810
Creepy, creepy!

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.590
<i>No! No! No!</i>

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.950
<i>No way. No way.</i>

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.820
<i>Why would I ask her?</i>

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.580
<i>Nothing but bluster.</i>

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.740
<i>KO!</i>

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.850
<i>I-I actually came.</i>

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.620
<i>I'm checking it out because
I'm bored. That's all.</i>

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.240
Did you wait?

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.020
You're so late.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.620
<i>Guess I'll buy some yakisoba and go home.</i>

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.960
Paisen located!

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.010
Located!

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.730
After him!

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.470
Roger!

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.080
I didn't realize you came
to festivals, Paisen.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.460
That's surprising.

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:20.790
A surprising loner sea louse.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:21.530
Surprise louse!

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:28.670
Wait a second. Did you come down here
thinking you might bump into Hayacchi?

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.130
Good on you.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.040
N-No!

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.540
Too bad for you! She's doing stuff
with her club right now.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.280
I-I see.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.740
Bye.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.430
Come on. You might as well spend
some time at the festival.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.580
Come on!

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.300
No, seriously. I was just stopping by.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.310
Hey, get the thing we
won in the raffle earlier.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.560
Roger!

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.450
Got a Paisen!

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:57.870
Got him!

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.460
Sorry to keep you so late.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.460
It's fine.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.840
I've been getting out of shape lately.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.600
Oh, yeah. Wasn't the festival today?

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.960
I know it's late, but do you plan on going?

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.840
I don't know.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:34.810
What?!

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.350
You sent it to Nagatoro?!

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.750
I did.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.530
She might actually come now!

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.610
"They're stealing my pet!"

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.080
Pet!

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.360
Who are you calling a pet?

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.560
Nagatoro's busy with her club.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.210
You can't just demand it.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.870
She's not coming.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.010
Sorry, you had a club tonight, didn't you?

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.440
Actually, it ended early.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.510
I was bored, so here I am.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:13.230
Yeah?

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.260
Yeah?

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.370
A collar?

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:20.020
Hilarious.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.440
Right?

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.060
Isn't it hilarious?

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.270
Hilarious!

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.530
Just take it off already.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.500
That looks fun.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.580
Give me.

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:33.930
We're taking Paisen.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.290
If you want him back, fight for him!

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.790
Fight!

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.230
All right, then.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.800
I don't care about Senpai,
but I accept your challenge!

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.880
<b>Shooting Gallery</b>

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.800
It's two-on-two.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.190
The team that wins more
of the better prizes wins.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:57.720
Okay.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.600
Senpai, don't you dare drag me down.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.040
I'm playing, too?

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.110
Here.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.990
But I hit it!

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.250
You have to aim higher.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.280
I did, though.

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:28.510
I didn't think you'd come to a festival.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.890
I just wanted to get some fresh air.

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.520
Too bad. You missed.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.400
Were you actually...

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.320
waiting for me to invite you?

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.280
O-O-O-O-Of course not!

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:00.800
She got it!

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.040
Bull's-eye.

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.580
If there's somewhere you
want to go with someone,

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:12.050
you could always try asking them.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.450
Bam.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.980
I think we won this.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:36.950
Victory!

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:39.080
No, take a good look.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.960
Look at how huge this Gesopie is.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.450
We won by quality.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.910
Not enough to make up for the numbers.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.080
Right, Yoshi?

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.030
This Gesopie is a rare item, though...

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.370
Here, you can have it.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:53.810
You've been collecting them, haven't you?

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:55.970
I love you, Hayacchi!

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.720
You bought her off!

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.840
And so...

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.840
I get Senpai!

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.980
Can you take this off already?

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.020
Oh, fine.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.060
Later, Paisen.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.820
Don't get caught next time.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.080
Go back to the mountains!

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.430
What am I, an animal?

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.730
Want to go look around,
since we're here?

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:35.150
S-Sure.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.850
Let's look around.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:58.110
<b></b>It's Like a Date, Huh, <b>Senpai{</b>?

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.220
Mine!

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:03.840
<i>It's like...</i>

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.500
Here!

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.040
<i>Like...</i>

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.040
It's like a date, huh, Senpai?

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:15.360
A d-d-d-date?!

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:20.050
That's for people who've gone through
the proper procedures first.

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:24.380
Just kidding.

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:28.560
I'd never go on a date with you, Senpai.

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.060
S-Stop it!

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:42.100
While we're at it,
why don't we try holding hands?

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:03.220
The fireworks are starting!

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:12.340
We're going to watch them, Senpai!

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:14.360
Stop pushing!

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.690
The fireworks here are awesome.

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:19.990
They blast off the big ones
one after another.

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:23.510
I-I mean, I've seen it before.

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:25.220
When would you have seen it?

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.670
When I was in elementary school.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:28.360
That's such a long time ago.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.640
What are you, a recluse?

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:30.870
Shut up!

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:34.880
<b>Fireworks Venue
10m Ahead</b>

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.140
It's so crowded.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.240
The line hasn't budged at all.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.110
<i>The fireworks I saw last time...</i>

00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:58.950
Nagatoro, this way.

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:00.080
Hey, we're moving.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.150
We gotta get there before it ends.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.720
Senpai!

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.460
Nagatoro!

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.280
Th-This way.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.150
What's this about, Senpai?

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:48.800
I-I'm pretty sure it's that way.

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:53.080
What are you doing,
taking me somewhere so quiet?

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:55.850
What are you going to do?

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:56.830
Here.

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:59.380
Well? Well?

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:12.850
I just remembered watching the
fireworks from here as a kid.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.300
Hm...

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.030
I don't know, though, Senpai.

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:34.420
Is it really a good idea to drag a girl
into the darkness on a date?

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:36.320
Th-The darkness?!

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.630
Most people would be alarmed.

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:42.110
Th-That wasn't my intent.

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:45.810
You dragged me by force, too.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.150
Were you about to do something sleazy?

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:51.920
Sleazy! Sleazy!

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.900
You're so sleazy for a virgin!

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:58.560
Sleazy! Sleazy!

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.650
<i>Here we go with Nagatoro's
virgin shaming again.</i>

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:01.650
<i>Actually, though...</i>

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:04.370
Sleazy! Sleazy!

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:06.150
<i>I know she can be a bit shy at times, too.</i>

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:15.200
Something sleazy? Like what?

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:21.170
S-Something sleazy, as in...
something sleazy.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.790
Details.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:26.300
You know what I'm talking about.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.050
No, I don't.

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:29.550
Give me more specifics.

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:31.050
Like...

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:33.050
Specifics. In exact terms.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.310
What?!

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.810
Like throwing your arms around me by force.

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:44.420
And...

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:47.320
K-Kissing me and stuff.

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:53.270
That wasn't what you were
trying to do, was it?

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:54.580
I'm not!

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:57.230
Yeah, you never had a chance.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:03.250
There's no way a virgin
like you could force a kiss.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:05.820
A-And you can?

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:09.590
Sure, I can.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.120
Look, it's another big one.

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:40.120
You're right. It's big.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:53.600
Man, I wish I could have worn
my yukata to the festival.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.140
Y-Yeah.

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.230
Senpai!

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.740
If there's somewhere you
want to go with someone,

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:13.150
you could always try asking them.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.320
L-Let's...

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:24.670
c-come back next year, I guess.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.670
You're right.

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:31.810
You'd better wear your yukata, too, Senpai.

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:34.000
G-Guys don't wear yukatas.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.640
Sure they do.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.680
I know, why don't we wear matching yukatas?

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:44.780
Matching yukatas?!

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:48.500
I'm kidding.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.840
Who would ever wear
matching yukatas with you?

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:51.850
That's so gross!

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:53.860
No way!

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:06.000
<b></b>Let's Go Home, <b>Senpai</b>

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.460
The first day of new term was painful.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.930
I guess I'll go home and play <i>Bragon Quest</i>.

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.710
Again?!

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:13.470
Didn't you get asked out last week, too?
<i>That voice!</i>

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:16.250
I did, but...

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:18.970
So, who was it?

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:20.800
Who was it?

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.730
Hoshino-kun from Class 3.

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:28.070
Isn't he Aoi-chan's boyfriend?

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.230
It's the Nagatoro family.

00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:29.920
That's hilarious.

00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:30.730
<i>I don't think I could go near that.</i>

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.510
Hilarious!

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:33.740
<i>Her group of friends is even bigger now.</i>

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.740
<i>She's been around me a lot lately...</i>

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:47.060
<i>but we live in totally different worlds.</i>

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:48.730
<i>It's like...</i>

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:55.510
<i>A mole living in a dark hole...</i>

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.500
<i>happened to pop up</i>

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.150
<i>in the midst of a gathering of jaguars.</i>

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.690
Hey.

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:12.450
'Sup?

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:14.140
'Sup?

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.110
Damn, I'm so tired.

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:21.120
Sheesh, are you trying
to gain sympathy already?

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.870
Seriously, though, we get worked so hard.

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:27.120
You guys aren't even showing up
to your club meetings.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.640
The club president was about to snap.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.130
Damn, that president's scary.

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.220
No, thanks.

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:37.130
<i>They're fitting in.</i>

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:41.270
<i>They hang out so effortlessly with girls.</i>

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:44.830
<i>I think that's the kind
of guy you need to be.</i>

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:48.280
So anyway, Hayacchi, wanna go hang?

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:51.130
I think I'll pass.

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:54.150
Come on. I'll make it really fun.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:57.040
Want me to come along if you
don't want to go one-on-one?

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.520
We'll make it a double date.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:18:59.890
Wanna join, Yoshi?

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.600
Me! I wouldn't mind going.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.280
Sweet, it's settled.

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:14.910
No, I'm not going.

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:17.970
Come on. We're just
sitting around blabbing.

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:18.920
Let's go.

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:21.240
Let's go.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.540
We can decide where to go
once we're at the station.

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:28.320
Huh? Who's that?

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:28.820
Creeper?

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:30.290
<i>Oh, no!</i>

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:31.440
Who's that dude?

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:35.870
Hey, it's Paisen. 'Sup?

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:37.190
Yo.

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:40.080
What are you doing over there?

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.590
Come on over.

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:43.700
What? You know that kid?

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:48.450
What do you want?

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:51.710
N-No...

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:57.460
I-I, uh...

00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:58.910
Let...

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:00.470
Let...?

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:02.560
Let...

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:04.940
Let...

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:08.470
Let's go.

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:11.730
What?

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.750
<i>Wh-What the hell am I saying?</i>

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:17.740
Come again? I couldn't hear you.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:19.910
Yes, sir, let's hear that again.

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:21.740
Louder this time.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.200
Let's go home, Senpai.

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:31.060
Bye.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:33.620
Let's go, Senpai.

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.140
Y-Yeah.

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:38.510
All right. Let's go.

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:40.540
Huh? Okay.

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:43.380
What? Wait up!

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:49.440
Are you sure about just leaving them behind?

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.760
Why not? They're annoying.

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.390
A-Annoying!

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.080
I didn't expect that from
you, though, Paisen.

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.470
Paisen!

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:00.490
Huh? What?

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:02.650
I remember now!

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:04.650
You're the manga senpai!

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:05.670
Yeah.

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:07.830
He draws really pervy manga.

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.660
Ew!

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:16.170
I draw m-manga sometimes,
but it's not hentai or anything.

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:20.100
You don't need to lie,
Hentai Manga Sensei.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.520
That's so gross, Hentai Manga Sensei.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.420
Totally gross.

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:27.320
You have such a weird vibe.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.240
Right?

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.660
Hentai manga aura.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:32.890
It's oozing out of this puffball here.

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:34.180
Stop it!

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.920
Puffball!

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.190
He's going to put you into
a hentai manga, Sakura.

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:40.400
Oh, no!

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.440
Look out for the hentai manga vibes.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.160
Hilarious.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.700
<i>I really don't fit in here.</i>

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:47.700
Hilarious.

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:27.220
Points of improvement for today.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:30.000
Why didn't you invite me
to the festival, Senpai?

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.830
You were actually dying to go, weren't you?

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:32.760
Th-That's not true.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.800
It's not really manly, just waiting
for something good to happen.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.220
B-But...

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:37.520
But?

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.020
I'm glad I got to go w-with you.

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:39.990
E-Ew!
