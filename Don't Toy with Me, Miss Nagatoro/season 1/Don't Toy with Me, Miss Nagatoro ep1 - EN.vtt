Hey, look at this!

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.720
Isn't it awesome?

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.880
Nice.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.980

Yeah.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:06.380
Want to go karaoke?

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.900
Yeah!

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.250
Seriously, no way.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:50.670
<b>Fire Hydrant</b>

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.820
I felt so bad.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.810
Anyway, and then he sent me a LINE message.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:32.640
Really?

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.840
Oh, man. That's hilarious.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.800
Right?

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.380
I wish he would stop having the wrong idea.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.930
<i>This is usually my favorite spot after
school, since no one comes here.</i>

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.910
<i>I can't stand those types of girls.</i>

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.380
<i>I'm never going to have anything
to do with that species.</i>

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.310
<i>I'll get my homework done and go home.</i>

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.860
Keep quiet. Set phones on silent.
<b>Currently Away</b>

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.080
I can't!

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.620
This is taking forever.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.060
Where's Yukko, anyway?

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.120
She's not reading my messages on LINE.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.320
Ew, he messaged me again.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.580
That's hilarious!

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.800
Do you have any pictures or anything?

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.170
I do.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.940
One second.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.260
He's so persistent.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.040
See? Isn't he pretty iffy?

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.520
He is!

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.390
You know, though... Look at that.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:41.910
Oh, yeah.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:42.690
Right?

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.410
For sure.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.540
<i>Don't let them get to you!</i>

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.680

<i>Stay calm.</i>

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.300
Oh, yeah. Toro-chan, where's that
book you were talking about?

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.950
It's on the shelves in the back.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.220

S-Sorry.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:33.710
Oh, God!

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.360
Look at this!

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:36.800
What?

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.660
What is it?

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.400
Look at these.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.840
"I'll protect you!"

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.120
So badass.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.700
<i>Relax.</i>

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.400
<i>Keep calm... Keep calm...</i>
Man, this is so sketch.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.300
It's better than <i>Two Piece</i>.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.240
Nah, don't diss <i>Two Piece</i>.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.610
This doesn't even come close.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.910
That's true!

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.240
Yukko says she's at the family
restaurant by the station.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.460
Let's go!

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.210
Hayacchi, are you coming with?

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.470
Later.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.720
Seriously? Do you have a thing for weirdos?

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.020
So apparently Yuka's
boyfriend is good-looking.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.580
I can't wait to see him.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.710
Same!

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.040
I'm a first-year.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.980
Are you a second-year?

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.740
Yeah.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.500
You're my senpai, then.

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.540

"But they're ambushed by soldiers from

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.150
"Siegfried and Elizabeth
barely make it out alive."

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.570
"He knows that his love for
her will never be requited,"

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:35.930
"and yet, he protects her with his life."

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.640
<i>Stay calm!</i>

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:46.210
So basically, Siegfried is you, isn't he?

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.940
N-No, not really...

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.370
You projected yourself onto
this unfortunate swordsman,

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.740
who slowly grows closer
to this beautiful knight.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:55.810
I...
who slowly grows closer
to this beautiful knight.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:56.220
I...

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:01.760
Oh, no. I don't mean to laugh
at your creativity, Senpai.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.710
But, you know...

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.990
I feel sorry for you and Siegfried.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.110
Y-You feel sorry?

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:12.740

No, I won't laugh.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.640
Siegfried is your double, after all.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.550
S-So what do you mean, you feel sorry?

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.890
You don't get it?

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.140
All right!

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.070
Let's do this together.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.110
I've never used a sword or
anything, so let's use these.

See what happens?

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:07.070
See how you react?

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.980
There's no way you're enough of a badass

You're nothing like that!

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.790
Senpai, why are you looking away?

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:47.620
You're supposed to look a person in the eye
when they're talking to you, aren't you?

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.900
Senpai, you're kind of...

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.380
Actually, you're <i>really</i>...

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.650
kind of creepy!

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.190
Huh? Are you crying, Senpai?

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.620
I'm not...

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.240

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.700
You can have that.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.340
Sorry for messing with you.

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.980

Huh? Are you in the art club?

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:51.180
I washed it.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:54.060

Wh-Why are you in here?

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.220
Are you the only one here?

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:39.280
Does that mean we're alone together?

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.860
Senpai?

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.110
L-Leave if you have no reason to be here.

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:51.370
You're so cold, Senpai.

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:10.640
I'll model for you, Senpai.

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:13.390
You don't need to.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:16.310
That's not what I feel like drawing.

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:18.080
What about this, then?

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:22.620
Should we try something a bit sexy?

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.650
I bet that's your thing.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:28.290
That's not true!

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:31.390
A girl shouldn't be so
quick to show her skin!

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.300
What? You'd draw a nude model?

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:37.170
Oh, all right.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:44.640
Fine!

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:45.800

"Normally! Something normal!"

W-Want to take a break?

You've been acting sus this whole time.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.830
Don't tell me you haven't drawn anything.

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:19.580
N-No, I was trying to
figure out your outline.

<i>What do you expect?</i>

If you can finish drawing me
properly, I'll give you a reward.

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:41.100
Wh-What reward?

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.900
That's a secret.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.690
Come on! You can do this, Senpai!

Close your eyes.

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:32.440
Wh-Why?

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.120
Just do it.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.530
Y-You have to tell me why—

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:37.540
Just do it!

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.210
<i>N-No way.</i>

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:53.220
<i>A k-kiss?!</i>

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:06.480
What's with that face?!

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.410
You didn't think I was going
to kiss you, did you?!

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:12.750
Did you really think you deserve a
reward for this? Are you kidding?

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:14.920
You haven't drawn me properly at all!

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:16.120
Especially this area!

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:20.870
Were you too embarrassed
to draw a girl's thighs?

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:24.370
You're beet red, Senpai!

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:28.650
And then you made a funny face,
expecting a kiss.

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:30.430
I-I didn't.

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.830
You're kind of funny, Senpai.

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:35.570
A-Are you done?

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.760
Go home if you're satisfied.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.770
I don't know...

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:43.760
It's fun observing you.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.460
Wh-What's that supposed to mean?

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:48.880
Your eyelids are twitching, Senpai.

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:51.570
M-M-My eye's just itchy.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.010
Are you going to cry again?

00:16:58.010 --> 00:16:59.860
G-Go home!

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:02.560
Wh-What are you doing?

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.750
S-Stop... Stop it!

00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:11.300
Senpai, I thought you were a guy.

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.300
You're so weak.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:21.060
I'm sorry, Senpai.

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:22.880
I had to mess with you again.

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:27.260
You didn't mess with me.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.580
Stop crying, Senpai.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:33.680
I'm not c-crying.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.840
<i>I've never cried in public before.</i>

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.830
<i>This first-year made me cry again.</i>

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:44.880
Draw me properly next time, Senpai.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.200
I'll give you a <i>huge</i> reward.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.450
I d-don't want a reward.

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:56.150
Senpai! Senpai! Senpai!

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.010
Senpai! Senpai! Senpai!

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:02.010
<i>Why do we have the same route home?</i>
Senpai! Senpai! Senpai!

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:03.450
Senpai!

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:05.180
Wh-What?

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:10.520
There's something I wanted to ask you.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.530
I know this is weird,

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:16.640
since we've only just met...

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:20.530
Please go out with me.

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:27.790
B-But w-wait...

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:30.990
Th-Th-This is so sudden...

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:32.040
Psych!

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:38.980
Psych! Psych! Psych!

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:40.960
I'm kidding, Senpai!

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.000
Stop it!

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.270
Why would you take me seriously?

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:50.720
Did you really think a
girl would ask you out?

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.220
I-I knew you were kidding.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:55.330
Are you sure?

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:58.640
I was only surprised because
it came out of nowhere.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.070
Uh-huh.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:04.510
You're just toying with me
for the fun of it, miss.

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:08.000
"Miss"?

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.580
You're so gross!

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:20.700
He's light.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.730
Sorry.

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:35.430
I-It's not a big deal.

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:41.820
Don't you ever get angry, Senpai?

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:46.190
I've been pretty horrible to you.

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:48.220
<i>She's right.</i>

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:50.750
<i>She's the same as the others.</i>

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.200
Hey, master.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.250
Show me your new manga, sir!

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.990
<i>It's always been like this for me.</i>

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:05.840
<i>I know how to deal with it.</i>

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:08.770
<i>Look away, close my mind,</i>

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.100
<i>and make it through.</i>

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.020
Bah, he's turtling again.

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:17.360
Leave him.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.650
Let's go.

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:23.880
<i>So I don't remember what
any of those kids looked like.</i>

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:27.030
Come on, Senpai...

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:30.530
Well? Come on.

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:35.290
Don't tell me you have a crush on me.

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:36.940
N-No...

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:38.560
No way!

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.440
Give me a break, Senpai!

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.300
N-No, I...

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.710
A-All that stuff about having a crush on...

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:48.320
On?

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.680
...you aside...

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:53.180
...aside?

00:20:54.420 --> 00:21:00.600
Honestly, you tick me off
and get on my nerves.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:06.230
But I don't... I don't hate it that much.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:11.760
Talking with you and stuff, miss.

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:15.830
Seriously, that "miss" thing is creepy.

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.840
F-Fine then... your name.

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:22.010
Tell me your n-name.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.240
Sure.

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:31.700
"Naga" as in "long," and "toro."

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:32.510
"Toro"?

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.090
You write it like this.

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:44.060
Toro.

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:50.220
Call me Nagatoro from now on.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:53.870
Let's get to know each other, Senpai.

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.320
Reflections for today!

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.800
Wh-What is that supposed to mean?

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.030
Senpai, you looked at my bra.

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:33.260
I d-didn't!

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:34.680
Lies!

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:35.520
What color was it?

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.180
I d-didn't see it!

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:38.430
It looks like this. See?
