dawn

280
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Episode 24: Perfect Replica

281
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:34,850
The lord of that dungeon is the mirror devil, Spiegel.

282
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:41,560
It's a monster of the age of myth that is
mentioned in the legends of Ewig the Sage.

283
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,870
It is thought that Spiegel reads
the memories of those who enter the dungeon

284
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,880
and uses them to create a replica of the target.

285
00:02:54,890 --> 00:03:00,330
There are monsters with similar powers
in modern times, like the Einsam.

286
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:06,310
But Spiegel imitates people's
power, mana, and even techniques,

287
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,720
creating flawless physical replicas.

288
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:15,580
It's why the Ruined King's Tomb is still uncleared.

289
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,300
Why did Sense pick such a venue for the exam?

290
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,960
The replicas are just as strong as the targets.

291
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,630
To defeat them without sacrifices,

292
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:29,240
one needs teamwork and
an awareness of one's weaknesses.

293
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:37,640
It's quite a fitting exam for a pacifist like her.

294
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,710
This is bad.

295
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,420
Fall back!

296
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,760
Denken!

297
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,770
Now, what shall we do about this?

298
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,230
A dead end, huh?

299
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,720
We're in quite the pinch, aren't we?

300
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:35,170
Four-eyes, can you give me
your opinion as an expert on cloning magic?

301
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,880
I told you, my name is Land.

302
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,430
I guess it doesn't matter.

303
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,870
How perfectly do you think
that replica is copying me?

304
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:58,570
Übel, you're the kind of person
who keeps talking during a fight, aren't you?

305
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,450
Almost like you'd die if you stopped.

306
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,700
How observant of you.

307
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,040
Yeah, I might die.

308
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,680
It's quiet.

309
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:20,800
Does that mean it's not copying
my memories or personality?

310
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,970
No, it probably just can't talk.

311
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:33,680
It stole the escape golem
from my pocket during the initial assault.

312
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,050
I see, that is something I'd do.

313
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,740
It also knows about us.

314
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:53,670
It's not coming after us even though we're cornered
because it's wary of your Solganiel.

315
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:59,260
Either that, or it's toying with us
for its own enjoyment.

316
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,010
That's disturbing.

317
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,660
You're bleeding a lot.

318
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,980
Four-eyes, you're not gonna last long at this rate.

319
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,690
I suppose not.

320
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,730
Can you tell me one last thing?

321
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,200
Are you the real four-eyes?

322
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,200
Well, who can say?

323
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,710
Use my flask.

324
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:43,220
That's for your survival.

325
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,790
Huh, is that so?

326
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:51,140
Alright, four-eyes. Give me a minute.

327
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,820
I'll get back your flask.

328
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,150
Hey, wait—

329
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,240
Yeah, of course it's going to close the distance.

330
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:11,660
Solganiel requires the target's
entire body to be in view.

331
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,390
Whoever misjudges the distance first is going to lose.

332
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:27,470
Since we're equal, I'm going to need luck to win.

333
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,890
I've always had the worst luck,

334
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,430
so I hate fights that rely on luck.

335
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:41,360
That's why I don't want to be fighting against myself.

336
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,860
Man, I just can't help but rush to my death.

337
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,580
Yeah, I've got the worst luck.

338
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,250
That's why I didn't want to do this.

339
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,630
That said,

340
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:07,380
it looks like your luck was even worse.

341
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,510
Four-eyes, you got here faster than I expected.

342
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:26,200
So the flask was fake, after all.

343
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:40,580
Übel... You knew that wasn't the real me, didn't you?

344
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,840
Why rush to your death like that?

345
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:46,710
Because I was sure you'd come to my rescue, I guess.

346
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,720
Do I look like I'm that nice to you?

347
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,210
Nope, not at all.

348
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,240
Besides, that's irrelevant.

349
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:02,330
You didn't accept my flask, four-eyes.

350
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,490
You don't want someone else
to die because of you, right?

351
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,620
That's why I designed a situation
where I'd die because of you.

352
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,400
Thanks, four-eyes.

353
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,630
I feel like I understand you a bit better now.

354
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,750
I see, good for you.

355
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,240
So, will you be able to empathize with me?

356
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,990
I think I still need more time.

357
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:42,310
I think we're pretty close to the core.

358
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,150
Lady Frieren, there's a staircase over there.

359
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,530
Fern, show me the map.

360
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,820
I think we've finished exploring this floor.

361
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,600
There's a hidden room on the other side of this wall.

362
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,340
I'm sure there's treasure.

363
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:23,940
It feels like... there might be a rare grimoire in there.

364
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,040
There wasn't anything
that looked like an entrance, though.

365
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,360
That's true.

366
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,500
But there's definitely a room here,
considering the layout of the dungeon.

367
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,910
Lady Frieren, this is amazing.

368
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:46,770
It depicts the triumphs of the buried king.

369
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:53,030
I've never seen a mural of
the Unified Dynasty in such good condition.

370
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,780
This is a valuable discovery.

371
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,470
It's magnificent, isn't it?

372
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:19,600
We're making progress almost too smoothly.

373
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,350
Are we just going to easily pass the exam at this rate?

374
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,390
Maybe.

375
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,810
What's up?

376
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,660
Why are you waiting around here?

377
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:40,110
Considering the layout, the core is beyond this room.

378
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,740
And?

379
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,370
That thing has been standing
guard for half a day already.

380
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:56,510
This is getting interesting.

381
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,930
This is how conquering a dungeon should be.

382
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,210
A perfect replica, huh?

383
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:12,520
It does indeed look like it's as powerful as me.

384
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:18,250
We can't reach the core without
doing something about that replica.

385
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,700
Do you have any ideas?

386
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:27,350
Let's see... If it really is a complete recreation of me,

387
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:31,210
I guess it would have the same
weaknesses as a live mage.

388
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:37,960
To defeat a superior mage, you can use
either restraining magic or mind control magic.

389
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,090
I'm resistant to both, though.

390
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:45,220
They could create a slight opening, though.

391
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:49,740
That should be all you need to defeat it.

392
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,730
Methode.

393
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,130
You're good at these kinds of tricks, aren't you?

394
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:58,360
I wouldn't say I'm particularly good at them.

395
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,120
Well then, excuse me.

396
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,500
This is curious.

397
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,400
My restraining spell isn't working.

398
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,510
You smell nice.

399
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:19,510
It normally works, unless there's a large gap in mana.

400
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:25,010
Lady Frieren, please look me in the eyes next.

401
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:32,060
Mind control isn't working, either.

402
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:37,150
I'm not capable of breaking
Lady Frieren's mental defenses.

403
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,900
Oh, dear.

404
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,780
Looks like you really are resistant to both.

405
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,790
While her mental defenses are complex and sturdy,

406
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,540
they seem to use quite an old structure.

407
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,930
An expert in mind magic
might be able to exploit a weak point.

408
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:58,730
Are you aware of any among the examinees?

409
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,140
Edel, the second-rank mage, should be able to.

410
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:10,800
However, unlike me,
she has absolutely no fighting ability.

411
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,890
I'm honestly not sure whether
she'll be able to make it here...

412
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:22,650
The use of mind control also relies
on the assumption that the target has free will.

413
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:27,290
Are the replicas really detailed enough for that?

414
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,660
We're still lacking a lot of information.

415
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,170
Edel, what do you think that is?

416
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,410
Who knows.

417
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:52,180
However, it seems safe to assume
it's just as strong as the first-rank mage, Sense.

418
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,600
There's only so long we can hide
while concealing our mana.

419
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,060
We've got to defeat it.

420
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,270
You think we can defeat it, Blei?

421
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:07,320
It's one thing for me, but neither
of you can properly fight in this dungeon.

422
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:12,580
Modern magic isn't suited
for dungeon combat in the first place.

423
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:18,200
That's a result of most dungeons having been cleared
around the time the demon king was defeated.

424
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,090
With powerful defensive spells
taking so much of our mana,

425
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:29,590
offensive spells utilizing the environment
have become more common.

426
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:41,060
Manipulating existing matter takes far less mana
than creating new matter does, after all.

427
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:45,820
That thing has a powerful advantage in that regard.

428
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,450
Countless spells are cast on its hair.

429
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,700
I think we can assume it has plenty
of options for fighting in a dungeon.

430
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,960
By my reckoning, we can't win against it.

431
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,600
Magic is all about imagination.

432
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:13,970
That replica freely manipulates the nigh-
uncountable number of threads that make up hair.

433
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:18,230
Its ability to visualize
is far beyond that of any normal human,

434
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:22,440
so there's no doubt it's
a vastly more powerful mage than us.

435
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:27,310
I honestly think it's a miracle we've
been able to avoid it for this long.

436
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,030
We did our best.

437
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:37,040
Combat wasn't our forte anyway,
so it's about time we give up.

438
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,180
Honestly, I'm scared and want to go home.

439
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:46,840
Edel, would your voice not work?

440
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:51,610
Mind control magic is my clan's specialty,

441
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:56,850
but don't think I'll be able to fulfill
the conditions for advanced commands against that.

442
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,350
At most, I might be able to
make it kneel to create an opening.

443
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:06,610
Even then, I'd need to speak
the command while looking it in the eyes.

444
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,110
So it's not impossible.

445
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,360
Assuming it has free will.

446
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,990
How long do we need to stall it?

447
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,990
Fifteen seconds.

448
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,870
Not like any more than that is feasible, anyway.

449
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,370
What do you mean?

450
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,900
You're about to see.

451
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,900
Defend us from all directions!

452
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,150
Huh?

453
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:51,780
In modern magic combat, there are
two ways of overcoming defensive magic.

454
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,150
Either you break it down with sheer mass,

455
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,280
or you bypass it with technique.

456
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,160
A large quantity of attacks usually implies the latter.

457
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,660
I'm surprised.

458
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,500
I didn't think someone would use both.

459
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,300
The attacks have the weight of boulders.

460
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:16,930
I'd thought we would last fifteen seconds
with a complete defensive barrier,

461
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,180
but it broke through so fast.

462
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,480
But our eyes have met.

463
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:29,010
The best mages carefully observe their opponents.

464
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,690
Kneel!

465
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:42,040
I see how it is.

466
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,250
It doesn't have free will.

467
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:49,290
It's but a thorough imitation of a person's free will.

468
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,800
We have no chance of winning.

469
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:58,680
I guess we had no choice
but to ride the coattails of others.

470
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,060
Run, and try to join up with the combatants.

471
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,060
As I said, I'm giving up.

472
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:07,770
I'm sick of this pain.

473
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:17,030
It even protects you, now that's convenient.

474
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,780
We should run, too.

475
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:29,670
Is anyone going to reach
the core of the dungeon like this?

476
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,670
I told you.

477
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:35,550
She never intended to pass anyone.

478
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:55,860
We're still lacking quite a lot of information.

479
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,820
We should consider what to do
if the replica doesn't have free will.

480
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:02,370
Though I guess it'll turn into
a pure contest of power, then.

481
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,170
Could you beat it?

482
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,950
Dunno, not sure.

483
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,310
Damn it, I have no idea what they're thinking.

484
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,950
Though, as expected, our matchups are looking good.

485
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:53,710
Ehre would completely overwhelm
the two of us in a pure contest of mana.

486
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:09,810
But I know how to strategize to win.

487
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:24,350
No matter the opponent, no matter the situation.

488
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,690
A contest of power, huh?

489
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:34,540
Um, in that case,

490
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:40,050
I might be able to kill Lady Frieren.

491
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:42,860
Is that so?

492
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,290
Yes.

493
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,300
Alright,

494
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,980
let's make a plan.

495
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,230
And

496
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,230
