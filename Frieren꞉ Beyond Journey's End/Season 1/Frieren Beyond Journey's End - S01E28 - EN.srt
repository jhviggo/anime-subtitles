dawn

278
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:50,880
I know you well, Imperial Mage Denken.

279
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,390
Well, that's an honor.

280
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:58,050
Having worked your way up
from serving with the army,

281
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:02,190
you're now the most influential
mage in the Northern Lands.

282
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,900
It's a tale I often hear of.

283
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,860
To be honest, I would have liked
to meet you when you were young.

284
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,870
Your young days, back when
you were passionate and ambitious.

285
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,790
I have no interest in cinders.

286
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,790
Or so I thought.

287
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,010
You've changed your mind?

288
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:38,760
When you saw me, you thought
about how you'd fight me, didn't you?

289
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,260
Just for a moment. I immediately gave up.

290
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,470
Pass.

291
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,910
Your fire hasn't gone out.

292
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,780
Most people won't even consider fighting me.

293
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,180
Next.

294
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,000
Pass.

295
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,130
We haven't talked about anything yet, though?

296
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,060
Is a conversation necessary?

297
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,860
I guess not.

298
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,770
Next.

299
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,150
You think this is a joke?

300
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,570
What is?

301
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,010
This is the first-rank exam.

302
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,890
What kind of idiot doesn't show up to the venue?

303
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:34,370
For what it's worth, my real body is also at the venue.

304
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,900
Otherwise, I'd be disqualified—

305
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:41,030
Your real body hasn't left your hometown
at any point during the exam, has it?

306
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,510
Enjoying your afternoon tea right now?

307
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,920
I'm surprised.

308
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,250
Even Übel didn't notice.

309
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,050
You've got guts.

310
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,220
Pass.

311
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,720
Next.

312
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,170
The captain of the Northern Mage Corps, Wirbel.

313
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:07,820
The most combat-oriented
of the second-rank mages I know.

314
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,380
You realized you couldn't beat me at first glance.

315
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,600
But that wasn't a judgment born from fear.

316
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,370
I wouldn't even be second-rank
if I picked fights I couldn't win, would I?

317
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,510
I suppose that's true.

318
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,020
Tell me your favorite spell.

319
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,500
Magic is a tool for killing.

320
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,500
There's no liking or disliking it.

321
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,880
Pass.

322
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,260
Next.

323
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,680
What... did you think, looking at me?

324
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,520
Um, I thought you looked small and cute.

325
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,030
What is going on with this year's examinees?

326
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,530
Pass.

327
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,040
Sense.

328
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,450
I should apologize.

329
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,540
We did have a lot of good examinees this year.

330
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,730
I failed.

331
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,050
There's always next time.

332
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,550
Would you stop following me already?

333
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,270
Three years, huh?

334
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,810
Lady Frieren, I passed.

335
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,120
Good job.

336
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,810
Frieren.

337
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:38,190
It's thanks to you I managed to get this far.

338
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,450
Now I can go to my hometown and pay my respects.

339
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,770
I see.

340
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,460
Hey, Fern...

341
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,110
Can we go already?

342
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,560
Let's get this—

343
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,560
Gramps, this—

344
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,120
Hrm.

345
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,440
Eat as much as you like.

346
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,530
I seldom got to eat sweets when I was young.

347
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,820
Thank you very much.

348
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,080
What is this situation?

349
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,300
You have some too, boy.

350
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,110
Thanks, old man.

351
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,520
Who is this?

352
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,640
This is Denken, the Imperial Mage.

353
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,000
Huh, Imperial Mage.

354
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,530
Wait, he's a noble?!

355
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:11,760
Um, apologies for speaking rudely.

356
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,150
I don't mind.

357
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,370
I came to this city as a mage.

358
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:21,120
But you're treating me to all this
even though you don't know me...

359
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,760
It's not like I have a use for all my money.

360
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,580
That can't be true.

361
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,510
He's right, what about your grandchildren?

362
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,860
I have no children, nor grandchildren.

363
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,520
My wife passed away during my mid-twenties.

364
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:42,150
She always had a weak constitution.

365
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:48,600
She was the daughter of a remote
noble family that lost a power struggle.

366
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:54,170
While she languished, I sought out wealth and power.

367
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:58,170
I knew of no other way to save her.

368
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:04,550
She passed away shortly before Serie
started advertising the special privilege

369
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,880
and created the Continental Magic Association.

370
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,720
I've never felt as powerless as then.

371
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:21,440
How ironic that now, entire nations would march on my command.

372
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,690
Fern.

373
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:28,570
Magic was only a tool for politics to me.

374
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:37,330
Could you tell Frieren that she allowed me
to remember how fun magic used to be to me?

375
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:44,210
I became a mage out of admiration
for Frieren of the heroes' party.

376
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,360
Please tell her yourself.

377
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,090
I'm sure she'll be happy to hear it.

378
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,460
You're right.

379
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,100
I'll do that.

380
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:09,600
As expected from the city of magic, Äußerst.

381
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,950
I found lots of good grimoires.

382
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,540
Hey, granny.

383
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,500
They go in this basket, right?

384
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,230
I can't believe you just ignored that.

385
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,810
I thought about it for a moment, you know.

386
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,260
Just a moment, huh?

387
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:39,490
Pretty surprising, for a comrade of Himmel the Hero.

388
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,770
For a comrade of Himmel the Hero?

389
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,820
I'm the one who's surprised.

390
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:51,190
I heard you tried to kill Fern
and her team in the first-stage exam.

391
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,240
Fern was complaining.

392
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,920
She said you looked like the kind of guy who'd kick a dog.

393
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,240
I get told that a lot.

394
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,000
It's just an intimidation tactic.

395
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:07,500
Well, there was someone the world
might have been better off without.

396
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,010
I'll do anything to protect my hometown.

397
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:20,170
The reason I wanted to be a first-rank mage
was for the privilege of getting any spell I asked for.

398
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:25,020
If I obtain a strong spell, it'll make
it that much easier to slaughter demons.

399
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:33,330
But separately from that,
I try to help out people when I can.

400
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,780
Why?

401
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,740
My hometown is a remote village in the north.

402
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,430
There are still many
legends of Himmel the Hero there.

403
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,600
Conquering the Tower of a Thousand Mirrors.

404
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,130
Fighting Böse the Immortal,

405
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,010
or the Hell Emperor Dragon.

406
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:59,690
I loved those tales as a kid.

407
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:06,150
But the elders never talked about those stories.

408
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,320
It was always about defeating
some aggressive monster,

409
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,870
escorting some merchant,

410
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:16,660
or in the worst cases,
even about carrying some crates.

411
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,940
Nothing amazing at all.

412
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,800
Boring stories.

413
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,950
That's what I thought.

414
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:29,960
But the elders all so happily
kept talking about those stories.

415
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,160
After Himmel the Hero died,

416
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,970
and the remaining demons started
rampaging, it got real clear to me.

417
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:54,830
It was true—the Tower of a Thousand Mirrors,
Böse, the Hell Emperor Dragon...

418
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:59,240
even the demon king himself
didn't have much to do with my village.

419
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,740
Everyone had their hands full
protecting their own livelihoods.

420
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:09,630
I'm sure if Himmel the Hero
hadn't come to my village,

421
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:13,940
it wouldn't be around today,
even if the world had found peace.

422
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:17,590
I see. What are you trying to say?

423
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:23,500
What got me this far are those
stupid tales of Himmel the Hero.

424
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,400
That's all I was trying to say.

425
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:33,880
I guess I lost track of time.

426
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:38,320
I'm going home with those guys, in the end.

427
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,780
Frieren.

428
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,040
Treasure your encounters.

429
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,290
Death isn't the only thing
that can part people forever.

430
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,790
But I guess you're well aware of that.

431
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:06,690
Frieren, can't you float
us over with magic one by one?

432
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,770
If I do that, I'll be left on this side by myself.

433
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:16,030
Himmel, we need to defeat
the demon king as quickly as possible.

434
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:19,780
What point is there in this minor errand?

435
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:26,040
You're right, it is a minor errand.

436
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:30,540
I'm sure the world won't change because of this.

437
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:36,900
But if someone in front of me is in need of help,
I have no intention of turning my back on them.

438
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,180
It's alright, Himmel.

439
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,920
The world did change.

440
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:02,530
The special privileges are being awarded tonight,
and we can bring people with us.

441
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:06,210
It's a rare opportunity, so let's all go together.

442
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,830
She's making a really unhappy face.

443
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:16,340
I heard we could bring people with us.

444
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,780
I'm terribly sorry.

445
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:22,840
On Lady Serie's orders, Lady Frieren is banned.

446
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:28,020
You're not to enter the Continental Magic
Association's buildings for a thousand years.

447
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,710
Lady Frieren hasn't even done anything.

448
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,910
That's how it is.

449
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,840
I upset Serie, after all.

450
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,240
She's really such a child.

451
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,230
Well, it's not like I came because I wanted to.

452
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,920
I'll wait outside.

453
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,390
I'll wait outside, too.

454
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,790
Hey!

455
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,850
It's the evening bell.

456
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,770
The conferment should be finished soon.

457
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:11,640
Yeah.

458
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,470
A first-rank mage.

459
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:18,390
The pinnacle of mages, of which
there are less than fifty in the world.

460
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,020
Fern really has come far.

461
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:31,240
I'm sure Fern will become
a more famous mage than me in this age.

462
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,000
Frieren.

463
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:36,900
It feels good.

464
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,880
Yeah, it does.

465
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,750
Lady Frieren.

466
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,450
Who's that?

467
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,890
He's from the Continental Magic Association.

468
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:52,160
I'm Lernen, a first-rank mage.

469
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,140
One of Lady Serie's apprentices.

470
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:59,470
It seems Lady Serie has caused you trouble.

471
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,940
I don't mind.

472
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,150
She's always been like this.

473
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,910
What's up, Frieren?

474
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,130
You can see them, can't you?

475
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,120
The fluctuations in my mana.

476
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,070
What an incredibly powerful mage.

477
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:20,870
You're out of place in this age of peace.

478
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:27,130
Indeed, I'm an outdated mage
who knows nothing but combat.

479
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:30,060
Lady Serie tells me this, too.

480
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:33,440
If I'd been born during
the war with the demon king's army,

481
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,140
I would have carved my name into
history alongside the legendary champions.

482
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,850
I see.

483
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,150
So, what are you here for?

484
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:47,880
The only one of Lady Serie's
apprentices to leave her mark on history

485
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,530
is the Great Mage Flamme, who has passed into myth.

486
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:59,790
Once I die, another testament
of Lady Serie's life will disappear.

487
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:05,200
I don't want to leave her all alone in the future.

488
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:12,930
Even if that is by the infamy of having
taken down the legendary mage, Frieren.

489
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,450
I would like to request a duel, Lady Frieren.

490
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,310
We will not have a duel.

491
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,160
It's a waste of time.

492
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:39,790
Jeez.

493
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:45,290
Mages who know nothing
but combat sure tend to be bad with words.

494
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:49,130
There's no need for you
to leave your mark on history.

495
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,220
Serie will remember you.

496
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,890
One last thing before I leave.

497
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:04,900
These flowers were made with magic.

498
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,150
What of it?

499
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,230
It's the spell Master liked.

500
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,910
Didn't you say it was a stupid spell?

501
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,790
Flamme was a failure, to be honest.

502
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,320
Even as talented as she was,

503
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,090
she couldn't reach my heights.

504
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,790
I took many more apprentices after her.

505
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:37,300
Most of them passed away
without even coming close to my power.

506
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,810
But it's strange.

507
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,560
Even though I took those apprentices on a whim,

508
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:48,280
I still vividly remember both the personality
and favorite spells of each and every one of them.

509
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:56,870
Frieren, for some reason,
I've never regretted taking an apprentice.

510
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:01,080
Even if they didn't leave their mark on history.

511
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:06,620
She can't even honestly convey
her feelings to her apprentices.

512
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,710
She really is a child.

513
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,090
Lady Frieren.

514
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,910
The conferment is over.

515
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,100
Alright, let's go.

516
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,100
Lady Frieren, what happened to your shoulder?

517
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,300
I need to get that healed at the church.

518
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,610
I hope it's still open.

519
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,610
Bad with words, indeed.

520
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,310
Both you and me.

521
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,620
Stark, what are we gonna play today?

522
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,880
Sorry, I can't play with you today.

523
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,630
Stark, have you had breakfast?

524
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,000
Yeah, I have.

525
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,820
Stark, have a cup before you go.

526
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,380
Oh, thanks.

527
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,610
The journey of a warrior is long and fraught.

528
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,140
Take care of yourself.

529
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:04,960
Yeah.

530
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,400
Our time in Äußerst is finally over, huh?

531
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,660
You sure are beloved
no matter where we go, Sir Stark.

532
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,820
Am I?

533
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:21,410
By the way, Fern, what spell did you get yesterday?

534
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,420
Can you tell?

535
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,340
Your clothes are clean.

536
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:38,050
And they have a bit of a floral scent.

537
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,430
Could it be?

538
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:44,460
It's the Spell That Makes Clothes Clean and Fresh.

539
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,510
Doing laundry is going to be easy now.

540
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:50,440
As expected from the living grimoire, Serie.

541
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:55,190
That's a legendary spell,
said to have existed in the age of myth.

542
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,100
I'm proud of you, Fern.

543
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:02,110
That's my apprentice for you.

544
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,990
Of course, Lady Frieren.

545
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:13,010
Lady Serie seemed really unhappy about it, though.

546
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,840
Are you insane?

547
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,680
I can imagine.

548
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,990
Serves her right.

549
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,350
They're here.

550
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,970
Frieren.

551
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:27,990
Thanks a lot.

552
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:33,610
We failed this time, but we're
going to try again in three years.

553
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,110
I see, that's good.

554
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,870
It was fun.

555
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:38,860
Take care of yourself.

556
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,570
See you.

557
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,000
Yeah, see you.

558
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:56,430
This also happened with Sir Sein,

559
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,550
but you really do goodbyes casually.

560
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,380
Same with Kraft.

561
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:15,240
Himmel, you really do goodbyes casually, don't you?

562
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:16,900
Is that weird?

563
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,260
It does seem a little unlike you.

564
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:24,160
Even if it was just a job,
we did travel with him for two whole weeks.

565
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,910
And we had such a good time
drinking with him every night, too!

566
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,910
Sorry excuse for a priest.

567
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,020
That's true.
