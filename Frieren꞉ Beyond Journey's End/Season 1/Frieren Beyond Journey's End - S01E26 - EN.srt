Episode 26: Pinnacle of Magic

279
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,120
It blocked our attack.

280
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,870
Within expectations.

281
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,330
From here on out, it'll be a battle of attrition.

282
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,420
They really are here.

283
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,840
Methode's observations were right.

284
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,680
Don't drag me down.

285
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,360
That's my line.

286
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,480
Methode has determined
the precise locations of the replicas.

287
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,990
If they swarm us, we won't have a chance.

288
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:40,990
We should split up and fend
them off before they gather here.

289
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,720
We've shared our worst matchups.

290
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,880
A bad matchup for you is also
a bad matchup for your replica.

291
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:55,590
Our advantage is being able
to strategize and cooperate.

292
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,470
If we correctly choose our opponents,

293
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,480
we should have the edge in battle.

294
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:20,820
If you cannot beat your opponent
by yourself, outnumber them.

295
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,470
It's almost funny how easily I can fight.

296
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,190
We should be able to keep
the replicas at bay this way.

297
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,750
Okay. As planned, then.

298
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,280
Yes, I wish you luck.

299
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,540
I have one concern.

300
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:13,540
I'm not detecting a replica for every examinee here.

301
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:19,550
In particular, I can't find
our greatest threat, Lady Sense's replica.

302
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,680
Yeah, I can't detect it, either.

303
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,310
We definitely can't overlook Sense's replica.

304
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,700
If we're attacked from behind,
I won't be able to protect Fern.

305
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,010
If worst comes to worst, we both might die.

306
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,470
I haven't been able to locate
Lady Fern's or Sir Denken's replicas, either.

307
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,380
I'll have to search with
more accurate short-range detection.

308
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:48,660
If you weren't here,
this wouldn't be a concern, though.

309
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:56,300
First-rank mages must be able
to weather unreasonable adversity.

310
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,920
This isn't even unreasonable.

311
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,430
Besides, you can pass the exam
just by protecting your allies.

312
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,560
Truly a kind, peaceful exam, don't you think?

313
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,940
We beat them.

314
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,060
Doesn't feel good, though.

315
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,740
An ambush.

316
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,880
Absurd.

317
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,440
I don't believe I ever neglected my mana detection.

318
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,660
Lawine, break your flask, too.

319
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,260
You're mature enough
to know when to give up, right?

320
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,140
There's another exam in three years.

321
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,060
Damn it.

322
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,690
I didn't make it.

323
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,700
Though I imagine my aid
wouldn't have changed the outcome.

324
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,510
Even though it has its back turned,
there's no hint of an opening.

325
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,220
Regardless, I'm going to have to buy some time.

326
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,840
You're the Imperial Mage, Denken, right?

327
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,720
What's the situation?

328
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,570
Are you planning to fight that thing?

329
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,230
I don't think you can win, though?

330
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,730
I'm well aware.

331
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,990
Hey, Denken, do we really need
to fight this to conquer the dungeon?

332
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,110
Frieren is—

333
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,980
I don't need an explanation.

334
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,990
Is it necessary?

335
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,370
It is.

336
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,120
Let me handle it, then.

337
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,190
What are you talking about?

338
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:00,250
Denken is the strongest of us.

339
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,250
And besides, you couldn't even win against Wirbel.

340
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:07,260
That's not really the point, though.

341
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,660
It's true, I'm an inexperienced third-rank mage.

342
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,020
I'm much weaker than Wirbel or Denken.

343
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,500
But I think I can win against Sense.

344
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,020
This is the spell I'm best at.

345
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,780
The Spell That Can Cut Just About Anything: Relseiden.

346
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,280
Anything I believe it can cut, it cuts,

347
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,900
and anything I don't believe it can cut, it doesn't.

348
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,320
What about it?

349
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,170
It's easily blocked by defensive magic.

350
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:44,290
Oh yeah, you were watching
my fight with Wirbel, weren't you?

351
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:49,130
Yeah, defensive magic
is designed to block magic, after all.

352
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,640
I can't really visualize it being cut.

353
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,020
Is that so?

354
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:57,150
Then it won't work on Sense anyway.

355
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,520
Even just counting what I can detect,

356
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,400
several layers of spells equal to defensive
magic have been cast on its hair.

357
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:08,030
Like I said, I don't care about any of that logic.

358
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,720
I'm talking about visualization.

359
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,660
Hey, wait.

360
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,160
Hm.

361
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,410
As expected, Solganiel doesn't work.

362
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,420
Hair is part of one's body, after all.

363
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,920
I can't get its whole body in my field of vision.

364
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,930
Relseiden.

365
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,680
As expected, my replica's opponent is Übel.

366
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,910
The outcome of that fight is clear.

367
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,560
It probably won't even be a real fight.

368
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:48,070
It was during the Second-Rank
Mage Selection Exam two years ago.

369
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:53,950
The first-rank mage, Burg,
was in charge of the exam.

370
00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:00,740
He'd never been wounded
since becoming a first-rank mage.

371
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,710
That's how specialized in defense his magic was.

372
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,500
The Indomitable Cloak,

373
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,980
a cloak he created with his magic,

374
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:13,670
was woven with enough defensive enchantments
to repel all manner of attacks.

375
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:21,730
The rules for passing
the second-stage exam were very simple.

376
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,400
The examinees were to attack Burg's cloak,
and make him take even a single step back.

377
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,900
The reason murder would disqualify examinees,

378
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:36,270
was to make people have a modicum
of restraint, and to protect the other examinees.

379
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,370
Next.

380
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,550
No one was worried about Burg in the least.

381
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,890
Oops, I cut too much.

382
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:05,640
But he was easily killed by a nameless girl,

383
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,780
who had only just become a third-rank mage.

384
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,610
I'm disqualified, right?

385
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,430
I know.

386
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,670
Can I go?

387
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,110
I have one question for you.

388
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,370
Go ahead.

389
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,990
How did you get through the Indomitable Cloak?

390
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:32,160
Um, Lady Sense, have you ever done any sewing?

391
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,380
No. What about it?

392
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,780
You do seem like you come from a good family.

393
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,640
Or do you just do that kind of stuff with magic?

394
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:48,150
Well, you know, I'm kinda clumsy,
so I've never done anything like that either.

395
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:55,990
I used to watch my sister sew a lot.

396
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,620
You see, when cutting cloth,

397
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,960
you start with the scissors like this,

398
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,270
and cut it by sliding them along like this.

399
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,250
It makes a really nice sound.

400
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,410
I loved that sound.

401
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,010
What's your point?

402
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,740
I'm talking about visualization.

403
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,440
Cloth is something you can cut.

404
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,730
Everyone knows that.

405
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,980
She's insane.

406
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,100
It's true, anyone can visualize cutting cloth.

407
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,860
Even an idiot could.

408
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:43,490
But the world of magic isn't that simple.

409
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,190
You cannot use magic to realize
what you cannot perfectly visualize.

410
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:55,000
Much like an ant can't visualize
crushing a giant dragon beneath its feet,

411
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:03,260
there exist almost no mages who can visualize
cutting that cloak with all its enchantments.

412
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:11,400
Because any mage can tell at a glance
that his cloak will repel all manner of attacks.

413
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,400
Even an idiot could tell.

414
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:21,640
Intelligent creatures like humans
cannot escape those limitations.

415
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:26,410
And yet, she acted in accordance with her intuition.

416
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,670
Even though she intellectually
knew the cloak was uncuttable,

417
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:36,170
she followed her intuition, and constructed
an image of herself cutting up the cloak.

418
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:41,140
I cannot imagine her having a human mental state.

419
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,000
She's a savant.

420
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,840
Can I go now?

421
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,770
Yes.

422
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,310
By the way, Lady Sense, your hair is very beautiful.

423
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,070
Taking care of it must be a lot of work.

424
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,720
It's possible I had already lost at that point.

425
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,580
I can't visualize myself winning against Übel.

426
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,700
She's too bad of a match for me.

427
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,100
Everyone uses their head too much.

428
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,220
Hair is something you cut.

429
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,220
Taking care of my hair?

430
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:27,720
It's hell.

431
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,370
I don't even want to think about it.

432
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,310
She should just cut it, then.

433
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:40,480
I get the gist of the situation.

434
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:46,550
So you're buying time
for Frieren to take down Spiegel.

435
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,690
That's correct.

436
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,960
We also took care of three replicas.

437
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,250
That makes things simpler.

438
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:55,840
Well, then—

439
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,380
Oh.

440
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:02,040
It seems Lady Sense's replica was just defeated.

441
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,760
This mana...

442
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,680
it was Übel, the third-rank mage, who did it.

443
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,790
That's surprising.

444
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,060
You think so?

445
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,350
I think it was a pretty bad matchup.

446
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:18,310
Fights between mages are a bit
like rock-paper-scissors, after all.

447
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:23,970
Though an incredibly complicated
and difficult version, with countless different hands.

448
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:28,580
So you want to increase the number
of hands available as much as you can.

449
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,550
We're in.

450
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,870
We'll help stall the replicas.

451
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,840
I'm not one to trust strangers,

452
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,880
but I'm not stupid enough
to not join the winning team.

453
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:49,140
There are still two replicas we definitely
need to stall at the moment.

454
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:55,130
I've located one of them, Sir Denken's replica.

455
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,640
I'll ask you to take care of that one.

456
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:04,900
Please leave the other one,
Lady Fern's replica, to me.

457
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,620
It seems she is especially good at hiding her mana,

458
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:13,790
so if we don't find her, there very well
may be fatalities from an ambush.

459
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,580
Will you really be fine by yourself?

460
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,290
I can focus on mana detection better by myself.

461
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:23,260
She's quite strong, you know.

462
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,040
I'm rather versatile,

463
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,550
so stalling is one thing I'm good at.

464
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:35,430
Moreover, I've confirmed that restraining magic works on her in person.

465
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,480
There.

466
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,310
I can't move.

467
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:40,440
Alright, let's give them what we've got.

468
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,690
Übel, this...

469
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,810
isn't my imagination, is it?

470
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,320
Yeah, I don't think it is.

471
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,700
I mean, you can't move, can you?

472
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:58,460
My replica has regenerated.

473
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,970
You think this is going to continue
until that Spiegel thing is defeated?

474
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:14,220
It's a battle of attrition, this is getting fun.

475
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,470
You can say that again.

476
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,460
Isn't it time to give up?

477
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,890
That gap isn't good enough, either.

478
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,890
Fern doesn't have the experience to notice it.

479
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,130
That leaves me no choice.

480
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:13,510
The gap in mana detection
isn't going to be enough to get the kill.

481
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,760
You're right.

482
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,950
If only the gap was bigger, I could win.

483
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,240
But you would win, right?

484
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,590
Then let's make an opening.

485
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,340
Can you do that?

486
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:31,040
If I show an opening,
it will show an even bigger opening.

487
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,890
But then you will...

488
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:38,580
If I concentrate on defense, it won't be lethal.

489
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:42,270
Then, what's the strategy in that case?

490
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,680
I'll leave it to you.

491
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,570
Whatever you think works, will work.

492
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,230
How can you be so sure about that?

493
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,990
Because I underestimate you.

494
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,400
That's a relief.

495
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,000
We have good odds of winning this fight, then.

496
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,540
It's still standing,

497
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,230
but it's fatally wounded.

498
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:07,230
I need to finish it.

499
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,950
What happened?

500
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,950
Was I attacked?

501
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:22,080
I can't sense any mana.

502
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,710
I can't perceive this attack as magic.

503
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,130
Incredible...

504
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,820
Lady Frieren...

505
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,210
So this is the pinnacle of magic...

506
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,340
But... it's unlike you...

507
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,150
to be so wide open.

508
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,020
You did well, Fern.

509
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,990
I think it's been eighty years
since I was cornered enough to use that.

510
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:15,750
Alright, let's end this.

511
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,150
It's finally over.

512
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,020
I can't move anymore.

513
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,020
Wirbel, give me a piggyback ride.

514
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:38,180
You guys always collapse, don't you?

515
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:51,610
So this is the core of the Ruined King's Tomb.

516
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:56,110
You have conquered the Ruined King's Tomb.

517
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:02,550
This is a historical achievement,
worthy of a first-rank mage.

518
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:09,430
As promised, everyone who has reached
the core passes the second-stage exam.

519
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:15,590
So, where have our foremost contributors gone?

520
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:22,330
It's dark! It's scary!

521
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,640
It's dark and scary...

522
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,200
Well, I kinda get how she feels.

523
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,200
Dark and scary...

524
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:34,470
Well then, the second stage has concluded.

525
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:40,010
And they can even use healing magic!

526
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,400
What do you think, amazing, isn't it?

527
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,190
Who are you?

528
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,170
And

529
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,170
