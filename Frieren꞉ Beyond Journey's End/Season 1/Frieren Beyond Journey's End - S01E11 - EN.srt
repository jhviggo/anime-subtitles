Let's go.

562
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,360
Wait. You don't need to run.

563
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,630
He said he'd pardon everyone.

564
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,350
It must've been a fierce battle,

565
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,850
but they're all in one piece.

566
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,260
You have my gratitude.

567
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:51,100
Thank you for honoring these warriors of the Northern Lands.

568
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,330
I didn't restrain myself last time,
so I got an earful from Himmel afterward.

569
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,390
I can imagine.

570
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,880
As well you should've. I'd be angry, too.

571
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,170
Sir Himmel must've trained you well.

572
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,710
Don't call it "training."

573
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,210
But yeah, that makes sense.

574
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,720
She's the unnatural one.

575
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,910
What do you mean?

576
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,460
Don't mind me.

577
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,610
Fern.

578
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,060
Stark.

579
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,840
Good job defeating Lügner.

580
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,570
I'm proud of you.

581
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,910
It would've been even better
if you weren't all beat up.

582
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,080
Isn't this normal for a warrior, though?

583
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,140
What is normal?

584
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,700
You're covered in wounds.

585
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,410
Give them a proper burial.

586
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,620
I'll escort those three back to town.

587
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,330
Yes, sir.

588
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:51,960
Milord.

589
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,000
What is it?

590
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,020
Frieren.

591
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,730
I've never been as grateful to someone as I am today.

592
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:32,150
Frieren. I did indeed say I would
grant you any reward within my power.

593
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:38,130
You asked for the Great Mage Flamme's
grimoire on the city's barrier,

594
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:43,140
handed down in my family for generations.

595
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,520
Are you sure this is what you want?

596
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,640
This grimoire is—

597
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,050
A fake.

598
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,490
That's right.

599
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:58,930
It has nothing whatsoever to do with the
oral traditions of this city's barrier magic.

600
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,610
I'm entirely aware, milord.

601
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,390
This is merely a hobby of mine.

602
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,160
I see.

603
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:10,100
Anyway, you don't need to be so formal.

604
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,740
I must be but an infant to your eyes.

605
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:18,420
I learned this lesson the hard way
when setting off to defeat the demon king.

606
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,260
I remember Sir Heiter mentioning that.

607
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,040
Apparently, disrespecting
Capital nobles is punishable by death.

608
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:31,120
Himmel and Eisen disrespected
the king and were nearly executed.

609
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,730
This takes me back.
I still remember Himmel's wailing.

610
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,670
The death penalty? That's so overkill.

611
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,100
Oh, and brat.

612
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,660
Not addressing me with respect
is a severe crime in this city.

613
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,290
Sorry, old man.

614
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,560
I'm gonna break this expensive-looking chair.

615
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,080
The Central Lands sure are
barbaric, aren't they, milord?

616
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,960
Not like this!

617
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,760
I've cut down the tree in the back garden.

618
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,830
Good work.

619
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,970
Ah, well, what I said back then
was just an excuse to get you to run away.

620
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,850
There's no law to sentence people to prison
just for a lack of respect in this city.

621
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,240
You can relax.

622
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,880
If that's how it is...

623
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,170
Isn't that great, Sir Stark?

624
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,870
He fainted.

625
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,500
I've told the people about your victory over Aura.

626
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,100
Everyone wants to thank our champions.

627
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,700
Please take your time and relax.

628
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,040
He's floating.

629
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:00,270
It wasn't that big of a deal.

00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:25,070
ded

847
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:25,070
on

848
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,070
I've got everything we need.

849
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,170
Shall we go, then?

850
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,080
Already setting off, Frieren?

851
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,440
Lord Granat.

852
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,330
I'll see you to the gate.

853
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,330
Frieren.

854
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:48,090
I hear you're heading to Ende, in the far north,
where the demon king's castle lies.

855
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:54,350
But the situation in the Northern Plateau
is looking quite dire at the moment.

856
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,700
Entry onto the plateau is restricted.

857
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:02,860
I've heard that even adventurers are
required to have a first-rank mage with them.

858
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,860
Since we have Lady Frieren
with us, we should be fine, then.

859
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,790
What's this first-rank mage thing?

860
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,350
You don't know?

861
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:17,140
It's a certification from the
Continental Magic Association.

862
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,310
A certification?

863
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,620
I acquired one just before we left the holy city.

864
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,750
See?

865
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,310
It's my third-rank mage certificate.

866
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,200
Oh yeah, so that's what you were doing back there.

867
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,590
This is the latest in certifications, huh?

868
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:37,180
Lady Frieren, don't tell me
you're an unlicensed mage?

869
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,390
Don't make me sound like some back-alley doctor.

870
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:44,470
Look, the institutions governing
mages change all the time.

871
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,400
I can't be bothered to get every new certification.

872
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,280
It's not like I can use this
mark of the holy staff anymore, right?

873
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:55,590
What kind of relic is that?

874
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:59,080
Even I know about the
Continental Magic Association.

875
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,000
It's been around for
at least half a century, you know?

876
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,790
That's quite recent.

877
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:09,210
It's a real bother how they
keep changing the standards.

878
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,010
Anyway, we won't be able to travel on like this.

879
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,960
I'm not sure about the specifics,

880
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,640
but there's a place in the Northern Lands that hosts
the first-rank certification exam, isn't there?

881
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,810
Yes, in the Northern Lands'
largest city of magic, Äußerst.

882
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:30,490
It's far beyond the Schwer Mountains.

883
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:35,270
You can follow the highway there,
but it will be a long journey.

884
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:43,460
Frieren. House Granat will never forget this debt.

885
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,440
Have a safe journey.

886
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,790
It's snowing.

887
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,490
Looks like winter is here.

888
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,110
Winter can be harsh around here.

889
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,330
You'll die if you underestimate it.

890
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,110
It's that dangerous?

891
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,610
You don't know?

892
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,120
The most prolific killer in the war
with the demon king's army

893
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,970
was the winter in the Northern Lands.

894
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,640
See? We're lost.

895
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,720
Now what?

896
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,970
Episode 11: Winter in the Northern Lands

897
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,480
We're lost.

898
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,980
28 years after the death

899
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,980
of Himmel the Hero

900
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,980
Northern Lands,

901
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,980
Decke Region

902
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,980
I can't believe we got stranded
before we even got to the Schwer Mountains.

903
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,660
Sir Stark, wake up!

904
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,740
You'll die if you sleep!

905
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,890
Was the Jumbo Berry Special
really this small, though?

906
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,370
As if I'd know!

907
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,840
What should we do?

908
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:13,260
We can't float him with magic in this wind.

909
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,240
He'd probably get blown away.

910
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,130
I guess we'll just have to carry him.

911
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,190
So heavy.

912
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,400
Why is he so heavy?

913
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,150
Smells good...

914
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,960
Can I leave him?

915
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,030
Bear with it.

916
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,760
There should be a cabin at the base of the mountain.

917
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,780
That's information from eighty years ago, isn't it?

918
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,900
Are you sure it's still there?

919
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,290
Thank goodness.

920
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:57,190
Looks like it's still being regularly maintained.

921
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,570
It sounds like someone's inside.

922
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,770
It seems we're not alone.

923
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,570
Either way, let's get inside.

924
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,940
We'll freeze over at this rate.

925
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,760
Yeah, this is good!

926
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,030
I'm warming up!

927
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,660
Excuse us.

928
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:34,790
Lady Frieren, this place is no good.
Let's search for someplace else.

929
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,660
Huh, why?

930
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,760
There's a freak inside.

931
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,680
A freak? I'm offended.

932
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,550
Let's go, Lady Frieren.

933
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,290
Wait, you're an elf?

934
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,320
It's been around three hundred years
since I've met another of my kind.

935
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:02,090
I was convinced we'd gone extinct.

936
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,560
Me, too.

937
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,710
Thanks for the fire, young lady.

938
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,330
You're welcome.

939
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,700
I'm quite lucky to have met some mages.

940
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,210
The goddess must have guided us.

941
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,440
I came over the Schwer Mountains,

942
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,180
but I let my fire go out in this blizzard.

943
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:25,730
I was keeping myself alive
in this freezing cabin by doing squats.

944
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,310
Makes sense.

945
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,220
I don't really get it.

946
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,980
I'm Kraft the Monk.

947
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,420
I'm Frieren the Mage.

948
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,590
Likewise, Fern the Mage.

949
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,730
This is Sir Stark the Warrior.

950
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,760
A journey to Aureole.

951
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,660
To heaven, huh?

952
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,950
It's good to be pious.

953
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,560
I'm somewhat doubtful, though.

954
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,450
Lady Frieren.

955
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,860
Sir Stark's body temperature...

956
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:04,220
It's warm and comfortable.

957
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,460
And that huge Jumbo Berry Special...

958
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,230
What happened to me?

959
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,620
There was a blizzard...

960
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,620
Who's this old dude?!

961
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,880
What's the noise about?

962
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:46,630
What's with that attitude when
I went out of my way to warm you up?

963
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,670
Warm me up?

964
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:53,580
Old man, you've got an amazing body.

965
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,610
Sir Stark.

966
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,640
I mean, like,

967
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:00,650
it's a well-trained, impressive body.

968
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,080
You're ridiculously strong, aren't you?

969
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,030
What's your name, old man?

970
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,910
Kraft the Monk.

971
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,380
I've never heard of you.

972
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,210
But you must be a renowned monk, right?

973
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:20,000
Stark, you stay here and rest.

974
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,370
Can the other two help me carry in provisions?

975
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:26,770
My cart and supplies are nearby.

976
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,010
I'm truly glad I met you.

977
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,900
Now we should be able
to use these frozen provisions.

978
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,390
Have as many of them as you like.

979
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,570
Looks like there's plenty here.

980
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:44,150
Trying to cross the Schwer
Mountains now would be suicide.

981
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,320
I guess we'll be stuck here for a bit.

982
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:53,840
By the way, Frieren. Have you heard of me?

983
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,060
Not at all.

984
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,470
I thought as much.

985
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:59,160
I've also never heard anything about you.

986
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,370
She's the mage of the heroes' party.

987
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,120
And before that?

988
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,010
What are you trying to say?

989
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:10,510
That we're elves.

990
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,560
It'll be six months soon.

991
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:07,570
I made it through the Northern Lands'
long winter thanks to you guys.

992
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,210
Here.

993
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,560
Give this to Fern.

994
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,330
She's a good, pious child.

995
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,470
It's gotta be the influence of being raised by a priest.

996
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,690
She's always grateful to the goddess.

997
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:28,420
Why do you believe in the goddess?

998
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,800
Sounds like you don't believe in her.

999
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:37,610
Except for in the age of myths,

1000
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:43,690
the Goddess of Creation hasn't shown herself
once in the long history of this world.

1001
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,390
You're still young, huh?

1002
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,950
I was like that a long time ago.

1003
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,570
But now I believe in the goddess
from the bottom of my heart.

1004
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:57,070
Rather, I need her to exist.

1005
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:04,300
Anyone who knew of
my righteous deeds is long dead.

1006
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:10,310
That's why I'm going to have
the goddess praise me in heaven when I die.

1007
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,840
"You did well, Kraft."

1008
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,960
"You lived a magnificent life."

1009
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,980
You get that, don't you?

1010
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:31,230
No one remembering the path
you've walked is just too cruel.

1011
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:36,240
We've lived a long time to get here.

1012
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:42,800
Kraft, that's just our selfish desire.

1013
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,120
I suppose so.

1014
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:50,250
Is heaven too but a selfish desire, Frieren?

1015
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,880
Well, whatever.

1016
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:01,760
Tell me about your past. I'll tell you about mine.

1017
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,740
If you say you don't believe in her,

1018
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,550
then I'll praise you in her stead.

1019
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,030
You're surprised?

1020
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:20,030
I didn't expect you to be donating
to the reconstruction of this orphanage.

1021
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,920
How candid.

1022
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,410
I was an orphan too, after all.

1023
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:36,550
I'm sure the goddess will praise me
for having lived a pure and just life.

1024
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,160
And you say this while drinking booze,
you sorry excuse for a priest.

1025
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,060
Frieren.

1026
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,560
Do you have anyone to praise you?

1027
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,060
Where'd that come from?

1028
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:54,350
It seems you don't believe in the goddess.

1029
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,410
So if you tell me about your past,

1030
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,520
I'll praise you in her stead.

1031
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:03,210
I've just been dallying my time away.

1032
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,830
There's nothing to praise me for.

1033
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,830
Even though you're limiting your mana at all times?

1034
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,590
I would think that to be the fruit of a grueling effort.

1035
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,220
One that you would have to dedicate your life to.

1036
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,360
You've noticed?

1037
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,600
How many years do you think
we've been traveling together?

1038
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:28,980
It's not a very fun story.

1039
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,580
I don't mind.

1040
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,600
Besides, it'll be a good reference for me.

1041
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,230
How so?

1042
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:39,610
It's possible my child might become a mage.

1043
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,170
Priests are celibate for life, aren't they?

1044
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,950
Why is everyone who serves the goddess so weird?

1045
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,380
I'll pass. Someone else has already praised me.

1046
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,510
I see. You have some good friends.

1047
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,990
Cherish them.

1048
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,520
No, he's already...

1049
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,530
He's already in heaven.

1050
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:22,640
Then you'll get to see him eventually.

1051
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:24,840
Yeah.

1052
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,040
I'm going this way.

1053
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:33,510
Frieren, I don't believe this to be a final farewell.

1054
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:35,920
I'll see you in a couple hundred years.

1055
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:42,920
Take care, old man! It's been fun!

1056
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:47,280

to piss off

1499

of our village's strongest warrior.

1500
