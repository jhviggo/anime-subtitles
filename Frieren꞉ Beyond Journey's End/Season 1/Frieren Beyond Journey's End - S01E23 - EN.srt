00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,700
First off, let me congratulate the eighteen of you

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,200
Second Exam — Examiner

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,200
Sense — First-Rank Mage

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,200
on passing the first-stage exam.

7
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:21,960
I've been hearing quite a lot of speculation
regarding the exams I've headed.

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,870
I'm sure some of you
have heard these rumors as well.

9
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,130
But there's no need to be nervous.

10
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,210
The exam is very straightforward.

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,350
Anyone aiming to be a first-class mage
should be able to get through it without issue.

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,140
I will now explain the specifics
of the second-stage exam.

dawn

287
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,990
Episode 23: Conquering a Dungeon

288
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,870
For the second-stage exam,
you will conquer a dungeon.

289
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:26,150
You will be conquering the Ruined King's Tomb.

290
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,060
There is just one requirement to pass.

291
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,940
You must reach the core of the Ruined King's Tomb.

292
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,790
I'm a pacifist; I don't like conflict.

293
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:43,520
Thus, all who reach the core will pass.

294
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,690
Wait.

295
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:50,270
This is an uncleared dungeon,
from which many adventurers have not returned.

296
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,250
Do you intend to fail everyone again?

297
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,530
What do you mean?

298
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,410
We're looking for the pinnacle of mages.

299
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,690
Achieving the impossible
is what makes a first-rank mage.

300
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:09,090
The uncleared and uncharted
are no issue to the first-rank mage.

301
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:15,330
How should we prove that we reached the core?

302
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,010
Should we bring back coin or treasures?

303
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,000
There is no need for you to prove it.

304
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,640
I will accompany you to the core.

305
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,520
Though, naturally, I won't be helping you examinees.

306
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:32,650
I will also give each of you one of these flasks.

307
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:39,170
They're escape golems, developed
by the first-rank mage Lernen.

308
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:45,550
If you break the flask, a golem
will appear and carry you out of the dungeon.

309
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,580
They're prototypes, but should be sufficiently safe.

310
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,330
You will fail the exam if you use it,

311
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:57,140
but if you feel you can't continue
due to injuries or the like, don't hesitate to use it.

312
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:00,720
I don't condone the deaths of promising talent.

313
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,600
The flasks will also break
automatically at dawn tomorrow.

314
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,480
That is the time limit for the second exam.

315
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,980
The exam starts now.

316
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,320
There are multiple entrances.

317
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,510
Looks like the dungeon dates to the Unified Dynasty.

318
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,780
Dungeons of that age
always have multiple entrances,

319
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,580
which are all connected to the core.

320
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,650
If we investigate each of them,

321
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,770
we should be able to get a rough idea of the dungeon's layout.

322
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,280
We should all split up and—

323
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,030
Why are you assuming we'll work together?

324
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,040
There is no need for conflict in this exam.

325
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,290
We will fare better if we all cooperate.

326
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,540
That's out of the question.

327
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,050
Unlike the first exam, the survival
of allies isn't a requirement to pass.

328
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,550
Grouping up doesn't mean
you're obligated to save anyone,

329
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:27,530
and you even risk being sacrificed
when push comes to shove.

330
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,440
You especially seem pretty
knowledgeable about dungeons.

331
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,260
I'll go by myself.

332
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,250
Well, considering what happened in the first exam,

333
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,860
it'll be hard to team up
with people we don't really know.

334
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,260
Let's go.

335
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,540
Wait a moment.

336
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,570
Fools.

337
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,690
To think they don't understand
how advantageous teaming up is.

338
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,880
Let's go, Fern.

339
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,570
Are you sure, Lady Frieren?

340
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,350
There's no cooperation to be had here.

341
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,200
Not after that display.

342
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,950
Hm.

343
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,580
Well then, I will follow you two.

344
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:39,020
I feel like you'll reach the core with the least trouble.

345
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,950
Don't get in the way.

346
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,290
I won't.

347
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,970
I will neither hinder nor help.

348
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,260
This is the safest path.

349
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,530
Let's proceed carefully while we map out the place.

350
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,370
That stone there...

351
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,540
It's a trap, so be careful.

352
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:27,050
You really are knowledgeable about dungeons.

353
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,210
That wasn't always the case,

354
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,950
but Himmel liked dungeons.

355
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,190
We explored a lot of them
on monster extermination requests.

356
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,570
What do you mean, he liked dungeons?

357
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,070
Just what I said.

358
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,820
He said they excited him.

359
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,080
Doesn't make sense, does it?

360
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,760
It's the staircase to the next floor.

361
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,630
I see, so this path's a dud.

362
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,690
Let's go back to that last fork.

363
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,230
Indeed.

364
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:11,980
Why? Our target is the monster
at the core of the dungeon.

365
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,220
When will you learn, Eisen?

366
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,760
You're meant to fully clear each
floor of the dungeon before proceeding.

367
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,690
That's common sense for adventurers.

368
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,320
Think you mean "uncommon nonsense."

369
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,310
You think I'm a clown, don't you?

370
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:35,940
Isn't it best if we can
have fun while helping people?

371
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,360
It's not always going to be this easy.

372
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,170
Dungeons are going to become more dangerous as we go on.

373
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:42,500
Yeah, what she said.

374
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,590
I'm going to enjoy this until the end.

375
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,760
We'll have fun adventuring, exploring dungeons,

376
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,760
defeating monsters, searching for treasures...

377
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,760
And before we know it, we'll have saved the world.

378
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,370
That's the kind of journey I want.

379
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,110
Besides,

380
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:06,530
there might be a rare
grimoire at the other side of the fork.

381
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,480
What are you waiting for? Let's hurry.

382
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,700
It really doesn't make sense, does it?

383
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,090
Let's go, Kanne.

384
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,650
It's only the five of us left, huh?

385
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:50,630
If we had all cooperated and divided roles,

386
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,490
we would have had a good chance
of conquering this place.

387
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,240
We had enough skilled mages here to do it.

388
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:03,030
Denken, not everyone can be that rational about it.

389
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,360
You said it yourself at the end of the first exam.

390
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,760
It must've rubbed them the wrong way.

391
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:17,640
Just think of it as only
the smartest of us remaining.

392
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,190
At the very least,

393
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:24,770
there's no one here who would drag us down
by falling for a simple trap like a mimic.

394
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,370
Isn't that good enough?

395
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:32,150
As if anyone in this exam would be that foolish.

396
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,120
Let's go.

397
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,350
This mana...

398
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,910
It might be a grimoire.

399
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,550
Lady Frieren, you saw me check
this chest with Miekheit, right?

400
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,680
It's a mimic.

401
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:01,400
Fern, that spell is accurate 99% of the time.

402
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,430
What about it?

403
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:11,320
There are historical discoveries that were only
made because great mages caught on to that last 1%.

404
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,190
I'm sure of it.

405
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,080
There's a precious grimoire in here.

406
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:28,080
My experience as a mage is telling me so.

407
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,010
It's dark! It's scary!

408
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,850
So scary!

409
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,850
So dark and scary!

410
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,990
I may have picked the wrong people to follow.

411
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,500
Don't step on the center of the floor.

412
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,840
The ceiling will come falling down.

413
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,920
Is that human-shaped stain there...

414
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:24,220
That's brutal. Even the bones are gone.

415
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,400
Gargoyles!

416
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:47,040
Denken, someone was trapped.

417
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,970
I know.

418
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,230
She's on the other side of that wall.

419
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,310
Stand back.

420
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,820
It's no use, after all.

421
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,570
Nothing we can do.

422
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,570
Break the flask!

423
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,610
Wow.

424
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,350
We've lost one already, huh?

425
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,850
The slightest misstep can be fatal.

426
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,240
This is the Ruined King's Tomb, huh?

427
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,740
Hey, Fern, listen.

428
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,250
Stop pulling for a minute before I split in half.

429
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,850
Alright.

430
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,270
At times like this,
you have to push instead of pull.

431
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:04,130
The mimic will go bleh and stop biting down.

432
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,890
What are they, dogs?

433
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,130
I'm saved.

434
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,520
Geez.

435
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,080
What did you do when you were by yourself?

436
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,280
I'd blow them up
with offensive magic from the inside.

437
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:26,970
But it makes my hair all frizzy, so I don't like doing it.

438
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:28,030
I'm home.

439
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,160
My hair turned into drills.

440
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,970
So that's why your hairstyle
changes every now and then.

441
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,420
Why?

442
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,090
Well, let's put that behind us,

443
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,960
and continue exploring.

444
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,100
Those are Gargoyles.

445
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,230
Let's defeat them before they move.

446
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:01,990
These medals are all over the place, aren't they?

447
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,990
I think there's an eccentric who collects these.

448
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,720
This seems like the right path, so let's turn back.

449
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,830
Why?

450
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,960
This is going surprisingly smoothly.

451
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:24,570
It does seem strange for an uncleared dungeon.

452
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:27,710
The core should be close, too, considering the layout.

453
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,030
Either way, we can't let our guard down.

454
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,470
Let's take a break once we find
the next burial chamber.

455
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,770
We found some pretty good stuff.

456
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,860
It just looks like junk to me.

457
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,860
Hm.

458
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,350
I don't understand.

459
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,870
Truly.

460
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,110
How does stuff like that make her happy?

461
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,260
She's rubbing her face on it...

462
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,070
You're the one I don't understand, Fern.

463
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:08,660
I've never seen a mage
as young as you with such skill.

464
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,550
You must have trained quite a lot.

465
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:15,770
Yet I don't sense any passion
or determination in you.

466
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:17,140
You're a strange girl.

467
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:26,440
I became a full-fledged mage
to repay my debt to someone.

468
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,450
That was my life's goal at the time,

469
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:34,570
so I gave it my all,

470
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,520
never once thinking about what would come after.

471
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:47,010
I must've used up all my
passion and determination back then.

472
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:52,590
Then why do you continue to pursue magic?

473
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,630
Lady Frieren looks like she's having fun, doesn't she?

474
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,180
That she does.

475
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,190
The first time I entered a dungeon,

476
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:10,410
Lady Frieren was smiling about
the junk artifacts she was collecting.

477
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,160
I couldn't help but smile with her.

478
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:26,190
I think the reason I pursue magic is because
I enjoy seeing her be so passionate about it.

479
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,940
Let's move on.

480
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,560
Following you two was the right choice, after all.

481
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,100
I'm sure you'll be able to enjoy
even this grueling dungeon.

482
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,060
The ambience has changed.

483
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,550
The core might be close.

484
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,780
Wirbel.

485
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,810
What, can't walk anymore?

486
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,520
I've been restrained.

487
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,400
There are three mages with hidden mana.

488
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,670
It's an ambush.

489
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,320
Scharf, block their line of sight.

490
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,070
The spell cast on Ehre is Solganiel.

491
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,990
I'm aware.

492
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,550
No wonder the Ruined King's Tomb is impenetrable.

493
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,240
I sure wasn't expecting something like this.

494
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,310
Scharf, you take me.

495
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,560
Ehre, go for Scharf.

496
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,890
I'll crush Ehre.

497
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,570
Let's do this shit.

498
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:58,990
Replicas made with magic.

499
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,490
The work of a monster or demon, I imagine.

500
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:07,870
I've never seen such a perfect non-personal replica.

501
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,750
It was equal to Laufen in both mana and skill.

502
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,080
It even carried itself the same.

503
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,760
It might be exploiting your memories.

504
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,690
Not a great feeling.

505
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:27,700
Being able to tell they're fake
at a glance is the only saving grace.

506
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:31,900
At least we don't have to worry about friendly fire.

507
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:38,120
If the caster of this spell
can manipulate multiple replicas at once,

508
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,640
they'll make a terrifying threat.

509
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:47,790
Either way, we were right to group up.

510
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,590
It gives us more countermeasures against them.

511
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,070
Denken, do you have
any countermeasures against that?

512
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,260
Let's just say,

513
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,250
if this wasn't an exam, I would
have long since broken the flask.

514
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,150
And

515
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,150
I'm

516
