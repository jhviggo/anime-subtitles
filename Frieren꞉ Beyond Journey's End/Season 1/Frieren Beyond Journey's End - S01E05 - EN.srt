1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:02,730
Frieren.

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,240
Go find Aureole and talk with Himmel.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,240
At the far northern edge of the continent,

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,040
I arrived at the place
the people of this world call heaven:

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,870
Aureole, the land where souls rest.

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,750
It was a place where many souls gathered,

7
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,300
and where I was able
to converse with my old comrades.

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,140
Sorry about this.

9
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,890
It'll be a long journey.

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,980
It took us ten years.

11
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,350
I see.

12
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:46,110
It's the same path that the heroes' party
took to the Demon King's castle, isn't it?

13
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,540
Yeah.

14
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,290
A mere ten-year adventure.

15
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,500
One hundredth, huh?

16
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,010
Frieren, are you not going to stay in the capital?

17
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,180
I'll continue my journey.

18
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,680
By yourself?

19
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,510
It's nice and easy.

20
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,350
You won't take an apprentice or something?

21
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,270
It's better to have someone to talk to on a journey.

22
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,020
It would be a waste of time.

23
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,780
Even if I teach them a bunch,
they'll die soon anyways.

24
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,660
Frieren, that's not what
making relationships is about.

25
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,080
It is.

26
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,420
Our adventure made up less than
a hundredth of my life, too.

27
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,630
Oh, yeah, I did say that.

28
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,090
It's kind of funny.

29
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,720
What is?

30
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,970
That "one hundredth." It changed you.

31
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,570
Well then, see you.

32
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,110
Yeah, see you.

33
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,660
It's been half my life, you know.

34
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,630
The time I've spent with you.

35
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,380
It's only going to get longer from here on.

So if I become a bad girl,
I can get you to come haunt me?

599

You've gotten shrewd, haven't you?

Just who do you take after?

601
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,890
I take that back.

602
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:52,900
If you're a good girl,
I just might come and haunt you a little.

603

We're almost there.

00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,390
You two are planning to
take the mountain pass, aren't you?

616
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,850
You should reconsider.

617
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,730
There's already been several disappearances.

618
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,900
Did monsters show up or something?

619
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,360
I hear they were abducted by ghosts.

620
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,450
There are eyewitnesses, too.

621
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,200
Could be the undead.

622
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,740
Do you know what they looked like?

623
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,790
I'm afraid not.

624
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,790
If you're interested,
why don't you try asking around?

625
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,760
So to summarize,

626
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,350
ghosts of deceased friends or family were seen,

627
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,640
all of them looking the same as when they were alive.

628
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,770
Some of them even started talking.

629
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,070
Sounds like they're not undead, then.

630
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,480
They're not?

631
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,450
Undead is the general term
for corpses controlled by magic.

632
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,990
Like zombies or skeletons.

633
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,830
But these are mimicking
the appearances of the living.

634
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,420
You wouldn't mistake a corpse like that.

635
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:42,090
This is an entirely different type of monster.

636
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,340
Sounds like you have an idea?

637
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:51,970
They're rather vile; we should try to avoid them.

638
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,900
We'll leave first thing in the morning.

639
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:01,610
Lady Frieren, the villagers are in trouble.

640
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,950
You sound like Himmel and the others.

641
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,700
Unlike you, I'm a good girl.

642
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,200
Well, if you want to help, sure.

643
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,290
We'll be taking the mountain pass either way.

644
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,560
This is where the villagers have been disappearing.

645
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:40,230
Any clues...? Looks like more than enough.

646
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,360
There are traces left behind from magic use.

647
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,360
Yeah. What kind of magic do you think it was?

648
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,820
Illusionary magic.

649
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:57,750
I read a book on magical ecology that said
there are monsters that use illusions to lure in prey.

650
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,630
Einsam.

651
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:05,010
They're particularly cunning
and insatiable among their kind,

652
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,510
as they have an abnormal diet
composed only of humans.

653
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:11,640
They show people illusions
of the dead to lure them in.

654
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,640
Is that enough to trick people?

655
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,940
They use people that were important to their targets.

656
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:27,030
Their illusions aren't a threat to mages, though.

657
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:32,530
They'll easily disperse if you hit them
with dense mana, like that of offensive magic.

658
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,910
So we just need to blast the illusions, right?

659
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,370
Could you?

660
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,000
Of course.

661
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,880
Since I'd already know it was fake.

662
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:49,220
I once blasted an illusion of
my master begging for her life.

663
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,140
Well, I was used to hearing her beg for her life,

664
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,310
so I didn't feel that guilty about it.

665
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,770
That said, it was quite unpleasant.

666
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:05,020
What do you mean, you were
used to hearing her beg for her life?

667
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,030
It's gotten foggy.

668
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,660
They're close.

669
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,950
If an illusion shows up, don't hesitate.

670
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,460
Fern.

671
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:34,010
There it is. An illusion of the dead.

672
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,260
I'm not disturbed.

673
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:39,730
I can blast it.

674
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:45,610
You've become quite the mage, haven't you?

675
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:53,490
Since you were a good girl,
I came to haunt you a little.

676
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,740
My memories.

677
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,710
It seems you chose well in becoming a mage.

678
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:05,130
You've always loved magic.

679
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,090
It's using my memories.

680
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,510
You were so happy when I gave you that staff.

681
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,710
What a cruel thing to do.

682
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,010
These are precious memories to me.

683
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,010
You slept with it every night.

684
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,140
Fern?

685
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,140
No good, huh?

686
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,150
So, Himmel shows up now.

687
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,910
I'd assumed Master would show up again.

688
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:40,160
I guess that means I've changed a bit.

689
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:46,670
Frieren. Blast me.

690
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,000
Yeah.

691
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,420
That is what Himmel would say.

692
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,110
There's that danger taken care of.

693
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,950
Lady Frieren.

694
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,950
That was an illusion of Sir Heiter.

695
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,080
A fake.

696
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,460
Yeah.

697
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,460
Let's go see the real one next.

698
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,420
We're heading for Aureole, after all.

699
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,140
Indeed.

700
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:48,730
28 years after the death

701
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:48,730
of Himmel the Hero

702
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:48,730
Central Lands,

703
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:48,730
Riegel Canyon

704
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:48,730
28 years after the death

705
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:48,730
of Himmel the Hero

706
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:48,730
Central Lands,

707
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:48,730
Riegel Canyon

708
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,230
So, that's a dragon?

709
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,690
It's my first time seeing one.

710
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,030
Look at the nest.

711
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,410
There's a grimoire.

712
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,660
I've been looking for that one.

713
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,660
You sure do love grimoires.

714
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,210
But why is it there?

715
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:12,920
Dragons build their nests with mana-rich materials.

716
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,800
That's a Crimson Dragon.

717
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,930
It's eaten countless adventurers,

718
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,390
so it would be good to get rid of it.

719
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,310
Be careful not to hit the nest.

720
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,060
Yes.

721
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,030
Lady Frieren, that didn't seem to do much...

722
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,370
Dragons are tough, after all.

723
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,910
Oh well, let's run.

724
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,640
We finally lost it.

725
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,810
It flies fast, huh?

726
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,940
I guess an aerial fight isn't on the table, either.

727
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,490
I... I thought I was going to die.

728
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:19,700
Well, let's head back.

729
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:23,740
If we keep this up, we're bound to beat it eventually.

730
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,460
Yeah, I guess not.

731
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,130
Playing tag with a dragon
isn't the way of a mage, is it?

732
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:41,340
Well, let's go get that warrior, then.

733
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,800
For our vanguard?

734
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,600
Yeah, you were looking for someone, right?

735
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:54,100
There's a warrior named Stark
in a village by the Riegel Canyon.

736
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,610
Pick him up on your way
to the Northern Lands, will you?

737
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,820
He's my apprentice.

738
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,360
Oh? Is he a good warrior?

739
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,880
You wouldn't think there was a dragon
around here from the atmosphere.

740
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,380
Yeah.

741
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:27,640
Lady Frieren, what kind of magic
does that grimoire contain?

742
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,390
Magic that lets you see through clothes.

743
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,860
You really do collect a lot of weird magic.

744
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,530
It's my hobby, after all.

745
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,900
But it does have practical use.

746
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:48,160
Depending on what you consider
to be clothes, hidden weapons—

747
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:50,410
Could I have a moment of your time, dear travelers?

748
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,290
Sir Stark would like to see you.

749
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,210
Looks like we won't need to go searching for him.

750
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:07,550
That dragon attacked the village
about three years ago.

751
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:19,060
That's when Sir Stark appeared.

752
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:23,440
He steadfastly stared down the dragon

753
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,200
until it flew away after a long standoff.

754
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,540
Because he's stayed here since,

755
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:37,920
the dragon hasn't attacked us,
and we've been able to live in peace.

756
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,550
So if we can get Sir Stark's help,

757
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,300
it sounds like we can defeat the dragon.

758
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,090
Hopefully.

759
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:52,140
Can I become a strong warrior like you?

760
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,100
For sure.

761
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,350
But, being a warrior isn't as great as it sounds.

762
00:15:58,770 --> 00:15:59,860
Grandma!

763
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,200
So, you're the ones who messed with the dragon.

764
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:15,700
Don't provoke it; it's a danger to this village.

765
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,460
Dragons are far scarier than you can imagine.

766
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:26,170
This scar is from a fight with an Umbral Dragon where—

767
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,970
That scar isn't anything impressive.

768
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,350
Did Master send you?

769
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,720
Who are you?

770
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,730
Frieren the Mage.

771
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,900
Grandma, give us some space.

772
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,530
It's fine, they're my master's friends.

773
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,870
Master was angry, wasn't he?

774
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,620
I did leave without telling him.

775
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:02,040
Stark, why don't you defeat the dragon?

776
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,460
You have no reason to stay in this village, do you?

777
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:08,050
Can you tell me why you're here first?

778
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:11,890
I'm not going back to my master's place.

779
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,430
I want you to be the vanguard for our party.

780
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:20,020
Starting off by helping us
eliminate the Crimson Dragon, I guess.

781
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,480
I want the grimoire in its nest.

782
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,150
What for?

783
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:27,650
For my hobby. No particular reason.

784
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,610
It's a Crimson Dragon.

785
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:33,410
You don't just fight them for no reason.

786
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,870
Wow, amazing!

787
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,670
You're right.

788
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:49,840
There once was an idiot
who praised my magic collection.

789
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,340
I guess that's my reason.

790
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,140
Praised you, huh?

791
00:17:58,770 --> 00:17:59,930
That's silly.

792
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:00,980
Right?

793
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,440
I don't mind joining your party.

794
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:08,190
My master said to take me with you, right?

795
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:12,150
But you're going to need
to defeat the Crimson Dragon.

796
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,200
It's honestly too tough to do by myself.

797
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,700
Frieren, you can defeat it, right?

798
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,710
Without fail, if you can hold it off for thirty seconds.

799
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:28,500
I see. Thirty seconds, huh?

800
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,050
Can't someone else do that?

801
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:35,470
What is he talking about?

802
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,140
I figured as much.

803
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,980
Stark. What's your experience fighting monsters?

804
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,730
None!

805
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:46,480
Frieren, save me!

806
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,730
I tried to confront it at first, you know?

807
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:53,740
But it was so scary, I couldn't move an inch!

808
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:58,490
It cut up houses like they were vegetables!

809
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:01,750
That's not something humans
should be trying to fight!

810
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,460
I got saved by the whims of the dragon.

811
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:13,010
But then the dragon stopped attacking,
and they started treating me like a hero.

812
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:16,470
The villagers are really great people.

813
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:18,640
You're still young, so eat up!

814
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,770
Stark, show me your new ultimate technique!

815
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:25,270
I can't run away like this!

816
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,940
Lady Frieren, he's hopeless.

817
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,480
We should find someone else.

818
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,280
Don't leave me!

819
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,030
No, he can fight the dragon. He has it in him.

820
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,780
You say that like he just needs to put his mind to it...

821
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:05,560
Stark, I'll give you one night.

822
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,940
Think about it.

823
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,480
You should understand you can't go on like this.

824
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,170
I heard you met with Sir Stark.

825
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,580
He's a nice young fellow, isn't he?

826
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:35,170
He always eats our food with such relish.

827
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:38,300
Sir Stark sure is beloved.

828
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,300
He does seem like a good-natured guy.

829
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,260
Good-natured?

830
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,930
He just looked cowardly to me.

831
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:50,940
I won't deny that.

832
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,190
But if you think back to your
first fight against a monster...

833
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,820
Fine, I won't bring it up.

834
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,830
Gosh, and you were so cute
and well-behaved when you were little.

835
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,420
Anyway, why doesn't the dragon attack this village?

836
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:15,880
Who knows. It could be a whim, or—

837
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,090
What was that sound?

838
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,050
Probably Stark.

839
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,600
If you're curious, go take a look.

840
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,770
I'm going to bed.

841
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,830
Oh? Is he a good warrior?

842
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:55,340
When his village was attacked by demons,

843
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,210
he was the only one to run away. He's a coward.

844
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,220
Just like me.

845
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:08,310
That's why I drilled everything I could into him.

846
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:13,230
He's the kind of person who can fight for others now.

847
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:17,190
I see. He's a good warrior.

848
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:41,460
So it was your training that caused this.
