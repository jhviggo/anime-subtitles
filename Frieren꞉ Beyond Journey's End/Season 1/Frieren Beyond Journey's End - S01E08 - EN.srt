00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,730
Who are you?

2
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,030
I believe visitation hours have ended.

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:19,170
I'm one of Aura the Guillotine's executioners, Draht.

4
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,640
I'm here to kill you.

5
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,170
I see. You done playing diplomacy?

6
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,050
We've just begun.

7
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,930
Just so you know, I'm pretty strong.

8
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,640
Stronger than me?

9
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,090
Stronger than Aura the Guillotine.

10
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,380
Doesn't look like that to me.

11
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:46,860
Why not?

12
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,880
This fight's already over.

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,340
Mana wire, huh?

14
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,960
Interesting magic.

15
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,230
You saved your neck
by concentrating mana around it.

16
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,030
You're pretty calm, huh?

17
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,840
Your average mage would have lost
their head without realizing what happened.

18
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,260
But this wire's strength is
top-grade even among demonkind.

19
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,810
Humanity's magic won't
be able to do anything about it.

20
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:25,060
I'll cut right through your mana and neck.

21
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,610
You're right, I don't think
I can do anything about this wire.

22
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,560
Already convinced you've won, huh?

23
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,610
Demons these days aren't up to par.

24
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,120
They lack combat experience.

25
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,090
Damn it!

26
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,050
My arm!

27
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,920
You bitch—

28
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,260
Wait! We can talk—

29
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,530
That's one down.

30
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:20,130
If I report this attack to the earl and get rid of
the other two, I'll probably get clemency.

31
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,880
That's a dead guard.

Master said cities with delicious food

590
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,660
Wait!

591
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,110
I'm sure this city is good, too.

592
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,260
Sir Stark.

593
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,650
I'm not sharing!

594
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,970
Let's go appeal directly
to Earl Granat to release Lady Frieren.

595
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,600
I believe it's only a matter of time
before harm befalls this city.

596
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,310
Let's get Lady Frieren out of jail
and have her defeat the demons.

597
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,110
I guess that's our only option.

598
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,090
There's no way we could beat them ourselves.

599
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,090
Especially that Lügner guy...

600
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,490
He's ridiculously strong.

601
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,870
He was only looking at Frieren.

602
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,270
We and the city guard were right there.

603
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,990
But his eyes were fixed on Frieren.

604
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:18,130
He thinks he can kill us whenever he wants.

605
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,320
My hands are still shaking.

606
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,520
Great, now it looks like I wet myself.

607
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,900
That's just how strong he is.

608
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,530
Wipe that off quickly. We've gotta go.

609
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,030
The demons are near the earl.

610
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,490
It could turn into a fight.

611
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,620
The heroes' party would go on nonetheless.

612
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,500
True.

613
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,420
If I chickened out here,
Master would be disappointed in me.

614
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,420
Let's go.

615
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,110
You can keep that.

616
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,250
What's wrong?

617
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,110
My knees gave out.

618
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:21,240
I can't detect Draht's mana.

619
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,240
He must have died.

620
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,760
How stupid. He got too complacent.

621
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,110
Complacent?

622
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:37,380
We're Lady Aura's closest aides, her executioners.

623
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,500
You think we would die from complacency?

624
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,010
Who is that mage?

625
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,300
Sorry I made you wait.

626
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,920
The mage from earlier escaped,

627
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,150
having cut off the guard's head.

628
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,420
Sounds like quite the issue.

629
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,690
Let us help with the search.

630
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,280
Linie is quite good at mana detectio—

631
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,910
No, that's alright.

632
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:16,670
By the way, you seem to be missing one of your companions.

633
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,920
He went to the bathroom. He'll be right back.

634
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,250
Without asking the servants for directions?

635
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,310
Even I could tell that mage was quite skilled.

636
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,520
But the guards easily restrained her.

637
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:38,270
She understands the weight of killing a guard.

638
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:42,530
Sir Lügner, I will ask once more.

639
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,480
Where is your companion?

640
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,040
Unbelievable.

641
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,340
Draht, that moron,

642
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,040
he's ruined everything.

643
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,080
Still, it's strange.

644
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:44,650
This god-awful situation where
I'm forced to resort to violence—

645
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:48,590
I'm finding it absolutely delightful.

646
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,930
Lord Granat. What are words?

647
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,100
Just what sets them apart from this sword?

648
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,820
No matter what they use, the weak will die.

649
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,860
Much like the owner of this sword.

650
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,990
Lügner!

651
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,510
In the end, we are but savage beasts.

652
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:25,260
Don't worry. I won't kill you.

653
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:32,230
We need your help in deactivating
this city's barrier, after all.

654
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,770
We're almost at the earl's mansion.

655
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,160
Lady Frieren?

656
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,990
That is you, right?

657
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:01,000
What are you doing out here?

658
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,600
Did you break out of jail?

659
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,880
I had no choice.

660
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:11,500
A demon called Draht attacked me in my cell.

661
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,510
I killed it,

662
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,260
but demons dissipate into
mana particles when they die.

663
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,890
What about it?

664
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:24,270
It'd killed the guard in front of the cell.

665
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:32,530
All that was left was a guard
decapitated with magic, and me, a mage.

666
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,160
How do you think that looks?

667
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,490
You'd be executed for killing a guard.

668
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,950
Right?

669
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,720
This is a pain, so I'm going to skip town.

670
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,000
Please wait.

671
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:48,110
The other demons are still at large.

672
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,010
Are you going to forsake this city?

673
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,630
Can't you guys deal with them?

674
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,370
You say that like it's easy...

675
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,760
They're not the kind of enemy we can beat.

676
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,890
You won't fight if your opponent is strong?

677
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:12,590
Besides, I genuinely don't think
you two are weaker than them.

678
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,120
Wait!

679
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,870
I'll fight! So at least help us!

680
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,120
I'm begging you!

681
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:26,630
Peek.

682
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,630
No, wait!

683
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,530
Frieren! Please!

684
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,800
You need to know when to give up.

685
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,360
We'll just have to deal with it.

686
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,010
Come on, it's impossible.

687
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,630
Stop throwing a tantrum.

688
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:53,960
I'd guess it's about 10 kilometers away.

689
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,970
I sense a massive amount of mana.

690
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,380
She's checking in on the situation here.

691
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:20,300
One of the Seven Maleficent Sages,
Aura the Guillotine.

692
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:25,560
I also hate fighting strong enemies.

693
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,000
All the more reason to get it over with quickly.

694
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:27,450
Should we really be sneaking in like this?

695
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:32,390
Would you like to tell the guards that
we're here to kill the peace emissaries?

696
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,020
It's weirdly quiet.

697
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,100
You see, I love magic.

698
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,370
Take the renowned Sage of Decay, Qual.

699
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,620
He spent most of his life developing
his Magic that Kills People.

700
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:24,760
We demons dedicate our long lives
to the research of a single form of magic.

701
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:29,430
Our magic is the accumulation
of all the years we've lived in pursuit of it.

702
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:34,720
Each year, we further refine our magic,

703
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,520
pushing our power to even greater heights.

704
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:46,280
However, magic is a strange thing.

705
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:52,040
The magical barrier that prevents
demons from entering, protecting this city,

706
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,740
was created by the Great Mage Flamme.

707
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:25,940
At times, the magic of a prodigy over a thousand
years ago can surpass even modern magic.

708
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,910
I hate prodigies.

709
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:34,380
They lack the beauty of accumulated effort.

710
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:41,170
The Granat family has been in charge
of the barrier for generations.

711
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:49,800
The fact that we were able to enter
means there must be a way to control it.

712
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:52,810
Out with it.

713
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,060
Let us take a break.

714
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,940
You'd do well to think it over.

715
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:10,450
You humans sure love your stall tactics, don't you?

716
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:15,680
Being stubborn will only earn you greater agony.

717
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,050
There should be a grimoire
about the barrier somewhere.

718
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:32,440
Search the bedroom, I'll take the study.

719
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:49,600
Oh, you're the adventurer kid from earlier.

720
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,700
I thought my son had come to take me.

721
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,640
You look horrible.

722
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,120
They really don't hold back, do they?

723
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,720
I'll get you out.

724
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,840
You're trembling.

725
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,400
That a problem?

726
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,630
No, you're brave.

727
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,640
My late son also trembled before heading to war.

728
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,030
Shit, I can't cut it.

729
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,210
Did they use magic?

730
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:28,380
Leave me. I'm not going to make it anyway.

731
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,980
Prioritize evacuating the townspeople.

732
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:36,410
It's not like anyone's gonna listen
to some random-ass kid.

733
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:40,410
This necklace is the Granat family's emblem.

734
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,800
The guards will listen
to anything you say if you show it to them.

735
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:49,320
Oh, and brat.

736
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,800
Not addressing me with respect
is a severe crime in this city.

737
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,030
Good. I'll look the other way, just this once.

738
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,420
Get out of here.

739
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,190
That so?

740
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,820
Sorry, old man.

741
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,730
I'm gonna break this expensive-looking chair.

742
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,110
And I'm not gonna be able to pay for it.

743
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,590
Sir Lügner, a rat.

744
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,170
Lord Granat, an acquaintance?

745
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:30,050
No, he's one of the adventurers from earlier.

746
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:33,350
He likely came to appeal to me directly,

747
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,050
not knowing the mage already escaped.

748
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,810
What a stupid kid.

749
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:40,810
I see.

750
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,810
Again...

751
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,310
You can go home, kid.

752
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,290
I'll look the other way.

753
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,570
He's doing it again.

754
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,250
He's not even looking at me.

755
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,870
What are you doing? Move.

756
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,180
Interfering here will get you killed.

757
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,960
Try me!

758
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:09,630
He's fast.

759
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,300
But merely human.

760
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,620
You managed to protect your vitals.

761
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,680
Your reflexes are quite sharp.

762
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,530
Nonetheless, young humans
and demons alike sure are impulsive.

763
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:35,190
You're unprepared and reckless.

764
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:41,620
I'll give you points for the valor
of challenging me by yourself, though.

765
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,620
By myself?

766
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:48,110
Huh, I guess you really can't tell.

767
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,130
What?

768
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,960
Fern, I made the opening you asked for.

769
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:56,420
Sir Lügner, there's a mage—

770
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,970
Impossible.

771
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:18,480
A mere human evaded Linie's mana detection?

772
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,410
What's more, this magic...

773
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,810
Sir Lügner, I'll handle this—

774
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,290
Don't.

775
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,170
Girl. What was that magic?

776
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,160
Standard offensive magic.

777
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:40,510
I believe it's called Solltrag in your system.

778
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,970
You're trying to tell me that was Solltrag?

779
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,240
Who do you think you're kidding?

780
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:50,090
We demons conquered
Solltrag over half a century ago.

781
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,650
Who did you learn this magic from?

782
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,690
Oh, you're stalling for time.

783
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,400
I'll finish you off now.

784
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,610
I won't let you.

785
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,370
Fern!

786
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,030
The earl's heavily injured.

787
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,610
We don't have the time to fight.

788
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:09,550
Let's retreat.

789
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:11,620
Okay.

790
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,270
We'll chase them once I stop the bleeding.

791
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,260
You take care of the warrior.

792
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,270
My blood is on the both of them.

793
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,770
We'll find them wherever they go.

794
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:38,150
There's no need to trouble yourself with this.

795
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,620
I can deal with the two of them.

796
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:44,160
You would have died from that magic.

797
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:52,420
It was modified to be especially
effective in killing demons.

798
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:57,010
It's no longer what we know as Solltrag.

799
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:01,680
It's the Magic that Kills Demons.

800
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,840
The way that girl carried herself
was reminiscent of someone...

801
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:10,530
I've experienced that magic once before.

802
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,400
Oh.

803
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,630
I remember now.

804
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,370
It was Frieren.

805
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,270
The mage who greatly contributed
to humanity's study and analysis of Solltrag,

806
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:40,140
and sent more demons
to their graves than any other.

807
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,570
Frieren the Elegy.

808
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:49,930
Episode 8

809
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:49,930

What the hell...

1251

You'll have to rest for some time.

That's messed up.

1253
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,860
You demons

1254
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,320
truly are monsters.

1255
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,070
All demons

1256
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:26,200

00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,450
