Episode 21: The World of Magic

277
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,980
Balgland.

278
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,520
The young ones are too hot-blooded, aren't they?

279
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,150
This "special privilege" is nonsense.

280
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,470
Say, why do you think that?

281
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,160
Do you even need to ask?

282
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:03,040
Magic is most enjoyable when you're pursuing it.

283
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,160
It's that simple.

284
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,040
I see.

285
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,170
Time sure flows quickly.

286
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,800
The apprentice I took on a whim
has already brought along her own apprentice.

287
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,700
This is Frieren.

288
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,180
An elf, huh?

289
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,360
You're strong.

290
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,440
I like you.

291
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,920
Tell me what magic you desire most.

292
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,680
I will grant you a single spell.

293
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,640
What magic I desire?

294
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:40,650
I know almost all grimoires
written throughout history.

295
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:47,710
Mages spend their whole lives pursuing the magic they desire.

296
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,740
Tell me yours.

297
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,380
I will grant it to you.

298
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,590
I don't need it.

299
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:59,770
Magic is most enjoyable when you're pursuing it.

300
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:05,060
Flamme. This girl is no good after all.

301
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,220
She lacks ambition. Burning ambition.

302
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,020
Master.

303
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,730
This girl will defeat the demon king one day.

304
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:21,030
I believe she's the kind of mage
who will lead us to an age of peace.

305
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,630
You mean to say I cannot?

306
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,540
You long for combat.
You will not be able to defeat the demon king.

307
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,320
It's not possible for you or me.

308
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,170
Think about it, master.

309
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,860
You can't imagine yourself
living in an age of peace, can you?

310
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:44,440
Frieren is a mage fit for an era of peace.

311
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,690
I like it.

312
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,570
That's how a mage should be.

313
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,500
Damn it.

314
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,220
I can't freeze him at all.

315
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,210
He has too much of a mana advantage.

316
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,380
Nephtia.

317
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,060
Too weak.

318
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,270
Kanne, defend!

319
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,140
I know!

320
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,420
So, you ended up making quite the scene.

321
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,990
I do believe I know most of your tricks.

322
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,160
Ice magic lacking in force,

323
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,290
and a mage that can't fight without water.

324
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,920
What am I even doing here?

325
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,920
At this rate, I really am just babysitting kids.

326
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,180
You sure like laying it on.

327
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:12,890
With all this flashy magic, is your mana going to last?

328
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,780
You're graduates from a magic school, aren't you?

329
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:23,080
Are the elders there still teaching
attrition tactics focused on defensive magic?

330
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,430
What do you mean?

331
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,910
Let me give you a lecture on magic history.

332
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:33,250
Modern defensive magic was developed
as a countermeasure to Solltrag.

333
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,030
As such, it's very resistant to magic itself,

334
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:41,920
but doesn't help in defending
against physical threats.

335
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,680
There is, of course, a clear reason for this.

336
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:52,180
It's because it was enough to defend against
the physical attacks of monsters and warriors.

337
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,270
Defensive magic mustn't be over-engineered.

338
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,820
If you seek perfection, the structure will be too complex,

339
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,190
and have critical repercussions on casting time.

340
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:07,450
The history of magic is one of offense and defense.

341
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,750
That's why modern offensive magic

342
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,200
has come to favor physical attacks.

343
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,210
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?

344
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,960
Kanne, no! Dodge!

345
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,390
My magic uses an overwhelming
amount of physical matter to attack.

346
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,640
Take a nap or something.

347
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,320
Give me a break.

348
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,940
I don't enjoy hurting people.

349
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,920
Or what? Do you want me to kill you, after all?

350
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,830
You sure you wanna be getting this close?

351
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,580
People are 60% water, you know?

352
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,580
What about it?

353
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,560
Magic is all about imagination.

354
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,640
Can you imagine how water
is distributed through a person's body?

355
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,110
Can you imagine isolating and manipulating it?

356
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:12,950
How are you going to do that against
a mage protected by large amounts of mana?

357
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,350
If you can't imagine it, you can't realize it with magic.

358
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:20,980
Besides, even if there was water here,

359
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,360
a little girl like you wouldn't be a threat.

360
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,090
Bluffs don't work either, huh?

361
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,100
What an obnoxious adult.

362
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,740
I did notice one thing, though.

363
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,740
You're telling a lie, aren't you, bastard?

364
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,540
If you really liked fighting enough to lecture us about it,

365
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,880
you would have crushed us down by the water.

366
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,590
What are you so afraid of?

367
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,240
Settle down.

368
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,640
My job is to put you to bed.

369
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,520
As long as Denken doesn't lose, that is.

370
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:14,530
At this rate, I'll run out of mana,
and that'll be the end of it.

371
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,870
This is a little much for my age.

372
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:23,480
Sorry, but I'm going to end this early, Frieren.

373
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,920
Waldgose.

374
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,880
Daosdolg.

375
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:41,140
That geezer... What a way to fight.

376
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:45,230
That old man sure is flashy.

377
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,420
Is the barrier going to be okay?

378
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,880
Stupid question.

379
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,910
The barrier was put here by the Great Mage Serie.

380
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:56,420
It won't be destroyed by any amount of brute force.

381
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,100
I see. If you say so.

382
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,040
By the way, since sometime last night,

383
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,990
someone has been analyzing the barrier.

384
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,190
To what end?

385
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,300
No idea.

386
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,800
It's a futile effort anyway.

387
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:15,980
Do you think there's a mage
who can surpass Serie in this world?

388
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,660
Katastravia.

389
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,940
You're kidding me, a counterattack?

390
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,340
Those were ceaseless arrows of light!

391
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,910
There was no opening for—

392
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,280
I'm out of mana.

393
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,060
This is it, huh?

394
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,110
I can't believe it.

395
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:09,820
She never used anything but basic combat magic.

396
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:16,320
It’s like this was just practical training for a pupil.

397
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,310
I'm surprised.

398
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,570
After how far I've come,
I didn't think I still had this far to go.

399
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:25,150
Tell me where Laufen is.

400
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,790
You must know.

401
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,540
You will be returning the Stille.

402
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,010
If you were in my position, would you give it away?

403
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,120
I suppose not.

404
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,860
Laufen, you're hiding nearby, aren't you?

405
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,360
Bring the Stille here.

406
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,860
If you don't, I'll kill Denken.

407
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,870
Don't do it, Laufen. She won't kill me.

408
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,630
You get that, right?

409
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,430
Gramps got beaten.

410
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,970
I can't—

411
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:09,880
No, not even Richter could win against her.

412
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,350
But she's let her guard down.

413
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,420
She's not touching Gramps's body.

414
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:19,180
Don't use Silwehr. Keep hiding.

415
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,950
She'll detect you from the slightest amount of mana.

416
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,370
At this distance, I can grab Gramps and get away.

417
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,420
Stop, it's a trap.

418
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,190
No getting around it.

419
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:33,160
I didn't really want to do this...

420
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,440
Found you.

421
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,470
Fool.

422
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,450
Damn greenhorn.

423
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:48,960
It was clear she wasn't going to kill me.

424
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:54,420
But she would've beaten you
within an inch of your life.

425
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,590
Even so, we would've won.

426
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,350
Gramps, why would you
go so far to become a first-rank mage?

427
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:07,470
Don't you already have wealth,
authority, and anything else you might want?

428
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:16,980
I'm from deep in the Northern Plateau.

429
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:22,870
Only first-rank mages can go there now
due to the rampaging of the demons.

430
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:27,240
It's been a while, and I wanted to visit a grave there.

431
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,710
That's it.

432
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,410
Shouldn't you go check on those kids?

433
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,760
Though it may already be too late.

434
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,980
Richter will kill them before facing you.

435
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,760
He's the kind of person who can
make a pragmatic decision like that.

436
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,440
They'll be fine. Kanne and Lawine will win.

437
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,390
I just finished analyzing the barrier.

438
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,410
I didn't think Denken would lose.

439
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,390
Well then,

440
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:06,220
I'm done babysitting you.

441
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,310
Looks like he's seriously trying to kill us now.

442
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,850
We really won't last a minute at this rate.

443
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,070
Barrier? Analyzing?

444
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,930
What do you mean?

445
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:48,830
Frieren, you can't mean...

446
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,460
Genau.

447
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,970
Don't worry, it's impossible.

448
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:06,050
Hell would sooner freeze over.

449
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,230
It's going to break.

450
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:25,990
Sense, who is that elven mage?

451
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,490
The examinee list says her name is Frieren.

452
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,910
The same name as the mage of the heroes' party.

453
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,930
She apparently also has the mark of the holy staff.

454
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:41,220
The last Great Mage...

455
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,070
You've done it now, Frieren.

456
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:48,760
Quite the greeting after
a thousand years, don't you think?

457
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,360
This is why I can't give up magic.

458
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:57,900
In the world of magic,
hell does sometimes freeze over.

459
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,900
To think you'd actually destroy the barrier.

460
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,420
Why break it?

461
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,650
I felt bad for Kanne.

462
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,930
Magic should be free.

463
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,910
The mage who manipulates water?

464
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,620
Magic is all about imagination.

465
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,630
Can you imagine winning against
a mage who manipulates water in the rain?

466
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,630
I can't, at least.

467
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:27,010
That Richter guy probably can't, either.

468
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,760
The barrier...

469
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,490
What happened?

470
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,260
It's raining.

471
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,690
Never mind, I can check that later.

472
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,020
I need to hurry and finish—

473
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,400
You finally showed an opening.

474
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:43,110
Your mana control slipped in your rush.

475
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,400
You think that'll buy you enough time to—

476
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,280
I get it now.

477
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,780
I get why you're afraid of
the Spell That Manipulates Water.

478
00:16:54,810 --> 00:17:00,540
This is exactly the kind of overwhelming amount
of physical matter you were talking about.

479
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:04,040
Lawine, don't let him get away.

480
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,410
Riemstrohr.

481
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,930
It's not like I even have anywhere to run.

482
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,100
This is why I hate water.

483
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,480
Looks like you won.

484
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,730
Let's get out of here.

485
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,700
There's still two hours until sunset.

486
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,930
You can hide your mana that long, right?

487
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,900
There's nothing to hide, I'm out of mana.

488
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,070
I see. You did well.

489
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,420
Don't pat me.

490
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:51,930
Sorry.

491
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,230
You can't win every time.

492
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:03,180
Denken and I are both out of mana.

493
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,420
There's two hours left.

494
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,110
It's over.

495
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,180
Laufen, can you break these restraints?

496
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,910
You've got to be kidding. These restraints
have an incredible amount of mana in them.

497
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,790
Then the tree. Knock it over.

498
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,520
Denken, we're done for.

499
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:38,380
I don't have enough mana left to use Silwehr either.

500
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:45,560
Richter, Laufen, what do you think
an Imperial Mage would do in this situation?

501
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,570
Struggle until the last moment, no matter what.

502
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,570
We're going to search for other
traces of battle and follow them.

503
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,830
You know, Fern,

504
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,970
you're really boring.

505
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:07,080
You're really only using basic magic.

506
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,090
Tell that to Lady Frieren.

507
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:14,820
Oh yeah, that elf is your master, isn't she?

508
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:20,600
We got drenched because of her.

509
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,690
Make sure to tell her off for that.

510
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,980
I fully intend to.

511
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:29,820
Oh, I'm not restricted
regarding non-combat magic, though.

512
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:34,210
Oh yeah, you did use the Spell That Catches Birds.

513
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,820
What other spells can you use?

514
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,380
Let's see.

515
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,950
The Spell That Lets You See Through Clothes.

516
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,080
I'm not going to use it.

517
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,620
Hey, sorry to intrude on this fun chat,

518
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,460
but shouldn't you avoid
giving away your hand like this?

519
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:57,090
We'll be enemies in the second-stage exam.

520
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,100
I guess.

521
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,600
Sorry about that.

522
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:06,600
I feel like you could've opened up
a bit more though, four-eyes.

523
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,360
Found them.

524
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,990
Their team already lost.

525
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:18,950
The corpse of their teammate is nearby.

526
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:24,630
They have no way to pass anymore,
but they're still cradling the Stille.

527
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,360
Are we going to negotiate with them, Denken?

528
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,030
I doubt they're willing.

529
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:38,160
If I was in their shoes,
I would accept no amount of money.

530
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,090
Why not?

531
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:42,160
Because it would rub me the wrong way.

532
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,220
It's not a matter of logic.

533
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,020
Laufen, you wait here.

534
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,300
Grab the Stille if you get a chance.

535
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,240
Richter, come with me.

536
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,770
What's your plan?

537
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,920
We're approaching them head-on?

538
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,340
I don't have any mana left, you know?

539
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,460
You should understand.

540
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:17,960
The same goes for them.

541
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,100
Prepare yourself.

542
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,910
You're a man, aren't you?

543
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:36,980
Hey, you're kidding, right?

544
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:43,910
It's time to throw down!

545
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,780
It's time.

546
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:17,400
The first-stage exam is hereby concluded.

547
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:22,280
A total of six teams,
or eighteen examinees, have passed.

548
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,780
The second-stage exam is in three days.

549
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,930
We will notify you of the details in the coming days.

550
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,140
That is all.

551
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,070
You're dismissed.

552
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,540
It's already been two days
since they started the exam.

553
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:42,620
Fern can't scold me for staying up late.

554
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,940
It's almost scary how great this is.

555
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,800
You must have it rough, kid.

556
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,170
And

557
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,170
I'm

558
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,170

559
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,170
right

560
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,240
I'll

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,240

right

564
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,050
Yeah,

565
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,050
I

566
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,050
