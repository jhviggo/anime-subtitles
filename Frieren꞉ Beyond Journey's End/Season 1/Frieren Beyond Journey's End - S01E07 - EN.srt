1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:05,240
A grimoire by the Great Mage Flamme?

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,330
"Books attributed to Flamme are never real."

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,230
Every grimoire discovered so far has been fake.

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,690
This might be the best fake yet, though.

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,370
Quite good reward for such an easy quest.

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,960
I don't really see what's so great about that.

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,300
After so long of finding fake after fake,

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,090
one begins to question if real ones even exist.

9
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:38,140
As the progenitor of humanity's magic,
Flamme herself is more myth than history.

10
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,350
A myth, huh?

11
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,870
I suppose. Enough years have passed
for truth to become myth.

12
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:51,700
I'm probably the only one who remembers her face.

13
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,500
It's morning.

14
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,510
Lady Frieren woke up early!

15
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,030
Are we supposed to be impressed?

16
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,140
Of course.

17
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,970
We need to make sure
to praise her when she's a good girl.

18
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,980
What the hell is this?

You're lifesavers.

585

The landslide had me at my wit's end.

586
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:28,070
Hey, did we really need to do all this?

587
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,410
You're not happy with it?

588
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,190
The reward isn't bad.

589
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:36,320
No, I mean, can't you lift
his carriage over with magic?

590
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,320
Then people who come here later will be in trouble.

591
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,740
That's what Fern said.

592
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,320
You're pretty selfish, huh?

593
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,370

00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,010
Thanks.

596
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:06,520
By the way, what's with such a localized landslide?

597
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:12,520
There are parts of the Northern Lands
that have been in active conflict with demons.

598
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,720
I'd imagine it's the aftermath of a battle.

599
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,070
The scars of war, huh?

600
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:28,960
Sir Stark, could you come help over here instead?

601
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,460
Sir Stark?

602
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,590
Say, could you stop calling me Sir?

603
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,220
It's weirding me out.

604
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,600
We're basically the same age, aren't we?

605
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,880
I see. As you wish.

606
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,170
Stark, get your ass over here. Immediately.

607
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,230
So rude?!

608
00:04:54,630 --> 00:05:00,520
You do realize there's a middle ground here, right?

609
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,240
Huh?

610
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,490
Come on, be a little more friendly, I get hurt easily.

611
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,980
What a pain in the neck.

612
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,500
Oh, come on!

613
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,000
You making progress over there?

614
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,900
Let's hurry, Sir Stark.

615
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,010
Okay.

616
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,250
I'm truly grateful for your help.

617
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,470
I'll guide you to the city if you'd like.

618
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,720
But I must say...

619
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,510
In all my years of living,
I've never seen an elf before.

620
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,610
We are rather rare.

621
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:41,010
Come to think of it,
I've never seen an elf other than you.

622
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,240
There are very few of us, after all.

623
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,990
I haven't met more than
a handful of my kind either.

624
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,380
We elves live for a long time,

625
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:56,270
but lack any kind of romantic
feelings or reproductive instinct.

626
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,330
We're slowly going extinct.

627
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:04,330
The last time I met another elf
was over four hundred years ago.

628
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,680
Our end might not be that far off.

629
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,150
There's the city.

630
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,780
There's a line of carriages.

631
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,940
They look like merchants.

632
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,280
The Liberation Festival is tonight, after all.

633
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,040
Today's the day Himmel the Hero and his party

634
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,000
defeated the demon dominating over the region.

635
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,630
Oh yeah, we did do that.

636
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,050
The Liberation Festival
is a commemoration of that day.

637
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:48,270
The statues of the heroes in the
middle of the city are decorated,

638
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:51,770
and the city comes together
for a great celebration.

639
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,450
Humans are so dramatic.

640
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,040
You turn every simple thing into a festival.

641
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:02,190
The demon's defeat was over eighty years ago.

642
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:08,950
For humans, that's plenty of time
for something to be forgotten.

643
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:17,090
But the triumphs of the party of heroes
will be kept alive as long as we keep our traditions.

644
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:22,920
Good work.

645
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,440
On the fifth try, huh?

646
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,050
It went pretty quickly this time.

647
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,060
You sure have statues made often, Himmel.

648
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:36,980
I want everyone to remember me.

649
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:41,350
We don't live as long as you do, after all.

650
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,700
Gotta leave my dashing figure for posterity.

651
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,410
Let's head back to the inn.

652
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,910
But, my number one reason...

653
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,170
is to make sure you won't be alone in the future.

654
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,290
What do you mean?

655
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,170
We're not a myth.

656
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,430
I want them to know that we really existed.

657
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:19,810
We celebrate the achievements
of the heroes' party like this every year.

658
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:27,820
Incidentally, you sure look like
the statue of Lady Frieren of the heroes' party.

659
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,200
Do you think this will
still be held in a hundred years?

660
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,800
As long as this city still exists.

661
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,960
And in a thousand?

662
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,380
That, I cannot say.

663
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,970
Alright, let's go.

664
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,670
To the far north.

665
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:58,850
By the way, I've been following you two around, but...

666
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,850
where are we going, anyway?

667
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,560
Heaven.

668
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,170
Sounds like fun.

669
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:14,080
28 years after the death

670
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:14,080
of Himmel the Hero

671
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:14,080
Northern Lands,

672
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:14,080
Granat Earldom

673
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,780
There sure are a lot of guards.

674
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,840
Did something happen?

675
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,950
Let's decide on shopping responsibilities.

676
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,880
Lady Frieren, we're in the middle of the city.

677
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,940
There's a demon.

678
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,990
What do you think you're doing?!

679
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:09,960
Earl Granat, is this your doing?

680
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:15,720
Sir Lügner, it might be true that I despise
and wish an ill fate upon your lot,

681
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:21,980
but I'm not so foolish as to kill a
peace emissary in the middle of the street.

682
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,440
A peace emissary?

683
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:28,900
They're probably adventurers,
unaware of the circumstances.

684
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,020
Let's leave it at that, then.

685
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,710
What a calm but murderous expression.

686
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:46,490
Though they might hate us,
even the citizens of this city

687
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,750
look at me as a person they're afraid of.

688
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:56,680
But you, you look at me as if I'm just a savage beast.

689
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,860
Well, I'm right, aren't I?

690
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,890
You demons merely imitate humans.

691
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,800
There's no talking with savage beasts.

692
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,750
Throw her in the dungeons.

693
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,480
Sir.

694
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,780
Hey!

695
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,410
I'm so bored.

696
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,300
Lady Frieren.

697
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,530
They said to repent for two to three years.

698
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,970
That's shorter than expected.

699
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,810
Bring me some grimoires later.

700
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:54,250
You sure like wasting time, don't you?

701
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,320
It's not like I'm in here because I want to be.

702
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,080
So, what's the deal with a demon
being a peace emissary?

703
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,040
I looked into it while shopping.

704
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,210
You know Aura the Guillotine, right?

705
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,830
One of the Seven Maleficent Sages,
the great demons serving the demon king, right?

706
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:17,020
She lost most of her subordinates fighting us,

707
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,220
and I believe she hasn't been seen since.

708
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,310
Did something happen recently?

709
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,930
Aura regained her power twenty-eight years ago.

710
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:31,190
It seems this city has been fighting
with her forces for a long time.

711
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,570
Exhausted by the pointless conflict,

712
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,840
it seems Aura's side proposed a truce.

713
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,910
And they welcomed the messenger in, huh?

714
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,200
A bad move.

715
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:45,500
There's no point in dialogue with demons.

716
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,260
It's not pointless, is it?

717
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,930
We have words.

718
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:53,460
If things can be resolved by
talking them out, isn't that for the best?

719
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,570
It's pointless because they don't get resolved.

720
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,840
Demons are man-eating monsters.

721
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,930
Have you ever thought about
why they use our language?

722
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,270
Sir Himmel, quickly, finish her off.

723
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,780
She's still a child.

724
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:25,490
So what?! She ate our daughter!

725
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,640
It hurts...

726
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,660
So much...

727
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,760
Mom...

728
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,760
Enough. I'll do it.

729
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:53,150
This... would make us no different than demons.

730
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:59,510
It's not like they need to eat humans to live, right?

731
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,350
Shouldn't we give her an opportunity to atone?

732
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,170
Chief...

733
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,660
You can't be serious!

734
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:11,120
My daughter... give me back my daughter.

735
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,500
Let's get you patched up.

736
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:22,890
I was just looking for some more help on the field.

737
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:29,850
Himmel, you'll regret it
if we don't kill her now. She's...

738
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:33,850
Frieren, we have words.

739
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,520
We'll be staying in this village anyways.

740
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,730
Let's see how it goes.

741
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,330
I see.

742
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,270
Why did you kill the village chief?

743
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:28,030
I knew it. We should have killed her back then.

744
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,350
There it is again.

745
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:36,930
It felt like you wanted to kill me every day.

746
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,540
I want to live in peace.

747
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:45,420
That's why I prepared a replacement

748
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,140
for your daughter, who I ate.

749
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,720
That's the village chief's daughter.

750
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,980
The village chief is gone now.

751
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,690
It looks like I made a bad choice.

752
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,990
Oh well. I have a hostage—

753
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,250
No more objections, right?

754
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,190
Yeah.

755
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,500
Mom...

756
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,640
"Mom" again, huh?

757
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:38,010
Demons, like monsters, do not raise their young.

758
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:41,970
They spend most of their time
after birth in complete solitude.

759
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,930
Solitude is natural for your kind.

760
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,630
You don't even have the concept of family.

761
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,650
So why do you say "Mom"?

762
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,000
I mean, it stops you from killing us, doesn't it?

763
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,840
It's a wonderful, almost magical word.

764
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:12,340
To them, words are merely
a means to deceive humans.

765
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,390
The Great Mage Flamme defined
demons as monsters that can speak.

766
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:22,230
They evolved from a monster lurking in the shadows,

767
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,230
calling for help to lure in prey.

768
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,300
Don't forget those grimoires.

769
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,000
Earl Granat is late.

770
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,620
Likely a human diplomacy tactic.

771
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,210
I'm more concerned about that mage.

772
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,340
I feel like I've seen her somewhere...

773
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,600
"There's no talking with savage beasts," huh?

774
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,920
Quite the accurate assessment.

775
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:06,360
She's the only one in this city
who understands our nature.

776
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:13,110
There is only one reason why a man-eating
predator would speak man's language.

777
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:18,620
They speak not to understand, but to deceive.

778
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,220
This city isn't long for this world.

779
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:26,000
I should use the turmoil to escape.

780
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,010
And this is?

781
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,390
My son's room.

782
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,810
He was my pride and joy.

783
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:50,080
He'd often be cheeky about how he was
going to succeed me soon, and let me retire.

784
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:01,240
His Majesty bestowed this sword
upon him after an exhibition bout.

785
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,540
What is he doing now?

786
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,470
Ten years ago, he died in the war with Aura.

787
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,850
This sword is the only thing that returned home.

788
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,730
Lügner!

789
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,430
I invited you here to avenge my son.

790
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,980
We'll kill all of you here and now.

791
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,610
Peace be damned!

792
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:49,630
This room is well cleaned.

793
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,640
I'm sure it looks just like it did ten years ago.

794
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:56,590
What about it?

795
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:02,600
I, too, have left my father's room a time capsule.
He was killed by your people in the war.

796
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,850
Let us put a stop to this, Earl Granat.

797
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:14,270
Do you wish to continue
the bloodshed and the tragedies?

798
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,930
We have words.

799
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,870
Please, let us talk things over.

800
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,240
Show them to the guest room.

801
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,650
I'll think about it.

802
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:53,900
Sir Lügner.

803
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,020
What's a "father"?

804
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,900
Indeed, I wonder what.

805
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:14,000
It seems Earl Granat bears a grudge
against us, but is quite an empathic person.

806
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:21,930
If we win him over, we very well may be able to get
him to lift the city's barrier in the name of peace.

807
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:26,720
All that's left will be for
Lady Aura's forces to annihilate this city.

808
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:35,430
By the way, where has Draht gone off to?

809
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,400
He said he'd get rid of a nuisance.

810
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,380
He's getting ahead of himself.

811
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:44,410
You young ones are too impulsive.

812
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:52,420
Sir Draht. You mustn't come to a place like this.

813
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,100
The guest room—

814
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,850
Who are you?

815
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:09,310
I believe visitation hours have ended.

816
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:16,440
I'm one of Aura the Guillotine's executioners, Draht.

817
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,820
I'm here to kill you.

818
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:23,450
I see. You done playing diplomacy?

819
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,320
We've just begun.

820
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:32,620
According to Sir Lügner,
this girl is our only obstacle.

821
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:39,210
If we eliminate her, this city will easily fall
just by winning over Earl Granat.

822
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,220
Just so you know, I'm pretty strong.

823
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:45,930
Stronger than me?

824
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:49,310
Stronger than Aura the Guillotine.

Not addressing me with respect

1265
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:24,440
They're not the kind of enemy we can beat.

1266
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:24,740
is a severe crime in this town.

1267
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,860
You'd be executed

1268
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,820
for killing a guard.

hate fighting

1272
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,070
She's the mage who's put more

1273
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,070
demons to their grave than any other.

1274
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,990
strong enemies.
