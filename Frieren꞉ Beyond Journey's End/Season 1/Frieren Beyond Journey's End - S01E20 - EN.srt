1
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,540
That's pretty scary.

2
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,540
It's probably a spell that severs objects.

3
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:28,580
It's on the simpler side of spells, but it's invisible.

4
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,780
I can't block it all.

5
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:35,720
But...

6
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,600
What happened? Not gonna go for the kill?

7
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,610
I guess I got a little carried away.

8
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,360
You sure did.

9
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,110
Your spell has a range
of about five meters, doesn't it?

10
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,810
Spot-on. So, what are you gonna do about it?

11
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,940
Duke it out with basic spells, like before?

12
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,190
No, that won't be necessary.

13
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:01,420
He uses utterly unscrupulous, cowardly magic,

14
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,850
and does whatever it takes to win.

15
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,230
The girl that's fighting him right now,

16
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,010
she's probably going to get killed.

17
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,340
Well then...

18
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,100
A saturation attack?

19
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,030
She can use this many
offensive spells simultaneously?

20
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,500
This kind of brute-force attack is absurd.

21
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,990
There's not a scrap of dignity.

22
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,990
I can't fend them all off.

Episode 20: Necessary Killings

298
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,000
Solganiel.

299
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,820
I can't move.

300
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,070
I can't use my mana, either.

301
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:38,120
A powerful binding spell, huh?

302
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,580
If he had this, he could have
just caught a Stille himself.

303
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,330
I guess it doesn't do him
any good if he can't find one.

304
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:52,790
My spell lets me immobilize
anything within my field of view.

305
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,970
As long as I don't look away,
you won't be able to move.

306
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:01,730
I can easily kill you in that state.

307
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:05,220
This guy was holding back, huh?

308
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,690
If he was really trying to kill us,

309
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,360
he would have immobilized us during that ambush.

310
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,480
Alright, last chance.

311
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,650
Leave the Stille and get out of here.

312
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,750
How boring.

313
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,540
And here I thought we would be fighting to the death.

314
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,040
But he just wanted to get the Stille by threatening us.

315
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,790
Wait.

316
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,750
Why do you need to order me to do that?

317
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,510
You could just take it
from me while I'm immobilized.

318
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,650
So, it doesn't work if you can't see my entire body.

319
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,510
No wonder you didn't use it against us earlier.

320
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,640
You went for my eyes, didn't you?

321
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,750
The logical choice, isn't it?

322
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:15,180
Nah, in your shoes,
I'd aim for the neck in order to kill.

323
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,760
That would end the fight.

324
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,260
You could have done that.

325
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,510
I've seen people act like you on the battlefield.

326
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:29,770
They were all sickos who enjoyed killing.

327
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,270
I should kill you here and now.

328
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,030
Have you killed women and children before?

329
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,530
You think I haven't?

330
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:48,040
Hm? What kind of hell did you experience?

331
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,230
Stalling for time?

332
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,800
Fine. I'll play along.

333
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,070
The Northern Mage Corps are mercenaries specialized in fighting demons, but in times of need,

334
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,430
we're called on to fight
against other countries as well.

335
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:13,940
People are well aware of others' weaknesses.

336
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:20,940
Inhuman acts like sending women and children
out to war are entirely commonplace.

337
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,340
It's no hell.

338
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,140
In the far north, it's our everyday life.

339
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,290
Yeah?

340
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,580
Oh well.

341
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,960
Aren't you going to kill me?

342
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:56,550
You know, I believe the spells people
are proficient in reflect their life and character.

343
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:03,360
This immobilizing spell feels like you
want time to prepare yourself for the kill.

344
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,740
I guess that's why you went along with my stalling.

345
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,600
I'm surprised.

346
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:17,000
You still want to be human, even though
your hands are already stained with blood.

347
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,540
That's right. I need the time
to gather the resolve to kill.

348
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,870
But you see, girl.

349
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:35,270
I may hesitate, but I've always killed when necessary.

350
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,270
See ya, girl.

351
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,150
Please don't move.

352
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,260
You've got to be kidding.

353
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,290
Ehre lost to you?

354
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,040
I didn't notice her at all.

355
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,070
I'm surprised. You can completely hide your mana?

356
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,550
You must be the one who caught the Stille.

357
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,690
We were just lucky.

358
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:10,360
We happened to find the Stille's nest,

359
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,530
and her master had taught her
the Spell That Catches Birds.

360
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:19,560
Since you can trap anything,
you must've been really unlucky.

361
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,310
You can say that again.

362
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,100
You were fighting Ehre, right?

363
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,320
What happened to her?

364
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,320
I killed her.

365
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,430
The conditions for passing the first-stage exam

366
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:39,050
are being in possession of a Stille by sunset,

367
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,070
and all team members being present.

368
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,220
We've lost. I'm going to withdraw.

369
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,220
Weren't you going to kill me?

370
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,750
I've already been disqualified.

371
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,890
Killing you is no longer necessary.

372
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,350
See you.

373
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,980
You can aim for my back if you want.

374
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:06,480
That unnecessary killing
will simply become necessary again.

375
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,770
Lady Übel.

376
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,610
I know.

377
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,020
Good lie.

378
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,870
Let's take the chance to go help Sir Land.

379
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,080
I'm sure he's fine.

380
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,750
That four-eyes is a real sandbagger.

381
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,270
This fight is over.

382
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,640
This is impressive.

383
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:52,660
You turned countless petals into steel, and slipped
through my defenses with incredible precision.

384
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,680
But you're self-taught, aren't you?

385
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,290
Self-taught people often neglect their fundamentals.

386
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,560
When fighting someone for the first time,

387
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,170
I make it a point to wait and see how they fight first.

388
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,490
I've grasped your weak points well.

389
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,550
I've probably won.

390
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,400
You talk a lot.

391
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,560
How are you going to win
without your dominant arm?

392
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,020
If you won't surrender, I'll sever your head next.

393
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,280
I told you, I'm just analyzing
how you fight beforehand.

394
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,650
You're bad at mana detection, aren't you?

395
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,500
Illusionary magic.

396
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,920
It's tangible, so a clone, to be precise.

397
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,150
When did you—

398
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,840
From the start. Since the exam started.

399
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,970
I trust no one but myself.

400
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,400
"Killed her" my ass.

401
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,770
That damn woman, lying through her teeth.

402
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,060
Hey, Ehre, wake up.

403
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,580
You ran out of mana? Lame.

404
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,410
Weren't you top of your class?

405
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:26,220
She overwhelmed me with standard offensive magic.

406
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,290
I couldn't fend it all off.

407
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,340
Don't believe me?

408
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,770
I do.

409
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,350
Fighting fair and square like an idiot.

410
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,440
That was a fight you could've won.

411
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,510
If she can do this with just
standard offensive magic, though,

412
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:57,030
that woman's a real monster.

413
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,120
Let's go. We gotta meet up with Scharf.

414
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,910
Wait, I can't walk.

415
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,810
Fine, whatever.

416
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,640
Wait, don't carry me like an object.

417
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,880
Carry me piggyback!

418
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:23,120
Why am I stuck doing this...

419
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,400
Is Scharf close?

420
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,890
He's behind those bushes.

421
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,730
Hey, Scharf, help me carry Ehre...

422
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,740
Wirbel, give me a piggyback ride.

423
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,660
I'm paralyzed and can't move.

424
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,290
Damn it.

425
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,410
What the hell is going on?

426
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,920
What's that sound?

427
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,780
It's the rain.

428
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,670
It started falling outside the barrier.

429
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,670
It's really reflecting how I feel.

430
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:04,550
Two or three more hours until sunset.

431
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,200
The first-stage exam's almost over.

432
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,550
With the two of you out of commission,

433
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:12,650
we won't be able to steal a Stille at this point.

434
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:15,570
There's no way we're going to pass.

435
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:20,100
But you're still carrying us. How kind.

436
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,170
I could drop and leave you here, you know?

437
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,460
Please don't.

438
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,710
Stop crying, you're a man, aren't you?

439
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:33,080
Is that kindness why you fight demons?

440
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,240
You once saved my village.

441
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,590
Idiot.

442
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,720
Like I'm gonna put my life on the line for kindness.

443
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,600
People fight for greed.

444
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,370
I have an ulterior motive, too.

445
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:55,110
There was a girl I liked in my hometown.

446
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:02,820
Around 29 years ago, demon activity
increased in the Northern Lands.

447
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,990
Her family decided to flee to the Central Lands.

448
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,630
I was a dumb brat.

449
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,870
I tried to act cool for her.

450
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:15,210
I'll kill all those shitty demons.

451
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:17,950
So come back to this village once I do.

452
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:27,280
That was when I was four or five.

453
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,590
I don't remember her face or her name anymore.

454
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,920
That is pretty stupid.

455
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,850
Yeah, it is.

456
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,020
I guess I'll be going home by boat again.

457
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,160
I get really seasick...

458
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,460
I can introduce you to my grandpa.

459
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,940
He's a first-rank mage, so you could go by land...

460
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,560
Hey, Wirbel.

461
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,090
What's up?

462
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,050
Look.

463
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,450
What a joke.

464
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,560
What was all that trouble for?

465
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,980
Now we get lucky?

466
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:30,120
Frieren, that girl isn't doing anything.

467
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,120
An elf, huh?

468
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,120
She's a skilled mage.

469
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,750
Laufen's magic will probably only work on her once.

470
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,630
But that one time will be enough.

471
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:48,140
This is no battle to the death.

472
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,890
She disappeared.

473
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,100
Frieren, the Stille!

474
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,480
She took it.

475
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,040
An interesting spell.

476
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,370
Within the barrier,
it's comfortable even in the rain, huh?

477
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:25,170
Oh yeah, you're the examiner for
the second-stage exam, aren't you, Sense?

478
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:31,220
Looks like you've once again let several
promising examinees die, Genau.

479
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,970
Don't make me laugh.

480
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,230
The promising ones won't die here.

481
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:43,670
Besides, the first rank is just that valuable.

482
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,360
You should understand that.

483
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:55,200
Still, picking a target that you can't detect
with mana for a mage exam is quite ill-natured.

484
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,370
Catching one is dependent on luck.

485
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,630
This is a battle royale disguised as a hunt.

486
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:05,370
Luck is a skill, too.

487
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:10,260
Besides, it looks like some have
caught a Stille without relying on luck.

488
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,400
The sun sets in three hours.

489
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,690
The fighting is going to get more intense.

490
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,980
Who do you think is going to win?

491
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,150
Probably about a third will last.

492
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,680
Denken is guaranteed to be among them.

493
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,780
His skill is on par with that of a first-rank mage.

494
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:36,500
Why is an old man, with eyes
for nothing but wealth and power,

495
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,040
taking the exam at this point?

496
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,280
You think it's for the special privilege?

497
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,540
Who knows.

498
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,450
He's quite old already.

499
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:48,050
He must have his reasons.

500
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:53,280
Say, the spell that girl just used is Silwehr, isn't it?

501
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:57,680
A folk spell passed on amongst
a mountain tribe in the Southern Lands.

502
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,930
Yeah, it is.

503
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,720
Silwehr?

504
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,560
The Spell for High-Speed Movement.

505
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:08,170
Then shouldn't the two of you have stayed hidden?

506
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,570
You could've let that girl run away with the Stille.

507
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:14,560
Laufen is still inexperienced.

508
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,420
She leaves too many traces of mana.

509
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:21,700
You could easily track her, Frieren.

510
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,630
You think of us as nothing more than a nuisance.

511
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,010
Pretty much.

512
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,380
So, you know of me.

513
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:35,140
No mage of my generation doesn't know your name.

514
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,200
Though this is my first time meeting you in person.

515
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,270
I was sure of it the moment I saw you.

516
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:45,270
You're the mage from the heroes' party—Frieren.

517
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,980
She's famous?

518
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,210
She's a legendary mage.

519
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,820
I was wondering if she was who I thought she was.

520
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,280
Elves really don't age, do they?

521
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,550
So, you're challenging us openly, huh?

522
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,930
You've been scoping us out
this whole time, haven't you?

523
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,660
I thought you would do something more cowardly.

524
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,170
No, we're plenty cowardly.

525
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:13,050
While Denken stalls you,
I'm going to kill one of these two brats.

526
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,910
I see.

527
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:19,000
If we lose a party member and are disqualified,

528
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,310
I'll be forced to give up.

529
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,930
Bring it on. Try your best.

530
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,160
Lawine, this guy's strong.

531
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,440
I know.

532
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:35,070
Stop that, Richter. We just need to stall for time.

533
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,200
We can win.

534
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:43,200
Denken, I thought you were more
cold-hearted and ruthless than that.

535
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,810
You're an Imperial Mage, aren't you?

536
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,710
You must've gotten rid of political
enemies more than a few times.

537
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:02,470
I just don't think becoming a first-rank mage
is worth killing someone over.

538
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,160
That I agree with.

539
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,180
First-rank is just a title.

540
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,360
I don't believe it has that much worth.

541
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,250
I'm shocked.

542
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,550
You're taking the exam without
even knowing about the privilege?

543
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,360
The privilege?

544
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:25,390
The founder of the Continental Magic Association

545
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:31,160
who suddenly appeared in public half a century ago,
and reigns as the master of human magic.

546
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,880
The Great Mage Serie.

547
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:41,250
She's still pursuing tempered mages,
like those of the age of war with the demon king's army.

548
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:49,600
That's why she's promised those who
become first-rank mage a special privilege.

549
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,830
She grants them one spell of their choosing.

550
00:20:54,610 --> 00:21:00,900
Serie is a living grimoire encompassing
almost all spells from throughout history.

551
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:05,530
She's the closest mage on earth
to the all-seeing, all-powerful Goddess.

552
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,290
You could obtain immense wealth,

553
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,270
or cure serious illnesses,

554
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:13,380
or obtain enormous power.

555
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:20,920
To receive a spell of your wish
is to be granted a mage's greatest desire.

556
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,450
People are simple.

557
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:28,890
Thanks to that, first-rank mages are now
a bunch of monsters, barely even human anymore.

558
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,850
That's how valuable it is.

559
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,020
I see.

560
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,770
Ridiculous.

561
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:44,030
Denken, not many have
no interest in the special privilege.

562
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,040
Let's begin.

563
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,910
Denken, stall her for one minute.

564
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:52,430
That's all I need to kill them both.

565
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,790
Don't make me repeat myself, Richter.

566
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,250
They're just a pair of brats.

567
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,040
You just need to put them to sleep for three hours.

568
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,390
You can babysit some kids, can't you?

569
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,300
Denken.

570
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,140
I'll crush her.

571
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,640
That's good enough, isn't it?

572
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,270
Senile old man.

573
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,770
Balgland.

574
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:38,960
