00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:47,790
and where I was able to converse with my old comrades.

1839
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:47,790
— Great Mage Flamme

1840
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:47,830
It was a place where many souls gathered,

1841
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:47,830
and where I was able to converse with my old comrades.

1842
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:47,830
— Great Mage Flamme

1843
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:47,870
It was a place where many souls gathered,

1844
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:47,870
and where I was able to converse with my old comrades.

1845
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:47,870
— Great Mage Flamme

1846
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:47,920
It was a place where many souls gathered,

1847
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:47,920
and where I was able to converse with my old comrades.

1848
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:47,920
— Great Mage Flamme

1849
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:47,960
It was a place where many souls gathered,

1850
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:47,960
and where I was able to converse with my old comrades.

1851
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:47,960
— Great Mage Flamme

1852
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,000
It was a place where many souls gathered,

1853
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,000
and where I was able to converse with my old comrades.

1854
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,000
— Great Mage Flamme

1855
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,860
Frieren.

1856
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:10,570
We can see the capital now.

1857
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,510
It's the victorious return of the heroes' party.

1858
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,240
It'll be quite the festival.

1859
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,230
We'll have to find new jobs when we get back.

1860
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,000
You're already thinking about that?

1861
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,110
It's important.

1862
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,050
It's not like defeating the
demon king is the end of our journey.

1863
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,170
We've still got our whole lives ahead of us.

1864
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,740
A new job, eh?

1865
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,930
I'd want one where I can drink.

1866
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,750
You're a priest, though.

1867
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,830
That's a good point.

1868
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,430
Frieren.

1869
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:51,440
I'm sure you have more life ahead of you
than we can even imagine.

1870
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,990
I suppose.

1871
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:07,950

00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:07,950
!wkQ'e9nQu64r

1873
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:07,950
AN AGELESS ELEGY

1874
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:07,950
AN AGELESS ELEGY

1875
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,570
Himmel the Hero.

1876
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,070
Eisen the Warrior. Heiter the Priest.

1877
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,070
Frieren the Mage.

1878
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:43,410
You have done well to defeat the demon king.

1879
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:48,080
The world shall now know an age of peace.

1880
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:07,020
The king said he'll put up
statues of us in the plaza.

1881
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:14,400
Though I do severely doubt
whether they can replicate my dashing figure.

1882
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,990
Now he feels generous.

1883
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,570
He only gave us ten copper when we set out.

1884
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,080
Now, now, Frieren.

1885
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,870
Let's be happy with the free booze we're getting.

1886
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,540
Sorry excuse for a priest.

1887
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,300
It's ended, huh.

1888
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,300
Yeah.

1889
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,680
Our adventure is now over.

1890
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,100
Ten years...

1891
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,060
We've been a busy bunch, haven't we?

1892
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,310
On the day we departed...

1893
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:58,570
Himmel and Eisen disrespected
the king and almost got executed.

1894
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,940
Death.

1895
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,570
I'll give them a proper talking to.

1896
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,570
Shall I lick your boots?

1897
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,950
Our adventure could very well
have ended right then and there.

1898
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,660
There was also when Heiter was
so hungover he couldn't do squat.

1899
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,670
You look like an undead. You okay there?

1900
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,630
No.

1901
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,260
No, huh.

1902
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,470
That happened every damn week, too.

1903
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,470
At least I had it together.

1904
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,300
I considered leaving you behind
when you nearly got eaten by a mimic.

1905
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,260
It's dark! I'm scared!

1906
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:28,430
Seriously? Even though we
kept telling her it was a trap.

1907
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:30,180
It's scary and dark! Dark and scary!

1908
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,180
You wanna leave the elf behind?

1909
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,440
We really only have dumb memories, don't we?

1910
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,450
But it was fun.

1911
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:45,320
I'm glad I got to go
on an adventure with you three.

1912
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,410
So am I.

1913
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,080
As brief a time as it was.

1914
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,750
Brief?

1915
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,120
What are you saying?

1916
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,210
It took us ten years.

1917
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:58,090
Look at Heiter, he's become an old man.

1918
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,710
That's rude.

1919
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,260
Wasn't he already?

1920
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,550
That's quite rude.

1921
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,310
Looks like it's time.

1922
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,820
The Era Meteor Shower, was it?

1923
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,740
It only comes every fifty years.

1924
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,580
Just in time for the start of a peaceful era.

1925
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,420
It's beautiful.

1926
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,670
It's hard to see from the city, huh?

1927
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,840
Come on, we're having a moment here.

1928
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,340
Then, next time...

1929
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,600
I know a better place to see it,
so in fifty years I'll take you there.

1930
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,440
What?

1931
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,150
Never mind, it's nothing.

1932
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:02,150
Yeah, let's go see it together.

1933
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,090
Well then, I'm off.

1934
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,340
What are your plans?

1935
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,470
I'm going to continue collecting magic.

1936
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:34,930
I'm planning to travel around the
Central Lands for a hundred years or so.

1937
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,310
So I'll stop by every now and then.

1938
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,030
We'll never understand
an elf's sense of time, will we?

1939
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,700
Nope. Who knows how long she's been around.

1940
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:53,660
A mere fifty or hundred years
might not be significant to her.

1941
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,010
The horns of an Umbral Dragon?

1942
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,670
I don't carry those.

1943
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:53,010
I haven't even seen an
Umbral Dragon for twenty, thirty years.

1944
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:57,100
I see. That's a problem;
I need it for a summoning.

1945
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:05,110
That reminds me, I think Himmel still has the one
I picked up at the demon king's castle.

1946
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,070
This is giving off some sort of evil aura.

1947
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,990
It's not harmful, right?

1948
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,160
Dunno.

1949
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,990
You dunno, huh.

1950
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,370
It's almost time for the Era Meteor Shower,

1951
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,000
so I guess I can pick it up on the way.

1952
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:28,760
The city looks pretty different
than last time I was here.

1953
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,060
I think it was around here...

1954
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,150
Frieren.

1955
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,820
Himmel.

1956
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,870
You've gotten old.

1957
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,450
You could put that more nicely.

1958
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,630
Even at this age, I'm still quite dashing, aren't I?

1959
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:10,970
It's been 50 years, and you still look exactly the same.

1960
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,470
I thought I would never see you again.

1961
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,470
Ah, the Era Meteor Shower.

1962
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,730
Brings back memories.

1963
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,850
Also... About the thing
I picked up at the demon king's castle.

1964
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,860
The horn of an Umbral Dragon.

1965
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:30,570
I've never forgotten about it.

1966
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:34,110
It's been giving off an evil aura
from my drawer this whole time, after all.

1967
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:35,870
Sorry about that.

1968
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,330
You could have just tossed it
in a shed or something.

1969
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,080
That wouldn't do.

1970
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,920
You may have left this with me
without much thought,

1971
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,550
but from my perspective, it was something precious
entrusted to me by a dear comrade.

1972
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:01,270
I needed to safeguard it
until you eventually returned.

1973
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,820
It's not that grand, though.

1974
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,960
Himmel, you still not ready?

1975
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,470
You're bald, there's no point in fussing.

1976
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,970
There are things to fuss about when you're bald.

1977
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,610
Well then, let's go see the Era Meteor Shower.

1978
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,620
Heiter, you've gained quite an air of dignity.

1979
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,500
I'm a bishop of the holy city, after all.

1980
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,830
You haven't changed at all, though.

1981
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,750
Don't pat my head.

1982
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,590
On the other hand, Eisen, you haven't changed much.

1983
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,670
I see. Is that how it looks to you?

1984
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,090
As expected from a dwarf.

1985
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:21,470
So, where's this spot with a good view?

1986
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,560
We're leaving now?

1987
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,520
I think it's still a bit early for the Era Meteor Shower.

1988
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,610
Yeah, it's about a week from here on foot.

1989
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,230
That far?

1990
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:39,110
Good grief, this is elder abuse.

1991
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,370
Now this brings back memories.

1992
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:48,120
It really feels like we're back in the good ol' days.

1993
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,130
We traveled across the lands.

1994
00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:01,140
Everything was new and brilliant.

1995
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:31,000
You three were always there,
in those beautiful memories.

1996
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:39,880
You know, I've long been looking forward
to us all getting together again.

1997
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,760
Thank you, Frieren.

1998
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:48,770
Thanks to you, I got to go on
an awfully fun adventure at the end.

1999
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,460
It's truly beautiful.

2000
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:44,950
I believe Himmel was happy.

2001
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,910
You think?

2002
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,000
I hear that girl was one of Himmel's comrades.

2003
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,500
She doesn't look the least bit sad.

2004
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,710
How heartless.

2005
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,300
Oh, but we don't look sad, either!

2006
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,800
Bishop, do your job!

2007
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,140
You heartless man!

2008
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,180
So harsh.

2009
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:41,750
I don't know anything about this man, though.

2010
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,440
I traveled with him a mere ten years.

2011
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,900
Humans have short lifespans.

2012
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,030
I knew that.

2013
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,950
So why didn't I try to get to know him better?

2014
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,260
Don't pat my head.

2015
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:38,060
Well then, I'll be heading back to the holy city.

2016
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,820
Show me your faces, you two.

2017
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,690
I imagine this will be the last time, after all.

2018
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,450
Are you ill?

2019
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,200
All those years of drinking have caught up with me.

2020
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:52,910
It's divine punishment.

2021
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,410
If you stop by the holy city,

2022
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:59,080
pour a drink in my honor.

2023
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,670
Are you not scared of dying, Heiter?

2024
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,550
We're the heroes who saved the world.

2025
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:13,600
We are surely guaranteed a life of luxury in Heaven.

2026
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:17,930
That's why I fought with you guys.

2027
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,640
Sorry excuse for a priest.

2028
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,650
Well then, I'll be going on ahead.

2029
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,780
Alright, I should also get going.

2030
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,830
Off to collect more magic?

2031
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,620
Yeah, there's that too,

2032
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,500
but I think I'm going to try
learning more about humans.

2033
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,050
I see.

2034
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,010
There's something I wanted to ask you about that.

2035
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:55,100
Since I'm a mage, having a strong
vanguard would be a great help.

2036
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,810
Spare me.

2037
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,060
I'm no longer an age where I can swing an axe.

2038
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,940
Don't make that face, Frieren.

2039
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:11,190
Life goes on longer than you'd think
after you start slowing down.

2040
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,950
I see.

2041
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,950
See you again, Eisen.

2042
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,950
Yeah, see you.

2043
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:57,030
Episode 1: The End of an Adventure

2044
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,410
It's the same tree.

2045
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,250
I always get lost in this forest.

2046
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,580
Where am I?

2047
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:10,250
20 years after the death

2048
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:10,250
of Himmel the Hero

2049
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:10,250
Central Lands,

2050
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:10,250
Outskirts of the

2051
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:10,250
Holy City of Strahl

2052
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:10,250
20 years after the death

2053
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:10,250
of Himmel the Hero

2054
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:10,250
Central Lands,

2055
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:10,250
Outskirts of the

2056
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:10,250
Holy City of Strahl

2057
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,010
Are you looking for something?

2058
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,010
Is something the matter?

2059
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:24,940
Ah, I'm looking for the home
of someone called Heiter.

2060
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,600
Then you're a guest.

2061
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:33,150
You're still alive, you sorry excuse for a priest.

2062
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:38,570
It's surprisingly hard to make a cool exit.

2063
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,950
I brought some booze to leave by your grave.

2064
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,580
Want a drink?

2065
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,870
I've stopped drinking.

2066
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,210
I see.

2067
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:51,380
I don't think the Goddess will forgive you
at this point, mister goody-two-shoes.

2068
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,470
Thank you.

2069
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,560
Who's that?

2070
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,440
Her name is Fern.

2071
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,820
She's a war orphan from the Southern Lands.

2072
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,030
That's unlike you.

2073
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:18,410
You were never the type
to go out of your way for those in need.

2074
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,530
You're not Himmel, after all.

2075
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,830
Frieren, why did you visit?

2076
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,040
I happened to be shopping in the holy city.

2077
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:32,380
I've been trying to involve myself
with humans during my travels.

2078
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,340
Besides, I owe you quite a bit,

2079
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,380
so I came to return the favors before you die on me.

2080
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,100
In that case, I have a request.

2081
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,230
Won't you take an apprentice?

2082
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:52,980
Fern has the potential to be a mage.

2083
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,110
Please take her on your journey.

2084
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:02,120
Sorry, Heiter. That's the one request I can't grant.

2085
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,620
She'd be in the way.

2086
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:09,250
You know the survival rate of
apprentice mages in combat, don't you?

2087
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,670
I have no intention of sending a child
entrusted to me by a friend to her death.

2088
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:20,970
I see. Then I have a different request.

2089
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,890
This was discovered in Ewig the Sage's tomb.

2090
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:37,400
It's said this grimoire contains lost magic
for reviving the dead and attaining immortality.

2091
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:41,030
I can't imagine such magic existing, though.

2092
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:45,030
That's part of why I want to ask you to decipher it.

2093
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,620
Can you do it?

2094
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,290
It's a cipher using pictures.

2095
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:52,120
The people of that age sure liked this kind of thing.

2096
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,920
Well, if you give me five or six years.

2097
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,130
I see.

2098
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:00,760
But what are you going to do
with something like this?

2099
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,550
I thought you weren't scared of dying.

2100
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,510
Two things about that.

2101
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:10,520
First, I was trying to
show off in front of the two of you.

2102
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,980
Also, I'm more afraid
of dying now than I was back then.

2103
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:19,650
Well, even if it's not immortality, I just want a little...

2104
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:24,070
Just a little more time. That's all I need.

2105
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:32,290
Besides, it says to live healthily in the scriptures.

2106
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:35,500
What is a long life, if not that?

2107
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,210
Sorry excuse for a priest.

2108
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:43,220
Oh, and, it's fine if it's just during your spare time,

2109
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,300
but would you please teach Fern some magic?

2110
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,930
I'm a priest, so it's a bit out of my wheelhouse.

2111
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,440
Sure, that much I don't mind.

2112
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,900
There you are.

2113
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,620
It was hard to find you.

2114
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,080
Do you always train in the forest?

2115
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:13,290
So it was hard for even Lady Frieren to find me.

2116
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:18,080
Sir Heiter often tells me
I don't have much of a presence.

2117
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,210
That's quite a good thing, isn't it?

2118
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,970
I suppose so.

2119
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:31,970
It's true, I can barely detect her mana.

2120
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:35,230
She has excellent control over it.

2121
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:39,690
Just how much training has she put in at this age?

2122
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:45,740
Sir Heiter said I could become a full-fledged
mage if I can shoot through that rock.

2123
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,030
I guess Heiter gets it, that rock—

2124
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:59,670
My mana disperses like that, so I can't reach it.

2125
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,670
I see.

2126
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:05,630
How should I train to this end?

2127
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:08,430
Hey, can I ask you something first?

2128
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:10,890
Do you like magic?

2129
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,890
Moderately.

2130
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,890
Then we're alike.

2576
