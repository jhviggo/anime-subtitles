00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:04,740
We're still lacking quite a lot of information.

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,240
We should consider what to do
if the replica doesn't have free will.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,740
Though I guess it'll turn into
a pure contest of power, then.

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,520
Could you beat it?

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,370
Dunno, not sure.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,000
Um, in that case,

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,510
I might be able to kill Lady Frieren.

8
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:31,540
Is that so?

9
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,140
Yes.

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,970

Episode 25: Fatal Gap

287

So, to confirm,

288
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,070
if the replica does have free will,

289
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:30,790
we'll use Edel's mind control magic
to break my mental defenses,

290
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,960
and Fern will make the kill, yeah?

291
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,510
Yes.

292
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,590
That's it?

293
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,640
Sir Dunst.

294
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,650
What about Lady Edel?

295
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,970
She was pierced by Lady Sense's
replica and dropped out.

296
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,060
I see.

297
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,280
Sir Blei, as well?

298
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,050
I managed to get away because he bought me time.

299
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,050
I only hope he managed to escape safely.

300
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,050
Leave me! Go!

301
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,900
But...

302
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,740
It's better than none of us making it.

303
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,410
I have information.

304
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,640
Could we cooperate?

305
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:46,330
That was my intention from the beginning.

306
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,370
Is there anyone who can treat him?

307
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,270
I have a copy of the holy scriptures.

308
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,170
I can cast a simple healing spell.

309
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,550
Please do.

310
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,310
I see.

311
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,310
So the replicas have no free will?

312
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,840
Yes. According to Lady Edel's investigation,

313
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,350
they are thoroughly imitating a person's free will,

314
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,950
but do not actually possess it themselves.

315
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,700
Well, there goes the last
easy way of defeating them.

316
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,950
We'll need to make a plan on that basis.

317
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,580
That said, Frieren, there are still
too many uncertainties.

318
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,840
The biggest problem is that we don't know
how those replicas work, or what's creating them.

319
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,090
We can't act without knowing their nature.

320
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:46,970
Especially since we don't know if they have
the same weaknesses replicas usually do.

321
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,520
If that replica really is just as strong
as Frieren, there may very well be casualties.

322
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,760
I'm not telling you.

323
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,950
Didn't think so.

324
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,910
They don't have any weaknesses.

325
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:07,290
A monster from the age of myth called
the Spiegel is controlling the replicas.

326
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,120
Lawine.

327
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,790
How do you know that?

328
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,540
My oldest brother was part of
the Continental Magic Association's advance team

329
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,670
for their attempt at conquering
the Ruined King's Tomb.

330
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,660
So you had information.

331
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,890
No wonder you made it this far.

332
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,510
Not very rational if you ask me, though.

333
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:36,030
You should have shared that information
and cooperated with us from the start.

334
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:39,440
We couldn't really cooperate in that atmosphere.

335
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,380
And before we knew it,
Frieren had already gone ahead.

336
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:48,540
Besides, you're the kind to ruthlessly abandon
others if there aren't any rules, aren't you, old man?

337
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,540
There was no way we could just cooperate.

338
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,070
She really hates you, doesn't she?

339
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,920
I am indeed an old man,

340
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,800
but it's not easy having it said to your face, eh?

341
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,580
Maybe you should apologize?

342
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,180
My bad, pops.

343
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,810
According to the advance team's observations,

344
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:17,200
Spiegel is behind that door, inside the treasure room.

345
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:22,570
Apparently its real body is
a weak monster with no offensive capabilities.

346
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:27,200
If you defeat it, the replicas will disappear.

347
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:31,320
That matches what we've
figured out with mana detection.

348
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,740
The monster is behind the door.

349
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:40,480
But a powerful seal has been cast on it.

350
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,480
I've confirmed that as well.

351
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,840
It's the work of my replica.

352
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,850
It's the Spell That Guards
a Treasure Room Door With One's Life.

353
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:55,230
It's a top-grade folk sealing spell.

354
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,930
That door won't open unless the caster dies.

355
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,400
There's also the option of bypassing
the door and breaking through the wall,

356
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,610
but I bet that's been accounted for already.

357
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:16,620
Regardless, that means we need to beat
that replica in order to defeat Spiegel.

358
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,500
We'd better hurry if we want to defeat it.

359
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,710
What do you mean?

360
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:28,000
Spiegel creates replicas
of everyone inside the dungeon.

361
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,470
Those replicas have a habit
of gravitating toward the core.

362
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:41,440
Besides my brother's unit, the previous
advance team was almost entirely wiped out.

363
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,130
Right here, just before the dungeon's core.

364
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,570
I see.

365
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,420
Excuse me...

366
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,340
The replicas are thoroughly
imitating people's free will, right?

367
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:07,840
So weaknesses based on behavioral patterns
should be the same as the original, right?

368
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,590
In all likelihood.

369
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,970
In that case, we might still have a chance.

370
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,630
What would that weakness be?

371
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:26,070
Lady Frieren, could you stand by the wall over there?

372
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,740
Sure.

373
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:47,830
This is...

374
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,680
Unbelievable...

375
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,180
Of all the things...

376
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,890
You've noticed.

377
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,400
Did you get anything?

378
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,430
Nope.

379
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:02,170
This is indeed a fatal gap in Frieren's defenses.

380
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,580
How did I miss this while fighting her?

381
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:12,070
No, knowing that she's a master
is precisely what prevented me from noticing.

382
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:19,330
The moment she uses a spell,
her mana detection cuts out for just an instant.

383
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,460
Isn't that a mistake apprentice mages often make?

384
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,840
Yeah, I've always had trouble with that.

385
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,590
If you were aware of it, why didn't you tell us?

386
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,140
I mean, it's embarrassing.

387
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,540
Is now the time to be saying that?

388
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:39,730
That said, she's superior in all other aspects.

389
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:45,210
There are not going to be many
mages who can make use of that gap.

390
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,480
Regardless, let's discuss our strategy.

391
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,260
Assuming we manage to deal with Frieren's replica...

392
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,860
Lady Frieren, you look like you're having fun.

393
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,680
Yeah.

394
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,650
Alright, here's the plan.

395
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:34,000
So, Eisen, you'll lure it in and attack it from the side.

396
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,330
Frieren will provide covering fire.

397
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,280
What about Heiter?

398
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,690
He's got a hangover, so he's out for today.

399
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,780
He's stone dead.

400
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:09,060
I was just thinking how we'd often have discussions
like this when trying to beat a dungeon boss.

401
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:32,960
Alright.

402
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,720
Let's conquer this dungeon.

403
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,220
Can you win?

404
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:43,220
Don't worry, no dungeon is unconquerable.

405
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:49,850
I'm the mage of the party that conquered
more dungeons than any other.

406
00:11:53,130 --> 00:12:00,120
Are you sure you'll be fine with just
the two of you fighting against Frieren's replica?

407
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,270
It'll be easier to predict its actions with fewer people.

408
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:12,880
We'd almost certainly win if everyone fought,
but I think the majority of us would die.

409
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:17,530
There probably wouldn't be a chance
to use the escape golems, either.

410
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:23,760
So, holding back the replicas heading
towards the core is more important?

411
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:33,020
If we're attacked from behind, it'll be the end of us.

412
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,400
Okay. As planned, then.

413
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,030
Yes, I wish you luck.

414
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,670
Alright, open the door.

415
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,560
Now, then.

416
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:09,900
Everyone state their worst matchup among us.

417
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,390
Zudrazirm.

418
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,300
It's exactly the behavior Lady Frieren predicted.

419
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,110
Vulsanbel.

420
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,080
My mana detection cut out.

421
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,820
I'm going to be wary of Fern,
who used that chance to hide.

422
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,710
But since I'm fighting
an opponent just as strong as I,

423
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,840
I don't have the luxury of searching for her.

424
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,260
I mean,

425
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,980
I know best just how scary I can be.

426
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,230
It'll be fine.

427
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:37,730
When you've completely hidden yourself,
even I can't find you that easily.

428
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:42,690
Is Solltrag really the right spell
to use for the attack, though?

429
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,070
It has the shortest casting time.

430
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:52,450
What's more, since Solltrag
is a relatively new spell for elves,

431
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:57,710
it hasn't been long enough for us to be
able to defend against it with pure instinct.

432
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:01,200
Processing it will take just a moment,

433
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,470
an almost insignificant amount of time,

434
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,970
but it'll delay my defense.

435
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,420
But you're different.

436
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:15,100
For you, Solltrag is a normal spell
that's been around since before you were born,

437
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,610
and it's been carved into you
as a fundamental of being a mage.

438
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,360
Your Solltrag can kill me.

439
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,550
Put as much mana into it as you can.

440
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:50,640
Frieren, you hate me, don't you?

441
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,270
Why did you come here?

442
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:57,630
To be honest, I thought I'd never meet you again.

443
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,650
I came to deliver Master's will.

444
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,380
It's been fifty years.

445
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,640
I see.

446
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,530
So, Flamme has died.

447
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,530
Aren't you sad?

448
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,110
I raised her on a whim.

449
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,560
It's like a report.

450
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,050
What did she write?

451
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:31,680
The emperor has permitted
the research of magic throughout the country.

452
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:37,940
In human culture, magic was
treated as a demonic art until now,

453
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,480
and open research was a taboo.

454
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,190
Flamme is the one who advocated for the change,

455
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:49,850
and she was involved in the education
of these so-called imperial mages.

456
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:55,080
It says she wants me to continue her work.

457
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,300
What an extravagant will.

458
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,630
Legalizing magic is already
a remarkable feat on its own,

459
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,590
yet she asks for even more?

460
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,470
Is it that impressive?

461
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,670
It means the Unified Empire,
the largest on the continent,

462
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:16,850
will begin researching magic
and exploring its military applications.

463
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:20,490
The surrounding countries won't stay quiet, either.

464
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,860
In mere decades, magic will
have spread across the continent.

465
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,240
It's the arrival of an age
where anyone can use magic.

466
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,150
This means, in the near future,

467
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:37,490
humanity will gain the power
to resist the demon king's army.

468
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,970
I see, that's amazing.

469
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,250
Very much so.

470
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,620
It really is.

471
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,760
However, it's not what I want.

472
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,890
Leave, Frieren.

473
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,420
I will not follow such a will.

474
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,020
It's truly unpleasant.

475
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,900
An age where anyone can use magic?

476
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,080
Magic should be special.

477
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,150
I intend to only teach those with talent.

478
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,240
To think she would leave me a will like this...

479
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,160
I guess Flamme and I
never came to an understanding.

480
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,690
In the end, she was just
an apprentice I took on a whim.

481
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:26,920
Master said you would probably
get angry and rip up her will.

482
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,530
She said she wanted to tell you anyway.

483
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,680
She said her dream came true.

484
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,180
Doesn't make sense, does it?

485
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,980
Well, I'm gonna go.

486
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,340
I don't think we'll meet again.

487
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,340
Frieren.

488
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,300
You want to take a walk with me first?

489
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,880
We have all the time in the world.

490
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,320
An age where anyone could
use magic was Flamme's dream.

491
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,870
I'm sure she didn't care
about all this in the beginning.

492
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:12,260
It wasn't for humanity's sake,

493
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,490
or because she wanted power
to resist the demon king's army.

494
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,270
Do you know what her favorite spell was?

495
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,360
The Spell That Creates a Field of Flowers.

496
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:31,180
A stupid spell that's entirely useless.

497
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,640
She really loved magic.

498
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:45,470
She seriously wished
that anyone could use such a spell.

499
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,290
It made my skin crawl.

500
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:53,180
It's like the childish dream of an innocent girl.

501
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:56,050
But that's what she was.

502
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:04,160
It's a fantasy she told me when
she was a little girl, much smaller than me.

503
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:10,400
I honestly thought such an age was a long time away,

504
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,570
and not something she herself could make a reality.

505
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:22,090
In what to me was a short, ephemeral life,

506
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:25,080
she climbed her way to becoming
the founder of human magic.

507
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,220
Master always made decisions very quickly,

508
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,210
like she was being hurried on by something.

509
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:37,000
Humans have limited time.

510
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,090
The steady march of death is never too far behind.

511
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:46,780
There are many times in life
when one must make an important decision,

512
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:50,460
but they can't put those decisions off.

513
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:56,260
We can drag our feet
for a hundred, two hundred years.

514
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,790
Even if we procrastinate for
a thousand years, it's no problem at all.

515
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,040
Our time is nigh eternal, after all.

516
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:15,500
Frieren, humans have been slowly progressing
ever since they first established a civilization.

517
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,010
But from here on out,
their progress will only accelerate.

518
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,010
A thousand years.

519
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,970
In a mere thousand years,
the age of humans will come.

520
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,030
Humans will surpass us.

521
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,790
Don't neglect your training, Frieren.

522
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:00,550
If something is to kill you,

523
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,550
it'll either be the demon king...

524
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,560
or a human mage.

525
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,600
Exciting, isn't it, Serie?

526
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:23,250
A new age, full of mages and countless
spells, is just around the corner.

527
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,140
And

528
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,140
I'm
