of Himmel the Hero

559
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:35,990
Central Lands,

560
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:35,990
Glanz Strait

561
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:41,790
You see, this has long been
a dangerous area for ships.

562
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,630
All sorts of things wash up here.

563
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,980
The whole village used to take care of it,

564
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,010
but the local population has declined,
so it's been neglected.

565
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:58,050
In the past, the water was crystal-clear and beautiful.

566
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,600
I know.

567
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,470
Will this be sufficient payment?

568
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,490
A work by the Great Mage Flamme, huh?

569
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,400
Lady Frieren.

570
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,580
Is this the only grimoire in the village?

571
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,760
Yes.

572
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:23,240
Alright, we'll take on the cleaning job.

573
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,950
That grimoire is fake, isn't it?

574
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:34,760
Sounds like you've been studying
like I told you to. Good girl.

575
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,500
"Books attributed to Flamme are never real."

576
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,180
This too is a poorly made fake.

577
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,090
Then why did you accept the job?

578
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,630
He seemed troubled.

579
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,480
I can't imagine it was out of pure goodwill.

580
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,260
I suppose so. This is for myself.

581
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,990
Looks like it's going to be another long stay.

582
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,890
Thanks for always coming by, Fern.

583
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,350
I threw in an extra one for you.

584
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,010
Thank you.

585
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,310
It's already been three months, hasn't it?

586
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,310
Have you gotten used to the village?

587
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,100
Yes.

588
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:32,070
The shore gets quite cold
this time of year; take care of yourself.

589
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,950
It's already winter.

590
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,660
She's still asleep.

591
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,710
This place is a mess.

592
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,710
I just cleaned up yesterday, too.

593
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:56,470
Lady Frieren, it's morning. Please wake up!

594
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,730
Let's go continue cleaning the shore.

595
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,380
So cold...

596
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,630
I've been thinking.

597
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,510
About what?

598
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:46,640
Aren't you a really slovenly person?

599
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:52,230
Every morning, I wake you up,
feed you, and dress you.

600
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,150
I'm practically your mother.

601
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,780
I can do all that by myself.

602
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,110
But then you would sleep until noon, wouldn't you?

603
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,070
Yeah.

604
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,620
Well, I suppose I've already given up.

605
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,250
Sorry.

606
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,500
What did you do when traveling
with the heroes' party?

607
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,500
There wasn't anyone to take care of you, right?

608
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,630
I overslept frequently.

609
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,970
Did they not get angry with you?

610
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,720
They did. Just once.

611
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,760
Just once?

612
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,100
They must have been really forgiving.

613
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,890
They really were big-hearted.

614
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,560
Heiter did click his tongue sometimes, though.

615
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:35,860
Sorry.

616
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,400
Hey now.

617
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,190
Look, I get you, but...

618
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,660
That sounds more like he was absolutely livid.

619
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,800
How's the cleaning going for you?

620
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,300
About a third to go, I'd say.

621
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,050
Do you think you'll make it in time
for the New Year's festival?

622
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,260
We'll manage.

623
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:13,310
In that case, I would very much like
for you to watch the sunrise this time around.

624
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:26,320
What does the shore cleaning and
the New Year's festival have to do with each other?

625
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,700
It's their tradition to watch the sunrise
on the day of the New Year's festival.

626
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:37,590
The way the clear ocean reflects
the sun is apparently very pretty.

627
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,590
Did you not see it?

628
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,220
Did you think I could wake up in time?

629
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,720
I suppose not.

630
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,310
Let's hurry. We don't have much time.

631
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,520
No issues with the water quality.

632
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,100
Looks like we made it just in time.

633
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,850
It hardly looks like the same shore.

634
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,150
You've been a great help, Lady Frieren.

635
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:45,490
You'll participate in the festival too, right?

636
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,240
Yeah.

637
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,240
We'd love to have you.

638
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,370
Are you insane?

639
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,750
You'll have to get up before the sun rises.

640
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,870
It's not possible.

641
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,580
I'll just stay up all night, it's fine.

642
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,000
You want to see the sunrise that badly?

643
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,010
I don't really get why people care about it so much.

644
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,010
That's why I want to see it for myself.

645
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,760
I don't understand.

646
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,470
Yeah.

647
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:23,270
Why didn't you come to the New Year's festival?

648
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:28,530
Heiter collapsed in shock. Poor thing.

649
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:31,870
He just drank too much during the festival.

650
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,120
You all got to go, isn't that enough?

651
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,500
We wanted you to enjoy it, too.

652
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,380
It's just a sunrise. I doubt I'd enjoy it much.

653
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,670
No, you definitely would.

654
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,630
Why?

655
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,970
Because that's the kind of person you are.

656
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,220
She's asleep.

657
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,190
She fell asleep!

658
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:03,190
Lady Frieren, wake up! We'll be late for the festival!

659
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,770
Mom...

660
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,940
I'm not your mom!

661
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,320
Why am I doing this...?

662
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,080
Thanks, Fern.

663
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,720
It's definitely beautiful,

664
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,470
but not quite worth getting up this early for.

665
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,180
Himmel didn't get me after all.

666
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,230
Fern, let's go back to slee—

667
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,070
It's very beautiful, isn't it?

668
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,110
I guess?

669
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,860
It's just a sunrise.

670
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,450
But you look like you're having fun.

671
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:02,000
That's because you were smiling.

672
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,800
I couldn't have seen this sunrise by myself, could I?

673
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,720
Of course not. You wouldn't
be able to get up by yourself.

674
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:24,100
Episode 4: The Land Where Souls Rest

675
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,690
Are these for your family?

676
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,820
It happened a long time ago.

677
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,320
My village was attacked by demons.

678
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,200
What are you doing?

679
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,290
I'm praying.

680
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,210
When people die, they return to the void.

681
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,210
They go to Heaven.

682
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:50,670
A couple thousand years ago, it was
the prevalent view that people returned to the void.

683
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,050
Dwarves value tradition.

684
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:56,930
Well, I'm also skeptical of Heaven.

685
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:02,180
Since current magical research
hasn't been able to observe posthumous souls,

686
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,560
it can't be proven to exist.

687
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,190
I think it's fine either way.

688
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:12,190
I don't think whether it exists or not matters, either.

689
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:15,740
Is it okay for you to say that,
you sorry excuse for a priest?

690
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,620
But even if it doesn't exist,
I still believe that it should.

691
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,830
Why?

692
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,170
Because it's more convenient for it to exist.

693
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:32,050
It wouldn't be right for people to live their lives
in earnest, only to end up returning to the void.

694
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:39,300
It's better to look forward
to a life of luxury in Heaven.

695
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,770
That is more convenient.

696
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,310
Let's pray.

697
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,440
Yeah.

698
00:11:55,650 --> 00:12:01,830
28 years after the death

699
00:11:55,650 --> 00:12:01,830
of Himmel the Hero

700
00:11:55,650 --> 00:12:01,830
Central Lands,

701
00:11:55,650 --> 00:12:01,830
Brett Region

702
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,160
28 years after the death

703
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,160
of Himmel the Hero

704
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,160
Central Lands,

705
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,160
Brett Region

706
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,120
Hey, Eisen. We're here to hang out.

707
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,340
You make it sound like it hasn't been thirty years.

708
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,960
What's a mere thirty years?

709
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,220
You're right.

710
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,720
I wouldn't have thought you'd take an apprentice.

711
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,850
Eisen, is there anything you want help with?

712
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:33,860
I hear you asked Heiter the same thing.

713
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,490
It's too soon for farewells.

714
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,610
How'd you know?

715
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,530
We'd been exchanging letters.

716
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,870
You're more diligent than you look.

717
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,330
You're just too aloof.

718
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:51,040
So, how about it? Anything you want help with?

719
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,130
Voll Valley, huh?

720
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,840
Takes me back.

721
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,220
You've been here?

722
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,260
A long time ago.

723
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,180
"A long time," she says.

724
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,850
Just how long ago must that be?

725
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,930
Perhaps prehistoric times?

726
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:11,770
I'm not that long-lived.

727
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,530
So, what is it you're looking for?

728
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:20,280
The memoirs of the Great Mage Flamme.

729
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,790
That's fine, but almost all
of Flamme's works are fakes, you know?

730
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,700
I do have a lead.

731
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:35,790
Heiter deduced the location
from records on Flamme in the holy city.

732
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:40,920
The real memoirs are somewhere in Voll Valley.

733
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:44,930
Frieren, you should know where it is.

734
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,890
That sorry excuse for a priest really dug deep.

735
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:54,940
Alright, let's start by looking for a big tree.

736
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,070
A big tree, huh?

737
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,860
Where do we even start?

738
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,360
There's an outrageous amount of those.

739
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,660
I guess we have all the time in the world.

740
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,820
Yeah.

741
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,790
It'll make Fern unhappy though,
so let's get it done quickly.

742
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,670
Let's make sure to search efficiently.

743
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,760
You've changed.

744
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,800
You were never the type
to consider other people's time.

745
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:28,180
Well, Fern's scary when she gets angry.

746
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,180
I see. I'll be careful.

747
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,090
Lady Frieren.

748
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:11,390
There are some ruins to the west
that have been swallowed up by a tree.

749
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,310
This way.

750
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,190
Got it.

751
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:22,780
Hey, why did you decide
to search for Flamme's memoirs?

752
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,530
I felt sorry for you.

753
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:27,450
Huh?

754
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:32,080
I felt sorry for you and Himmel.

755
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:35,080
On that day thirty years ago,

756
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:39,080
you said you regretted not knowing him better.

757
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:44,340
You should tell him those words directly.

758
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:53,220
It's said that there are records
of talking with the dead in Flamme's memoirs.

759
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,560
That's a fairy tale.

760
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,480
Besides, it's not like I'm dying
to see him at this point.

761
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,730
All magic was a fairy tale at some point.

762
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,860
Besides, you want to
know more about Himmel, right?

763
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,870
That's why I discussed it with Heiter.

764
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,370
I was sure you'd be regretting it,

765
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,120
so I wanted to help you out.

766
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:30,640
Lady Frieren, both the tree and the ruins
are protected by a powerful barrier.

767
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:39,600
Even after a thousand years,
I'm still in the palm of Master's hand, huh?

768
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,520
How's that little sapling going to keep watch?

769
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,150
Don't sell it short.

770
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:52,910
Once it grows, it'll continue protecting
this place for a thousand years, if need be.

771
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,700
You'll be dead by then, though.

772
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,620
But you won't.

773
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,880
At some point you'll make a great mistake,

774
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,550
and find yourself wanting to know someone.

775
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,300
You want me to know you better?
Are you that starved for attention?

776
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,840
That's not it.

777
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,260
I'm telling you to come back here when that happens.

778
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:20,310
As the Great Mage Flamme, I'll help you out.

779
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,580
Those are Flamme's memoirs?

780
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,660
Are they the real thing?

781
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,540
They are.

782
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,540
How can you tell?

783
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,090
Frieren is Flamme's number one apprentice.

784
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:54,220
The Great Mage Flamme is an ancient hero
written about in magic history, right?

785
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,060
Are we sure she hasn't been
around since prehistoric times?

786
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:01,640
Is there anything about conversing with the dead?

787
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,060
It was conveniently already open to that page.

788
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,320
She knew that I was going to
come here a thousand years before.

789
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,410
Obnoxious as always.

790
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:17,330
At the far northern edge of the continent,

791
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:21,370
I arrived at the place
the people of this world call heaven:

792
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:25,710
Aureole, the land where souls rest.

793
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,840
It was a place where many souls gathered,

794
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,880
and where I was able
to converse with my old comrades.

795
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,430
This discovery of the century

796
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:41,140
surely will advance
the research of souls dramatically.

797
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,150
Is this true?

798
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,360
Who knows. She was quite the free spirit.

799
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,480
Heaven exists.

800
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,990
It's more convenient that way, right?

801
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:59,370
That it is. I guess I'll try believing her.

802
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,540
Where exactly is this?

803
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,420
One moment.

804
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,290
Ende, in the far north.

805
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,420
Ende? That's—

806
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,380
Yep.

807
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,510
It's where the demon king's castle is now.

808
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,600
Why there?

809
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,640
Frieren.

810
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:27,400
Go find Aureole and talk with Himmel.

811
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:32,280
You're going to help me out, right?

812
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,280
Eisen, you've gotten crafty.

813
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,910
I got it from Heiter.

814
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:44,290
Fine, it's not like we were
traveling anywhere specific.

815
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,710
It's super cold near the demon king's castle though.

816
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:52,670
I don't really want to go.

817
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,970
She's already losing steam.

818
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,970
She fell asleep.

819
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,720
How carefree.

820
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:09,150
It's cold. I don't wanna go.

821
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,480
She's sleep-complaining.

822
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:14,320
Is it really that cold up there?

823
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:23,490
Ende is at the northern edge
of the continent, after all.

824
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:27,410
Moreover, a lot went on out there.

825
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,000
A lot?

826
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,800
This is awkward.

827
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,430
Maybe I'll wake Lady Frieren.

828
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:46,730
Lady Frieren, Lady Frieren!

829
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,480
I guess that's not happening.

830
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:56,900
Say, Fern. Is she a good master?

831
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,150
I wonder.

832
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,280
I'm not quite sure.

833
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:07,290
I keep getting dragged into
her wild quests for new magic.

834
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:14,290
It seems like she's interested
in learning more about the heroes' party,

835
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:19,930
but it's possible she's not all that interested in me.

836
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:27,220
Lady Frieren only took me as an apprentice
because of her promise with Sir Heiter, after all.

837
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,560
I see.

838
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:34,480
She's a very intriguing person, though.

839
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:40,200
Over the course of our travels,
she's begun giving me birthday presents,

840
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:43,200
despite being so indifferent normally.

841
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:48,950
Just what is she thinking? It's a mystery.

842
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:58,210
Frieren, are you not going to stay in the capital?

843
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,380
I'll continue my journey.

844
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,880
By yourself?

845
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,720
It's nice and easy.

846
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,560
You won't take an apprentice or something?

847
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,470
It's better to have someone to talk to on a journey.

848
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,230
It would be a waste of time.

849
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,980
Even if I teach them a bunch,
they'll die soon anyways.

850
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:21,860
Frieren, that's not what
making relationships is about.

851
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,320
It is.

852
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,370
Our adventure made up less than
a hundredth of my life, too.

853
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,870
I thought you'd understand, Eisen.

854
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,460
I...

855
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,630
Alright, enough with the heavy talk!

856
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:42,420
We're supposed to be celebrating! Let's have a drink!

857
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:45,300
You just want an excuse to drink.

858
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,890
I've been found out.

859
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:49,390
You're always drinking, anyways.

860
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:51,220
You sorry excuse for a priest.

861
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,770
Fern.

862
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,280
She's a good master.

863
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,200
I suppose she is.

864
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,120
You're really not gonna come with?

865
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,540
No.

866
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:17,290
I told you before, I'd be in the way.

867
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,920
I see.

868
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,670
You remember the route to Ende, right?

869
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:26,640
Yeah. First, we go past Wille.

870
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,600
Then through Riegel Canyon
to the Northern Lands border.

871
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:34,180
Sorry about this.

872
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,940
It'll be a long journey.

873
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,020
It took us ten years.

874
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,400
I see.

875
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:48,160
It's the same path that the heroes' party
took to the Demon King's castle, isn't it?

876
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,230
Yeah.

877
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:19,100
A mere ten-year adventure.
