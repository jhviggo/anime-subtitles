How long have you guys been traveling?

563
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,340
Uh...

564
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,890
It's been around four years since
I started traveling with Lady Frieren.

565
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,380
About a year for me.

566
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,370
I see.

567
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,010
You know, this party is missing something.

568
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,030
What do you think it is?

569
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,920
We have a vanguard, some mages, and a priest.

570
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,520
Perhaps a thief?

571
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,230
Since Lady Frieren always falls for mimics.

572
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,300
Geez.

573
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,180
Treasure chests hold limitless potential.

574
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,400
No.

575
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,750
We're missing something more important.

576
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,560
We're missing a milf!

577
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,290
Normally there's at least one in a party!

578
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,060
A sexy and mature older woman!

579
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,570
Is there, now?

580
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,030
We have Frieren, don't we?

581
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,100
She's not a milf, though...

582
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,780
He looks incredibly pained.

583
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,030
Well, sorry about that.

584
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,200
L-Look, we're almost at the next village!

585
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,440
They're still breathing.

586
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,310
Yeah, same here.

587
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,980
What happened?

588
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,310
They're all asleep.

589
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,910
This smells of trouble.
We should move on to the next village.

590
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,420
Don't make me angry, Lady Frieren.

591
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,810
Just kidding.

592
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,020
It's a curse.

593
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,680
I knew it. What a pain.

594
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,640
Hey, Frieren, what's a curse?

595
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,090
Among the spells used by monsters and demons,

596
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:55,230
some do things like putting
people to sleep, or turning them to stone.

597
00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:01,210
Of those, ones that humanity
doesn't yet understand are called curses.

598
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,600
Humanity's mastery of magic is
insufficient to comprehend or dispel them.

599
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,060
So, it's already over for this village?

600
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,690
That only applies to humanity's magic.

601
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,820
It's another story for the goddess's magic wielded by priests.

602
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,450
Dealing with curses has
long been the domain of priests.

603
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,830
How's it look, Sein?
Think you can fix 'em up?

604
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,060
Don't rush me.

605
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,760
I'm trying to figure out
the type and source of the curse.

606
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,470
How is the goddess's magic
different from other magic?

607
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:42,530
Her magic is written in the holy scriptures,

608
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,970
and can only be used by those who possess them.

609
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:50,230
Much like with demons' magic,
we don't understand most of it.

610
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,480
That's why the scriptures aren't very interesting.

611
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,990
Besides, it's hard to use if you
don't have the innate capacity for it.

612
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,490
That capacity also makes curses less effective.

613
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,620
I think it's called the goddess's blessing?

614
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,000
It's why priests are generally resistant to curses.

615
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,360
So even you can't defend against curses very well?

616
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,720
Mages can't really detect curses, no.

617
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,080
It does vaguely feel like I'm being attacked,

618
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,280
so this village is probably
still under the effect of the curse.

619
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,610
It feels prickly.

620
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,910
You mean we're actively being cursed?!

621
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:32,980
That's terrifying!

622
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,730
It looks to be a pretty unusual curse.

623
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,740
You can't dispel it?

624
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,190
I'd need to perform a ritual,
and I'd need tools to do it.

625
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,410
It'll be faster to stop this curse at the source.

626
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,250
It's being cast by a monster.

627
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,060
I've determined where it's located, too.

628
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:51,790
Let's go.

629
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,160
Nice and straightforward.

630
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,050
Lady Frieren.

631
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,940
Sir Stark, he...

632
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,990
He's asleep.

633
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,480
Could you wake him temporarily?

634
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,650
With my current abilities,
not for more than five seconds.

635
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,560
That's practically nothing.

636
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,790
Looks like we should really hurry.

637
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,430
Fern won't wake up.

638
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,720
I told her we'd only be taking a short break.

639
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,220
The sleep got to Fern too, huh?

640
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,350
This is starting to get quite dangerous.

641
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,430
I put up a barrier.

642
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,860
Let's stash these two here.

643
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,860
We're almost there. It's close by.

644
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,000
Okay.

645
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,240
Alright, Sein, wake me up when you find it.

646
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,090
Don't fight it by yourself.

647
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,000
I'll defeat it, no matter what.

648
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,550
You know, I told you five seconds is the—

649
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,140
Frieren?

650
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,880
What good is five seconds gonna do?

651
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,270
Oh well.

652
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:39,060
I do know some combat-oriented magic as well.

653
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,250
It's a subspecies of chaos bloom.

654
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,490
The sleeping villagers are fertilizer for it, huh?

655
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,260
They'll steadily have their
mana drained until they die.

656
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:17,620
Chaos blooms mix with local
vegetation and develop into subspecies.

657
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,520
It's like a mirror.

658
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:27,530
But no matter how its form changes,
its core is always its weak point.

659
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,120
Three Lances of the Goddess!

660
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,290
What happened?

661
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:46,300
Did it deflect my magic?

662
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,800
If I don't precisely hit the core,

663
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,930
its leaves could deflect my magic in any direction.

664
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,680
In the worst case, it could hit Frieren...

665
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,090
Shit. This isn't going anywhere.

666
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,020
Should I wake Frieren?

667
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,650
She's the mage of the heroes' party, though.

668
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,650
If her magic gets deflected...

669
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,660
Never mind the forest,
the whole village could be leveled.

670
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,660
We've only got five seconds.

671
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,910
That's not enough time to explain.

672
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:22,920
We haven't had enough time to build
the trust needed to convey the issue fast enough.

673
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,160
I don't even understand what she's thinking.

674
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,510
That's right.

675
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:34,140
You don't know what other people are thinking.

676
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:41,390
I believe that adventurers don't need
to understand or trust each other.

677
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:47,270
My old companion, Frieren,
was especially clumsy in that regard.

678
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:53,190
That's why I decided to trust her words.

679
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,220
She said she would defeat
the demon king, no matter what.

680
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,290
And I believed what she said.

681
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,540
Believe what she said, huh?

682
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,770
Don't fight it by yourself.

683
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,260
I'll defeat it, no matter what.

684
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,220
What a sloppy face that was.

685
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,230
Don't blame me for whatever happens!

686
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,480
Ward of Awakening!

687
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,400
Frieren, only the core—

688
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,370
Okay, got it.

689
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,390
What the hell happened?

690
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,440
Thank you very much.

691
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,920
We won't forget this.

692
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,700
No, we didn't do that much.

693
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,590
No, you've awoken us for
a morning we'll never forget.

694
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:33,930
It just hit me when I woke up.
"Oh, this is one of those magic-reflecting ones."

695
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,840
You really are an incredible mage, huh?

696
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,350
We only made it out of this alive
because of you, though.

697
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,720
Thanks.

698
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,360
I'm proud of you.

699
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,670
The woman in that village sure was pretty.

700
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,410
He's still on about this.

701
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,900
So that's Vorig.

702
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:10,540
29 years after the death

703
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:10,540
of Himmel the Hero

704
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:10,540
Northern Lands,

705
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:10,540
The Fortress City of Vorig

706
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:10,540
29 years after the death

707
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:10,540
of Himmel the Hero

708
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:10,540
Northern Lands,

709
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:10,540
The Fortress City of Vorig

710
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,540
It's the halfway point on our way
to the city of magic, Äußerst.

711
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,970
We've only just reached halfway.

712
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,420
It really is a long journey, isn't it?

713
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,690
Anyway, let's go resupply in Vorig, and...

714
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:24,030
Um, Lady Frieren. This is awkward, but our funds...

715
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,000
Hey, you over there.

716
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,810
What?

717
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,560
That's a noble's carriage.

718
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,210
Huh?

719
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,320
What? What's going on?

720
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,320
Good body. Acceptable looks.

721
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,950
Come to my mansion.

722
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:47,450
What is going on?!

723
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,420
What is your name?

724
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,210
Stark.

725
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:59,810
Lord Orden, this is quite troubling.

726
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,720
You know me?

727
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,920
This is the mansion of the Ordens, one of
the Three Great Knights of the Northern Lands, right?

728
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,350
Your grandfather was a pushy person as well.

729
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:12,820
What nonsense are you speaking?

730
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:16,360
Regardless, I'm currently talking with Stark.

731
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,110
He's my party's vanguard.

732
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:25,740
Stark, do I need your mommy's
permission to talk with you?

733
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,240
Please don't fight.

734
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,870
I have a request. I'll pay well.

735
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,630
This is absurd. Let's go, Stark.

736
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,290
Lady Frieren.

737
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,750
What about those copper coins?

738
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,890
They're all the funds we have, apparently.

739
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,850
We may as well hear you out.

740
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:50,770
Frieren...

741
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,560
Stark, where are you from?

742
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,150
A village of warriors in Klee, in the Central Lands.

743
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:04,780
I see. My family is originally from that village, too.

744
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,020
This is my eldest son, Wirt.

745
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:16,290
My heir, and the champion of this city.

746
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,170
He resembles Sir Stark quite a bit, doesn't he?

747
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,300
He’s his spitting image.

748
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,390
If we dressed him up,

749
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:26,180
no one from outside our house would notice.

750
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,600
Does that have something to do with your request?

751
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,200
There was a major battle
with the demons last month.

752
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,970
Wirt died in that battle.

753
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,570
He died killing the enemy's general.

754
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:46,570
That it was a chaotic melee was a small mercy.

755
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:53,190
The only ones who know of his death
are Gabel here and my closest aides.

756
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,590
What do you plan to make Stark do?

757
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:06,720
The fortress city of Vorig is
the cornerstone of defense for this region.

758
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:11,970
I can't allow morale to drop
until our army has recovered.

759
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,630
So you want to cover up your son's death until then.

760
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:22,010
The most influential people in the region
will gather at a ball in three months.

761
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:24,570
We'll show them there that Wirt is alive and well.

762
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,520
What's the reward?

763
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,490
Ten gold Strahl coins.

764
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,240
That's three meals and a snack every day for a year.

765
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,750
Throw in a grimoire.

766
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:37,000
You may take one of your choosing from the library.

767
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,620
Wait, this is never going to work.

768
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,840
First of all, what about this scar?

769
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,700
I've already told the people that Wirt is recovering.

770
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,840
It's a battle scar.

771
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,210
Sir Stark, we need the money.

772
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,730
Sadness.

773
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:59,450
Gabel. Drill proper etiquette into this boy.

774
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:29,770
Sir Stark, how are your lessons going?

775
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,010
They're hell.

776
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,660
What do you think?

777
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,660
It doesn't suit you.

778
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,650
So mean.

779
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,180
I'm gonna go get some fresh air.

780
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,910
Lord Orden.

781
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,940
I keep telling you, call me Father.

782
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,170
You never know where people may be listening.

783
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,550
Aren't you being too cold?

784
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,510
It's been less than two months
since your son died, right?

785
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:15,260
I'm only fulfilling his last request.

786
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,890
We had a different double prepared.

787
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,180
Though he didn't resemble Wirt as much as you.

788
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:26,530
Though indeed, it brings me no joy to do this.

789
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,490
But this is my son's will.

790
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,740
You'll have to bear with it.

791
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,920
You're really bad with words, dude.

792
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,500
Mut, straighten up.

793
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,140
Yes, Father.

794
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,490
That's my second son, Mut.

795
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,880
Even though he's to become my heir,
he's having trouble improving.

796
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:59,430
In contrast, Stark is a failure.

797
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,910
Your skill with the sword shows in your posture.

798
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,570
I will teach you the Orden sword style.

799
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,450
What's wrong?

800
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,060
It's okay. Take a deep breath.

801
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,520
This is not your hometown.

802
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,090
What do you think of Mut, Lord Orden?

803
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,390
He's not as talented as his brother.

804
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,730
But he's a hard worker.

805
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:44,280
His training will not betray him.

806
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,770
He will become a stronger knight than me.

807
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,400
I see.

808
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,780
You should tell Mut that.

809
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,120
I always do.

810
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,210
That's why he's struggling
to improve—it goes to his head.

811
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,040
Well, that's a problem.

812
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,040
What?

813
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,670
I'm also taking lessons?

814
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,690
It's a ball, you know.

815
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:12,840
Did you think it would be acceptable
for a boy of age to go by himself?

816
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:17,230
Or is Mommy here going to take him?

817
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,240
Good luck.

818
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:56,800
This past month was hell.

819
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,970
We need the money, right?

820
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,010
I'm sorry.

821
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,730
We put all that work into practicing. Let's dance.

822
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,610
This really doesn't suit you.

823
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,060
Shall we dance, too?

824
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,780
I'm going to eat cake.

825
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:35,930
I see.

826
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:45,780
I would have been the one on
the front lines if not for this injury.

827
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,490
Maybe Wirt wouldn't've died.

828
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,650
Sir.

829
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,090
I take it the ball has ended.

830
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,340
This marks the end of my request.

831
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:05,330
Gabel, give Frieren the payment.

832
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:18,340
Stark, your ability as a warrior is incredible.

833
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,360
If you'd like to—

834
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,200
I'm not a replacement for your son.

835
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,390
That's true.

836
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,620
I, too, am not a replacement for your father.

837
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,730
But you don't have a place to call home, do you?

838
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:37,050
The village of warriors in Klee
was wiped out by demons.

839
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,500
I know that much.

840
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,150
I had a fight with my son the last time I saw him.

841
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,010
It was about some trivial thing.

842
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:52,020
I told him I never wanted to see his face again.

843
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:56,150
Even though I didn't truly think that.

844
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:02,900
I thought it was a miracle when I found you.

845
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,700
All the more reason I can't stay here.

846
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,910
I also said some things I didn't truly mean

847
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,750
to my adoptive father.

848
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:21,800
That's why I gotta bring back
plenty of stories from my journey.

849
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:25,020
I see.

850
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:33,810
Which grimoire should I choose?

851
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:37,400
Lady Frieren, it's already been half a day.

852
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,940
Sir Gabel is quite troubled.

853
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,440
Please hurry up.

854
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,950
Look, he looks like he's dying.

855
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:50,440
It seems it's going to take quite a while
for their army to recover.

856
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,950
What's up?

857
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,580
Nothing.

858
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:06,190
At the very least, he'll have a good heir.

859
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,270
Forgotten heroes, huh?

860
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,940
I don't even know their names,

861
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,690
He's senile...

862
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,940
they're forgotten heroes.

863
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,490
He's been alone for a long time,

864
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,990
hasn't he?

865
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,200
Humans

866
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,610
sure grow

867
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,110
fast.

868
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:30,030
Episode 16

869
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:30,030
Long-Lived Friend
