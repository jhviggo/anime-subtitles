Episode 6: Champion of the Village

559
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,390
You don't intend to fight the dragon, do you?

560
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,590
So why do you continue training?

561
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,360
When I came to this village,

562
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,520
everyone was dispirited
and lived in a constant state of fear.

563
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,200
Now they wander the streets
with smiles on their faces.

564
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,280
They say the village is safe because I'm around,

565
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,400
even though I didn't do anything.

566
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,710
The only reason the village hasn't been destroyed

567
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,670
is that the dragon hasn't felt like it.

568
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,800
Will you fight the dragon
if it attacks the village, Sir Stark?

569
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,210
I don't wanna die.

570
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:43,800
But to the people of this village, I'm a champion.

571
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,130
I'm Stark, the champion of this village.

572
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,530
I've got to protect it.

573
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:56,820
I say that, but really, I might end up deserting them.

574
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:07,290
This scar is from when I fought with my master
because I didn't want to fight monsters.

575
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,470
He'd never struck me before.

576
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,460
I'm sure he was disappointed in me.

577
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:24,490
In the end, he never praised me. Not even once.

578
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:33,480
What?

579
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,900
I don't think you'll run.

580
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,080
What do you know about me?

581
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,990
I don't know anything about you,

582
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,000
but I know what it's like to be consumed by fear.

583
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,580
Consumed by fear?

584
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,790
It was the first time I fought a monster.

585
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,460
I was more than prepared to fight it,

586
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,910
but I froze up in fear,

587
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,480
and ran.

588
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,940
The monster chased me endlessly.

589
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,420
For some reason, Lady Frieren wouldn't save me.

590
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,680
Ah, my master was like that, too.

591
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,740
When I was finally cornered,

592
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,740
I steeled myself,

593
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,070
and my body moved.

594
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,000
All I needed was resolve.

595
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,800
What you've desperately built up
will never betray you.

596
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:44,140
You're a hopeless coward, but I believe
your resolve to protect this village is real.

597
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,240
Resolve, huh?

598
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,620
How was it?

599
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,830
I don't know.

600
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,010
I don't know, but...

601
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,350
I'm sure he will be fine.

602
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,780
He isn't here.

603
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,360
So he ran.

604
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,220
What a shame.

605
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,780
I'd gotten my hopes up.

606
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,460
Fern, it's time to play some tag.

607
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,230
Frieren.

608
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,680
You need me to hold it off for thirty seconds, right?

609
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,490
You're late.

610
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,710
Can you promise me one thing?

611
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:53,080
Make sure you kill the dragon, even if I die fighting it.

612
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,210
Very well. I promise.

613
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,800
But why would you go that far for the villagers?

614
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,670
What?

615
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,720
I just thought it was a weird question.

616
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,190
I've been in this village for three whole years.

617
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,060
That's a short stay.

618
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,690
Like hell it is.

619
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,200
Alright, let's do this thing.

620
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,620
Your hands are trembling.

621
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,770
Can you really blame me?

622
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,500
You don't have to laugh.

623
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,870
You're just like Eisen.

624
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,880
My master?

625
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,630
This is going to be a tough fight.

626
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,510
Eisen, your hands are trembling. Are you scared?

627
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,380
Yeah.

628
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,840
You admitted that easily.

629
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,930
Being scared isn't a bad thing.

630
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,620
Fear has brought me this far.

631
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,920
You even tremble the same way.

632
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,600
I see.

633
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:18,670
Master was scared too.

634
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:23,170
All I need is to have resolve.

635
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,510
He's in the dragon's range.

636
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,890
It isn't attacking.

637
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,640
It's being cautious.

638
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,520
I knew it.

639
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,410
No wonder it stopped attacking the village.

640
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,310
Dragons are smart.

641
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:55,710
They're not so foolish they'd go
out of their way to fight a strong opponent.

642
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,170
Eisen didn't punch him because he was weak,

643
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:05,630
or because he was a disappointment.

644
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,890
We had a falling-out.

645
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,770
You punched him?

646
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:22,350
I moved reflexively...

647
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,780
I feel bad for the poor kid.

648
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,720
I was scared.

649
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,280
I was scared of him, Frieren.

650
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,160
He's incredible.

651
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:43,880
My apprentice is going to be
one hell of a warrior.

652
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,460
Now! Shoot it down!

653
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,700
Hey! Why aren't you shooting it?!

654
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,590
I did what you asked!

655
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,720
You want me to fight it by myself?!

656
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,840
Cut the bullshit, you damn hag!

657
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,260
You're just like master, after—

658
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,640
It's already dead.

659
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,060
"Damn hag", huh?

660
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,890
That's gonna be scary later.

661
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,150
I killed it?

662
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,800
I beat it by myself?

663
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,580
Stark.

664
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,080
Good job.

665
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,430
You did better than I'd hoped.

666
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,420
I'm proud of you.

667
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,120
It's a pile of treasure!

668
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,300
We can't take everything.

669
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,280
No more than three things.

670
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,310
This really is silly.

671
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,960
This stuff is exciting for you?

672
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,440
It's a pile of treasure!

673
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:35,660
Master said the journey of the heroes' party
turned out really silly because of you.

674
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,570
I see.

675
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:41,580
A silly, and incredibly fun journey.

676
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,880
Wow! You're really making shaved ice!

677
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,800
Heh, was worth searching for.

678
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,940
What's more, it's really smooth and fluffy!

679
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,050
You're right.

680
00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:00,150
This is silly, don't we have
more important things to do?

681
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,020
What's the problem?

682
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,440
Our journey has only just begun.

683
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,810
The Hero of the South,
said to be humanity's strongest,

684
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,780
was slain by the demon king's
Seven Maleficent Sages.

685
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:17,280
We might not be surviving this journey either.

686
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,660
Do you want a hard and painful journey?

687
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:32,920
I want to have a fun journey, where we
can laugh about how silly it was afterwards.

688
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,360
Look at this! It melts as soon as you touch it!

689
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,410
You're supposed to eat it.

690
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,310
So silly.

691
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45,280
So, Frieren, what about the syrup?

692
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,430
I don't have any magic to make syrup.

693
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,270
You don't?

694
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,430
So incredibly silly.

695
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,820
So? Can you see through them?

696
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:12,080
I can, but this magic
isn't particularly interesting, is it?

697
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,050
Well, sorry for not having an interesting body.

698
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,810
What?

699
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,550
Tiny.

700
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,470
Like hell it is!

701
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:26,920
So Stark, what are you going to do now?

702
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,480
You can go back to Eisen if you want.

703
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:33,010
Master said to take me along, right?

704
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,980
Besides,

705
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:39,820
I also want to go on a silly journey now.

706
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:50,000
28 years after the death

707
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:50,000
of Himmel the Hero

708
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:50,000
Central Lands,

709
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:50,000
Riegel Canyon,

710
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:50,000
Fortress City of Wall

711
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:50,000
28 years after the death

712
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:50,000
of Himmel the Hero

713
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:50,000
Central Lands,

714
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:50,000
Riegel Canyon,

715
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:50,000
Fortress City of Wall

716
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,500
Monsters have been
very active in the Northern Lands.

717
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,590
No passage is permitted at this time.

718
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,850
When do you estimate
the checkpoint will open back up?

719
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,510
Who knows.

720
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:11,020
If nothing else, I've not let a single monster
or person through since I was assigned here.

721
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,980
Excuse me, captain.

722
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,130
The governor has called for you.

723
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,740
I'll be right there.

724
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,700
Listen here, adventurers.

725
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,460
Be careful that you do not
cause any problems in this city.

726
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,830
He was pretty unfriendly, wasn't he?

727
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:37,030
Yeah, he was an excellent guard.

728
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:42,140
Tough on outsiders, that's how city guards should be.

729
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,010
So, given the situation,

730
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,310
since this city seems safe, let's wait here for a while.

731
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,760
I can finally take some time to do magic research.

732
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,090
I think I'll go to a magic store
once I've left our stuff at an inn.

733
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:08,200
What? The checkpoint's closed,
nothing I can do about it.

734
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,770
Alright, go on, you're dismissed.

735
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,690
I'll go grab an inn.

736
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,920
Wanna grab some food?

737
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,420
Okay, I'll go by myself.

738
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:22,900
Scary.

739
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,140
They say sea routes have been blocked recently, too.

740
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,070
I hear the Northern Lands armies
are moving to resolve the problem,

741
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:38,480
but it's looking like at least
two years before the checkpoint re-opens.

742
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,460
It's ruining business.

743
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,370
This takes me back.

744
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,120
The Jumbo Berry Special.

745
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:53,040
Last time, I couldn't eat it all
by myself, since I was a kid,

746
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,710
so I shared it with Master.

747
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,340
Was it really this small, though?

748
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,970
That just goes to show that you've grown up.

749
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:08,970
I see. I guess it's me who got big.

750
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,860
When I was a kid, everything seemed so big,

751
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:18,990
but even Master's imposing figure
became small at some point.

752
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,040
Mister Eisen isn't young anymore,

753
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,400
so make sure to make him proud.

754
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,410
I'm in the middle of doing that now.

755
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,510
Was it really this small, though?

756
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:35,790
Time is a cruel mistress, isn't she?

757
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,580
What? I bought this with my own money,
there's nothing wrong with that.

758
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,780
Excuse me, could I get some milk?

759
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,920
You got it.

760
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:54,060
Uh, what? Why are you angry?

761
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,310
Sir Stark.

762
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,520
Okay, okay, I'll give you half.

763
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,190
No, I meant to ask,

764
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,860
how would you feel if you were told
you'd have to wait in this city for two years?

765
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,320
Huh? I wouldn't want that.

766
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,950
Right? You wouldn't want that, right?

767
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,140
Y-Yeah.

768
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,200
What's up with her?

769
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,870
I'm relieved, you're normal.

770
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,710
Hey, did I do something wrong?

771
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,340
A way to get past the checkpoint, huh?

772
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,690
Sure, I'll help you look.

773
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,340
Thank you.

774
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,350
Can't you fly over the walls?

775
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,540
At the border to the Northern Lands,

776
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:41,660
there's apparently a strong barrier up to
the maximum altitude, preventing passage.

777
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,360
Makes sense. Otherwise,
flying monsters could get in real easy.

778
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:50,440
Oh well, let's check the merchant's guild.

779
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,550
There might still be some trade happening.

780
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,630
Trade is completely blocked.

781
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,050
Even guarded caravans are prohibited.

782
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:13,140
The north must be in quite a dangerous state.

783
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,820
Maybe we will have to wait until things calm down...

784
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:22,770
No, let's check the black market
and the thieves' guild as well.

785
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,830
Won't that be too dangerous?

786
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:31,030
It'll be fine. I look pretty strong,
plus I'm good at bluffing.

787
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,910
You do look like a villain.

788
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,280
Yeah, yeah.

789
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,050
No luck, huh?

790
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:00,200
Checks out, I guess.
Situation's pretty much like a war.

791
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,310
No getting around the gate being closed.

792
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:06,860
Alright, let's go to the gatehouse, no harm in trying.

793
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,010
What?

794
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:15,610
Nothing, I was just thinking that
you were being very cooperative.

795
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:18,010
You're the one who brought this up.

796
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:20,080
You don't want to wait here, right?

797
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,080
You seem more determined than me.

798
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,060
Well, I don't have a lot of time.

799
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,010
What do you mean?

800
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,040
The view here is great, isn't it?

801
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,850
You can get a great look at the north.

802
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:42,280
Master brought me here when I was a kid.

803
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:50,580
We left for the Northern Lands from this city.

804
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,690
What kind of journey was it?

805
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:58,170
You wanna know? Back then, we...

806
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,120
Even though he normally
didn't talk about himself at all,

807
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,930
he would talk about the adventures
of the heroes' party with relish.

808
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:13,010
That mere ten-year adventure was more precious
than anything else in his long life.

809
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,760
I bet it's the same for Frieren.

810
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:19,930
I wonder about that.

811
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,430
Master's no longer at an age where he can travel.

812
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,190
He told you to take me along on your journey.

813
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:37,930
That's why I want to experience
a fun and silly journey in his place,

814
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:40,950
and come back with tons of tales to tell him.

815
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,540
That's about all I can do to repay him.

816
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,310
If we take it too slowly, he'll die before we get back.

817
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:57,490
Then we can't afford to get stuck here, can we?

818
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:02,560
Well, it does seem like he'll
keep kickin' a good while longer, though.

819
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:19,760
Lady Frieren. What are you doing back here?

820
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,620
Be quiet.

821
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,720
I'm being chased.

822
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,460
Wh-What did you do?!

823
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,820
I have no idea.

824
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,630
I was just browsing some magic stores...

825
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,850
You have my deepest apologies, Lady Frieren.

826
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,310
Please forgive me.

827
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:52,650
Wait, I really don't like where this is going.

828
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:57,650
It seems the captain was rather rude to you.

829
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,370
As the governor of this city, let me apologize.

830
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,800
No, don't worry about it.

831
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,410
He was just doing his job as a guard.

832
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:10,500
And it's not like I'm in a hurry,
rather, I'd like to relax and—

833
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,380
I take it you intend to travel north again?

834
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:21,050
I'm told the Northern Lands are deeply embroiled in
conflict with the remnants of the demon king's army.

835
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,290
You must be lamenting the current situation.

836
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:27,930
Truly the heart of a champion.

837
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:32,150
The people of the Northern Lands
will no doubt rejoice.

838
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:35,440
You may pass freely through the checkpoint.

839
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:51,390
We got through that easily.

840
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:55,450
Couldn't we have used your name from the start?

841
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,790
I didn't think it would help.

842
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,220
There goes my relaxing time.

843
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:05,360
Besides, I don't really like stuff like this.

844
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,480
Doesn't this feel awkward?

845
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,100
I'm glad I got to experience it.

846
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,610
Master also left for
the Northern Lands like this, huh?

847
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:37,880
Yeah.

848
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:43,460
I wanted to do more magic research...

849
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,740
She's still on that.

850
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:48,440
We had a long day because of this, you know?

851
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,250
Indeed.

Humans are so dramatic.
