1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:04,360
This is the goal of my journey.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,110
To meet up with my best friend
who set out ten years ago.

3
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,040
Did you find out where Gorilla was going?

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,130
Tür.

5
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,900
It's a trading city in the center of the Northern Lands.

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,130
Far to the east from here.

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,390
The opposite direction of Äußerst.

8
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,540
Yeah.

9
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,770
Frieren, I set out on this journey
to follow in Gorilla's footsteps.

10
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,430
I know.

11
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,710
The sun's about to set,

12
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,250
so why don't we figure everything out tomorrow?

13
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,400
I asked them if we could use the cabin in the village.

14
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,080
They said we're free to use it.

15
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:04,870
Thanks.

Episode 17: Take Care

291
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,840
I got some firewood.

292
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,750
I bought ingredients for dinner.

293
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,760
My hands are freezing.

294
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,520
It's gotten pretty cold, after all.

295
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,630
Wow, you're right.

296
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,480
This might be a new record, even.

297
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,390
Lemme see, too.

298
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,760
You're right, they're really cold.

299
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,640
Right?

300
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,270
Stop!

301
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,280
A new record, isn't it?

302
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,440
Yeah, it's stupid cold.

303
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,280
These kids...

304
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,790
It's snowing.

305
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,440
Will we need to hunker down
through the winter again?

306
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,670
We're not trying to cross any
steep mountains this time,

307
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,670
so it'll be fine as long as we don't get hit by a blizzard.

308
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,480
We got hit by one.

309
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,580
We sure did.

310
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,540
Yep.

311
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,590
Cold fronts around here last for around a month.

312
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,940
I'd recommend you stay here for the time being.

313
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:14,690
You're free to use the cabin for a while.

314
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,170
What are you going to do, Sein? Will you leave?

315
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,670
You need to ask that?

316
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,320
I guess you can't leave until the cold front passes.

317
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,710
Exactly.

318
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,580
That said, there's a pub and a store here,

319
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,620
and the cabin is pretty spacious.

320
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,740
We've got it a lot better than
we did in the mountains last time.

321
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:43,850
And best of all, there's a magic store
run by a shady old man in this village.

322
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:49,490
Based on my previous experiences, that's
the best kind of place for finding legendary magic.

323
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:54,110
Having the time to search that store is great.

324
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,610
Legendary magic?

325
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,690
What kinds of magic have you found so far?

326
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:05,540
A spell that erases mold and
a spell that removes stubborn oil stains.

327
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,680
Amazing.

328
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,990
Those were indeed convenient
enough to revolutionize cleaning.

329
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,290
Are these like grandma's household tricks?

330
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,640
Anyway, we're just going to have to wait it out.

331
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,780
To underestimate winter in the Northern Lands
is tantamount to suicide, after all.

332
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:28,670
Sir Stark did almost die last time.

333
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,320
I'm from the Northern Lands, you know?

334
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm well aware.

335
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:39,960
Looks like we'll be together for a little bit longer.

336
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,770
The cold front should pass soon.

337
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,260
You'll finally be able to set out.

338
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,430
Yeah, finally.

339
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:22,060
Wait, haven't we spent almost no time together?

340
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:24,550
Sein.

341
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,170
Do you have a moment?

342
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,280
What's up, Frieren?

343
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,910
It's rare for you to come to the pub.

344
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:36,210
Stark and Fern are acting weird.

345
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,420
I think they're having a fight. Can you mediate?

346
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,800
I don't mind, but why are you asking me?

347
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,710
Mediation is the priest's job.

348
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,740
It is?

349
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,490
What a scene.

350
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,360
Hey, what happened?

351
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,740
It's Sir Stark's fault.

352
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:06,360
Yes. It's all my fault.

353
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,170
This is getting us nowhere.

354
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,680
Come to the other room, one at a time.

355
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,820
So, what happened?

356
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,340
You know how when we first got here,

357
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,520
Fern touched my cheek with her cold hand?

358
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,060
Oh yeah, I remember that.

359
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,310
I got back at her today.

360
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,600
And Fern got really pissed.

361
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,070
What are you, twelve?

362
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:52,450
You know she wouldn't like
having her face touched like that.

363
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,530
Are you fine leaving it like this?

364
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,210
I want to make up with her.

365
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:03,130
Stark, unlike me, you're a good boy at heart.

366
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,830
Just be honest and say you're sorry.

367
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:09,840
If you want to make up with her,
you gotta tell her that.

368
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:13,240
Frieren won't mediate your fights, you know?

369
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,110
Yeah, I know. I'll apologize to her.

370
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,440
Stark feels bad about it.

371
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,920
He's just being childish,
he didn't mean you any harm.

372
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,870
I know.

373
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,530
I was being unreasonable.

374
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,200
I want to apologize.

375
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,790
I'm the one who started this in the first place,

376
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:40,350
and I'm not bothered by being touched.

377
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:46,140
It's just that he was holding my shoulder so strongly.

378
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:51,390
It scared me a little.

379
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,430
Do you hate Stark?

380
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,550
Why would you ask such a thing?

381
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,520
Does it look like I do?

382
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,690
Then go tell him that it
was scary and make up with him.

383
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,360
Be more gentle.

384
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,880
I'm sorry.

385
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,740
Get together already!

386
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:23,790
I don't really get it, but I can see
you're really trying your best.

387
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,680
Thanks, you've been a great help.

388
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:33,670
Frieren, you're about the only
person who praises me like a kid.

389
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,510
You are a kid, aren't you?

390
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,410
Well, it doesn't feel bad.

391
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:45,520
Say, I've been wondering.

392
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,570
What makes you look after me so much?

393
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:52,830
Even back when you invited me on this journey...

394
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,170
I guess it was self-loathing after all.

395
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,840
The way you were avoiding going on your adventure

396
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,710
reminded me of myself before
I left to defeat the demon king.

397
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,020
It made me really mad.

398
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:10,550
That doesn't really constitute a reason, though.

399
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:15,940
I think that's why I wanted
to give you the opportunity to leave.

400
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,870
What do you mean?

401
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:23,590
I mean, that's what Himmel the Hero would've done.

402
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,070
Take my hand, Frieren.

403
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,070
I'm your chance to embark on a journey.

404
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,210
Himmel and the others gave
me the courage to set out,

405
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:44,230
and taught me the joy of being with friends.

406
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,590
What do you think, Sein?

407
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,220
It's been fun, hasn't it?

408
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,000
Yeah.

409
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,710
It's been really fun.

410
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:11,610
I'll become an unforgettable champion,
just like Himmel the Hero.

411
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:15,990
I'm talking about the present, Sein.

412
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:21,490
And I believed what she said.

413
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:26,480
Gorilla talked about you a lot.

414
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,840
He talked about how you two would
leave your mark on history as champions.

415
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,090
I'm going to go after Gorilla.

416
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,960
I'm done regretting my choices.

417
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,150
I understand.

418
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,960
Take care.

419
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,460
See you again.

420
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,040
See you.

421
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,220
We split up pretty unceremoniously, huh?

422
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,200
Well, Sein is an adult, unlike you two.

423
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,410
I'm sure he'll be fine.

424
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,990
It sure is quiet being by myself.

425
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:03,010
29 years after the death

426
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:03,010
of Himmel the Hero

427
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:03,010
Northern Lands,

428
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:03,010
The Offens

429
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,030
Huh?

430
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,530
That's unusual, they're still asleep.

431
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,330
We've been walking all day recently,

432
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,010
so they must be pretty tired.

433
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,950
I guess that's alright.

434
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,780
Hey, breakfast's ready. It's time to wake up.

435
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,100
Fern?

436
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,400
Hey, Frieren, wake up.

437
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,780
Just another half a day.

438
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,240
Isn't that too much sleep?

439
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,990
More importantly, it looks like Fern is sick.

440
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:11,750
Hey.

441
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,010
Stop it.

442
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,700
Yeah, she has a fever.

443
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,720
She'll need to keep warm and rest more.

444
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,730
Hmm.

445
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,450
That's strange.

446
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,920
I brought some water.

447
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:41,530
There it is.

448
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,470
What's that?

449
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:47,640
A notebook about medicinal herbs that Sein left us.

450
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,720
Oh, that was nice of him.

451
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,210
If I can figure out the illness
with magic, we'll know which herbs to use.

452
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:58,500
Isn't identifying illnesses the goddess's magic?

453
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,170
Don't you need the holy scriptures to use that?

454
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,220
I do own a copy of the holy scriptures.

455
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:05,910
Huh?

456
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,560
It's being used as a trivet!

457
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:20,610
Even if I don't have any talent as a priest,
I can at least identify basic illnesses.

458
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,980
Not complicated ones, though.

459
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,740
Is she going to be okay?

460
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,760
Yeah, it's just a cold.

461
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:32,740
What herbs can we find in this region...?

462
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,980
That reminds me,

463
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:40,380
I think I once gathered herbs
with Himmel and the others near here.

464
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:44,410
For now, let's find a place to get away from the cold.

465
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,280
You're right.

466
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,650
Oh dear.

467
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,660
You're a real lifesaver.

468
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:12,540
I didn't expect anyone to be
living this deep in the mountains.

469
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,530
There was a village here last time I came by.

470
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:18,580
It's been decades since this was a village.

471
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:24,000
It was a storied place that
even the hero once passed through.

472
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,050
Well, take your time and rest up.

473
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,540
Thanks.

474
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,010
By the way, there was an icicle cherry tree nearby, right?

475
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:35,650
Yes, north of here.

476
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,890
The path there is somewhat tangled, though.

477
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,650
That's fine.

478
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,290
I've been there before.

479
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,840
Alright, I'm going to go back to work.

480
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,530
Wait for a bit, Fern.

481
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,670
We'll go grab ingredients for your medicine.

482
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,530
You've been holding her hand since we got here.

483
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,170
I mean, she looks quite uncomfortable.

484
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:05,310
Holding her hand will put her more at ease.

485
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:07,930
She's been like this since she was a kid.

486
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,930
What's wrong?

487
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,680
Lady Frieren, that's embarrassing.

488
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,690
Why?

489
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:24,060
Don't treat me like a kid.

490
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:31,200
I see, okay.

491
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,200
I guess she'll be a full-grown
adult in another two years.

492
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,350
She was only this tall not too long ago.

493
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,170
I was taller than her for
most of our time together, too.

494
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,960
She grew up in a flash.

495
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,440
You see, in my mind, Fern is still a child.

496
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,570
That'll probably never change.

497
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,470
Frieren.

498
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,230
We should hurry and get
the ingredients for the medicine.

499
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,510
Yeah.

500
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,080
We're almost at the icicle cherry tree.

501
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:40,040
So that icicle cherry tree is our last ingredient?

502
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,860
Well, we'll be using
the mushrooms that grow at its roots.

503
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,180
It's pretty, isn't it?

504
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,580
I wish Fern was here to see it, too.

505
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,490
It might be my favorite winter blossom.

506
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:09,540
The petals are poisonous, so be careful.

507
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:14,770
Say, why were you holding Fern's hand?

508
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,600
You don't treat her much like a kid normally.

509
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,540
I don't think I was treating her like a kid.

510
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,600
I was just holding her hand
to try and comfort her.

511
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:31,230
It's the only way I know to soften her pain.

512
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:36,740
I wonder what I should've done.

513
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,390
I think you just gotta do what you feel like doing.

514
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,750
That's what Master did.

515
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:50,790
I think we all need some emotional support.

516
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,630
Everyone appreciates getting support like that.

517
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,390
What do you think you're doing?

518
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,780
You were groaning in your sleep.

519
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,020
It's easy to feel lonely when you have a cold, after all.

520
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:14,650
My mother, who died when I was young,
used to hold my hand like this.

521
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,430
It makes you feel strangely at ease.

522
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,660
That was when you were a child, though, wasn't it?

523
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:24,130
Children aren't the only ones
who need emotional support.

524
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,120
It doesn't feel bad, right?

525
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,150
I guess not.

526
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,300
I suppose it is nice.

527
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,470
I'm handsome when I'm caring, too, aren't I?

528
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,900
Shut up.

529
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,510
We finished the medicine.

530
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,930
Fern was probably embarrassed because I was there.

531
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,160
You don't want others to see
you getting pampered, you know?

532
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,250
Thanks, Stark.

533
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:04,160
I'll try doing what I want.

534
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:10,090
In return, I'll hold your hand if you catch a cold, too.

535
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,880
No thanks, that's embarrassing.

536
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,880
Alright, let's grab these mushrooms.

537
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,260
There we go.

538
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,260
They're bigger than I expected. Scary!

539
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:25,760
Now we add the other ingredients,

540
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,020
and mix everything very well.

541
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,520
You look like a witch. Incredibly scary!

542
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:36,020
Open up, Fern.

543
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,120
You're good at this. Thanks for the help.

544
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,500
Am I?

545
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:55,500
It's okay, you'll get better soon.

546
00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:00,140
Lady Frieren, I'm not a child anymore...

547
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:01,880
I know.

548
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,110
I'm well aware.

549
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:17,770
Do take care of yourself!

550
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,420
Thank you for everything!

551
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,780
Feeling better now, huh?

552
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:30,420
It's thanks to you, Lady Frieren, and Sir Sein's notes.

553
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:35,380
The woman here took good care of me, as well.

554
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,300
Alright.

555
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:44,050
Then we're off to Äußerst, the city of magic.

556
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,170
And

557
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,170
I'm

558
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,170

559
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,170
right

560
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,240
I'll

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,240

right

564
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,050
Yeah,

565
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,050
I

566
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,050
