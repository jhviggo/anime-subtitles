563
00:01:55,010 --> 00:02:00,020
of Himmel the Hero

Northern Lands,

Alt Forest

566
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,020
When I was a kid,

567
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,810
I had a friend who I joined on many little adventures.

568
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,530
He was a reckless muscle-head, like a gorilla.

569
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,710
That said, he was a kind and caring gorilla.

570
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,040
I'd almost forgotten about those dreams

571
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:26,040
when he invited me to join him as an adventurer.

572
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:32,350
How different might my life be
if only I'd taken his hand?

573
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,100
That was a whole ten years ago.

574
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,930
I regret it to this day.

575
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,060
Why are you telling me this?

576
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,230
The harvest festival in my village is coming up.

577
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:53,180
My brother asked me to pick some herbs.

578
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,370
While doing that...

579
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,560
I got stuck in quicksand.

580
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,800
This is the end for me.

581
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:10,210
How different might my fate be
if only you would take my hand?

582
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,880
Wait a moment, I'm thinking about it.

583
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,930
What is there to think about at this point?

584
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,180
Your hand is dirty.

585
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,890
I'm pretty sure this isn't the time
to be worrying about that.

586
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,640
Besides, young lady.

587
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,770
Adults are always dirty, you know?

588
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,810
This might be a record for physical dirtiness.

589
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,590
Give me a bit more time.

590
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,490
I'm trying to remember the spell
to get a person out of quicksand.

591
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,620
Please, hurry up.

592
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,500
Uh.

593
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,750
Lady Frieren.

594
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,060
Did you find the herbs?

595
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,070
Ah, I remember now.

596
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,220
I'll be going this way.

597
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,400
I apologize for Lady Frieren's behavior.

598
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,280
It's fine, she did save me.

599
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,280
No, I'll give her a proper talking to.

600
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,400
Not my problem.

601
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,580
More importantly, you're sure
you don't want to swing by the village?

602
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:21,160
We're busy preparing for
the harvest festival, but I owe you one.

603
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,830
We want to reach a larger town today to restock.

604
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:30,320
Alright then, be careful.

605
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,250
There are a lot of venomous animals around here.

606
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,350
Yeah.

607
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,510
Got it.

608
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,770
I got bitten.

609
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,740
Huh? You got bitten?

610
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,540
Come on, we were warned about this...

611
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,920
Let's stop the bleeding for now.

612
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,030
Huh?

613
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,330
I suddenly got a nosebleed.

614
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,800
Poison identification is a priest's spell,
so I'm not that good at it.

615
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,580
I don't recognize this reaction,

616
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,790
so the antidotes we have probably won't cut it.

617
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,680
We should have you looked at in a church.

618
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,740
How long can you use flight magic, Fern?

619
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,990
It takes a lot of mana,
so no more than thirty minutes.

620
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,140
We won't get to town in thirty minutes.

621
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,290
Let's head back to that village.

622
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,480
I'll carry Stark.

623
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,980
You're overreacting.

624
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,290
I'm fine.

625
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,610
Master also said that getting
over poison is a matter of will.

626
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,490
That reminds me,

627
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,110
even after getting hit by a poison arrow
strong enough to knock out a dragon,

628
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,420
Eisen was perfectly fine.

629
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,370
It really freaked Heiter out.

630
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,420
See?

631
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:54,520
No, that just goes to show how abnormal he was.

632
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:01,130
Besides, Sir Heiter told me that poison is
the cause of twenty percent of adventurer deaths.

633
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,630
Let's hurry.

634
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,140
I'm telling you, I'm fine.

635
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,270
It's too late.

636
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,360
In a few hours, your brain will start to melt,

637
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,570
run out of your nose,

638
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,490
and you will die.

639
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,350
That's terrifying!

640
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,620
Is there nothing to be done about it, Father?

641
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,520
Normally, it can only be treated if caught early,

642
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,830
but my little brother might be able to do something.

643
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:38,000
Hey, you got a moment?

644
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,780
Isn't the new washtub a little small?

645
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,990
We're practicing austerity.

646
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,040
Isn't this going too far?

647
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,260
No one else goes to palm-sized extremes like this.

648
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,750
More importantly, Sein, tend to these people.

649
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,520
Oh, these are the guys I was telling you about.

650
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,120
The ones that saved me.

651
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:04,220
What, did you get bitten by a snake or something?

652
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,030
I even told you to be careful.

653
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,540
And now we're even.

654
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,670
I'm gonna go help at the square.

655
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,670
Alright.

656
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,290
My nosebleed stopped.

657
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,550
I don't detect poison anymore.

658
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,720
Father, that guy...

659
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,970
What do you think of my little brother?

660
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,550
That necklace with the holy crest.

661
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,900
The holy city gives them to the most
outstanding priests in the land.

662
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:52,990
He instantly cured a poison
an expert judged to be incurable.

663
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,410
He was born to be a priest.

664
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,990
As I thought, Lady Frieren, you can tell.

665
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,180
You know me?

666
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,200
I've heard of you from Sir Heiter.

667
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:13,110
I received this holy crest from Sir Heiter
when he came here for an inspection.

668
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,180
That said, I'm but a countryside priest.

669
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,440
This is just about the only thing I can be proud of.

670
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:25,930
But Sein's talent is far beyond mine.

671
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:30,510
Our parents passed when we were young.

672
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:35,700
I raised my much-younger brother by myself.

673
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:41,300
He frequently talked about wanting
to become an adventurer as a child.

674
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:49,840
He'd say that he didn't want to be a priest of a mundane village,
merely repeating the same routine every day.

675
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,850
He'd say that, his eyes filled with hopes and dreams.

676
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:59,200
But now he's just like me when I was young.

677
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,400
It must be quite the boring life for him.

678
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,670
Please, won't you take him out of the village?

679
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,700
I'm sure he's been waiting for
someone to give him that push.

680
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,330
I'm all for it, Frieren.

681
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,170
What's there to think about?

682
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:29,030
I don't wanna come close to having
my brain run out of my nose again.

683
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:33,620
It would be reassuring to have
a priest with us from here on out.

684
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,720
What problem do you have with him, Lady Frieren?

685
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,850
Self-loathing... I guess?

686
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,270
What is she on about?

687
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,680
Anyway, I'm gonna try and recruit him myself.

688
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,030
Where?

689
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:57,240
Sir Sein apparently frequents the bar downstairs.

690
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,870
Huh?

691
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,500
Drinking.

692
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,880
Smoking.

693
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,000
Gambling.

694
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,970
A little extreme for a priest, no?

695
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,880
We're getting to know each other better.

696
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,600
You wanna play, kid?

697
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,080
My name is Stark. We're looking for a priest.

698
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,850
Do you wanna join our party?

699
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,710
You've gotta be joking, I'm a priest of this village.

700
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,280
I can't go...

701
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,780
Well, I guess it could be fun.

702
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,400
Join us, Stark.

703
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,900
If you win against me, I'll join your party.

704
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,990
For real?

705
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,910
Yeah, for real.

706
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,200
Spare me!

707
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,910
Lady Frieren. I just heard
Sir Stark scream from downstairs.

708
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,190
He's stark naked!

709
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,620
This is horrible. Who would do such a thing?

710
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,820
No hard feelings.

711
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:17,000
Adults always play dirty, you know?

712
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,020
He's naked, too!

713
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,330
The mayor took it all.

714
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,930
He's demonically strong.

715
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:24,660
Sein.

716
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,610
I heard you were looking for a priest.

717
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:28,920
You'll have to find someone else.

718
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,800
You want to be an adventurer, don't you?

719
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:36,590
I'm telling you, that was a long time ago. It's too late.

720
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,580
I should have chased after him much earlier.

721
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,180
All that's left here is a
down-and-out grown man in underwear.

722
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,720
Frieren. Come defeat the demon king with us.

723
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,190
It's too late.

724
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:58,350
I haven't fought a demon in over five hundred years.

725
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,610
I've forgotten how to fight.

726
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,700
I put off the decision for too long.

727
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,710
I must've been too scared to fight the demon king.

728
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,210
Too many years have passed.

729
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,470
So what, Frieren?

730
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,570
I'm talking about the present.

731
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,300
Find someone else.

732
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,310
You don't understand.

733
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:38,220
I see. That tells me all I need to know.

734
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,810
I hate you, after all.

735
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,010
That so? Then—

736
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:47,890
So I've decided I will have you join our party.

737
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,000
Huh? Why?

738
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,110
You're making so little sense, I'm scared.

739
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,010
Thanks. It's warm.

740
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:05,360
I'm truly sorry for all the trouble.
Thank you very much.

741
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,890
How much did it cost to get them back?

742
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,900
He said to take it easy
with the harvest festival coming up,

743
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,620
and just gave them back.

744
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,200
We're lucky they're nice people.

745
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,560
They weren't sure what to do with the axe.

746
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,910
Sad.

747
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,080
Sir Stark, wear your coat.

748
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,830
Why are you holding it like some dirty rag?

749
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,330
Here are your belongings, Sir Sein.

750
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:38,380
Just what did I do to her?

751
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:43,250
She's angry you stripped Stark.

752
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,060
I told you, it wasn't me, it was the mayor.

753
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,020
People who gamble are the worst.

754
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm sorry.

755
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,190
Especially Sein, since he's a priest.

756
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:57,400
But priests who drink are okay?

757
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,040
Don't you know, Lady Frieren?

758
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,210
Liquor is the best medicine.

759
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:06,660
Damn it, Heiter. What did you teach her?

760
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,930
Well, putting aside whether he joins our party,

761
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,860
I think Sein should become an adventurer.

762
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,670
You're suddenly a lot more into this.

763
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:21,350
I thought it would be nice
to give someone a push for once.

764
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,430
Like Himmel the Hero once did.

765
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:35,110
It seems those adventurers decided
to stay in the village for a while.

766
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,570
They come to recruit me almost every day.

767
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:51,670
I've tried to make them give up, but it was no use.

768
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:59,840
They invite me on their adventure,
their eyes full of hopes and dreams... just like him.

769
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,970
I'm just gonna do a quick loop
around the Northern Lands.

770
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:07,470
I'll be back by the harvest festival in three years.

771
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,220
If you're not prepared now, you can come then.

772
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,620
Let's go on the next adventure together.

773
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:21,230
Every time they invite me, I wonder why.

774
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:25,950
They shine too brightly for these tired eyes.

775
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:30,490
What Sein likes?

776
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,820
Yeah, we're having trouble.

777
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,580
We thought it might help.

778
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:39,000
I suppose drinking, smoking, gambling...

779
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,980
Those we already know.

780
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,970
Is he really a priest?

781
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:46,900
Sir Heiter was an upright priest, after all.

782
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,510
What is an upright priest?

783
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:55,020
Other than that... he likes older women.

784
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,290
What an absolute failure of a priest.

785
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,660
Older women, huh?

786
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:03,140
Not much we can do with that information...

787
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,500
Huh? What?

788
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,160
Oh, I see.

789
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,490
Hey, isn't this new sickle a little too small?

790
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,260
Trimming the yard is gonna...

791
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,990
Oh, it's you guys again.

792
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,580
You got a moment, Sein?

793
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,930
You're still here?

794
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,020
Now, now.

795
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,710
Don't make me repeat myself.

796
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,380
Find someone else.

797
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:35,040
Sein, you wanna go on a journey with a milf?

798
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,060
Idiot.

799
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:42,050
That's the whole reason I was aiming
to become an adventurer as a kid.

800
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,320
Wow, how sinful.

801
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:48,070
So, where is she? Where is this milf?

802
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,110
Right here, Sein.

803
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:55,800
I'm an elf! A woman far older than you!

804
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:00,860
Oh yeah, my brother did say something like that.

805
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:09,070
That... That's not a milf.

806
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,720
He looks incredibly pained.

807
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,500
No way around it.

808
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:16,490
I wanted to avoid having to do this.

809
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,710
The time to use my master's
seduction technique has come.

810
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,070
What was that?

811
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,370
It's called blowing a kiss.

812
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,730
Maybe you're a bit too young to get it, kiddo.

813
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,330
Someone please come pick up your child.

814
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,170
It's too lewd.

815
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,900
What's wrong with you two?

816
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:50,590
That's strange. When I tried it on Himmel,
it was powerful enough to make him faint.

817
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,270
Himmel!

818
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,100
It seems we've found his weakness.

819
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:58,730
How weird.

820
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,180
I get it.

821
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,490
I would have been in danger had I been hit directly.

822
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,960
He may be rotten, but he's still clergy.

823
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,290
A powerful foe.

824
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,360
Enough!

825
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,490
I have no intention of becoming an adventurer.

826
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,370
Don't you want to chase after your best friend?

827
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,620
Brother, you understand, right?

828
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,080
Sein.

829
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,880
He said he'd be back in three years.

830
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,590
It's been ten years since then.

831
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,720
He's obviously long gone.

832
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,100
You're giving up without even trying to find him?

833
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,280
It's only been ten years.

834
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:45,280
You'll regret it later on if you don't try now.

835
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:49,250
You'll realize it was never too late to try.

836
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,990
It's too...

837
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:55,240
You're thinking it's already too late, aren't you?

838
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:00,490
I'm talking about the present, Sein.

839
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:11,510
I can't. For the same reason
I didn't go with him ten years ago.

840
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,390
I could never just up and leave my brother here.

841
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,510
What are you talking about, Sein?

842
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:26,020
I happened to overhear you
when Sir Heiter came for the inspection.

843
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:33,450
With your talents, I'm sure you would
do well as a priest in the holy city.

844
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,400
Me? In the holy city?

845
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,320
Yes. I'm sure of it.

846
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,660
Sir Heiter, what would happen
to my brother in that case?

847
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,020
He would come with you, of course.

848
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,920
Is that so?

849
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,150
Sir Heiter, I really do appreciate your offer.

850
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:57,250
But I'm satisfied with my life in this village.

851
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,430
My little brother lost his parents at a young age.

852
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,180
And I'm his older brother.

853
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:07,940
I cannot take his home from him as well.

854
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,440
I see.

855
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,770
I understand your feelings on the matter.

856
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,650
Well, that was quite the waste of time.

857
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,830
But, since I'm already here,

858
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:27,820
I suppose I'll tell your little brother
some tales of my adventures.

859
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:32,460
My brother stayed in this village for my sake.

860
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,860
Sein, is that what you were thinking?

861
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:43,350
We're not the same!

862
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:47,600
I have not regretted that decision even once.

863
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,630
Yet look at you.

864
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:53,090
How long do you intend to regret your choices?

865
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,620
Enough.

866
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,000
I apologized to my brother.

867
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,780
Okay.

868
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:19,880
I don't want you to get
the wrong idea. He's very kind.

869
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,750
He's never hit me before.

870
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:26,550
Yet look what I made him do.

871
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,700
I've never seen him like that.

872
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:38,460
Frieren, I've decided to become an adventurer.

873
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,640
I'm going to chase after him.

874
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,070
It's only been ten years, after all.

875
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:45,800
I see.

876
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:55,290
The goal of my journey is to find him.

877
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm going to find that guy

878
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,910
and fulfill that stupid dream I had as a kid.

879
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,030
So I'll join for now. I'll go with you part of the way.

880
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,280
I got one!

881
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,390
We did it!

882
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,470
Goodbye!

883
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,370
Come back safely!

884
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,400
Goodbye!

885
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,670
Come back safely!

886
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,400
Come back safely!

887
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,910
By the way, what's the goal of your journey?

888
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,600
Heaven.

889
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,910
Is that a place to aim for?

890
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,660
Everyone goes there when they die.

891
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,540
You too, Sir Sein?

892
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:42,240
Isn't she a little too hard on me?

893
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,050
Welcome to the club.

894
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,440
