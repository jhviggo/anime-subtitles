Central Lands,

560
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:35,990
The Trading City of Warm

561
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,010
Alright, let's split up and get supplies.

562
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,780
You say split up, but I'm picking up
most of the essentials, aren't I?

563
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,890
Food, water, daily necessities...

564
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,270
What are you buying?

565
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,020
Herbs and stuff.

566
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,530
She makes that face
when she's hiding something.

567
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,960
I've known Lady Frieren for a long time.

568
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,030
It's never a good sign.

569
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,290
She always ends up buying unnecessary stuff.

570
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,380
I couldn't resist.

571
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,040
What would you even use that for?

572
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,970
This potion dissolves clothes.

573
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,300
Go return it.

574
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,670
I got you a book on magic history.
Studying is important, too.

575
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,810
I guess that one wasn't unnecessary.

576
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,680
See you at the inn.

577
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,200
It's not like we can afford to waste our funds, either.

578
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,450
I need to keep an eye on her.

579
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,460
An accessory shop?

580
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,610
You went to bed without
drying your hair again, didn't you? Gosh.

581
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,640
I didn't realize she had any interest in fashion.

582
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,730
She's really thinking about it.

583
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,950
Huh? What's with that expression?

584
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:34,990
I've never seen her so conflicted.

585
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,880
That sure took her a lot of time.

586
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,490
I suppose there's no harm
in getting some accessories.

587
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,730
Better than some weird bones or potions.

588
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,530
I guess I should get back to shopping.

589
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,030
Is there a good sweets place around here?

590
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,160
Now that's just not fair!

591
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,810
For that, you should ask
the people down there at the bar.

592
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,830
Thanks.

593
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,420
I haven't had anything sweet in months!

594
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,770
This place, huh?

595
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,470
Is there a good sweets place around here?

596
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:01,280
No, this clearly isn't the place to ask about sweets.

597
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,580
A good sweets place? You kidding me?

598
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,040
Gulp.

599
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:13,710
There are loads of good sweets to be had in this city.

600
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,670
We can tell you about all the good shops.

601
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,550
It is the place to ask.

602
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,730
You're well-informed for a ruffian.

603
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:27,680
Sweets are what gives us adventurers energy.

604
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:34,810
There's nothing like treating yourself
to some sweets after a job.

605
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,000
They're adventurers.

606
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,760
They look like worse news than just some ruffians.

607
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,270
Way too scary.

608
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,140
See ya.

609
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,590
Is she going to the sweets shop?

610
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,600
Oh? This is towards the inn.

611
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,110
Is she heading back?

612
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,130
I haven't done any of my shopping yet.

613
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,970
You're late.

614
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,160
I'm sorry.

615
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,220
Well, it's fine. Put those over there.

616
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,610
Why don't we get something sweet for a change?

617
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,060
What a nice view.

618
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,630
No wonder it was highly recommended.

619
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,380
Lady Frieren. I'm sorry for doubting you.

620
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,880
What's this about?

621
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,640
Nothing.

622
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,220
You can order whatever you want.

623
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,180
Do we have enough money for this?

624
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,440
It's fine; I have a secret stash.

625
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,420
I had no idea she had such a thing.

626
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,210
What are you going to get?

627
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,280
Let's see. Today, I'm in the mood for...

628
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,160
Merkur pudding, right?

629
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,920
I bet you're in the mood for Merkur pudding, right?

630
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,670
How'd you know?

631
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,430
How many years do you think
we've been traveling together?

632
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,860
I just know.

633
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,060
I don't know anything about you guys.

634
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,440
I guess we'll have to try and get you to know us.

635
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,800
Ruf omelettes are my favorite, by the way.

636
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,820
Grapes for me. The sourer the better.

637
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,850
For me, it's—

638
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:44,780
Booze, right?

639
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,660
That much I know, you sorry excuse for a priest.

640
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,860
You weren't being flattered.

641
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:54,540
It's not a good sign that the only thing
she remembers is the priest's drinking habit.

642
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,420
Sorry, Fern.

643
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,670
Why are you apologizing?

644
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,960
I don't really know anything about you,

645
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,380
so I wasn't sure what you would like.

646
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,950
It is my birthday today, isn't it?

647
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,090
What a beautiful hair clip.

648
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,450
Thank you very much.

649
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,620
I really appreciate it.

650
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,500
Really?

651
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,630
Lady Frieren, since you can be
hopelessly dense, let me make this clear.

652
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:48,880
I'm incredibly happy that
you tried to understand me better.

653
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,390
I didn't do anything special, though?

654
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,730
You really don't understand
people's feelings, do you?

655
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,460
Let's get going.

656
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,160
Yes.

657
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:31,880
So, Lady Frieren, does this journey have a purpose?

658
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,180
Not particularly.
It's just for my hobby of collecting magic.

659
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,520
But whenever we can,

660
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,180
I do want to follow the trail of
my journey with Himmel and the others.

661
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,070
Before the trail fades.

662
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:52,420
That matters a lot to you, doesn't it?

663
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,080
I don't know. That's what I'm trying to figure out.

664
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:06,590
So, you've finally grown taller than me, haven't you?

665
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:09,960
I'm already sixteen, after all. I'm a big girl now.

666
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,970
A big girl.

667
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:16,480
Our diets are mostly the same, so it can't be that...

668
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,420
How strange.

669
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,980
Episode 3: The Magic That Kills People

670
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:29,980
27 years after the death

671
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:29,980
of Himmel the Hero

672
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:29,980
Central Lands,

673
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:29,980
Größe Forest

674
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,720
You've gotten the hang of defensive magic.

675
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,640
Time to cover some practical applications.

676
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,800
I aimed for a gap in your defense.

677
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,030
In a real battle, you'd be dead.

678
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,720
Well then.

679
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,410
How are you going to handle this?

680
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,660
Like this.

681
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,790
I see.

682
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,410
Can you sustain that?

683
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,320
That's it for today.

684
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,040
Defensive magic is very powerful,

685
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,190
but it consumes a lot of mana.

686
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:53,550
If you try to maintain it over a larger area,
your mana won't last even a minute.

687
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,470
So the best option is to produce
fragments at the moment of impact.

688
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,520
Pretty much.

689
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,690
We've been doing nothing
but defensive magic recently.

690
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,330
That's because it directly influences
your chance of survival.

691
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:24,520
That makes sense.

692
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,440
Any one type of defensive magic
can block almost all offensive magic, after all.

693
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,150
It's strange how strong it is.

694
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:35,280
Fern, you haven't read that book
on magic history, have you?

695
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:39,500
Magic isn't just about hands-on experience.

696
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,940
Maybe I should read it to you at bedtime.

697
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,040
I'll read it myself.

698
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,250
I'm not a kid anymore.

699
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,100
So, this is our destination?

700
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,050
Collecting some weird magic again?

701
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,060
No, not this time.

702
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,320
I guess it'll depend on the weather.

703
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,060
Yeah.

704
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,400
Can I ask you something?

705
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,010
It's an elf.

706
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,070
She has white hair.

707
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:20,320
Would you happen to be Lady Frieren?

708
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,730
How'd you know?

709
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,910
You want to know where Qual is sealed, right?

710
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,790
I'll show you the way.

711
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,130
Qual?

712
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,880
Qual, the Sage of Decay.

713
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:43,890
A demon who perpetrated many
horrific atrocities in this land eighty years ago.

714
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:48,850
Himmel the Hero and his party sealed him.

715
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:54,760
That seal won't last much longer,
so I came to defeat him.

716
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,270
How did you know, though?

717
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,530
I didn't tell anyone about it.

718
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:06,780
Until about 30 years ago,
Sir Himmel came here almost every year.

719
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:11,200
He was apparently checking on the state of the seal.

720
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,040
Mr. Nice Guy, as always.

721
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,920
He also talked about you, Lady Frieren.

722
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,670
About how heartless you were to never visit.

723
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,950
That's pretty cold, isn't it?

724
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,620
It really is.

725
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,930
Well, sorry.

726
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:30,680
But she's not so heartless
that she would abandon this village.

727
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,190
She'll come when the seal is beginning to weaken.

728
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:38,440
That's what he said back then.

729
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,140
I see.

730
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,450
This is it?

731
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,780
It's definitely losing its strength.

732
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:10,680
Let's release the seal and finish off Qual tomorrow.

733
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,210
You're the one who sealed Qual, right?

734
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,860
Was there some reason you sealed him?

735
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,820
Qual was simply that strong.

736
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,520
We couldn't win.

737
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,580
Qual was one of the best mages
in the demon king's army.

738
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:45,720
Solltrag. The unprecedented
piercing magic he developed.

739
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:52,010
It pierces not only humanity's
defensive magic, but also magic-resistant armor,

740
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,980
and directly destroys the body.

741
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,820
It is said that forty percent
of this region's adventurers

742
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:04,230
and seventy percent of its mages
were killed by Solltrag.

743
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,870
Isn't that too strong?

744
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:14,500
Yes, that's exactly it. It was too strong.

745
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,750
That's why its strength came back to bite it.

746
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,190
What do you mean?

747
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,260
You really haven't read any magic history, have you?

748
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,320
How about I actually read it to you?

749
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,780
I'll read it myself right now.

750
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,030
No, that's okay.

751
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,520
It's more important that you get a good night's sleep.

752
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,050
You'll see tomorrow, anyway.

753
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,660
I'm releasing the seal.

754
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,410
Don't let your guard down.

755
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:23,770
It's been a while, Frieren.

756
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,090
How long, exactly?

757
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:28,330
Eighty years.

758
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,160
A mere eighty years?

759
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,990
Not long to you or I.

760
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,680
What of His Majesty the Demon King?

761
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,660
We killed him.

762
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,250
I see.

763
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:46,250
Well then, I suppose it's time for some revenge.

764
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,760
Fern, defensive magic in front of us.

765
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,470
Solltrag!

766
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,770
Oh? I'm surprised.

767
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,770
To think you could block Solltrag.

768
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:11,150
A mighty advanced defense structure.

769
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:16,000
Lady Frieren, what's going on?

770
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,660
That was standard offensive magic.

771
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,140
That was Solltrag.

772
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,040
The magic he developed, the so-called

773
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,780
"Magic that Kills People."

774
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:35,860
Qual. Your magic was simply too powerful.

775
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:45,260
Since your sealing, mages from across
the continent have researched and analyzed Solltrag.

776
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:51,720
In just a few years, Solltrag was incorporated
into humanity's theory of magic.

777
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:58,280
Powerful defensive magic
using novel structures was developed.

778
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:03,000
The magic-resistance properties of armor improved.

779
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,400
Solltrag has ceased to be "Magic that Kills People."

780
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:11,050
Now it's just standard offensive magic.

781
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,430
I'm told eighty years is quite a long time to humans.

782
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,920
Qual, if you don't resist, I'll kill you painlessly.

783
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,310
I see.

784
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,190
I understand.

785
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:35,020
It harmonizes with
the offensive magic, and disperses it.

786
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,570
Quite the complicated structure.

787
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,450
It must be quite the strain on your mana.

788
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:45,080
He's noticed the weak point of defensive magic.

789
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,920
Fern, you can handle it, right?

790
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,800
Yes. You already showed me this, after all.

791
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,090
Then handle defense for me, as well.

792
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:24,620
Oh? So you can fly? Interesting!

793
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,540
Solltrag.

794
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:43,630
Frieren. My magic...

795
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,420
Now we can continue living in peace.

796
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,450
Hey, that hat...

797
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,220
This?

798
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,980
The sun is very strong in this region,
even at this time of year.

799
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,000
A hat like this is every farmer's friend.

800
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,130
I feel like I've seen this before.

801
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:29,710
Wait... You're the little brat who flipped my skirt.

802
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,270
What do you think you're doing, you little brat?!

803
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,980
I'll kill you. I wanted to see, too!

804
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,580
You'd better not kill him.

805
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,010
I'll show you mine.

806
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,530
Yikes.

807
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,040
So you were still alive.

808
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,790
Thanks to you, it looks like
I'll get to live even longer.

809
00:21:55,650 --> 00:22:00,090
I'm glad I trusted Sir Himmel, and waited.

810
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,470
They were really grateful, weren't they?

811
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,940
Their gratitude wasn't exactly towards me.

812
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:21,040
Himmel is the one the people
of this village believed in.

813
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,350
I don't really get it,

814
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:29,450
but I think Sir Himmel believed in you.

815
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,290
What is it?

816
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,250

I felt sorry for you.

It's more

1257
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,260
