I remember now.

559
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,430
It was Frieren.

560
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:45,970
The mage who greatly contributed
to humanity's study and analysis of Solltrag,

561
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,080
and sent more demons
to their graves than any other.

562
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,270
Frieren the Elegy.

563
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,120
The kind of prodigy I truly despise.

564
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,020
Episode 9: Aura the Guillotine

565
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,260
You'll have to rest for some time.

566
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,240
Sorry for the trouble.

567
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,040
Are you alright?

568
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,170
Thanks to you two.

569
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,710
You have my gratitude.

570
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,810
I'll also forgive the matter with the other mage.

571
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,670
Her judgment was correct.

572
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:49,310
Now Frieren can come back to the city.

573
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,280
Let's have her defeat the demons.

574
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,110
Actually, Lady Frieren didn't kill the guard...

575
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,030
I know. It was a demon.

576
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,760
More importantly, that mage is Frieren?

577
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,540
Yes.

578
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:09,960
That's the name of the
elven mage of the heroes' party.

579
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,670
I've been rather disrespectful.

580
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,800
The Granat family owes
the heroes' party a great deal.

581
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,260
During my grandfather's time,

582
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:25,630
they fought off the demon army attacking our city.

583
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:31,260
We faced Aura the Guillotine
of the Seven Maleficent Sages back then, too.

584
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,200
It's been a while, Aura.

585
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:41,200
Indeed. Around eighty years, Frieren?

586
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,040
You're headed to the city behind me, aren't you?

587
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,720
I would appreciate it if you turned back.

588
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,380
I don't want to.

589
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,130
Why not?

590
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,150
Because I have the overwhelming advantage here.

591
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,030
I see.

592
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,820
You've got even more now.

593
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,930
Demon magic sure is incredible,

594
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,260
puppeteering this many bodies.

595
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,000
Humanity's magic could
never ascend to such heights.

596
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,820
But it's incredibly foul magic.

597
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:41,800
It makes me sick.

598
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,640
How mean.

599
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,270
It took a lot of effort to collect all these, you know?

600
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,980
I recognize some of those suits of armor.

601
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,330
I thought as much, Aura.
I'll need to kill you, right here, right now.

602
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,890
The Scales of Submission.

603
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,580
They're the reason that, in all these years,
we've never been able to defeat Aura.

604
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:22,570
Her magic makes people submit to her,
and lets her control them at will.

605
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:28,270
The Seven Maleficent Sages' magic
is beyond human comprehension.

606
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:33,320
Aura puts her and her opponent's souls on the scales,

607
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,650
and weighs their mana against each other.

608
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:42,810
The one with more mana gets to make
the other submit, reducing them to a puppet.

609
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,000
For all eternity, until their body returns to dust.

610
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,650
It's a risky spell, but with that risk
comes a huge reward.

611
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,170
With Aura's amount of mana,
it's nigh unstoppable.

612
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,920
Is there no way to counter it?

613
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:07,120
Aura's mana reserves may tip the scales,

614
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,970
but the scales are fundamentally fair.

615
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:13,890
If a soul with more mana
than Aura were put on the scales,

616
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,630
she would be defeated.

617
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:24,500
But it is said that in the 500 years that Aura
has reigned as a Maleficent Sage,

618
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,530
that has not happened even a single time.

619
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,040
So there's no way to fight her?

620
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,420
There was.

621
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:43,550
One with a strong will
could resist, if only temporarily.

622
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,560
A true champion, with an iron will.

623
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,680
And even then, only temporarily?

624
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,740
It's a fatal flaw, though.

625
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,070
I imagine that will was quite the nuisance to her.

626
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:01,640
That's why...

627
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:09,700
Aura the Guillotine fixed her puppets
in an awfully rational way.

628
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,700
It's a gruesome story.

629
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,420
What do you think?
My immortal army is strong, is it not?

630
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,310
I'm surprised.

631
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,310
You nullified my magic.

632
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,320
This is a first.

633
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:53,290
Nullification magic this strong
must consume quite a lot of mana.

634
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,330
Why would you do such a roundabout thing?

635
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:02,380
You were blazing them away last time, weren't you?

636
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,720
I got an earful from Himmel afterwards.

637
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,720
Isn't that all the more reason
to not hold back anymore?

638
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,100
Why?

639
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,850
Himmel's gone, isn't he?

640
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,360
Ah, good.

641
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,440
You demons are, without a doubt, monsters.

642
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,290
I can kill you without remorse.

643
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:30,820
Alright.

644
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,210
I think I've mostly recovered.

645
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:38,900
Sir, this place is safe, right?

646
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,560
Yes, this church has its own barrier,

647
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,460
though it isn't as strong as the one protecting the city.

648
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,250
Good, then wait here, Earl Granat.

649
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,720
What are you doing, brat?

650
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,000
Are the demons gonna go home if we wait here?

651
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,480
Sir Stark, are you serious?

652
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,610
We just happened to catch them by surprise earlier.

653
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,780
And even then, we didn't
have a chance to finish them off.

654
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,410
We're the ones who would
have died, had we continued.

655
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,120
Someone's gotta do it.

656
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,590
You're right. Let's give it our best shot.

657
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:32,010
No, you go to the guardhouse.

658
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,450
You need to evacuate the people.

659
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,850
Then, you're going to...?

660
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,350
Yeah.

661
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:41,850
I'm going to

662
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:46,360
beg Frieren to come back with all my might.

663
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,430
What?! What else are we going to do?!

664
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,870
I suppose that is our most realistic option.

665
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,880
He says the guards will listen
to you if you show them this.

666
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,260
Understood.

667
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,230
I'll leave town right away.

668
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,390
What's up?

669
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,340
Your arms look pretty bad.

670
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,820
Will they let you through the gate like that?

671
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,660
I'm sure it'll be fine.

672
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,990
This isn't unusual for a warrior.

673
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,230
Looks fine to me.

674
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:33,610
I have never seen a warrior with
two bloody arms walking through a town.

675
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:37,620
Well, look at yourself first
before talking about other people.

676
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,870
Besides, whose blood is this?

677
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,120
It's not mine, is it?

678
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,170
Whoa, what's wrong?

679
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,510
Sir Stark, this blood has mana—

680
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,350
Fern!

681
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,140
An axe?!

682
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:16,820
I must be dreaming. Is this for real?

683
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:20,330
Those are Master's techniques.

684
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:27,250
Your attempt to move away
caused me to miss your vitals.

685
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,030
I wasn't planning on making you suffer.

686
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,630
Why do you look so surprised?

687
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,140
Is it because I'm still standing here
despite your fatal blow?

688
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,140
Or maybe it's because
you couldn't detect our approach?

689
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:54,570
You're not the only one who can
hide your presence by regulating your mana.

690
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,720
All demons are capable of this.

691
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:05,660
That said, I don't find that act
befitting of a fight between mages.

692
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,360
You sure talk a lot.

693
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,420
Are you not going to finish me off?

694
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,970
Given the opportunity, there are
a couple of things I want to ask you.

695
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,720
Or would you rather die right away?

696
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,720
Go ahead.

697
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,980
Is that brat strong?

698
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,270
He's Eisen the Warrior's best apprentice.

699
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,730
Interesting. An uncanny coincidence.

700
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,990
Pitiful, really.

701
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,240
He'll die a miserable death against Linie.

702
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,990
One more thing.

703
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,270
Where is Frieren?

704
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,000
She fled from this town.

705
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,390
Because you killed the dungeon guard.

706
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,720
Earl Granat also mentioned that.

707
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,260
Apparently, killing a guard is a severe crime.

708
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,270
She would be executed.

709
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,670
Executed?

710
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,640
As if that woman would run because of that.

711
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:13,520
She has a deep hatred of demons.

712
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:19,030
Deep enough to drill magic made specifically
for killing demons into her apprentice.

713
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,660
She would never flee.

714
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,670
What's her aim here?

715
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,580
Is it Lady Aura?

716
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,460
Don't move an inch.

717
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:40,360
You have an idea where Lady Frieren went, don't you?

718
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,970
What a vain struggle.

719
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,470
You lied about missing my vitals, didn't you?

720
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,080
You wanted to get back
at me for that surprise attack.

721
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,520
You're arrogant, conceited,

722
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,110
and you still don't see us,

723
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:01,070
or anyone except Lady Frieren, as a threat.

724
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:05,570
That's why you went out of your way
to give me an opening.

725
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,160
At this range, I can shoot out your heart.

726
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:13,920
Try me.

727
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,840
Your head will roll first.

728
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,940
Lady Frieren, am I useful to you?

729
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,980
Why do you ask that?

730
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:37,940
I can't wield magic as perfectly as you.

731
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,820
I've lived much longer than you, after all.

732
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,890
You'll never catch up to me.

733
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,230
Is that so?

734
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,920
But that only applies to
your techniques and amount of mana.

735
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:57,620
I often leave fighting monsters to you, don't I?

736
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,440
Yes. You foisted it on me this time, as well.

737
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,710
Sorry.

738
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,820
It doesn't take as long if you fight.

739
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,720
You cast magic faster than me.

740
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,720
Girl.

741
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,980
I've devoted most of my life to magic.

742
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,390
So have I.

743
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,460
What's up with her reaction speed?

744
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:42,200
She would have hit my heart
if I hadn't reflexively defended.

745
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,040
You defended your heart.

746
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,220
As I thought, it's your weak point.

747
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,720
This girl.

748
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,290
I see.

749
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:55,480
You do seem to have devoted your life to magic.

750
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,110
Well then, I'll just have to crush you.

751
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,230
Varterie.

752
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,960
Looks like they've started as well.

753
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,240
Unfortunate.

754
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,810
We're already done.

755
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,160
I guess I'll go spectate.

756
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,300
Sir Lügner would get annoyed if I interrupted him.

757
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,510
Oh?

758
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,510
We're not done yet.

759
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,450
You're a tough one.

760
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,260
Maybe we can have a little fun.

761
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:42,770
I far exceed her in mana, control, and technique.

762
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:08,300
There's a vast gulf between us.

763
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:09,930
She's just...

764
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,510
fast.

765
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,150
I'm being pressured by the sheer
number of spells she's casting.

766
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:27,900
Damn you, Frieren. Just what kind of
training did you put this girl through?

767
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:34,620
I'll go on the defensive and wait
for her to run out of mana.

768
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,460
No, this isn't working.

769
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:53,090
She'll break through before then.

770
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,720
If I could just get a small opening...

771
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,470
Linie! What are you doing?

772
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,850
Finish him off already!

773
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,410
Really? He says that now?

774
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,070
This guy won't stop playing defense, though.

775
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,330
What's up with the way you're handling that axe?

776
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:37,640
Those are Master's techniques.

777
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,890
You see, I'm good at sensing mana.

778
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,410
By memorizing people's internal flow of mana,

779
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,770
I can imitate their movements.

780
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,140
Like this!

781
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,720
I was sure of it when I saw
your movements in the mansion.

782
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:23,100
You move the same way as
that unrivaled warrior I once observed.

783
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:29,160
What a coincidence.

784
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,570
Fate is a curious thing.

785
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,320
No way.

786
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:40,080
I'm imitating Eisen the Warrior.

787
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,040
What the hell? That's messed up.

788
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,790
How am I supposed to win against—

789
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,470
He's finally down.

790
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,170
I should hurry.

791
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,560
Sir Lügner's going to be angry with me again.

792
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:12,150
"Down"? Did she beat me?

793
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,680
Get up, Stark.

794
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:22,610
No matter how beat up you are,
I will not let you lie in defeat.

795
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:26,000
You say that...

796
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:30,510
but I'll never win against you anyway.

797
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,950
Of course you won't.

798
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,670
I'm stronger than you.

799
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,760
Then what's the—

800
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,260
But you haven't lost yet.

801
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,800
You got up, after all.

802
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,080
What's that supposed to mean?

803
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:50,770
I'll tell you the secret to
winning against strong opponents.

804
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,250
It's simple.

805
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:57,010
Get up, again and again.
Get up and continue fighting.

806
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:01,910
Warriors win by being the last one standing.

807
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,650
Damn you, Master.

808
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:12,200
Pushing your weird ideas onto me.

809
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,820
Is your brain filled with muscles or something?

810
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,780
You should have just kept lying there.

811
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,430
You've already lost.

812
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,050
I'm still standing.

813
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,580
Besides, I remembered.

814
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,980
Master's attacks were heavier.

815
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:35,820
In the end, yours are just an imitation.

816
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,450
Well then, I'll put an end to you
with these imitations.

817
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,990
Erfasen.

818
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:49,000
Varterie.

819
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:03,090
A wide swing with no defense.

820
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,760
He's gone crazy.

821
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:16,470
I was prepared to die killing you,
but I guess I was scared for nothing.

822
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:19,400
Your attacks aren't all that heavy after all.

823
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,820
Lightning Strike!

824
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,960
Linie!

We heard there was

1269
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,860
a fifth of my mana.

1270
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,230
sure to lose

1271
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,780
a long-lived mage

1272
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,480
in a head-on fight.

1273
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,820

Heiter?

1279
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:27,900
Wipe out the elves.

1280
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,990
You're a far more powerful mage, after all.
