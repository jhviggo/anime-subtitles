Episode 27: Age of Humans

283
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,390
I had a fight with Lady Frieren.

284
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,380
Again?

285
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,020
Isn't this happening a lot lately?

286
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:10,010
The next stage is the last, right?

287
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,970
This doesn't seem like the time...

288
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,160
She was much worse this time.

289
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,410
My staff broke during the fight
in the Ruined King's Tomb,

290
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,660
so I wanted to go with Lady Frieren and get it fixed.

291
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:28,370
She said I would be better off throwing
my old staff away and getting a new one.

292
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:33,200
The one that broke into a thousand pieces, right?
She was saying it was beyond repair.

293
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,470
Even so, I received that staff from Sir Heiter.

294
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,590
It's been with me since I was little.

295
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,020
This is Frieren, after all.
I don't think she meant any harm.

296
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,030
I can't believe she would even suggest that.

297
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,410
Three years until the next first-rank exam, huh?

298
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,290
Three years is a long time, isn't it?

299
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,540
Go on, make fun of me, like always.

300
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,430
Do you want me to?

301
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,300
No.

302
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,430
Then would you like some head pats, Lawine?

303
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:25,140
You wanna fight?

304
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,520
Hurry up.

305
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,780
You're really bummed, huh?

306
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,640
Oh, it's Frieren.

307
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,540
What's in that bag?

308
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:51,920
Hey, how long are you gonna loiter around here?

309
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,500
I've failed the exam.

310
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,920
We're strangers now.

311
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,570
You're obstructing business, get a move on.

312
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:03,020
I'm here as a customer.

313
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,810
Then buy something already.

314
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,540
You can have one.

315
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,820
Don't want it.

316
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,820
You were unlucky this time.

317
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,390
You drew the short end of the stick.

318
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:24,330
It could have happened to any of us.

319
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,320
A loss is a loss.

320
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,580
I wasn't good enough.

321
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,680
But never talk to me about that again.

322
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,090
I may not look it, but I feel awful right now.

323
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,340
But you're still opening your shop, huh?

324
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,300
Denken, you may not know this,

325
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,980
but people need to work to provide
for themselves, no matter how awful they feel.

326
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:53,980
I see.

327
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,990
Well, it's probably for the best
that I'm the one who failed.

328
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,150
The first-rank mage exam is once every three years.

329
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:08,620
Denken, there might not be another three years
for an old geezer like you, after all.

330
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,120
True enough.

331
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,580
Don't just take it like that.

332
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,840
Richter, you really are a cocky whippersnapper.

333
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:28,350
You deride authority and have no qualms
about trampling over the weak for your goals.

334
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,980
One can hardly call that admirable behavior.

335
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:37,230
And yet, I don't dislike you at all.

336
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,610
I'm sure that's because I myself
used to be that kind of cocky whippersnapper.

337
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:49,250
But now I hold the position of Imperial Mage.

338
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,370
What are you trying to say?

339
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,880
Don't be so pessimistic.

340
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,630
You'll be much stronger
in three years than you are now.

341
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,060
Laufen, let's go home.

342
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,240
Sorry, Gramps is pretty awkward.

343
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,770
Just what are you to Denken?

344
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,520
Old geezer.

345
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,780
He didn't even buy anything in the end.

346
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,920
Is it my unlucky day or something?

347
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:43,130
I asked around; is it true you can
fix any staff, no matter how broken it is?

348
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,550
Show me.

349
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,990
What is this pile of scrap?

350
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,890
Are you trying to tell me this is a staff?

351
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,690
Garbage like this is just a nuisance.

352
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,440
It's not garbage.

353
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,840
Probably.

354
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:09,950
I was feeling a bit better, but thanks to you,
I'm back to feeling absolutely awful.

355
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,990
I have the right to deny requests.

356
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,520
Give up on this staff.

357
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,850
I see.

358
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,260
If you can't fix it, that's fine.

359
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,820
Frieren.

360
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,460
You really get under my skin.

361
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,090
When did I say I couldn't fix it?

362
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,480
Think you can finish it today?

363
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,550
I'd like to make it in time for the third-stage exam.

364
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,280
A lot of tall orders...

365
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,630
Frieren.

366
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,510
What?

367
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,060
Sorry for calling it garbage.

368
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,830
It's a good, well-maintained staff.

369
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm sure it's been held quite dearly.

370
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,970
Fern, let's go home.

371
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,890
Lady Frieren just doesn't understand me at all.

372
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,480
I don't really understand you, either.

373
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,980
Stop it! Don't take it out on me!

374
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:28,240
I was trying to say I think
it's important to try understanding.

375
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,980
I think Frieren is doing the best she can.

376
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:42,500
Oh, you're Frieren's...

377
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:44,370
Apprentice?

378
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:47,940
Am I wrong?

379
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,380
No, she is.

380
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:56,390
Well, either way, I had one hell
of a day thanks to your master.

381
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,920
A man just can't catch a break around here, can he?

382
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,280
I would have made more
if you'd just gotten a new one, too.

383
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,240
Take care of it.

384
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,600
My staff.

385
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,610
Frieren isn't very emotional or empathetic.

386
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:42,850
You're sure to have fights and misunderstandings.

387
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,730
But there's a good side to that, too.

388
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:52,740
Frieren will spend all the more time
worrying over what she can do for you.

389
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:57,480
You'll have a hard time
finding a better master than her.

390
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:35,110
Lady Frieren, about yesterday...

391
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,120
What?

392
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,000
No, actually, never mind.

393
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,870
I see.

394
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:51,130
The third-stage exam begins now.

395
00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:00,780
Do you know why
I've come all the way out here, Sense?

396
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,310
Silent, huh?

397
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:08,310
You're always like this
when put in a bad position.

398
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:12,210
Twelve have passed the second-stage exam.

399
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:15,570
That is an abnormal number. It's too many.

400
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:19,700
Exams where everyone
has to cooperate are entirely fine.

401
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,200
Apparently cooperation flies
above the heads of the current first-ranks.

402
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,210
I'm sorry.

403
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:32,210
But there was someone more powerful
than there should've been in that exam.

404
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,590
You mean Lady Frieren.

405
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,370
Thanks to her, many who weren't worthy passed.

406
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:46,850
If the third-stage exam was held
as planned, they would all die.

407
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,340
Sense, that isn't something you wish for, is it?

408
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:57,910
Besides, even I don't desire
for that many lives to be wasted.

409
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,110
Lady Serie.

410
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,700
You don't need to apologize.

411
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,550
It's all Frieren's fault.

412
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:07,290
Extraordinary times
call for extraordinary measures.

413
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:10,250
I will take charge of the third-stage exam.

414
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,750
I'll select them peacefully.

415
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,010
You were the examiner, right, Lernen?

416
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,890
I take it you don't have any objections?

417
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:28,390
This isn't the first time
I've borne your whims, Lady Serie.

418
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:34,150
Besides, I am not capable of testing Lady Frieren.

419
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:39,910
I noticed she was restricting
her mana the moment I saw her.

420
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,660
Her mana is immense.

421
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,760
Enough to rival yours, Lady Serie.

422
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,540
Falsch, did you notice?

423
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,880
No, I don't know what you're talking about.

424
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,900
I witnessed her mana at the exam venue.

425
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,800
I cannot imagine it was being restricted.

426
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,680
There were none of the characteristic fluctuations.

427
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:13,440
No creature possessing mana
can hide those fluctuations.

428
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,740
Even if it were possible, it would require
an unfathomable amount of time.

429
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,450
It does not at all seem like a practical technique.

430
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:27,700
Frieren has dedicated her life
to that impractical technique.

431
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,710
To deceive demons.

432
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:39,130
Demons are much more sensitive to mana than us.

433
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:45,970
One or two hundred years of restricting your mana
will not deceive them without a born talent for it.

434
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,850
It's truly a waste of time.

435
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:54,190
If you used that time for other training,
you could become many times stronger.

436
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,360
It's about as inefficient as can be.

437
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:01,610
But that inefficiency
can sometimes create an opening.

438
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:05,110
In a fight among experienced mages,

439
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:09,480
misjudging your opponent's mana often means death.

440
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,550
Frieren is, in fact, rather
unskilled relative to her age,

441
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:18,500
yet has continued to win against demons.

442
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:24,240
That's just how much Frieren
has refined her mana restriction.

443
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,520
As far as I know, the only one to see through it
at first sight was the demon king himself.

444
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,930
That is, until just now, Lernen.

445
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,720
It was a coincidence.

446
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,400
I just happened to see a slight fluctuation.

447
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,130
That is all.

448
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,740
How very modest of you.

449
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:52,650
It's been half a century since
you were the first to become a first-rank mage.

450
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:58,060
You're still the same cowardly boy, huh?

451
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,290
All the more a shame.

452
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,430
You've come this far,
and yet you haven't got long left.

453
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:14,690
You will probably never fight Frieren.

454
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:18,530
Even if that was a fight you could win.

455
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,180
I really shouldn't take humans as apprentices.

456
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,690
It truly is a shame.

457
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:33,950
I guess he wasn't able to notice, either.

458
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,790
The fluctuations in my mana.

459
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:44,590
The third-stage exam is
an interview with the Great Mage Serie.

460
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,700
So that's how it's going to be.

461
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,080
You will be called in order
once preparations are complete.

462
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,160
Serie has no intention of letting either of us pass.

463
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,160
Please wait here until then.

464
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,100
Do you know her?

465
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,350
From long ago, yeah.

466
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,350
She's probably going to pass people based on instinct.

467
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:01,230
Serie's instinct is always right.

468
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:06,370
I have, in fact, not reached
the heights of magic Serie desires of me.

469
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,520
Excuse me.

470
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,080
Fail.

471
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,900
Leave.

472
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,650
Can I ask why?

473
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:52,210
You're intimidated by my mana as we speak.

474
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:55,160
You understand well where you stand.

475
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:59,920
You can't visualize yourself
as a first-rank mage, can you?

476
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:05,050
In the world of magic, you cannot
realize what you cannot visualize.

477
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,890
That's the most basic of fundamentals. Leave.

478
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,070
Fail.

479
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,050
Fail.

480
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,580
Fail.

481
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,880
Fail.

482
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,140
Frieren.

483
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:22,190
You too cannot visualize
yourself as a first-rank mage.

484
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,690
But for a different reason than the other examinees.

485
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:31,070
You don't think there's
any chance I'm going to pass you.

486
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,570
It's a fact, isn't it?

487
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,400
I'll give you one chance.

488
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,450
Tell me your favorite spell.

489
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,580
The Spell That Creates a Field of Flowers.

490
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,590
A spell you learned from Flamme.

491
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,840
Truly stupid.

492
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,370
Fail.

493
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,170
I see.

494
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,980
I insulted you, and you're
just going to take it?

495
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:05,120
I really can't imagine how
a mage like you defeated the demon king.

496
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,990
It wasn't my power alone.

497
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,910
Himmel, Eisen, Heiter, and I.

498
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,620
We couldn't have won
if any one of us had been missing.

499
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,370
You were blessed with good comrades.

500
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,320
You got lucky.

501
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,370
That's right.

502
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,130
I was lucky.

503
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:33,010
Say, Himmel, why did you recruit me to your party?

504
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,010
We were searching for a strong mage.

505
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,940
There are plenty of those in the royal capital.

506
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,020
It didn't have to be me.

507
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,520
I wanted you.

508
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,020
Why?

509
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:54,940
Frieren, you probably don't remember this,
but I've met you once before.

510
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,380
Yeah, I don't remember at all.

511
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,820
Yeah, you wouldn't.

512
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:04,660
When I was a kid, I went into
the forest to gather herbs, and got lost.

513
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:09,080
I wandered the forest at night for a long time,

514
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,920
and tasted solitude for the first time.

515
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,180
I thought I might never
find my way back to the village.

516
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,800
That's when an elf told me
the way to the nearest village.

517
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:30,110
She really only told me the direction,
with not a word of comfort.

518
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:35,200
Child that I was, I thought
you were a really cold-hearted person.

519
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,050
I don't know if you noticed
my unease, or if it was just a whim...

520
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:51,210
But you showed me the Spell That Creates a Field of Flowers.

521
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,870
I thought it was beautiful.

522
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,970
For the first time in my life,
I saw beauty in magic.

523
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:11,110
I'm sure this is nothing more than a coincidence,

524
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:14,510
but what led me to meet Himmel and the others

525
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:18,110
was that stupid spell Master taught me.

526
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,990
Also, Serie.

527
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,870
I'm sure you intend to fail Fern the same way,

528
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,620
but I don't think you'll be able to.

529
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:33,020
She's going to exceed your expectations.

530
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,630
The age of humans has come.

531
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,260
Exceed my expectations?

532
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,640
She's paralyzed just seeing my mana.

533
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,670
She's no different than the other examinees.

534
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,090
Wait.

535
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:59,150
What do you see?

536
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,270
It's fluctuating.

537
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,420
You said your name was Fern?

538
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,790
Become my apprentice.

539
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,170
What? I'd rather not.

540
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,680
You won't regret it.

541
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,540
I'll guide you to even greater heights.

542
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:36,860
To heights no mage has ever seen before.

543
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:42,240
Is this related to passing the exam?

544
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:44,990
It might be related.

545
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,750
I see.

546
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,640
Lady Serie.

547
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,010
Fern.

548
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,370
I'm sure Serie will tell you all sorts of things,

549
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:08,890
but you don't have to give in to her requests.

550
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:13,270
Much like I'm going to fail, no matter what I say,

551
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:16,250
you're going to pass, no matter what you say.

552
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:21,030
Serie's instincts are always right, after all.

553
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,560
I'm Lady Frieren's apprentice.

554
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,040
Frieren told you what to say, didn't she?

555
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:40,350
I'm not so stupid I'd let a promising mage go by.

556
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,470
Pass.

557
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,240
Next.

558
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,140
And

559
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,140
I'm

560
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,140
al

561
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,140
right

562
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,180
I'll

563
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,180
be

564
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,180
al

565
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,180
right

566
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,020
Yeah,

567
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,020
I

568
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,020
hear

569
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,020
you

570
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,230
I

571
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,230
care

572
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,230
a

573
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,230
bout

574
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,230
you

575
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:01,650
no
