407
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:43,330
29 years after the death

408
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:43,370
29 years after the death

409
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:43,410
29 years after the death

410
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:43,450
29 years after the death

411
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:43,490
29 years after the death

412
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:43,540
29 years after the death

413
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:43,580
29 years after the death

414
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:43,620
29 years after the death

415
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:43,660
29 years after the death

416
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:43,700
29 years after the death

417
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:43,750
29 years after the death

418
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:43,790
29 years after the death

419
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:43,830
29 years after the death

420
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:43,870
29 years after the death

421
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:43,910
29 years after the death

422
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:43,950
29 years after the death

423
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,000
29 years after the death

424
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,040
29 years after the death

425
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,080
29 years after the death

426
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,120
29 years after the death

427
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,160
29 years after the death

428
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,200
29 years after the death

429
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,250
29 years after the death

430
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:44,290
29 years after the death

431
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:44,330
29 years after the death

432
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:44,370
29 years after the death

433
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:44,410
29 years after the death

434
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:44,450
29 years after the death

435
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:44,500
29 years after the death

436
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:44,540
29 years after the death

437
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:44,580
29 years after the death

438
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:44,620
29 years after the death

439
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:44,660
29 years after the death

440
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:44,700
29 years after the death

441
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:44,750
29 years after the death

442
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:44,790
29 years after the death

443
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:44,830
29 years after the death

444
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:44,870
29 years after the death

445
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:44,910
29 years after the death

446
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:44,950
29 years after the death

447
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,000
29 years after the death

448
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,040
29 years after the death

449
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,080
29 years after the death

450
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,120
29 years after the death

451
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,160
29 years after the death

452
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,200
29 years after the death

453
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,250
29 years after the death

454
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:45,290
29 years after the death

455
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:45,330
29 years after the death

456
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:45,370
29 years after the death

457
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,090
Once you get certified as a first-rank mage,

458
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,880
we can enter the Northern Plateau.

459
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,730
I don't think I need to be the one
to get the certification, though.

460
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,520
It'll only last me a short time, anyway.

461
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,810
You can be the one to get it.

462
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,900
Don't you know, Lady Frieren?

463
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:11,400
First-rank mages are a select few
of the most seasoned mages around.

464
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,030
I'm not good enough for that.

465
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,500
Is that so?

466
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,490
You seem disinterested.

467
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,100
It's a bit late to ask this,

468
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,630
but why do we need such an amazing mage
to enter the Northern Plateau?

469
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:34,200
There's always been a lot of monsters there
that use tricky magic, like the Einsam.

470
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,140
Even in the past, you would need a priest
and an excellent mage to get through it.

471
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,620
That said,

472
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,520
if valuable seasoned mages are required to pass,

473
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,520
there must be quite some trouble brewing there.

474
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,150
We'll have to gather information
on the exam in Äußerst.

475
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,670
Based on what Fern said,
it seems there'll be actual combat.

476
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,410
So we'll need some countermeasures.

477
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,420
Isn't any kind of exam going to be easy
with your mana pool, Lady Frieren?

478
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,770
Even when you're regulating it,

479
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,420
you radiate the mana of a seasoned elder mage.

480
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,550
Don't call me an elder.

481
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,420
Come on, now she's sulking.

482
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,340
Isn't "elder mage" going too far?

483
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,950
I'm sorry.

484
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,690
And I haven't forgotten that you
called me a damn hag, you know?

485
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,690
That was ages ago.

486
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,940
Whatever. I'm going to sleep.

487
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,650
Wake me when we get to Äußerst.

488
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,900
Geez.

489
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,660
Actually, never mind.

490
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,160
Huh? What's wrong?

491
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,290
I could only see half the sky.

492
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,920
Just so you know, Fern,

493
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,170
the strength of a mage isn't
determined by just their mana.

494
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:58,760
There's technique and experience,
the magic they use and their control over it,

495
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,600
and their hard work and guts.

496
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,850
You mixed some real warrior words in there.

497
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,560
And also, talent.

498
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:13,440
So far, I've lost to mages with less mana
than me eleven times in my life.

499
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,990
Four of those were demons.

500
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,740
Like Qual.

501
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,620
One was an elf, like me.

502
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,280
And the other six were humans, like you.

503
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,750
The city should come into sight soon.

504
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,660
The road to Äußerst sure is rough.

505
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:37,720
Northern Lands,

506
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:37,550
Northern Lands,

507
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:37,720
Granat Earldom Outlands

508
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:37,550
Granat Earldom Outlands

509
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,260
Time to take a breather.

510
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,070
Hey, Miss, that's a nice staff you've got there.

511
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,520
What's this? More bandits?

512
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,360
We finally got some peace with Aura defeated.

513
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,680
But now people like you show up more often, huh?

514
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,320
Who said you could talk?

515
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,320
Pack up your belongings and—

516
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,410
You bastard!

517
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,510
If you value your lives, get out of here. Immediately.

518
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,890
Let's scram.

519
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,890
Thanks, you saved me.

520
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,890
I'm Übel the Mage.

521
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,270
I'm Kraft the Monk.

522
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,030
Oh, are you an elf?

523
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,280
That's rare, you're the first I've met.

524
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,280
You have the eyes of a murderer.

525
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,660
I didn't save you.

526
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,540
I found some butchered
bandits in the forest nearby.

527
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,340
It was the work of a mage.

528
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,800
And an awfully proficient one, at that.

529
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,050
I see.

530
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,050
Did you come here to lecture me or something?

531
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,090
No, I'm an adventurer too.

532
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:12,060
I'm not so naïve that I'd complain
about killing someone in self-defense.

533
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,670
I'd like to prevent it if I can, though.

534
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:19,070
Perceptive old man. How boring.

535
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,820
Are you headed for Äußerst?

536
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,320
Yeah, to take the first-rank mage exam.

537
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,970
Frieren was also talking about that.

538
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,830
I'll have another story for the next time we meet.

539
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,960
Continental Magic Association

540
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,960
Northern Branch

541
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,960
The exam will take place in two months.

542
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:45,220
Take note that the first-rank exam
is only held once every three years.

543
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:51,310
Additionally, at least a fifth-rank
certification is required to take it.

544
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,850
You've got this, Fern.

545
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,740
Lady Frieren, there's no way I can do this by myself.

546
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,730
You'll be fine.

547
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,470
What if I fail?

548
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,860
The exam is only held once every three years!

549
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,240
Then we'll either hire a first-rank mage or go by sea.

550
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,610
That would be incredibly expensive.

551
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,630
We'd be back to skipping snacktime every day.

552
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,930
Sure, but I don't have a certification.

553
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:28,510
This mark of the holy staff...

554
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,190
isn't gonna work, is it?

555
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,860
What's with that relic again?

556
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,710
Hey, you.

557
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,150
Could you let me see that?

558
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:49,300
Do you intend to take the first-rank exam?

559
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,410
Looks like I'll be able to participate.

560
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,170
I didn't think anyone still knew about these.

561
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,590
Is having that mark impressive?

562
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,180
It's supposed to be.

563
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:10,430
So, you're not in the mage's guild?

564
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,560
The institutions governing mages change frequently.

565
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,680
I can't be bothered to join each new one.

566
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,310
Besides, I have this.

567
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,580
The mark of the holy staff. Impressive, isn't it?

568
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,710
What's this rusted necklace? You recognize it?

569
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,780
Not at all.

570
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,330
I see.

571
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,750
This is the one thing
proving that I'm a mage, though...

572
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,840
Frieren, it's true we don't know about that necklace.

573
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,970
But we do know you're an amazing mage.

574
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,280
Isn't that enough?

575
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,100
You guys don't even live that long.

576
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,860
Lady Frieren.

577
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:16,870
We know well that you're an amazing mage.

578
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,550
Yeah.

579
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:29,130
According to the Continental Magic Association,

580
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:34,760
fifth-rank mages and above
are considered full-fledged.

581
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:38,000
Why did you get the third-rank certification?

582
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,660
It had the closest exam date.

583
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,810
The total number of mages
at or above fifth-rank is six hundred.

584
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:51,400
If you include apprentices from ranks
six through nine, it's a total of two thousand.

585
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:54,590
Forty-five of those are first-rank.

586
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,660
The first-rank exam is every three years

587
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:01,910
and is held in the northern branch
in Äußerst and the main branch in Strahl.

588
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:06,260
There are frequently years where no one passes.

589
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,300
Casualties are taken for granted.

590
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,940
It's quite a difficult exam.

591
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:16,490
The number of mages in the world
sure has decreased, though.

592
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,430
Were there more mages in the past?

593
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:22,700
It was normal to pass mages
on the street a hundred years ago,

594
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,810
when the demon king's army
was intensifying its offensive.

595
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,570
Now you barely meet any unless
you come to a city of magic.

596
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,490
Well, let's put these two months to good use
by buckling down for some training.

597
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,380
We will now commence
the First-Rank Mage Selection Exam.

598
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,990
First Exam — Examiner

599
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,990
Genau — First-Rank Mage

600
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:18,830
The first-rank certification is granted

601
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,990
We've got quite the lineup this year.

602
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:21,720
There's the second-rank mage, Wirbel,
the captain of the Northern Mage Corps,

603
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:21,220
to only the most exceptional of mages.

604
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,350
It is a title only a select few can earn.

605
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,000
who's fought against the remnants
of the demon king's army for many years.

606
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,790
The exam is naturally quite dangerous,

607
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,020
The second-rank mage, Denken,

608
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:32,020
but the Association will not help you
should you find yourself in danger.

609
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:36,510
a cunning old fox who prevailed in
the bloody struggle for the seat of Imperial Mage.

610
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,940
Third-rank mage, Fern,

611
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:44,270
the youngest mage to have passed
the third-rank exam, and with top marks at that.

612
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,270
We do have some problem children as well, though.

613
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:52,620
Like the third-rank mage, Übel,
who took the second-rank exam two years ago,

614
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,900
killed the first-rank examiner, and was disqualified.

615
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,920
Who else looks promising?

616
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:07,790
There's someone radiating
the mana of a seasoned elder mage.

617
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,440
Who's that?

618
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,540
No idea.

619
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:15,010
I will now announce the contents
of the first stage of the exam.

620
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,950
It's a team battle.

621
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:23,050
The fifty-seven of you will form
teams of three to take the exam.

622
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,990
We will now form the teams.

623
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,790
A bracelet?

624
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,280
It has a number on it.
I guess that means I'm in Team Two.

625
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:41,020
By infusing it with mana, I can tell where
the other bracelets for my team are.

626
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,420
So that's how we discern our teams.

627
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,140
This is an interesting setup.

628
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,040
A normal party is one thing,

629
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:56,170
but an impromptu team of eclectic mages
will have a hard time working well together.

630
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,640
First impressions are important
with this kind of thing.

631
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,180
I gotta be careful not to cause trouble.

632
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,680
The bracelet's reaction is over here...

633
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,610
They're gonna come off!

634
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:14,640
Screw you! I'll end you!

635
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,640
You can try.

636
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,820
They're already fighting...

637
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,580
Nice to meetcha.

638
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,020
Nice to meet you, too.

639
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Northern Lands, Grob Basin

640
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
First Exam Area

641
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,870
I will now explain the detailed
rules for the first stage.

642
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:40,130
This exam area is home to a bird called the Stille.

643
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:45,010
I have handed out one cage to each team.

644
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,640
There are two conditions for passing the first stage.

645
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:52,020
You must possess a cage containing
a Stille by sundown tomorrow.

646
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,270
Stay away from me!

647
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,730
All team members must be present at that time.

648
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,150
You're generally free to do as you please,

649
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:04,160
but if any team member exits the exam area,

650
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,160
the whole team will be disqualified immediately.

651
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,990
That's rich, coming from
the people who covered the entire area

652
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,990
with an absolutely impassable barrier.

653
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,750
There's no way we can get out.

654
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,010
So you are listening, huh?

655
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:23,630
The first stage begins now.

656
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,330
We should figure out a plan first!

657
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,610
Idiot!

658
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,870
How are we gonna plan before finding one?

659
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,640
They're still fighting...

660
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:37,640
For now, let's introduce ourselves while we walk.

661
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,770
And decide who holds the cage
with rock-paper-scissors.

662
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,320
I'm Frieren. Nice to meet you.

663
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,970
I'm Lawine, a third-rank mage.

664
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,700
I'm Kanne, also third-rank.

665
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,430
I go way back with Lawine.

666
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,880
We both graduated from the same magic school.

667
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:07,490
Do either of you know anything about the Stille?

668
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,230
No.

669
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,140
Nope.

670
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:14,050
I do know about it, but I've never seen one myself.

671
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:17,770
We should start by finding one
and observing it for a while.

672
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,420
I'm tired.

673
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,540
Show some grit.

674
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,520
Let's take a break.

675
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,230
I can still move, so I'll go look ahead.

676
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,870
It's safer if we move together.

677
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,810
So what? That's inefficient.

678
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,940
Are you strong, Lawine?

679
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,800
Stronger than her.

680
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,190
Wanna put that to the test?

681
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,070
And compared to me?

682
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,080
I wouldn't wanna fight you.

683
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,620
I see.

684
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,200
Alright, go look ahead.

685
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,420
Turn back if it seems dangerous.

686
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,080
Okay.

687
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,200
Oh, and be careful of the sky.

688
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,480
I know.

689
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:26,340
Is this team gonna be okay?

690
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,680
You're like a teacher, Frieren.

691
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,350
I think you should be the leader.

692
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,450
It's just because the two of you are always fighting.

693
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,100
I don't really want to be leading.

694
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:41,230
Sorry, we've always been like this.

695
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:45,010
By the way, what did you mean
by "be careful of the sky"?

696
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,190
I mean just what I said.

697
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,560
Are you bad at detecting mana?

698
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:51,860
Why?

699
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,610
Hey.

700
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,100
That was fast.

701
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,870
I found a Stille.

702
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:03,700
Good job, Lawine. Let's carefully observe—

703
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,010
I told you to observe it...

704
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,900
It's getting away.

705
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,760
No, good work, Kanne.

706
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,020
Oh, not bad.

707
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,910
But you should really get down now.

708
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,970
Huh, why...

709
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,170
Stille are incredibly tough,

710
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:38,870
and can fly faster than sound.

711
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,900
That level of restraint isn't going to work.

712
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,340
Seriously? I already lost sight of it.

713
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,700
We were so close.

714
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,290
It'll take a lot of observation to capture one.

715
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:53,390
We'll dedicate the rest of today to observation.

716
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:59,160
Kanne controlled the water, and Lawine froze it.

717
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,300
They were in perfect harmony.

718
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,160
That's quite impressive coordination.

719
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,900
You don't just learn that overnight.

720
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,570
I was worried for a bit there, but maybe we'll be fine.

721
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,160
Let's chase it.

722
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,410
No, we should check around the perimeter.

723
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:18,790
Why? The quicker we chase it, the better.

724
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,410
Never mind, they're fighting again...

725
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,640
What's that sound?

726
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,420
Huh?

727
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,870
Frieren's not here.

728
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,180
It's faint, but this is the sound of rain.

729
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,510
It's not raining, so why...

730
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,010
Oh, that's why.

731
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,270
So does that mean—

732
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,770
A monster!

733
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,240
My staff.

734
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,440
La-Lawine!

735
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,130
I told you to be careful of the sky, didn't I?

736
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,680
Have you calmed down?

737
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,640
Yeah.

738
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,400
You called Lawine's name.

739
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,990
Don't you hate her?

740
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,990
Yeah...

741
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,910
That's what I thought.

742
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,870
So why are you two so good at coordinating?

743
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,590
I don't get it.

744
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,870
You know, I'm pretty cowardly.

745
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,880
I often find myself helpless
when push comes to shove.

746
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,310
Like the first time we were supposed
to put our flight magic to the test.

747
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:47,110
The others have already made it way over there.

748
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:50,150
There's water down there, so it's not like you'll die.

749
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:54,020
If you can't muster the courage,
do you want me to kick you off?

750
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,900
I hate you, Lawine.

751
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,810
I know.

752
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,570
You're always so mean to me.

753
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:05,790
I do better when I'm praised, you know.

754
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,660
You've gotta be joking.

755
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:11,920
This is the result of being coddled by your parents.

756
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,050
If that's all you need to fly, I'll be as nice as you need.

757
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,420
Then tell me what good points I have.

758
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,300
Come on, are you serious?

759
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:31,220
The way you try your best,
even though you're scared...

760
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,820
That's a good point.

761
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,320
Tell me more.

762
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,700
What?! Why?!

763
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,810
The way you put in a lot of effort in secret.

764
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:51,080
The way you're considerate
to the people around you.

765
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,500
More.

766
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,280
The way you're cute when you smile.

767
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,130
What? Gross.

768
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,470
That was close.

769
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,880
Look at that, you can fly just fine.

770
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,650
I'm never gonna be nice to you again.

771
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:19,530
Lawine can be abrasive,
but she's always pushed me along.

772
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,960
Thanks to her, I've noticed
that if I don't let myself stop,

773
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,530
scary things are more manageable than they seem.

774
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,540
By the way, Frieren.

775
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,130
I noticed something interesting.

776
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,440
Could this be useful somehow?

777
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,010
I see.

778
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,240
We might be able to catch a Stille quite easily.

779
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,140

That's insane.

1193
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,440
Let's do this.

1194
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:24,070
You say that like

1195
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,650
we can take it easy now.

1196
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,820
They're rookies.

1197
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,240
Someone's detected us.

1198
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,070
It's time for some

1199
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:26,440
Shut up.

1200
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,900
inter-team fights.

1201
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:27,200
Then there's

1202
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,610
no more need

1203
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,990
This is an elaborate plan that Team Two came up with.

1204
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,030
for words.
