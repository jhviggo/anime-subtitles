29 years after the death

564
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:03,000
of Himmel the Hero

565
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:03,000
Northern Lands,

566
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:03,000
Klar Region

567
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,420
Is he really that strong of a warrior?

568
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:10,420
He's a dwarf who's protected
his village for almost four hundred years.

569
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,370
How long do dwarves normally live for?

570
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,430
About three hundred years.

571
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,760
His name is Old Voll.

572
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,680
He's a long-lived friend of mine.

573
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,250
I want to take some time
to talk to him before he dies.

574
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,560
That's worrying.

575
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:33,570
I suppose there really aren't many people
Lady Frieren can reminisce about the past with.

576
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:37,570
It's nice to take a detour like this every so often.

577
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,850
Maybe we'll stay there for a decade or so.

578
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,330
One week. No more.

579
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,200
Oh, is that it?

580
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,240
Old Voll.

581
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,470
It's been a while.

582
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:21,410
What do you think? He's a cool,
seasoned veteran of a warrior, isn't he?

583
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,520
He's a seasoned veteran?

584
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,880
Who are you again?

585
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,370
He's totally out of it...

586
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,380
I'm Frieren.

587
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,380
So you are.

588
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,390
You're still pretending to be senile?

589
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,980
Carelessness is a leading
cause of death on the battlefield.

590
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,110
It's the greatest weakness
of both demons and humans.

591
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,110
You can't stand, can you?

592
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,990
Even the most seasoned warrior
will easily suffer lethal injuries

593
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,420
if they do not know how to defend themselves.

594
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:14,110
If I had drawn my sword,
you would have lost your leg.

595
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,700
An underhanded strategy, as always.

596
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,010
Frieren.

597
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:24,380
I welcome you. Take your time and relax.

598
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,520
Frieren, wait.

599
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,390
I can't walk.

600
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,660
Stark, get some training from him while we're here.

601
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:35,900
Yes'm.

602
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,010
That's one hell of an old man.

603
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,630
Help yourself to the firewood.

604
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,280
Hey, I wanna stay for a decade,
could you introduce me to some work?

605
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,510
Lady Frieren, only one week.

606
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,170
Fine.

607
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,180
It's a small village.

608
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,620
There aren't enough hands around here,
so I really appreciate your help.

609
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,620
We've got spare time.

610
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:23,030
Still, I didn't think Old Voll had any friends.

611
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:26,200
I've never seen him have
such a good time talking with someone.

612
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,780
He's a senile old man.

613
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,700
He can barely hold a conversation.

614
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:38,630
He's been protecting this village from monsters
and demons since forever, but nobody knows why.

615
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,460
He's like a protective deity.

616
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,590
He's been alone for a long time, hasn't he?

617
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,510
A week goes by in a flash, huh?

618
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,330
How's Stark?

619
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,760
Humans sure learn fast.

620
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,760
He's gotten a good bit better.

621
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,770
I see.

622
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,220
It's been a fun week, Old Voll.

623
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,780
I really should thank you, you know?

624
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:49,910
You gave me an opportunity to get
to know Himmel and the others better.

625
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,980
Why are you protecting this village?

626
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,910
After all this time...

627
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,700
Does it even matter anymore?

628
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,920
People don't stake their lives
on things that don't matter.

629
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:13,930
I'm just protecting the village my wife loved.

630
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,190
She was a human.

631
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:27,610
I'm merely fulfilling a promise
I made a long time ago.

632
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,700
I have no intention of telling you about it.

633
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:39,460
It's not like I could convey to you
her face, or her voice, or her eyes.

634
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,910
Those memories are mine alone.

635
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:47,260
It's laughable, isn't it?

636
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:52,050
I've been keeping a promise with someone long dead.

637
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,700
I suppose.

638
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:03,860
But I'm sure she's happy
you're keeping that promise.

639
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,460
Himmel, you're a good hero.

640
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,870
I'm sure you'll defeat the demon king.

641
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:21,800
My wife also wished for an era of peace,
one without a demon king.

642
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:29,020
I'll take this memory of the great hero,
Himmel, into the future with me.

643
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:34,240
I'm thankful for that,
but you don't need to go that far.

644
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:38,970
I have both Frieren and Eisen in my party.

645
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,520
I'm not gonna live as long as an elf.

646
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,520
Then it'll be Frieren's job.

647
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:49,390
She'll take our memories into the future with her.

648
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,110
Isn't that right?

649
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,280
I can do that, I guess.

650
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,160
I see.

651
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,910
You've been blessed with good comrades.

652
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:07,780
Then I'll have to show Frieren the collection
of dashing poses I've come up with later.

653
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,220
Maybe I won't remember you after all.

654
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:17,390
The collection of dashing poses
really was unnecessary, though.

655
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,750
They're a waste of memory.

656
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,860
Do you remember the face of that hero?

657
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,360
Of course I do.

658
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,230
His voice?

659
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,240
Don't make fun of me.

660
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,600
I remember everything.

661
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,060
Himmel was the reason I started
learning more about humans.

662
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:42,120
Like the reason you started protecting this village,

663
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,970
he's very important to me.

664
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,520
I see. The reason, huh?

665
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,610
I can no longer remember.

666
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,430
Not her face, nor her voice, nor her eyes.

667
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:07,420
Still, there is some important reason
I continue to protect this village.

668
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,300
You sure make good jokes.

669
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:20,970
By the way, what's the goal of your journey?

670
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:24,900
We're heading for Aureole,
the Land where Souls Rest.

671
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,040
Where is that?

672
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,070
Ende, where the demon king's castle is.

673
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,300
I see.

674
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,230
So you're finally going to defeat the demon king.

675
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:44,840
I hope we see the arrival of an age of peace.

676
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:53,220
Old Voll, the demon king is already...

677
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,140
What is it?

678
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:11,460
I'll make sure to take your memory
to the future with me, as well.

679
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,370
I like the sound of that.

680
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:26,760
I'm glad to have met you at the end of my life.

681
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,140
You said the same thing eighty years ago.

682
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,360
See you, Old Voll. Take care.

683
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,240
Frieren.

684
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,650
I had a dream about my wife.

685
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:51,310
I see.

686
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:57,380
It may be thanks to reminiscing
about old times with you.

687
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,510
See you.

688
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:14,520
29 years after the death

689
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:14,520
of Himmel the Hero

690
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:14,520
Northern Lands,

691
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:14,520
Rohr Highway

692
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,840
What were you asking?

693
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,540
I'm looking for someone.

694
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:31,790
You remember why I set out on this journey, right?

695
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:35,670
To travel with a sexy, older woman, I think?

696
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,850
That is important,

697
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,930
but my goal is this.

698
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,340
To meet up with my best friend,
who set out on his journey ten years ago.

699
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,500
Oh yeah, that's what it was.

700
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,560
A photograph, that's rare.

701
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:58,400
We had it taken by a passing mage way back when.

702
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,570
Do you have an idea where he is?

703
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:06,140
We've been going along
the Northern Lands' major highway.

704
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,950
There have been multiple people who've met him.

705
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,580
I think it's safe to continue northwards.

706
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,170
It's been ten years, right?

707
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,920
I'm surprised people remember him.

708
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,970
His name stands out, after all.

709
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,080
It leaves a strong impression.

710
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,220
What's his name?

711
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,720
Gorilla the Warrior.

712
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,230
Okay.

713
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:35,850
And his actual name?

714
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,310
His actual name?

715
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,610
Was he really your best friend?

716
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:45,950
Everyone in our village used
to call him Gorilla the Warrior.

717
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,900
More like, he made everyone call him that.

718
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,620
What's up with that?

719
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,930
By the way, I'm Goatee the Priest.

720
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,130
I wasn't asking.

721
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,760
Were you called that before you grew a goatee?

722
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,130
We're staying on this topic?

723
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,850
Anyway, Gorilla the Warrior
is all the name you need.

724
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,390
He's guaranteed to introduce himself like that.

725
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,390
What a weird guy.

726
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,840
Yeah, he's a weird guy.

727
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:25,980
After crossing this chasm,
it'll be about a week on foot

728
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,960
until we finally arrive at the city of magic, Äußerst.

729
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,220
It's really been a long journey.

730
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,000
Why are you looking at me?

731
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,590
I didn't do anything this time.

732
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,710
Can we stop by this village first?

733
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,250
Since the highway splits here?

734
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,220
Sure. We also want to get some rest.

735
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,230
Hey, did a guy calling himself
Gorilla come by here about ten years ago?

736
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,480
What a question.

737
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,300
Ah yes, Sir Gorilla the Warrior.

738
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,760
It really works, huh?

739
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,180
He left a strong impression, so I still remember him.

740
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,810
He defeated some monsters near our village.

741
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,620
Do you know where he was headed?

742
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,880
I can't quite seem to recall.

743
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:22,670
I believe Sir Gorilla was on good terms
with Granny Stubborn up on the cliff.

744
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,150
You should try asking her.

745
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:28,180
Granny Stubborn. Another hell of a nickname.

746
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,680
You see, I'm quite the stubborn old woman.

747
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,440
I won't tell you that easily.

748
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,950
She's calling herself stubborn.

749
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,440
What should we do?

750
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:46,440
Complete a couple of my requests.

751
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:52,950
To start off, deliver this letter to Nagel,
the blacksmith in the neighboring village.

752
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,330
We're just running an errand, aren't we?

753
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,690
This reminds me of my journey with Himmel.

754
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,830
You did things like this?

755
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:07,930
Helping people out by doing errands
for them was an everyday occurrence.

756
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:13,920
These are the kinds of things that develop into
tiresome searches or difficult monster fights.

757
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,970
Don't jinx us.

758
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:21,230
Anyway, let's try our best
to get that granny to warm up to us.

759
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,160
She's not warming up to us at all.

760
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,890
I guess she's not called Granny Stubborn for nothing.

761
00:17:53,890 --> 00:18:00,200
Sorry, Himmel or Heiter would have
gotten her to open up in half a day.

762
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,900
Everyone in this party is pretty awkward.

763
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,120
This is the last one.

764
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,530
Clean the statue of champions in the valley.

765
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,930
Follow me, I'll show you the way.

766
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,080
What's this statue of champions?

767
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,420
It's a stone statue of the two brave souls
who saved the world a long time ago.

768
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,090
That's all I know.

769
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:33,090
We don't even know their names.
They're forgotten champions.

770
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,040
We've tended to the statue for generations.

771
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,770
Forgotten champions, huh?

772
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:41,810
By the way, you're Goatee the Priest, aren't you?

773
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,940
How do you know that?

774
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,690
We're here.

775
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,700
A priest and a warrior.

776
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,780
It's quite an old statue.

777
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:01,300
They kind of resemble Sir Sein and Sir Gorilla.

778
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:05,330
Actually, I think I recognize the warrior.

779
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,180
Oh. It's Kraft.

780
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,860
You're right.

781
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,960
He looks exactly the same.

782
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,590
Well, let's get started.

783
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,280
Sein?

784
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,480
I see.

785
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,900
So this guy's name is Kraft.

786
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,500
What about him?

787
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,480
Who knows.

788
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,800
I see.

789
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,730
What's this statue?

790
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:42,640
They look just like us, don't they?

791
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,650
The village chief says they're
champions from a long time ago.

792
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:50,000
But no one even remembers their names.

793
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,850
We won't end up like this.

794
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,010
I will not let myself be forgotten.

795
00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:00,310
I'll become an unforgettable champion,
just like Himmel the Hero.

796
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:06,900
All champions are eventually forgotten.

797
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,020
I'm sure even Himmel the Hero,
who defeated the demon king, will be no exception.

798
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,910
I guess you're right. It's inevitable.

799
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,400
I wonder if I could get that strong if I trained.

800
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,040
Gorilla the Warrior.

801
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,710
That's what I'm going by, starting today.

802
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,800
Why though?

803
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:39,930
If I want to make sure I'm not forgotten,
I gotta make sure my name leaves an impact, right?

804
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,710
That does make sense.

00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,830
That makes you Goatee the Priest, doesn't it?

806
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,660
I like that.

807
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,630
I'm sure the goatee will suit you.

808
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,040
We're finally done.

809
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,090
That was an ordeal.

810
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:12,760
It would have been easy to do
with magic if it'd been bronze...

811
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,050
I asked Gorilla to clean this as well,

812
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:19,490
but he wasn't nearly as thorough as you.

813
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:22,680
He's good for naught but fighting.

814
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,930
His name left quite a strong impression, though.

815
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:32,940
Gorilla talked about you a lot.

816
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:40,150
He talked about how you two would
leave your mark on history as champions.

817
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,660
Did you find out where Gorilla was going?

818
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,760
Tür.

819
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,500
It's a trading city in the center of the Northern Lands.

820
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,770
Far to the east from here.

821
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,020
The opposite direction of Äußerst.

822
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,150
Yeah.

823
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,000
