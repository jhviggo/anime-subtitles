Episode 14: Privilege of Youth

570
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,120
You didn't have to go that far!

571
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,210
You're always so damn hard on me!

572
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,850
Do you hate me that much?!

573
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,090
Whatever! I'm going back to Master!

574
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,610
She's always like this! She could listen
to what I have to say once in a while!

575
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,190
Sure is noisy today.

576
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,700
Lovers' quarrel?

577
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:47,730
Today's Fern's birthday,
but Stark didn't have a present for her.

578
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,980
So Fern snapped at him.

579
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,820
To be honest, I think you went too far today.

580
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,370
You never listen to what Stark has to say.

581
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,150
It's not like I have a present for you, either.

582
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:09,630
Men don't care about details like birthdays
or anniversaries, it's just the way we are.

583
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,380
Ow!

584
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,690
I get it, I'll buy you something.
So please, stop kicking me.

585
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,390
I'm gonna feel that in my knees later.

586
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,560
Geez, I feel bad for Stark.

587
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,230
At my age, you can kind of
brush off being treated like that,

588
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,780
but boys at Stark's age hang onto girls' every word.

589
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,740
I think you should go after him.

590
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,040
He's got a point, you know.

591
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:24,780
Oh yeah, her clip is a butterfly too, isn't it?

592
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,420
That's a cute pouch.

593
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,460
You don't like it?

594
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,070
No, it's just off-putting
how good with women you seem.

595
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,710
I see.

596
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,720
Did you find Stark?

597
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,720
He was in the town square, but...

598
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,400
You couldn't bring yourself to approach him?

599
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,060
I get it, it's not like you actually hate him.

600
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,720
You just don't know how
to interact with a boy your age.

601
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,480
Ah, to be young.

602
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,490
Anyway, you can choose whatever you want.

603
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,740
We can also look at some other shops.

604
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,370
No, that's fine.

605
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,120
Well, then I'll choose for you.

606
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,440
Though, you don't have to be so angry
at him for forgetting to get a present.

607
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,690
There's no way he's organized enough for that.

608
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:21,000
I bet he doesn't even remember his own birthday.

609
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,470
Don't blame the poor kid.

610
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,720
I gave him a present for his birthday.

611
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,980
Oh, so you picked one together then?

612
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,730
How did you...?

613
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,770
People don't normally say no when
someone offers to get them whatever they want.

614
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,090
I bet that memory is precious to you.

615
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,490
That's why you declined.

616
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,990
I don't know why,

617
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,490
but I just felt like I had to decline.

618
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,290
That so?

619
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:55,380
Then go apologize to Stark
and pick out a present together already.

620
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:02,080
He's just a kid. He's not
gonna pick up on subtle hints.

621
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,390
You wanna make up with him, don't you?

622
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,640
You gotta put your feelings into words.

623
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,650
I suppose so.

624
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,780
I'm gonna head back to the inn.

625
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,550
Um...

626
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,390
I apologize for kicking you.

627
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,170
Sir Stark.

628
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,390
Fern.

00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,310
Sorry!

631
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:58,190
I wanted to go pick something out together.

632
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:02,330
Since I wasn't sure what you'd like.

633
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:09,640
But I couldn't bring myself to suggest it
because I thought you might dislike the idea.

634
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,330
I don't dislike that idea at all.

635
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,260
Sir Stark, I'm sorry. I went too far earlier.

636
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,590
It's fine.

637
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,130
I'm used to it.

638
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,840
I really am sorry.

639
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,350
Let's go.

640
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,560
Yes, let's.

641
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,870
Eavesdropping, are we?

642
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,120
Kinda tasteless, don't you think?

643
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,120
You're no better.

644
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,740
Looks like they made up in the end.

645
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:04,630
As you become an adult
and figure out personal boundaries,

646
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,130
you also stop clashing with others.

647
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,760
Those kinds of conflicts are a privilege of youth.

648
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,100
You must've had your work cut out for you.

649
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,950
Can't be easy taking care of two kids.

650
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,620
What are personal boundaries?

651
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,400
Three kids it is.

652
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:31,160
Fern came to me for advice. Not to you.

653
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:35,870
I wonder who it is she sees in me?

654
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:39,670
Fern was raised by Heiter, after all.

655
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:44,090
She shouldn't just go and
compare me to such a great priest.

656
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,380
He wasn't that great.

657
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,580
He'd often be hungover from drinking too much.

658
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,260
There's an undead among us.

659
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,480
And he was incredibly picky.

660
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,390
Stop it.

661
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,320
He lied a lot, as well.

662
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,140
I haven't been drinking.

663
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,270
He was just a sorry excuse for a priest.

664
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,880
You're even worse, though.
An absolute disaster of a priest.

665
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,030
Well, sorry.

666
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,680
That's surprising, though.

667
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,780
I remember Sir Heiter as
a kind and dependable old man.

668
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:18,580
An ideal adult, unlike me.

669
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,840
You've changed, you know?

670
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,400
You seem more mature.

671
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:30,410
What are you talking about? I'm an old man.

672
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:33,430
This is just what happens when you get old.

673
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,380
That's what I would like to say,

674
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:43,560
but deep down, I've barely
changed from when I was a child.

675
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:51,090
I'm just pretending to be an adult.
I've been pretending all my life.

676
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:56,200
And I'm sure I'll continue pretending until the day I die.

677
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,960
Children need an adult
to support them emotionally, after all.

678
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,960
Especially Fern. She's a hard worker.

679
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,710
She needs a lot of praise and guidance.

680
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,970
So who's going to praise you
for putting on that act until you die?

681
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,720
That's what the goddess exists for.

682
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,100
I'll have to wait until I get to heaven, though.

683
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,360
Then, I'll praise you while you're still here.

684
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,610
Will you, now?

685
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:35,160
But you're an elf, you can't understand my feelings.

686
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,990
How are you going to praise me?

687
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,130
That feels better than I expected.

688
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:59,040
Frieren, I'll put in a good word
for you when I get to heaven.

689
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,450
I think you should get praised by the goddess, too.

690
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,560
Is that so? I'll look forward to it.

691
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,450
What do you think you're doing?

692
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,700
I think you're managing to be a fine adult.

693
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:26,960
This would've been much better
if you were an older woman, though.

694
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,960
Then you're in luck.

695
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,520
There are few women as old as me.

696
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:40,470
29 years after the death

697
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:40,470
of Himmel the Hero

698
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:40,470
Northern Lands,

699
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:40,470
Bande Forest

700
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,920
Thank you.

701
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,570
There weren't any carriages around
here, so we really appreciate it.

702
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,980
I'm just paying it forward.

703
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,790
I'm actually a merchant from the village up ahead.

704
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,360
My family has long run an accessory shop there.

705
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,740
Would you happen to be interested?

706
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,370
A sly salesman you are.

707
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,540
I'm not particularly interested,

708
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,090
but you like that kind of stuff, right, Fern?

709
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:05,620
Oh?

710
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,500
Did you buy a new bracelet?

711
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,690
Um, this is...

712
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,610
That's a cute design.

713
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,510
I have a ring with the same one.

714
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:21,470
I got it from Himmel.

715
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,140
It probably matches yours.

716
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,020
Really?

717
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,130
Let's see, where was it?

718
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,270
Huh.

719
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,690
Geez, this happens because
you don't organize your things.

720
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,960
There it is.

721
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:54,340
Sorry, I let my guard down.

722
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:59,090
Bird-like monsters tend to be cunning
and quite good at hiding their mana.

723
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,740
What are we going to do?

724
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:09,010
Can't we just kill the monster
and then use flight magic afterwards?

725
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,980
You can float a carriage, can't you?

726
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,790
Stark, have you ever seen a flying carriage?

727
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,980
We're in one right now.

728
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:24,740
This might surprise you, but it's only been
forty years since humanity learned how to fly.

729
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:29,500
Before that, the sky was the exclusive
domain of monsters and demons.

730
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,880
The flight magic we use is directly
emulating the structure demons use, and—

731
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,210
Never mind the technicalities,
explain it so I can understand.

732
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,850
We're using it without understanding it,
so we can't modify it.

733
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:49,290
We can only lift things larger than
a person for a very short time.

734
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,880
Makes sense.

735
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,350
I guess we'll have to escape.

736
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,540
I'll carry the merchant.

737
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,310
Fern, you carry Sein.

738
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,360
Understood.

739
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,330
I'll gather the baggage.

740
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,240
Hey, what about me?

741
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,210
You can jump out.

742
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,490
What are you talking about?

743
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,860
Sounds like certain death to me.

744
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,500
Warriors don't die falling from this height.

745
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,380
Of course I'd die!

746
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,670
Why are you looking all confused?!

747
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,000
That's weird.

748
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:21,880
Eisen never got hurt just from falling
down somewhere, no matter the height.

749
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,250
What are you?

750
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,020
It really freaked Heiter out.

751
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:38,020
That just goes to show how abnormal Sir Eisen was.

752
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,490
How about we float the carriage
just before it hits the ground?

753
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:46,780
We'd have to calculate whether
we could counteract the fall.

754
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:51,520
If we can't fully cancel our momentum,
we end up as meat splatters on the ground.

755
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,540
Wait, that's terrifying!

756
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:57,540
Either way, you should hurry up.

757
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:02,300
This monster kills its prey
by smashing it into the ground.

758
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,550
I see.

759
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:19,060
Well, nothing ventured, nothing gained.

760
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,820
Don't just suddenly drop us!

761
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,740
We're... alive!

762
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,960
Looks like our plan was a success.

763
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,710
What success?

764
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,910
What plan?

765
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,470
The horse only had light injuries.
I just finished treating it.

766
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,100
But the carriage is inoperable, we need to repair it.

767
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:54,980
Sorry.

768
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,880
No, quite the opposite, I'm grateful.

769
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,480
I would have died without you.

770
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,390
Seems like we'll be stuck here for a while.

771
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,870
Hm.

772
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,670
That's weird.

773
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,350
Where'd it go?

774
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,450
It's gotten warm recently.

775
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,770
We can switch to lighter clothes soon.

776
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:34,170
By the way Fern, that bracelet...

777
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:38,270
Yeah, I got it from Sir Stark as a birthday present.

778
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:41,100
It took us three whole hours to pick out.

779
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,550
So, you ended up choosing it for her?

780
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,140
I said I wanted him to choose.

781
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,150
Ah, I see.

782
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,820
You must've had it hard.

783
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,190
That request ends up being the toughest.

784
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,790
Yeah.

785
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,050
Is this good?

786
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,380
I spent three hours trying to judge her expression.

787
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,850
I was preparing for the stark realities of death.

788
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,760
I feel for you.

789
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,950
Do they think I can't hear them?

790
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,440
But...

791
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,880
She liked it, so I'm glad.

792
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,980
Good going though, Stark.

793
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,900
I thought you were more of a wuss.

794
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,260
That motif is a mirror lotus.

795
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,650
It signifies eternal love.

796
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:33,230
In this region, it's something
you give to your sweetheart.

797
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,020
Sir Stark?

798
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,910
I... I didn't know!

799
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,410
It's not like that!

800
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,870
You think I know flower language?

801
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,260
Yeah, you wouldn't. You're stupid, after all.

802
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,130
Do you need to be that harsh?

803
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,630
Even though you didn't know yourself?

804
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,790
Did you say something?

805
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,160
It's nothing.

806
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,890
Um, should we buy a different one?

807
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,060
You did your best to pick this for me.

808
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,830
Please never say such a thing again.

809
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,940
I'm sorry.

810
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,950
What is it?

811
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,300
Nothing at all.

812
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,730
Lady Frieren.

813
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,300
We've finished repairing the carriage,

814
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,150
so we'll be departing tomorrow morning.

815
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:30,230
I see.

816
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,340
You've been sneaking out every night.

817
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,110
What are you looking for?

818
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,610
That ring I got from Himmel.

819
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:39,990
I'll help.

820
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,120
Let's have them wait until we find it.

821
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:44,750
It's fine.

822
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:48,200
I'll give up if I don't find it tonight.

823
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,260
I'm used to losing things.

824
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:54,010
And it's not like that's
the only thing I got from Himmel.

825
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:58,470
You said it had a mirror lotus,
like this bracelet, right?

826
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,460
It apparently signifies eternal love.

827
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,970
I see. I didn't know that.

828
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,900
It doesn't matter.

829
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,230
I don't think Himmel knew about that either.

830
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:12,860
Still, I think it's very important to you.

831
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,470
Let's get everyone to help us search.

832
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,660
You should've told me.

833
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:26,160
There have always been a good number
of people who lose accessories in our village.

834
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:30,290
This is a spell that finds lost accessories.

835
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:34,400
It's one of the things I intended to give you as payment.

836
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,070
Frieren.

837
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:01,390
You did great on our last quest.

838
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,520
Pick something you like.

839
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,230
Accessories, huh?

840
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,790
I'd be more happy at a magic shop,

841
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,610
but this is fine.

842
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:13,720
That was fast. Pick one properly.

843
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:17,760
What's up?

844
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,410
Nothing.

845
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,450
Frieren.

846
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,660
Thanks.

847
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:25,820
Good thing you didn't give up, right, Lady Frieren?

848
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,010
I guess so.

849
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:42,970
By the way, why do you have
a mirror lotus bracelet, Fern?

850
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,100
Because Sir Stark is an idiot.

851
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,580
So mean.
