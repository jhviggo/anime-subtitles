29 years after the death

559
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:39,000
of Himmel the Hero

560
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:39,000
Northern Lands,

561
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:39,000
Schwer Mountains

562
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,000
She looks like she's going to fall asleep.

563
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,510
Huh?

564
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,920
She fell asleep.

565
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,170
Oh well, I'll carry her.

566
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,650
But, Sir Stark, your axe...

567
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,150
Oh.

568
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,780
My hands are free, though.

569
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,010
I'll carry her.

570
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,330
Huh, why?

571
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,980
Because.

572
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:38,160
In the end, the king only gave us ten copper, huh?

573
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,580
What a miser.

574
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,250
I don't blame him.

575
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,690
Many heroes have tried
and failed to defeat the demon king.

576
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:52,820
Well, taking some regular quests to earn
our travel expenses is fun too, right?

577
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,660
It's an adventuring classic.

578
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,740
That it is.

579
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,240
Hey, isn't that sword the Hero's Blade?

580
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,750
It's a replica.

581
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,830
I once saved a traveling merchant
from some monsters near our village.

582
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,830
He gave it to me as a thank-you.

583
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,670
"For a future hero," he said.

584
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,050
I'm sure he didn't really mean it.

585
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,430
And that motivated you to become a hero?

586
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,300
No.

587
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,310
There was this annoying guy
called Heiter at the orphanage.

588
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,900
He told me a fake sword could only make a fake hero.

589
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,190
So I thought I'd become a true hero,
and prove him wrong.

590
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:39,960
I'll obtain the real Hero's Blade
and defeat the demon king.

591
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:44,200
But time is a cruel mistress.

592
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:50,160
Heiter's now become an alcoholic, a fake priest.

593
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,210
I'm a real priest.

594
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,880
A dream.

595
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,110
Lady Frieren, you finally woke up.

596
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,120
I'm feeling some déjà vu here.

597
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,100
This must still be a dream.

598
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,130
If only.

599
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,620
I underestimated the mountain weather.

600
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,790
The village we're heading to is north of here.

601
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,880
Okay.

602
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,540
Lady Frieren, can you walk?

603
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,950
Nope.

604
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,130
I see.

605
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,010
You smell nice.

606
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,230
You've gotta be tired from
carrying her this whole time.

607
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,140
Let's swap.

608
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,420
Perv.

609
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,300
How, though?

610
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,480
The weather's finally calmed down.

611
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,420
I thought we were going to freeze to death.

612
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,150
I can't believe there's really
a village this deep in the mountains.

613
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,680
We've been waiting for you, Lady Frieren.

614
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,920
You're the current village chief? You're young.

615
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,290
Yes, I'm the forty-ninth. It's a hereditary position.

616
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,610
Welcome to the Village of the Blade.

617
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,070
There was an abandoned cabin outside the village.

618
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,230
That was an old hunting cabin.

619
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,640
The king of the mountain destroyed it.

620
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,960
King? Did this mountain have something like that?

621
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,980
So this is the Village of the Blade.

622
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,340
Do you know about it, Sir Stark?

623
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,840
This village used to safeguard the Hero's Blade.

624
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:07,720
The Hero's Blade, said to be bestowed by the goddess,
was lodged in a sanctuary near the village.

625
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:13,730
None of history's champions
had been able to so much as budge it.

626
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,420
Until eighty years ago, that is.

627
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,740
I think there was a legend about it...

628
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,820
"The only one who can draw the Hero's Blade...

629
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:29,030
is the hero who will vanquish the great calamity
that would destroy this world."

630
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:29,990
That's the one.

631
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,890
So, Sir Himmel is the one who drew that sword?

632
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,350
That's right.

633
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,750
It's a pretty famous story, haven't you heard it?

634
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,970
No. Sir Heiter never mentioned it.

635
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,140
We've arrived.

636
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,560
So warm.

637
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,140
This is quite troubling, though, Lady Frieren.

638
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,660
You'd promised to come again in half a century.

639
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,520
It's enough to make even me blow my top!

640
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,250
So were the words of the forty-seventh
village chief, my grandmother.

641
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,150
I did say I thought it would
be fine to wait eighty years.

642
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:13,500
The people of this village have
guarded the Hero's Blade for ages.

643
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,670
You can fend for yourself, can't you?

644
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:20,800
That's true, but we also need you to do your duty.

645
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,130
What's your duty here?

646
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,740
Monster extermination.

647
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,430
Monsters regularly infest
the area around this village.

648
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,880
It's been a real ordeal recently
with the king of the mountain's rampage.

649
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,730
Then let's get to it tomorrow.

650
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,690
Best to get it over with quickly.

651
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:00,150
There are a lot of monsters,
even this close to the village.

652
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:05,440
How come you didn't hire any
other adventurers with the situation this dire?

653
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,180
We would have loved to, but...

654
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,700
Himmel was a champion, after all.

655
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,680
There really are a lot of monsters, though.

656
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,060
They're gathered around that cave.

657
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,690
Frieren, what's—

658
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,590
It's the king.

659
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,690
I see.

660
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,100
No wonder I don't know about it. It's new.

661
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,850
Just eighty years, and you call yourself a king?

662
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,970
Stark! You can still move, can't you?

663
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,570
Cut me some slack!

664
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,260
Great work.

665
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,580
That brings our duty to an end.

666
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:40,230
Frieren, what's the meaning of this?

667
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,640
That's the Hero's Blade.

668
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,650
It's the reason the monsters gather here.

669
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,770
Even though they can't pass
the sanctuary's powerful barrier,

670
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:54,870
they can't suppress their urge to destroy the sword.

671
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,130
They must really fear the Hero's Blade.

672
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,000
That's not what I mean...

673
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,890
Ah, right.

674
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:10,130
Himmel wasn't able to draw the sword.

675
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,260
It seems you're not a true hero, either.

676
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,330
Himmel.

677
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,890
I'll happily be a fake hero.

678
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:28,020
I'm going to defeat the demon king
and bring peace to the world.

679
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:34,410
Then, whether I'm a fake or not won't matter.

680
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,440
And Himmel pulled it off.

681
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,960
He saved the world, even without this sword.

682
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,790
He was a true hero.

683
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,990
Then why are you hiding that fact?

684
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,420
It's because many people want
to worship Himmel as a champion.

685
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:59,930
A champion doesn't need a lame story
about not being able to draw the Hero's Blade.

686
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,690
Champions are always romanticized
by those who come later.

687
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:15,010
Until they eventually lose
all resemblance to the original.

688
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,200
I was sure you'd take care of it, Lady Frieren.

689
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,600
You really came in clutch.

690
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,220
My grandmother also said that.

691
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:42,350
What's up with your grandma?

692
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,290
Well then, see you again in half a century.

693
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,280
Please don't be late next time.

694
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:58,990
29 years after the death

695
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:58,990
of Himmel the Hero

696
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:58,990
Northern Lands,

697
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:58,990
Appetit Region

698
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:03,120
Alright, we'll take the rest of
the day off after we stop by the inn.

699
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,830
We're finally in a town again.

700
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,250
I'm going to enjoy this.

701
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,500
What are you going to do, Lady Frieren?

702
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,340
Do you want to browse the local shops together?

703
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,840
I'm good.

704
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,130
I'll relax and read grimoires here.

705
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:19,130
I see, then I'll go by myself.

706
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,760
Oh yeah.

707
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,350
Today's Stark's eighteenth birthday.

708
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,350
Why can't you tell me such things ahead of time?

709
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,150
I don't have anything prepared.

710
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,110
Just buy something in town.

711
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,610
I don't know what Sir Stark would want.

712
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,410
You haven't thought this through, have you?

713
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,580
This is your fault, you know, Lady Frieren.

714
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,420
Incidentally, what are you planning to give Sir Stark?

715
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,760
I've got just the thing.

716
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,520
A potion that dissolves clothes.

717
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:12,940
This is the kind of stuff guys are really into.

718
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,650
That's what Master told me.

719
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,370
What, you're interested, too?

720
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:33,170
I told you to go return this vulgar potion
when you bought it, didn't I?

721
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,420
You really can be just the worst.

722
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,430
This potion was pretty valuable, too.

723
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,720
What am I gonna do about his present?

724
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,320
I forgot about this.

725
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:09,540
I guess I'll just have to sound him out directly.

726
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,830
Even if it'll probably be obvious.

727
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,580
Sir Stark.

728
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,630
I guess he went out.

729
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,600
A warrior with an axe?

730
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,770
He helped push my cart.

731
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,600
I think he was headed to the plaza.

732
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,230
He was playing with us a bit ago.

733
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,200
He saved my cat that got stuck in the tree.

734
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,700
He stopped a rampaging bull.

735
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:52,080
He's been helping a lot of people.

736
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,960
Lady Frieren's idea was just rude.

737
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:00,250
There's no way Sir Stark would be happy
to receive such a lewd potion.

738
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,230
Sir Stark—

739
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,530
That cloud looks like boobs.

740
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,860
He's thinking lewd thoughts.

741
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:30,740
Damn, and that one looks like poop.

742
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,620
No, he's just childish.

743
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,960
I'll have to tell Fern about this later.

744
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,090
How am I supposed to react to that?

745
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,510
Sir Stark.

746
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:52,260
Fern, you came at just
the right time, look at that cloud...

747
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,850
I'm sorry, don't mind me.

748
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,560
Um...

749
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,610
Why don't we walk for a bit?

750
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:03,610
Yes.

751
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:09,110
Hey, why are you angry, did I do something?

752
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,620
How should I broach the subject?

753
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,120
I'll apologize, alright?

754
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,710
It'll be suspicious no matter what I say.

755
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,630
So I may as well ask directly.

756
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,470
Sir Stark, is there anything you want?

757
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,720
Why?

758
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:32,140
Because today is your birthday.

759
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,930
Is it?

760
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,230
What's that got to do with wanting something?

761
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,230
It's for your birthday present.

762
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,360
Huh? You're giving me something?

763
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:47,860
You're kinda obnoxious, so never mind.

764
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,870
Uh, I wasn't messing with you.

765
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:57,000
I've never gotten a present for my birthday.

766
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:06,170
I've never gotten one, neither
from my late family or my master,

767
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,130
so I thought that was normal.

768
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,880
Not even from your family?

769
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,510
Was there just no such tradition?

770
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:18,310
No, I think they just didn't care about me.

771
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,060
My home was a village of warriors.

772
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,860
There was no place for the weak.

773
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,320
What a disgraceful mess against mere monsters.

774
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,360
Take a page from Stolz's book.

775
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,740
Never mind injured, he hasn't got
a single drop of mud or blood on him.

776
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:42,250
A spotless white cloak is the mark
of our village's strongest warrior.

777
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,960
You're our village's pride, Stolz.

778
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,500
Of course, Father.

779
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:53,930
In contrast, Stark is a failure.

780
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:56,850
Even though he trains so much every day,

781
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,810
he's not been able to properly fight a monster even once.

782
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,520
It's starting to rain; let's go home.

783
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,900
I'll give my dumb brother some lessons.

784
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,940
Don't bully him too much.

785
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,530
I'm going ahead, it's a waste of time.

786
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,540
Stark.

787
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,540
Stolz.

788
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,300
I'm sorr—

789
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,420
Great concentration.

790
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,390
I'm sure you'll grow strong.

791
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,810
Your stance is a little off, though.

792
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:45,850
I suppose my brother was
the only one who was different.

793
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:47,860
But...

794
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,370
When my home was attacked by demons,

795
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,870
I abandoned him and everyone else.

796
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,710
I guess it only makes sense
my family didn't celebrate.

797
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,380
I'm a failure who keeps running away.

798
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:13,720
I'm sure Himmel wouldn't have run away.

799
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:22,180
Sir Stark, let's go pick out a present.

800
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,190
The past doesn't matter.

801
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:31,320
I haven't seen Stark the Warrior flee even once.

802
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,780
I might run away in the future.

803
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,280
We won't let you.

804
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,780
But I—

805
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,580
If you don't choose, I'll just choose something myself.

806
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,830
Alright, alright.

807
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,880
Then I think I'll go with this—

808
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,840
That's expensive, so no.

809
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,920
Okay.

810
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,680
Welcome back. You two were out pretty late, huh?

811
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:10,610
What's up with these absurdly large
hamburg steaks, Lady Frieren?

812
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:14,320
What do you mean, this is a classic birthday meal.

813
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,740
Master didn't give me any presents,

814
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,570
but he did always make me birthday steaks.

815
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,700
What's this about?

816
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,040
Stark, did Eisen not tell you?

817
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,830
Tell me what?

818
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,290
Warriors aren't good with words, are they?

819
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:32,840
You're saying that, Lady Frieren?

820
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,720
Yeah, I get it because
the same goes for me, I suppose.

821
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,180
It's stupid.

822
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,510
It's difficult to properly convey
your feelings without using words.

823
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,560
This is...

824
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,390
Come to think of it,

825
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:51,690
you always make these absurdly large
hamburg steaks when it's someone's birthday.

826
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:52,770
What's that about?

827
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,980
It's a tradition from my hometown.

828
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:00,660
It's a gift to show appreciation for
the warriors who've been giving it their all.

829
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,910
Consider it your birthday gift from me.

830
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:08,040
We're not warriors though, Eisen.

831
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,540
Everyone who's been giving it their all is a warrior.

832
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,960
That so?

833
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,540
I don't know about that.

834
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,960
Warriors who've been giving it their all...

835
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,510
Stolz, what are you making?

836
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,600
Hamburg steak. It's your birthday, isn't it?

837
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,680
Don't tell Dad.

838
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,070
Run away, Stark.

839
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,400
Survive.

840
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,350
I got the recipe from Eisen.

841
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,020
How is it? Is it good?

842
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,360
Yeah.

843
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,960
I've also got this. There's still a bit left.

844
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,130
I'll pour it over your head again, Lady Frieren.

845
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,380
Huh, what's that?

846
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,630
It has nothing to do with you, Sir Stark.

847
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,550
It's a valuable potion.

848
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,130
What kind of potion?

849
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,220
Perv.

850
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,720
Huh, why?

851
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,640
Perv.

852
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,890
