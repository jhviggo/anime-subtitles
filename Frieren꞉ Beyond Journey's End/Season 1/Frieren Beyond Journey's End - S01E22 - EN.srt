Episode 22: We'll Be Enemies Next Time

306
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,430
It's evening, huh?

307
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,550
Lazing around is pretty nice.

308
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,670
Who's that?

309
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,660
Coming!

310
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,990
Fern?

311
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,810
Weren't you out taking the exam?

312
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,440
We got back last night after the exam ended.

313
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,850
Sir Stark, it's evening right now, isn't it?

314
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,410
You were sleeping, weren't you?

315
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,540
You stayed up late, didn't you?

316
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,420
Yes.

317
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:09,920
What else?

318
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,300
I had some juice in the middle of the night.

319
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,740
I'm sorry! I'm sorry, alright?

320
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,260
You made her angry.

321
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:24,310
You just woke up, too, didn't you, Lady Frieren?

322
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,060
I got caught in the crossfire.

323
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:32,710
Looks like we're gonna need
to spend today pacifying Fern.

324
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,080
What are we going to do?

325
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,370
Let's go eat some tasty food.

326
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,820
Tasty food?

327
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,840
It's a little expensive,

328
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,580
but we found a nice place here
when we came through with Himmel's party.

329
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,140
That was eighty years ago, right?

330
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,680
You think it's still around?

331
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:07,810
Oh, my.

332
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,310
It turned on.

333
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,440
I told you I'd fix it, didn't I?

334
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,420
Thanks, you're always a great help, Richter.

335
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,200
You're welcome.

336
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,550
Ah, yes, take these as well.

337
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,270
Alright, see you later.

338
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,440
Hey, Grandma, I'm not a kid anymore.

339
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,060
I'm a grown man already.

340
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,050
You're still basically a child to someone my age.

341
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,970
You like those, don't you?

342
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,990
Sorry, I'm closing shop.

343
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,740
You see, an insane old man forced me into a fistfight.

344
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,020
I've got to rest up.

345
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,400
That sounds like quite the ordeal, Richter.

346
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,980
Why don't you come grab some food with us?

347
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,200
There's a restaurant I'm looking for,

348
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,130
but Laufen and I don't know our way around here.

349
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,010
Why are you with Denken in the first place, Laufen?

350
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,100
And what's that you're eating?

351
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,240
Gramps bought them for me.

352
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,510
I'm not sharing.

353
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,410
Wow, you've totally become his granddaughter.

354
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,230
Leave.

355
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,020
We're not a team anymore.

356
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,320
You lack political acumen.

357
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,740
If you're going to live as a mage,

358
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,700
it would pay to stay in my good graces.

359
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,440
There are plenty of restaurants around.

360
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,750
Just choose a random one.

361
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,080
My wife...

362
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,720
There's a place I once visited with my late wife.

363
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,160
I can't forget the taste of the food there.

364
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,970
You'll be treating me, yes?

365
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,090
Of course.

366
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,470
I told you it would pay.

367
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,250
Four-eyes.

368
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,860
Übel.

369
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,110
Nice to meet you, I suppose.

370
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:47,140
I guess you don't need clones
just to wander the streets.

371
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,710
I don't mind small talk,
but we're going to have to keep walking.

372
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:55,260
Sure, but if you try to run, I might end up killing you.

373
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,150
Can I ask you something?

374
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,670
Übel...

375
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,160
You have no qualms about killing people, do you?

376
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,340
Why didn't you kill Wirbel?

377
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,410
You had a chance, didn't you?

378
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,830
Oh, so you were watching.

379
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,540
Nothing gets by you, huh?

380
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,550
It's kinda hard to put into words.

381
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,430
I'm surprised.

382
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:32,560
You still want to be human, even though
your hands are already stained with blood.

383
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:39,310
That's right. I need the time
to gather the resolve to kill.

384
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,500
Because I could empathize with him, I guess.

385
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,200
I found myself wanting some time before the kill, too.

386
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,240
I can't move.

387
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,770
This is...

388
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,540
Solganiel.

389
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,080
The Spell That Binds Anyone in Sight.

390
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:04,590
The spells people are proficient in
reflect their life and character.

391
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:09,950
It's always been like that for me.

392
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,810
If I can empathize with a spell, I'll be able to use it.

393
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:17,100
If I can't empathize with it, I won't.

394
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:24,480
Four-eyes, your clones are such perfect copies,
they retain the same capabilities as the original.

395
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:29,120
What were you thinking?
What kind of life have you lived?

396
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,740
Tell me.

397
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,570
I see.

398
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,590
You're the type that uses magic by feel.

399
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:42,630
You just use spells, without even
understanding the underlying principles.

400
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:49,380
I hate brainless people like that.

401
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,260
That's not an answer.

402
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,020
I'm saying that I won't tell you,
because I don't like you.

403
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,110
You can kill me if you want.

404
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:06,030
However, you'll never have another chance
to empathize with me again.

405
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:15,020
Nah, I'm good.

406
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,450
I feel like I've gotten a glimpse of you.

407
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,740
I see.

408
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,790
I wanna know more.

409
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:28,090
Where were you trying to go?

410
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,580
Who knows.

411
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,300
Don't follow me.

412
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:33,800
This is it.

413
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,660
You made a good choice, Denken.

414
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,290
This is the best restaurant in town.

415
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,310
I come here often.

416
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:46,930
It's been fifty years since I came here with my wife,

417
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,520
but it hasn't changed at all.

418
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,550
How curious.

419
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,200
Are you sure?

420
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,050
Can I really order as many desserts as I want?

421
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:04,960
Yeah.

422
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,460
Denken, it's Frieren.

423
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,800
What should I get?

424
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,420
My recommendation is...

425
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:15,430
This is such a luxury, and it's not even my birthday...

426
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,440
Leave them, they look like they're having fun.

427
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,490
Meals are meant to be enjoyed.

428
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,750
That's why we're here.

429
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,050
Alright, it's time to stock up.

430
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,050
That sure is a lot of food.

431
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:43,370
Yeah, Lady Frieren does this occasionally.

432
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,880
Thank you for recovering this knife,
a family heirloom, from the demons.

433
00:10:53,880 --> 00:11:01,950
I, Lecker, prodigy chef of the century,
will serve and reward you to the best of my abilities.

434
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,790
That's quite the heaping of food.

435
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,380
The food here is really good, after all.

436
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,410
I ought to thoroughly enjoy it.

437
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,520
Instead of eating that much at once,

438
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,030
you could just come here again.

439
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:18,030
I thought so too, but there are many
flavors I ended up never experiencing again.

440
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,790
Rest assured, Lady Frieren.

441
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,530
I intend to pass these
flavors on to future generations.

442
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,300
You will still find them
in one hundred, even two hundred years.

443
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,120
Is that so?

444
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,080
It's funny, all chefs say that.

445
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,680
They say that, and then their successors change it,
trying to leave their marks on history.

446
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:50,060
When that happens, you can go
and find even tastier food.

447
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:56,450
With all due respect, Sir Himmel,
no food in the world will surpass mine.

448
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,940
Then make sure you pass it down to the future.

449
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,200
That's the reward I ask for.

450
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:14,840
If it is the hero's request, I will make sure to achieve
this feat that no chef has ever achieved before.

451
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:23,880
Frieren, this is crazy good.

452
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,850
Am I allowed to be this happy?

453
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:37,990
Really? All that enthusiasm,
and the flavors still changed.

454
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:45,160
I won't have to search for tastier food, though.

455
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:48,100
It's even better than last time.

456
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:56,050
It really is good.

457
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,300
You've got some on your face, Sir Stark.

458
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,150
You need to eat your vegetables.

459
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,430
You've totally become her grandpa.

460
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:08,590
Huh, you're a surprisingly light eater.

461
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,440
What's it to you?

462
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,940
That was delicious, Lady Frieren.

463
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,140
I'm so glad we were able to cheer her up.

464
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:24,340
By the way, are we okay money-wise?

465
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,670
That wiped out my secret stash.

466
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,130
This is the spiritual state of nothingness.

467
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,050
You have done well to achieve
the essence of a true warrior.

468
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,700
There is nothing more for me to teach you.

469
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,410
Who's that old man?

470
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,190
I don't know.

471
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:00,320
He just randomly starts
talking to me while I'm training.

472
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,450
You sure are liked by strange people.

473
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,080
Anyways, you have a moment?

474
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,240
I need your help.

475
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,830
What happened?

476
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,390
She's totally pissed.

477
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,490
This is even worse than yesterday.

478
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,660
Yeah.

479
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,680
What did you do?

480
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,960
It was my turn to go shopping, but I overslept...

481
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,520
That's nothing out of the usual, though.

482
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,890
Why's it a problem now?

483
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:33,890
Fern's the type to let it build up, then explode.

484
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,990
What happens when she explodes?

485
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,350
She stops talking to me.

486
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,360
What are you guys, twelve?

487
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,640
Please, Stark!

488
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,000
Talk to her for me!

489
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,710
She won't listen to me!

490
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,450
What?

491
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:49,870
I don't wanna!

492
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,230
I'm scared!

493
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:55,750
That makes sense. Sorry for asking that of you.

494
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,620
Uhm, Miss Fern?

495
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:09,330
It looks like she's reflecting on her behavior...

496
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:11,980
I want some.

497
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,680
Huh?

498
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,940
I want some sweets.

499
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,110
What a pain...

500
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,600
Alright, let's go buy some together!

501
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,120
Is there anything left of my secret stash?

502
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,880
Oh, that guy...

503
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,910
I think he was Wirbel, of the Northern Mage Corps.

504
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,650
You're a warrior, aren't you?

505
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:49,570
Uh, what do you want from me?

506
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:50,450
What do you think?

507
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,800
What?!

508
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,480
This one's a miss.

509
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,610
What are they doing?

510
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,530
Sorry, I'm late, Kanne.

511
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:11,080
Lawine, that outfit is even cuter than usual.

512
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,870
My brothers are back from the imperial capital.

513
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:21,380
They buy all this unnecessary
stuff for me every single time.

514
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm not a dress-up doll!

515
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,380
Mom gets all excited, too.

516
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,380
There's no stopping them.

517
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,350
You're even more spoiled than I am.

518
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:36,010
If that's what you think, switch with me.

519
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:39,390
It's hell being compared
to my overachieving brothers.

520
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,030
Come on, let's go. I feel like I'm gonna suffocate.

521
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:52,280
I'll be escorting you today then, Lawine.

522
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:01,040
Ow! Ow! They're gonna come off!

523
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:26,660
Um, Miss Fern, what shall we get?

524
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:30,910
Anything is fine, you can choose.

525
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,380
Anything is definitely not fine.

526
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,760
What should we do?

527
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,460
I'm the wrong person to ask.

528
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:47,210
Oh, it's Frieren.

529
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,460
Yeah.

530
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,340
This is perfect.

531
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,350
We were just about to go visit you.

532
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,680
Who are they?

533
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,900
They were on my team for the exam.

534
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:06,080
Yeah, Frieren helped us out a bunch.

535
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,730
She was like a teacher.

536
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,820
Because they kept quarreling.

537
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,000
That's on Lawine.

538
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,690
Ow!

539
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,720
I feel out of place among all these girls.

540
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:18,720
There, there.

541
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,870
Hey!

542
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,870
Huh?

543
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,860
You're a warrior, aren't you?

544
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,620
Uh?

545
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,620
Uh, wait.

546
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,630
Stop, what are you doing?

547
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,940
You're great.

548
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,800
What's going on?!

549
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,290
Crops are being thrashed by some Fressers,

550
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:40,500
and we accepted a request from
the Continental Magic Association to eliminate them.

551
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,180
We're looking for a vanguard.

552
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,640
We met during the exam.

553
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,290
Is this guy in your party?

554
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,270
Can we borrow him?

555
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,050
Go ahead.

556
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,400
So mean!

557
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,650
This is so mean...

558
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,530
They're taking him away, is that okay?

559
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:55,920
I'm sure it's fine.

560
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,250
He didn't seem to mean any harm.

561
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,570
It's almost like he's a different person.

562
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,930
He's probably the type to act
like a whole different person at work.

563
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,400
My brothers are like that, too.

564
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,290
Here, Frieren.

565
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,180
This is a thank-you gift.

566
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,980
I haven't done anything to be thanked for.

567
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:17,760
That's not true.

568
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:22,910
Without you, we couldn't
have passed the first-stage exam.

569
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,140
Thanks!

570
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,150
Thanks,

571
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,270
Sir Himmel!

572
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,770
Everything's okay now.

573
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:33,920
Yeah!

574
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,770
Alright, your mom and dad are waiting.

575
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:37,590
Yeah!

576
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,810
Why do you help people, Himmel?

577
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,270
Because I'm a hero.

578
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,040
That's not what I meant.

579
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,920
I guess...

580
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,180
It might be for my own sake.

581
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:04,060
I want people to remember me,
even just a little bit.

582
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:13,130
To live is to have others
know you and remember you.

583
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:18,070
What do you need to do for people to remember you?

584
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,950
Just a little bit is fine.

585
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:24,370
You just need to change someone's life a little.

586
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,350
I'm sure that's all you need.

587
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:40,350
And then Lawine...

588
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:43,630
No, that was you...

589
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,300
Huh, was it...

590
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,330
That other time too...

591
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:54,000
Lady Frieren, the sweets
they gave us are incredibly good.

592
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,860
She finally cheered up.

593
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,610
Oh yeah, you wouldn't wake up
for quite a while on the second day.

594
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,370
Don't talk about that.

595
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,520
She's going to start sulking again.

596
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,730
Frieren.

597
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,130
If the first-rank exam has
three stages, like in previous years...

598
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:15,470
We'll be enemies next time, won't we?

599
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,620
I guess so.

600
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,350
What is it?

601
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,940
It's a notice regarding the next exam.

602
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,760
The date, time, and location of the second stage,

603
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,100
as well as the name of the examiner.

604
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,510
The examiner is Sense, huh?

605
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,960
How unlucky.

606
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,290
Even though we passed the first stage.

607
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,820
What do you mean?

608
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,900
Sense has been the examiner of four exams.

609
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,960
No one has passed any of them.

610
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,230
This meat is so good.

611
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,200
Dude, you're amazing.

612
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,490
So this is the essence of a true warrior!

613
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:36,880
What a cruel task for an exam.

614
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:39,920
You think?

615
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,330
I'm a pacifist.

616
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,750
Unlike you, Genau.

617
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,150

This sure is a surprise.

1031
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,650
Gargoyles!

1032
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,650
It's a Mimic.

1033
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:24,280
That's brutal.

1034
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,900
That's out of

1035
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,400
the question.

1036
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,650
The work of a

1037
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,900
Even the bones are gone.

1038
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,240
monster or demon,

1039
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,860
I imagine.

1040
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,820
Let's proceed carefully

1041
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:27,610
while we map out the place.

1042
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:27,660
It would be

1043
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,410
a terrifying threat.

1044
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:29,990
Episode 23

1045
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:29,990
Conquering a Dungeon

1046
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,990
For the second-stage exam,

1047
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,990
you will be conquering a dungeon.
