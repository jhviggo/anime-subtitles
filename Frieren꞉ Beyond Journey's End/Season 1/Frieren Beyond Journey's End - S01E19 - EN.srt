Episode 19: An Elaborate Plan

279
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,560
See, you can do it if you try.

280
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,770
Hehe, you think?

281
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:08,020
Lawine can be abrasive,
but she's always pushed me along.

282
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,910
We'll finally be fighting our first dragon tomorrow.

283
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,770
Are you scared, Eisen?

284
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:18,990
You're trembling.

285
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,910
Yeah.

286
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,000
I see, then—

287
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,290
Huh? You're scared?

288
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,750
Yeah.

289
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,400
I see. I'm scared, too.

290
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,090
What's with this conversation?

291
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,550
I was trying to raise morale
by imitating other adventurers.

292
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,690
I'm sorry, that didn't pan out as I expected.

293
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,310
No, you helped ease my nerves.

294
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,280
Himmel, you're fine as you are.

295
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,200
I'm sure these things are different for every group.

296
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,330
Probably.

297
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,960
I see, they really are different for every group.

298
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,470
We finally managed to catch a Stille.

299
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,720
That's a relief.

300
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,720
You say that like we can take it easy now.

301
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,350
What comes next is the real trouble.

302
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,610
We need to protect the Stille
from being stolen by the other teams.

303
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,700
It's time for some real combat.

304
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,790
Alright, let's go over what we've learned
while observing the Stille.

305
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:50,560
First of all, as you said, it can
fly faster than the speed of sound.

306
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,890
There's no way we can catch it at that speed.

307
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,430
It's also as tough as a dragon,

308
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,460
and doesn't even flinch when hit
with an average offensive spell.

309
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,170
It can also break restraints.

310
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,070
What's more, it's incredibly sensitive to mana.

311
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:13,690
Even if we suppress our mana
when approaching it, it quickly flies away.

312
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:27,450
But the biggest problem is that we can't
use mana detection to find one,

313
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,790
since it has almost none.

314
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,150
Which is why we have no idea
where any are right now,

315
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,310
or even how many there are.

316
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,930
We haven't seen any since
the three from yesterday morning.

317
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:44,300
They've probably gotten cautious
from all the examinees walking around.

318
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,640
If we're unlucky, we might not see another one.

319
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:52,690
Not that we'd have any ideas for how
to catch one if we do find it.

320
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,400
That'll be fine.

321
00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:01,780
I was experimenting with a spell
that might help us catch one last night.

322
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,220
Oh yeah, you did go out.

323
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,670
What kind of spell is it?

324
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,590
You've already seen it.

325
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,680
The Spell That Catches Birds.

326
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:17,720
It's a folk spell that a tribe of hunters invented

327
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,050
back when there were far more mages,
and magic was more commonplace.

328
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:25,430
Oh yeah, you did immobilize that thing with magic.

329
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,770
But that was a monster, not a bird...

330
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,050
Yeah, it's a folk spell.

331
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,000
It seems it can catch anything
that's vaguely like a bird.

332
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,060
It's a powerful binding spell.

333
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,150
I think it'll work on the Stille.

334
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,170
Why didn't you tell us?

335
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:45,530
We could have caught one yesterday with that.

336
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,910
It's not that easy.

337
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,230
The spell has a range of fifty centimeters.

338
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,540
That's how close I need to get.

339
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,120
Fifty centimeters?

340
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,890
How close have we gotten so far?

341
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,160
At best, three meters.

342
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,310
And they seem to notice us
starting at about twenty meters.

343
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,460
We're one step away from catching one, huh?

344
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,940
That's a pretty big step.

345
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:18,830
Just to confirm, you two don't have
any spells that can slow it down, right?

346
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,470
If I could freeze it properly, that would work,

347
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:25,050
but besides being sensitive to mana,
it's a tough fighter, and hard to freeze.

348
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:28,370
It would probably get away before I could freeze it.

349
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:33,410
I could easily slow it down
if I had a large amount of water,

350
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:39,180
but the magic I use can only manipulate water.

351
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,170
I'm not capable of creating it myself.

352
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,480
So, I can't use it if there's no water,

353
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,060
and large bodies of water don't conduct mana well,

354
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:53,140
so it's hard to do without imbuing
them with mana beforehand.

355
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:58,120
If it's dispersed, like with rain,
I can manipulate large amounts immediately.

356
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:04,070
But if I imbue the water with mana,
the sensitive Stille will definitely stay away.

357
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,320
It'll stay away...

358
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,230
I see. It'll stay away from it.

359
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,330
I have a plan that might work.

360
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,130
That's not a bad idea, but it's risky.

361
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,860
We'd be picking a fight with every other team.

362
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:43,730
But we probably won't
be able to catch one otherwise.

363
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,610
Are you scared, Lawine?

364
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,910
Graa! They're gonna come off!

365
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:58,920
Fine.

366
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,790
Let's do this.

367
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:09,140
Team 4

368
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:09,140
Land — Second-Rank Mage

369
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:09,140
For now, we should try to hide
until the end of the exam.

370
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:14,640
Team 4

371
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:14,640
Übel — Third-Rank Mage

372
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,800
What? That's so boring.

373
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,640
Mages should fight with pride and dignity.

374
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,020
Team 4

375
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,020
Fern — Third-Rank Mage

376
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:18,020
Mages also avoid needless fights.

377
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,270
Getting more water comes first, though.

378
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,380
I believe there was a lake
in the center of the exam site.

379
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,750
I'm glad we managed to capture
a Stille early on, though.

380
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,330
If we can hide until sundown,
we'll have passed the first stage.

381
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,310
What's up?

382
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:47,340
Looks like it's not going to be that easy.

383
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:52,600
You know, I thought this was a path,
but it's a dried-up river.

384
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,970
This isn't the first we've come across, either.

385
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:01,560
There's a barrier covering the exam area, right?

386
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,440
Yeah, it's standard for exams.

387
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,820
It's a completely impassable physical barrier.

388
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,820
Does it not let water through, either?

389
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,200
Judging by how dried out things are,
they must've set up the barrier about a week ago.

390
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:24,210
Most of the water will have collected
in the lake at the center of the basin, then.

391
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:27,230
We examinees are living beings,

392
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,840
so we need a certain amount of water to function.

393
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:35,070
That doesn't mean examinees
are going to gather around the lake.

394
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,100
That's true.

395
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,600
We can carry water around with us.

396
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:43,850
But the Stille is a living creature too, and it can't.

397
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,680
Oh, I see.

398
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,520
So those who've noticed this are going
to be camped around the largest watering hole—the lake.

399
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,070
Alright, I've decided.

400
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,810
Give up on the water.

401
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:01,660
Come on, that's gonna be rough. I'm already parched!

402
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,250
We can find a small pond somewhere.

403
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,770
That doesn't seem sanitary.

404
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,590
It should be fine if we boil it.

405
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:33,570
Team 8

406
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:33,570
Scharf — Third-Rank Mage

407
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:37,070
Team 8

408
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:37,070
Ehre — Second-Rank Mage

409
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,330
Team 8

410
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,330
Wirbel — Second-Rank Mage

411
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,330
What a pain. I shoot to kill, you know?

412
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,210
You managed to react to that, huh?

413
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:54,090
Oh well. Hand over the cage with the Stille.

414
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,840
And if we refuse?

415
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,350
Then there's no more need for words.

416
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,360
That came from the lake.

417
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,470
She froze the whole lake!

418
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,380
What's the big idea?

419
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,100
This is no laughing matter.

420
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,470
That mana was from Team Two.

421
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,620
What are they thinking?

422
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,000
Do they plan on making
enemies of every other team?

423
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,610
What are you doing?

424
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,700
Melt it! Quickly!

425
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,370
Denken, what should we do?

426
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:08,380
This is a waste of time and effort.

427
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:10,380
Team 13

428
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:10,380
Denken — Second-Rank Mage

429
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,380
There's no point in melting it.

430
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,880
Team 13

431
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,880
Richter — Second-Rank Mage

432
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,380
Now that they've used magic that flashy,
the Stille won't go near the lake anymore.

433
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,380
Team 13

434
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,380
Laufen — Third-Rank Mage

435
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,140
We'll steal the Stille from Team Two.

436
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:27,270
If they're making this much of a scene,
they must have a plan to catch one.

437
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:52,040
Lady Frieren, what are you trying to do?

438
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,220
Let's split up for now.

439
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:10,480
Hurry up and melt the frozen lake!

440
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,810
How foolish.

441
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:16,520
If they use that much magic to melt the ice,

442
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,550
the lake will become truly unusable.

443
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,950
The Stille won't come here again.

444
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,040
Let's go!

445
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,580
Yeah.

446
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,460
Over there.

447
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:31,460
Those who've noticed that seem
to be looking for other watering holes,

448
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,690
but their mana detection is lacking.

449
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:36,920
They won't be able to handle the threats of the skies.

450
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,960
They're naïve.

451
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,090
Team Two apparently froze the lake!

452
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,360
Are they trying to ruin the exam?

453
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,150
Ruin the exam?

454
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,640
They've got it wrong.

455
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,730
This is an elaborate plan that Team Two came up with.

456
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,230
There's nothing to be done about it
if we don't unravel their scheme.

457
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,260
They were done in by monsters.

458
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,020
They're already dead.

459
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,030
Let's go.

460
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:38,020
Gramps, let's at least get them down.

461
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,370
It's not like you don't see them, right?

462
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,400
They're circling above us.

463
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,910
And not just one or two, either.

464
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:50,020
They've cast magic on the corpses.

465
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,540
If we try to get them down, we'll be detected.

466
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:59,170
They're Geisel. That's how
they lure in and hunt their next prey.

467
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:04,550
That team completely fell for it, and was annihilated.

468
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,530
That's insane.

469
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:10,200
Why would they choose a place
with monsters like that for the exam?

470
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,270
It's like they don't even care if the examinees die.

471
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,390
This is your first time
taking the first-rank exam, isn't it?

472
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,370
There's an extremely simple reason.

473
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:24,900
They don't need anyone who
would die to this as a first-rank mage.

474
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,260
The Continental Magic Association

475
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,910
is particular about the caliber of first-rank mages.

476
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,190
There are people still dreaming

477
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:37,920
of the strong and proud mages from the era
of the war with the demon king's army.

478
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,160
How ridiculously behind the times.

479
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,950
That's surprising, Denken.

480
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,300
I thought you would support those ideals.

481
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,550
Mages don't need caliber.

482
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:54,650
First-rank should just be
a straightforward symbol of authority.

483
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:58,070
If a mage cannot win over the hearts of the people,

484
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:01,570
then no matter their skill,
they might as well be powerless.

485
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:06,920
I've seen countless mages
far more brilliant than myself

486
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,910
fall from power and be oppressed.

487
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:15,700
Great power is feared. And authority
gained through fear doesn't last long.

488
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:20,400
Besides, magic isn't proud
or noble or anything like that.

489
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,590
I see. So, you're just the right level of weak?

490
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,680
Big words, young boy.

491
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,400
Against you, I could win with my eyes closed.

492
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,720
We're not detecting Team Two at all.

493
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,930
They must be lying low and concealing their mana.

494
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:15,510
This place, too. Every watering hole we've seen.

495
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:21,270
They've been imbued with a tiny amount of mana.

496
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,630
I can't tell at all.

497
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,530
Can you?

498
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:30,400
No, me neither. Team Two's handiwork?

499
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,250
Even the person behind it probably can't sense it.

500
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,590
That's how minuscule it is.

501
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,040
But the Stille can sense it.

502
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,540
They won't come to this watering hole anymore.

503
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,040
What's the point...

504
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:49,050
Oh! There's a watering hole
without mana somewhere.

505
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,680
Team Two is guaranteed to be near that one.

506
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,780
How are we gonna find it?

507
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,740
I'm going to rest for a while.

508
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,110
Denken.

509
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,460
The exam area is vast.

510
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:07,820
There's no way we can find mages
who are seriously hiding themselves.

511
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,320
We'll wait.

512
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,820
They're going to tell us their location anyway.

513
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:18,830
I've imbued mana into all
the ponds and lakes I could find.

514
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,830
There's a chance there are some I missed, though.

515
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,590
Limiting the ones the Stille can use is plenty.

516
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:31,900
Well then, I'm going to lie in wait for the Stille here.

517
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,100
No way, I didn't think
it was possible to erase your mana.

518
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,210
It's not complete.

519
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:51,240
If I move, some mana
will leak out, no matter what. See?

520
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,490
I can't tell at all.

521
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,990
We'll be the look-outs.

522
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,970
Don't drag us down.

523
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,750
Shut up.

524
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,780
I'd be more useful if only we had some rain.

525
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,640
Yeah, the barrier's repelling all of it.

526
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,700
Frieren, did you get it?

527
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,700
It was worth picking a fight with the other teams.

528
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,450
We cleared the first-stage exam!

529
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,210
No.

530
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,210
Found them.

531
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,010
As expected, they finally used magic.

532
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:36,920
No matter how skilled they may be,
this is the one moment they can't cover up.

533
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,780
We've been detected.

534
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,970
We need to move...

535
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,560
before... it's too late.

536
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,810
Jubelade.

537
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,280
Dolagat.

538
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,910
It's like artillery.

539
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,040
She backed away again.

540
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:21,920
The way she fights is refined and leaves
no openings, but it's an old one.

541
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,430
I feel like I'm fighting my grandpa.

542
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,690
Standard offensive and defensive magic.

543
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:30,450
You're only using basic spells.

544
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:32,440
You don't intend to show your hand yet?

545
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:36,940
I've been instructed to only use
basic magic in combat.

546
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,820
So it's your master's policy.

547
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:44,570
Yes. She said this is sufficient for the modern age.

548
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,160
I see.

549
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:59,860
It's happening again. What is this weird feeling?

550
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,590
It's almost like I'm fighting a seasoned mage.

551
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,810
You've got it rough.

552
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:07,430
If you were facing Wirbel instead of me,

553
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:11,020
you'd already be dead with that kind of fighting style.

554
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,850
That doesn't make sense.

555
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:16,230
You're the strongest on your team, aren't you?

556
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:30,350
Wirbel has fought the remnants
of the demon king's army.

557
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,620
He's the captain of the Northern Mage Corps.

558
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,500
He has far more combat experience than me.

559
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:41,510
He uses utterly unscrupulous,
cowardly magic, and does whatever it takes to win.

560
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,510
The girl that's fighting him right now,

561
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,190
she's probably going to get killed.

562
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,060
Is that so?

563
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,170
And

564
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,170
I'm

565
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,170
al

566
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,170
right

567
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,240
I'll

568
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,240
be

569
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,240
al

570
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,240
right

571
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,050
Yeah,

572
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,050
