3
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:22,880
What is it?

4
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,930
I think you're really underhanded.

5
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,010
Frieren. Do you remember Basalt's last words?

6
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,640
No.

7
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,050
They only use words to trick people.

8
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,230
That's right.

9
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,480
They're merely monsters that can speak.

10
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,890
That's the true identity of what I call demons.

11
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,610
They're underhanded.

12
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:56,490
So we should be even more underhanded.

13
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,750
If it allows me to eradicate them,

14
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,070
I'll gladly embrace that dishonor.

Episode 10: A Powerful Mage

572
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,770
The bleeding won't stop.

573
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,960
This is it.

574
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,190
Your plan has failed you.

575
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,270
I suppose so.

576
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:58,280
But Frieren won't get out of this in one piece.

577
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,250
She should be fighting Lady Aura now.

578
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,250
Last time, the heroes' party forced our retreat.

579
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:11,420
But there are no heroes here to protect her this time.

580
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,390
Frieren is certainly a threat,

581
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,890
but her mana won't hold a candle to Lady Aura's.

582
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,920
Frieren is sure to lose in a head-on battle.

583
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,870
Then Lady Frieren will win.

584
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,400
She would never fight a demon head-on.

585
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,110
She will definitely kill Aura with deception.

586
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,170
Nonsense.

587
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,660
She's always—

588
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,910
Frieren the Elegy has always fought us head-on...

589
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,290
Wait... Something's wrong here.

590
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,040
This girl's meager mana.

591
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,920
I was overpowered by the
sheer number of her rapid spells.

592
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,560
How could she do such a thing
without running out of mana?

593
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,130
I see.

594
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,200
Such a tactic is...

595
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,310
Frieren is doing the same, isn't she?

596
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,850
You underhanded cowards.

597
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,650
You're a disgrace to all mages.

598
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:22,280
Lady Frieren understands
that better than anyone else.

599
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,310
What a horrible sight.

600
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,420
An elven village, huh?

601
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,590
Basalt the Throne.

602
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,190
A general of the demon king's army.

603
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,190
He must have come to wipe out
this village with his troops.

604
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,330
Miss at-death's-door there,
are you the one who killed him?

605
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,140
What an amazing amount of mana.

606
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,460
You're strong, aren't you?

607
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,360
Did you fight the demons head-on?

608
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,970
How ridiculous. And foolish.

609
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,700
What compels you to fight your enemies head-on?

610
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,220
You could run, hide, or ambush them.

611
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,730
There are plenty of better options.

612
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,730
I'll never get strong mages.

613
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,520
You should understand.

614
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,240
Huh?

615
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,860
You should understand my perspective.

616
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:50,000
You're a far more powerful mage, after all.

617
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,260
What makes you think that?

618
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,260
Just a hunch.

619
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,890
What's your name?

620
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,950
What happened to the village?

621
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,800
It was completely annihilated.
A massacre sparing no women or children.

622
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:25,850
I couldn't protect them.
Even though I was the strongest.

623
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,960
You really are a fool.

624
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,290
If I were you, I would have fled without question.

625
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:33,910
Let me down.

626
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,400
No.

627
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,950
You have talent. I'm making you my apprentice.

628
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,330
Besides, you should understand.

629
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,860
You would have died if I hadn't passed by.

630
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,660
You would have died without even
being able to protect your village.

631
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,700
You would have died in vain.

632
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,640
We're being followed.

633
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,640
They're stronger than the general you killed.

634
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,950
A fascinating bunch, aren't they?

635
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,920
They completely hid their mana,

636
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,460
fully intent on ambushing us,

637
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,920
but the moment they realized we were mages,
they proudly showed themselves.

638
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,630
They're underhanded and cunning,

639
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:29,640
but at the same time, they all have
this ridiculous pride in their magic.

640
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,890
Human mage, leave the elven girl behind.

641
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,020
You'll let me live if I do that?

642
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,680
"Wipe out the elves."

643
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,030
Those were the orders
of His Majesty the Demon King.

644
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:46,030
Your life matters not.

645
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,770
Is that so?

646
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:58,320
Frieren. It's true; I do understand,
painfully well, the perspective of strong mages.

647
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,290
I also know exactly what these demons are thinking.

648
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:08,180
I understand their trust and confidence
in the magic they've developed.

649
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,930
As well as the stupid arrogance
and carelessness that comes with it.

650
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,950
Frieren, unlike you, it seems
those demons judged me to be a weakling.

651
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:37,260
They were far superior mages,

652
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,280
but their overconfidence cost them their lives.

653
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,250
You restricted the mana leaving your body,

654
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,210
making them underestimate your strength.

655
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,840
That's right.

656
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,390
I deceive and kill them by making
them misjudge how much mana I have.

657
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:58,480
It's an underhanded and appalling way of fighting
that makes a mockery of the proud art of magic.

658
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,700
Looks like you've mostly recovered.

659
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,750
Let's get your training started.

660
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,500
Flamme.

661
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,000
"Master."

662
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:33,590
Demons took everything from me.

663
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,750
Me too.

664
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,880
I hate them so much, I want to rid the world of them.

665
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,640
I do too.

666
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,900
But I love magic.

667
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,150
I love it too.

668
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,940
That's why no one but us should need
to make such an underhanded mockery of magic.

669
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,090
What kind of training am I supposed to do?

670
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:02,540
Try limiting the mana you release
to less than a tenth of your current amount.

671
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,850
Good job, you're regulating it well.

672
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,100
All elves can do this much.

673
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:17,550
Now, while you're doing that, let's raise
your mana capacity by training your fundamentals.

674
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,170
That's it?

675
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,480
Simple, isn't it?

676
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:26,660
By the way, how long do I need to
maintain this mana regulation?

677
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,330
It's exhausting to do for too long.

678
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,060
About the same as me.

679
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,450
Your entire life.

680
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,950
Devote your entire life to deceiving demons.

681
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,690
Lügner has died.

682
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,220
That was the last of your executioners.

683
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,380
Your plan has failed, Aura.

684
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,210
Indeed, that's a shame.

685
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,890
But, if I can eliminate you here,
it'll still be an ample success.

686
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:05,980
You've freed many undead
soldiers from my control in this fight.

687
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,980
Will you be okay expending
so much mana in my presence?

688
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,770
The Scales of Submission.

689
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:19,400
She puts her and her opponent's souls on the scale,

690
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,750
and the one with more mana
gets to force the other into submission.

691
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:29,150
She can only wield such risky magic
because of her massive mana pool.

692
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:34,510
In principle, mana grows in proportion
to the training one goes through.

693
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,960
Her brimming mana tells me all I need to know.

694
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,620
Aura is a Great Demon
who's lived for over 500 years.

695
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,020
She's spent most of her life training her magic.

696
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,920
500 years, huh?

697
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,350
That's pretty long, even among demons.

698
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,650
She's probably never met an equal.

699
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:01,150
You can deduce so much just from
the mana emanating from someone.

700
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:05,910
And yet, demons do not
hide their mana—Nor could they.

701
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,540
Pitiful.

702
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,550
Aselyse.

703
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,550
Master.

704
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,680
Demons are cunning, right?

705
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,850
So why don't they regulate their mana like you do?

706
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,440
They can't.

707
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,560
Demons are individualistic,

708
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,950
but they do have the bare minimum
of organization to fight humanity.

709
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,820
What do you think an organization needs?

710
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,620
Order?

711
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,450
That's right.

712
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:50,330
In other words, you need someone
important to lead the others.

713
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,450
For humans,

714
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:57,620
in this country, for example,
importance is determined by status and wealth.

715
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,280
That well-dressed guy who
just came out of the palace is important.

716
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,350
It's hard to tell how important a human is.

717
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:09,550
That's why they dress up like that,
so you can tell by looking at them.

718
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,600
And demons are different?

719
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,600
They haven't changed since they were monsters.

720
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,590
The strong are important.

721
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,740
It's much easier to tell than with humans.

722
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,240
You can tell strength by looking.

723
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,990
It's about mana.

724
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:30,110
Mana is to them what
status and wealth are to humans.

725
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,500
You could say it's a matter of dignity to them.

726
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:38,250
They may temporarily restrict it for stealth,

727
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,630
but no one's stupid enough to do it all the time.

728
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:46,760
It's like the difference between
a noble sneaking into a town,

729
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,390
or giving up their status and wealth
to live as a commoner.

730
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:59,650
And the world of demons is not so easy
that those with little mana get any dignity.

731
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:04,660
That's why the stronger demons are, the more they assert their mana.

732
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:10,160
There's no benefit to them
in constantly regulating their mana.

733
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,920
The idea wouldn't even occur to them.

734
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,140
They're pitiful, aren't they?

735
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:20,670
Like humans are bound to status and wealth,
demons are bound to mana.

736
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:25,580
They're extremely proud of their magic,
and they love magic more than anyone else.

737
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,370
Yet, they can't wield their mana freely.

738
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:32,980
It's a good thing that you're
not a demon, isn't it, Frieren?

739
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,190
Yeah. Otherwise I couldn't deceive them.

740
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,070
It's been three years since you started limiting your mana.

741
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,500
My expectations of you weren't misplaced.

742
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,680
You've gotten the hang of it well.

743
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,000
Frieren, do you still love magic?

744
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,590
That's out of the blue.

745
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,640
Moderately.

746
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:11,890
Long ago, you said in no
uncertain terms that you loved it.

747
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,390
That was only fifty years ago.

748
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,150
I suppose so.

749
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:24,250
In the end, I only taught you about battle.

750
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,520
About magic for revenge.

751
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,410
Do you regret that?

752
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:35,540
No, I'm glad I entrusted my magic to you.

753
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:42,050
With your long life, you may one day reach
such heights as to defeat the demon king.

754
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,610
Frieren, I have a request.

755
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,400
What is it?

756
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,480
Please plant a field of flowers around my grave.

757
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,110
That's not like you.

758
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,520
I suppose not.

759
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:05,400
Frieren. My favorite magic
creates a beautiful field of flowers.

760
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,520
My parents taught it to me when I was young.

761
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,080
It's the reason I came to love magic.

762
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,170
Then teach it to me.

763
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,500
Remember this, Frieren.

764
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,430
Don't try to leave your mark on history.

765
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,810
Live inconspicuously.

766
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:39,780
You'll leave your mark on history
when you slaughter the demon king.

767
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:43,710
We heard there was a long-lived mage in this forest.

768
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,590
Would that be you?

769
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:50,620
I may be long-lived, but I've
just been dallying my time away.

770
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,720
I'm not that remarkable.

771
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,220
What do you think, Heiter?

772
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,850
She has about a fifth of my mana.

773
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,330
A mediocre amount.

774
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,110
Just what are you going on about, boy?

775
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,090
Go home. You have no business
with a mediocre mage, do you?

776
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:15,240
No, you're stronger than any other mage I've met.

777
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,240
What makes you think that?

778
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,250
Just a hunch.

779
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,460
Aselyse.

780
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,860
You look happy, Aura.

781
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,110
You're sure of your victory?

782
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,110
We'll find out in a moment.

783
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,870
Frieren the Elegy.

784
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,830
She first gained fame about eighty years ago,

785
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,700
when she killed His Majesty
together with the heroes' party.

786
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,340
A mysterious elven mage of unknown age.

787
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:15,620
But it doesn't matter how long-lived a mage you are.

788
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,350
Your mana tells me everything.

789
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,890
I can tell exactly what kind of mage you are.

790
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:27,860
You're a remarkable mage,
but you don't have that much mana.

791
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:32,230
You can't have trained for more
than a total of about a hundred years.

792
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:35,650
What's more, it's not much
different than eighty years ago.

793
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,330
You must have been working
on something other than your mana,

794
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:42,080
or maybe you were just dallying your time away.

795
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:47,580
Either way, you don't hold a candle to me.

796
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,840
I win.

797
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:06,350
Now, I'll give you the honor
of my personal beheading.

798
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:15,250
Looks like I needn't have made her deplete her mana.

799
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,430
I was a bit too cautious.

800
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:21,050
She dealt quite some damage to my undead army,

801
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,880
I'll have to replenish it later.

802
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,500
What's going on?

803
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,750
The scales are tilting towards Frieren.

804
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,630
You've put my soul on your scales, Aura.

805
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:42,080
I would have honestly been in trouble
if you had continued rushing your army on me.

806
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,640
I'm glad you were so confident in your mana.

807
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:48,190
I can finally defeat you.

808
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,520
What do you mean?

809
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,020
I'm sure you've realized.

810
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:56,030
I've been restricting my mana.

811
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:59,610
You misjudged me, Aura.

812
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,420
That can't be.

813
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,160
I would never miss such a thing.

814
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:12,290
Your mana is missing the characteristic
unsteadiness, the telltale slight fluctuations.

815
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,320
I'm surprised.

816
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,990
Demons can perceive mana in such detail?

817
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,550
Master's approach was right.

818
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:27,290
I've spent most of my life regulating my mana.

819
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:29,630
So much so that this state has become natural to me.

820
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:35,070
That's stupid. Why would you
do such an absurd thing?

821
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,990
Yeah, it's pretty stupid.

822
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,700
But it lets me beat demons.

823
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,950
That's some bullshit.

824
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,200
I'm a Great Demon who's lived for over 500 years.

825
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,560
Aura.

826
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,380
Standing before you...

827
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,630
is a mage who's lived for over a thousand years.

828
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,520
Frieren.

829
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,280
Like demons deceive humans with their words,

830
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:23,030
you will deceive them with your mana.

831
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,030
Aura.

832
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,530
End your life.

833
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,300
This can't be happening...

834
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,140
