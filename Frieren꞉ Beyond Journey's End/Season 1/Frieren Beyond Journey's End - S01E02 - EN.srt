march

557
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:38,750
Let's see, long-range magic combines
the three most essential qualities of a mage.

558
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,060
The amount of mana you possess,

559
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,240
how strongly you can manifest that mana,

560
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,330
and how well you can control it.

561
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,390
You know that much, right?

562
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,130
Yes.

563
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,030
When your magic dissipated
partway through earlier,

564
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,760
that indicated a lack of mana
and manifestation strength.

565
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,390
That's not something you can fix overnight.

566
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:03,550
It's something you'll have to work on
for years, regardless of talent.

567
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,290
That said, your control over mana is very good.

568
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,630
That's what most people struggle with,

569
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,120
but it looks like you won't have to worry about that.

570
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,670
You'll just have to be patient.

571
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,980
I understand.

572
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,820
How is Fern's training going?

573
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,190
She's made more progress in four years
than a normal person would in ten.

574
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,820
She's a workaholic. It's not good.

575
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,320
She's been spending all
her time in the forest, after all.

576
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,060
She must really like magic.

577
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,960
That said, she's still some time away
from being a full-fledged mage.

578
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,260
I'll be done deciphering the grimoire before then.

579
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,970
Is that so?

580
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,970
Hey, Heiter?

581
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,010
This grimoire is probably—

582
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,690
Heiter?

583
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,450
Don't make that face.

584
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,910
It's a miracle that I've kept my mobility this long.

585
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,830
I'll hurry up deciphering the grimoire.

586
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,670
Please do.

587
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,550
Fern. Put your training on hold.

588
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,260
Heiter collapsed. You should stay by his side.

589
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,060
I still haven't shot through the rock.

590
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,310
You'll be able to do that eventually.

591
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,080
For now—

592
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,820
Eventually isn't good enough.

593
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,570
Eventually, Sir Heiter is going to die.

594
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,090
Sir Heiter saved my life.

595
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,490
I think dying now would be a waste.

596
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,470
A waste?

597
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:31,480
Quite some time ago, I lost an old friend, you see.

598
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:35,100
Unlike me, he was incredibly straightforward,

599
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,360
and would never abandon someone in trouble.

600
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,050
If he were alive instead of me,

601
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,490
I'm sure he would have saved many people.

602
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:53,380
I'm not like him, so I intended
to spend the rest of my life comfortably.

603
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,710
But one day, I realized something.

604
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,770
If I died now,

605
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:03,470
then all the things about courage,
will, and friendship I learned from him,

606
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:09,130
and many more important memories,
would be lost from this world.

607
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,940
If you have important memories like that,

608
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,490
then I think dying would be a waste.

609
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,120
Sir Heiter has always been worried
about leaving me behind when he died.

610
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,980
He did the right thing.

611
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,250
I don't want him to regret saving me.

612
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,260
Be it becoming a mage, or something else,

613
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:42,010
obtaining the means to support myself
is my way of repaying him.

614
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,390
I want him to be glad he saved me,
and to know I'm going to be alright.

615
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,300
You remember everything I taught you, right?

616
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,050
Yes.

617
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,520
Then do as you wish.

618
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,500
There was nothing about magic
that revives the dead or bestows immortality.

619
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,150
I see.

620
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,260
You knew?

621
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,430
Humans' fear of death is beyond comprehension.

622
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:14,140
If such a spell existed,
Ewig would have used it himself.

623
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,660
Then, why?

624
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,780
How is Fern doing?

625
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,860
She's still unpolished,

626
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,480
but she could hold her own as a full-fledged mage.

627
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,610
Is that so? Then she made it in time.

628
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,990
She won't be a burden anymore, will she, Frieren?

629
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:40,500
Please take her on your journey.

630
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,500
Sorry, Heiter. That's the one request I can't grant.

631
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,260
She'd be in the way.

632
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,980
You set me up.

633
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:55,770
I've left payment for your
deciphering work in the desk drawer.

634
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,860
Please set off tonight.

635
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,770
What do you mean?

636
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,400
As you can see, I don't have long left.

637
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:12,820
I don't want her to experience
any more loss than she already has.

638
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,790
Frieren. Take care of her for me.

639
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,790
You're going to try and show off again, Heiter?

640
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,760
Fern has long since prepared herself to say goodbye.

641
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,380
While you still have time left,

642
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,050
you should be saying your goodbyes properly,

643
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,680
and making as many memories with her as you can.

644
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:47,120
Frieren. You're a very kind girl.

645
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,700
Say, why did you save Fern?

646
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:19,730
It's what Himmel the Hero would have done.

647
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,100
That's true.

648
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,520
Then I suppose I'll do the same.

649
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,760
Thank you very much.

650
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,820
I was able to repay Sir Heiter thanks to you.

651
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,940
He just set me up, that's all.

652
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,230
What a sorry excuse for a priest.

653
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,220
Well then, let's go.

654
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,990
Episode 2: It Didn't Have to Be Magic...

655
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:32,170
26 years after the death

656
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:32,170
of Himmel the Hero

657
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:32,170
Central Lands,

658
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:32,170
Tag Region

659
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,050
That's enough, Fern.

660
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,380
We're done.

661
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,310
You're a life-saver.

662
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:46,310
Here's your promised reward.

663
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,310
All our work is pretty mundane, isn't it?

664
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,320
That's just life as an adventurer.

665
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,820
What was the reward?

666
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,910
Folk magic. It produces warm tea, apparently.

667
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,280
Let's experiment later.

668
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:05,370
Last time it was a spell that
cleans the rust off bronze statues.

669
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,630
And before that, magic that
turns sweet grapes into sour ones.

670
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,250
How is it?

671
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,630
Sour.

672
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,670
You're collecting a lot of weird magic.

673
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,010
It's my hobby, after all.

674
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:19,550
You really like magic, don't you, Lady Frieren?

675
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:22,260
Somewhat. Just like you.

676
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:25,520
I get the feeling it's not the same.

677
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,520
It is.

678
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,400
Are you really okay with taking on my request?

679
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,610
I'm just an herbalist,

680
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:38,400
so I won't have any magic for you.

681
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:43,830
It's fine. It'd be plenty helpful if you
would tell us about the flora in this region.

682
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,420
Here we are.

683
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,670
A statue of Himmel the Hero?

684
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,800
It's in an awful state, isn't it?

685
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,550
At my age, I can't keep up with it by myself.

686
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,520
The villagers don't care anymore.

687
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,060
Run! Run!

688
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:36,960
Sir Himmel fought with all his might
when the village was attacked by demons.

689
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,510
It saddens me to see it treated like this.

690
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:47,220
No, it's his own fault for being an attention seeker.

691
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:52,230
He should have declined when
the villagers offered to make a statue.

692
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:54,730
Is this pose good?

693
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,690
It isn't too dashing, right?

694
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,780
Just decide already.

695
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,490
He spent eighteen hours deciding on the pose
and made the sculptor lose his temper.

696
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,530
I'm hungry.

697
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,410
And in the end, he chose this stupidly orthodox one.

698
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,370
You say some strange things.

699
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,880
Come to think of it, there was an elven mage
in the heroes' party, wasn't there?

700
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,750
Well then, let's get this cleaned up.

701
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,260
I appreciate it.

702
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,100
Magic is quite amazing.

703
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,520
There's not a speck of rust left.

704
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,520
It would be nice to have some more color, though.

705
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,900
Maybe I'll plant some flowers later.

706
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,490
Lady Frieren, you're able to use magic
that creates a field of flowers, right?

707
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,860
Yeah. Some random flower will...

708
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:51,370
No, I suppose blue-moon flowers would be good.

709
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:54,000
What kind of flower is that?

710
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,460
I don't know. I've never seen any.

711
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,500
Then why?

712
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,130
They're from Himmel's homeland.

713
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,300
But if you've never seen them,
making them with magic is...

714
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,770
Blue-moon flowers.

715
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,230
What a nostalgic name.

716
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:21,820
There used to be a field in the depths of that forest.

717
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,660
They don't grow around here anymore?

718
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,580
They went extinct.

719
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:37,170
There haven't been any sightings
on this continent for decades.

720
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,330
I see.

721
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,800
Fern. Let's go.

722
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,800
Yes.

723
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,060
You hid something, didn't you?

724
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,640
I won't be mad, so show me.

725
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,610
They're seed rats, vermin that eat seeds.

726
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,280
I'll return them to the forest.

727
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:12,030
Alright, Fern, let's go search for blue-moon flowers.

728
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,160
Are you serious?

729
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,410
There was a field in this forest not too long—

730
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,000
Decades ago.

731
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,250
But they're worth searching for.

732
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,590
If we can find and analyze a sample,

733
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:28,090
we'll be able to use magic
to create a whole field of them.

734
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,590
Is this for Sir Himmel?

735
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,100
No.

736
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,770
I think this is for myself.

737
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:33,320
Lady Frieren, we've already spent
half the year looking for blue-moon flowers.

738
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,580
You're right, I suppose it's time to widen our search.

739
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:50,840
Oh, it's rare for you to come by yourself.

740
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,760
It's been quite a while since you came to this village.

741
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,600
Have you found any blue-moon flowers?

742
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,100
Do you think we will?

743
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:08,730
Lady Frieren has an abnormal attachment to magic.

744
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,240
At this rate, she'll continue searching
for years, or even decades.

745
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:19,160
Lady Frieren is a mage
capable of saving many people.

746
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:25,750
She shouldn't be wasting her time
on something that doesn't even exist.

747
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,590
Ah, so young.

748
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:33,510
Am I wrong?

749
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,840
I don't think you're wrong.

750
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:41,810
But I imagine it's different for Ms. Frieren.

751
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:49,570
She's much more of an adult
than either of us, though,

752
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,860
so if you tell her your genuine feelings,

753
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,990
I'm sure she'll understand.

754
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:16,840
These are seeds of a related species
that were stored for their medicinal value.

755
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,430
How about planting these around the statue instead?

756
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,850
Alright, fine.

757
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,350
Looks like I made you worry.

758
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:32,610
It's not like it's just my time.

759
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:33,990
We've done enough.

760
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,990
I'll call it off after a little longer.

761
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,120
How many years is a little longer?

762
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,120
It's just a bit more.

763
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,460
You really never know when to give—

764
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,680
Let's try following it.

765
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:35,210
Why are you collecting magic, Lady Frieren?

766
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,380
It's just a hobby.

767
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,380
It doesn't look like that to me.

768
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,390
It's really just a hobby.

769
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:45,720
I used to live dallying listlessly about.

770
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,420
Good grief.

771
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:24,800
There was an idiot who praised my collection.

772
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,560
That is all.

773
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,350
That's a silly reason.

774
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,690
That it is.

775
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,540
That's...

776
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,340
A petal.

777
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:03,340
It's said that seed rats bury
their food in places without predators.

778
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,890
So they're pretty smart animals.

779
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:08,140
Not really.

780
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,140
They bury their food in so many places that they
often end up forgetting where their stashes are.

781
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,900
Blue-moon flowers?

782
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:23,410
They're very beautiful flowers from my homeland.

783
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,910
Not as beautiful as me, though.

784
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,410
Let's get going.

785
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,410
Frieren.

786
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,620
I want to show them to you one day.

787
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,670
Okay.

788
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,170
If there's an opportunity.

789
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:49,760
I thought there'd be some,
but I didn't expect this many.

790
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,060
Sorry for the delay, Himmel.

791
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,950
I didn't think you'd actually find them.

792
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:08,160
Now we can create magic for blue-moon flowers.

793
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:11,950
Why do you work so hard for magic?

794
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,710
I don't understand.

795
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,960
You should get it.

796
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:19,960
You didn't give up on becoming a mage, after all.

797
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,510
That's different.

798
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:28,220
As long as I gained the ability
to support myself, I didn't care what it was.

799
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,220
It didn't have to be magic...

800
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:35,230
Yet you chose magic.

801
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:48,910
I suppose I did.

802
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:55,790
I didn't think I would ever
see blue-moon flowers again.

803
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,830
They really are beautiful.

804
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,090
Thank you, Ms. Frieren.

805
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:05,720
