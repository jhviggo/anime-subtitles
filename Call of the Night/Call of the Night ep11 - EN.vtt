00:07.460 --> 00:09.130

00:10.130 --> 00:11.130
Nice, right?

00:11.130 --> 00:12.130
Wow...

00:12.130 --> 00:13.130
Wow!

00:13.380 --> 00:14.500
Wow!

00:15.170 --> 00:16.380
What's with these?

00:16.380 --> 00:18.790
There's something I realized working as a maid.

00:19.920 --> 00:22.670
Money is so awesome...

00:22.790 --> 00:27.290
So you're going to up the quality of the cuddle buddy
business to make it more profitable?

00:27.500 --> 00:30.040
So yeah, time to find customers!

00:31.210 --> 00:36.670
<i>If I find someone who looks like they're super tired,
I should try talking to them, huh?</i>

00:37.290 --> 00:39.750
<i>Is it okay talking to them out of the blue?</i>

00:40.080 --> 00:42.290
<i>I don't want them to think I'm hitting on them...</i>

00:56.210 --> 00:58.210

01:01.420 --> 01:03.670
What, do you want something from me?

01:03.670 --> 01:05.830
Uh! Well, um...

01:05.830 --> 01:08.670
I-I just thought you looked tired...

01:08.670 --> 01:13.000
If you have some time, I was wondering
if you might want to chat for a bit...

01:17.790 --> 01:20.380

Um, I'm soliciting customers for

03:29.880 --> 03:32.750
I've been looking around for people
who look sleep deprived.

03:33.420 --> 03:34.630

03:35.000 --> 03:39.130
Then it's THAT kind of proposal.
Why didn't you just say so?

03:39.130 --> 03:40.330
N-no, no, no!

03:40.330 --> 03:41.330
Ow!

03:41.330 --> 03:42.710
It really isn't!

03:42.710 --> 03:44.130
I just help out!

03:44.130 --> 03:45.960
The one who does the cuddling is the owner, Naz-

03:45.960 --> 03:47.170
A girl!

03:47.170 --> 03:48.670
It isn't sketchy at all!

03:48.670 --> 03:50.170
<i>Okay, it's a little sketchy, but...</i>

03:52.380 --> 03:54.960
<i>Huh, you help out?</i>

03:55.540 --> 03:56.920
So it's a part-time job?

03:56.920 --> 03:58.710
Yes, pretty much.

"An employer shall not employ a person under
18 full years of age between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m."

04:12.880 --> 04:14.460
You understand what that means, right?

04:14.670 --> 04:19.170
If I report that business to the proper authorities...

04:25.880 --> 04:27.880
Just kidding!

04:27.880 --> 04:29.210
Did I freak you out?

04:32.040 --> 04:35.540
I don't make my decisions based on law.

04:35.830 --> 04:40.080
I don't intend to turn you in,
nor do I have the right to do that.

04:41.210 --> 04:43.710
You must have some special reason for it.

04:44.170 --> 04:47.210
Learn from this and be more careful next time.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.540
Thank you.

04:50.710 --> 04:52.210
Hey, don't.

04:52.210 --> 04:54.630
I'm just encouraging misconduct.

04:55.250 --> 04:57.750
As for the cuddling, you'll have to find someone else.

04:58.080 --> 05:00.080
When I sleep, I like to sleep alone.

05:00.580 --> 05:01.790

05:02.170 --> 05:05.330
Well, we have a massage option as well,
so if you ever change your mind...

05:05.330 --> 05:07.710
Oh, that I'm interested in.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.630
I figure Conan-kun takes care of that kind of stuff.

Jeez, how does that just happen?!

07:18.710 --> 07:21.290
That's it, I'm not doing anything until I get some booze!

07:22.130 --> 07:23.920
I thought you might say that.

07:24.790 --> 07:26.420

We're gonna sneak in and have fun, of course.

09:08.710 --> 09:12.000
We just happened to stay in touch like this,

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
but if the timing didn't work out,
we may have never gotten to meet up again.

09:16.670 --> 09:18.330
That would be a shame, you know?

10:03.830 --> 10:04.880
Why?

10:04.880 --> 10:06.790
Verifying the seven mysteries!

10:07.040 --> 10:09.210
That's the embodiment of the adolescent experience!

10:09.210 --> 10:11.830
We need to reclaim our adolescence!

10:12.000 --> 10:14.170

They say that sometimes,
that teacher appears in a classroom at night.

11:53.290 --> 11:54.290
Why?

11:54.290 --> 11:55.580
What?! That's all?!

11:55.580 --> 11:58.040
Isn't that really scary?!
Scary and exciting?!

11:58.040 --> 12:00.170
Isn't it cool that it's specific to our school?!

12:00.170 --> 12:02.880
It just feels kind of contrived.

12:02.880 --> 12:04.080
Yeah.

12:04.250 --> 12:05.500
Come on!

12:05.500 --> 12:07.580
You could say that about any seven mystery legend!

12:08.790 --> 12:13.250
Well, the fact that it's half based in reality
makes it more dubious, I guess.

12:13.250 --> 12:15.580
Jeez, don't say that!

12:15.960 --> 12:18.500
We're already here.
Let's at least see it through to the end!

12:18.500 --> 12:19.500
Yah!

12:28.330 --> 12:31.170
Why are there students here at this hour?

12:33.630 --> 12:35.210
You shouldn't be here.

12:35.920 --> 12:37.880
The night is dangerous...

12:41.040 --> 12:43.170
It's your fault for coming.

12:44.330 --> 12:46.210
I was restraining myself.

12:47.670 --> 12:49.830
Today was my last day...

12:51.630 --> 12:53.250
but you...

12:57.000 --> 12:59.750
I think I want the girl.

13:03.920 --> 13:05.130
Akira!

13:07.710 --> 13:08.920
Wh-what?!

13:09.130 --> 13:10.540
No! What is this?!

13:11.380 --> 13:12.710
What the hell, old man!

13:13.000 --> 13:14.380
Get away from her!

13:14.380 --> 13:16.250
Ko! You help too!

13:16.670 --> 13:18.790
<i>What? What is this?</i>

13:20.710 --> 13:21.540
<i>I know this kind of thing...</i>

13:21.540 --> 13:22.750
Ko!
<i>I know this kind of thing...</i><b></b>

13:23.250 --> 13:24.290
<i>It's familiar somehow.</i>

13:24.290 --> 13:25.290
Ko!
<i>It's familiar somehow.</i><b></b>

13:25.540 --> 13:27.420
It was supposed to end today.

13:27.830 --> 13:29.290
Everything, today...

13:29.710 --> 13:32.210
I've restrained myself for so, so long.

13:32.830 --> 13:34.080
So why...

13:34.920 --> 13:36.130
Why?

13:36.380 --> 13:37.580
<i>Why...</i>

13:37.580 --> 13:38.960
Why are there students here at this hour?!

13:38.960 --> 13:41.330
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Why are there students here at this hour?!<b></b>

13:41.540 --> 13:42.380
Ko!

13:42.380 --> 13:43.580
<i>Why...</i>

13:44.040 --> 13:46.830
<i>Why is there a vampire here?</i>

13:53.380 --> 13:54.580
Akira!

13:55.880 --> 13:57.080
You okay?!

13:57.630 --> 14:00.330
Th...thanks...

14:01.170 --> 14:02.380
Can you stand?

14:07.830 --> 14:09.080
<i>What's going on?</i>

14:09.460 --> 14:11.500
<i>He's definitely a vampire.</i>

14:12.250 --> 14:13.630
<i>Somehow, I can tell.</i>

14:14.330 --> 14:16.630
<i>But something's different.</i>

14:17.290 --> 14:21.920
<i>Vampires are all pretty and slick.</i>

14:22.670 --> 14:24.960
<i>So why is this person so unkempt?</i>

14:25.630 --> 14:27.540
<i>Why does he seem so distressed?</i>

14:28.630 --> 14:30.290
<i>Who is he?</i>

14:31.750 --> 14:32.960
Why?

14:33.540 --> 14:35.250
At this hour...

14:35.670 --> 14:38.330
Hurry, get away...

14:39.170 --> 14:42.000
Hurry, hurry...

14:42.000 --> 14:43.880
B-before I lose it!

14:47.790 --> 14:52.420
I was on a different trail, but I guess I hit the jackpot.

14:53.500 --> 14:56.710
Really, rumors are quite curious.

14:57.210 --> 15:01.880
You think it's smoke with no fire,
but turns out, it's not that wild after all.

15:02.830 --> 15:05.460
No, that analogy isn't very clear.

15:13.790 --> 15:15.130
Hey, there.

15:15.130 --> 15:17.750
We meet again, Yamori-kun.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.540
Why are you here?

15:23.580 --> 15:28.330
From my perspective,
I'm curious to know why you're here, Yamori-kun.

15:28.330 --> 15:30.790
Why? Why?

15:30.790 --> 15:33.710
I didn't want to run into anyone!

15:33.710 --> 15:35.670
I managed until today...

15:37.420 --> 15:38.630
Blood!

15:38.920 --> 15:42.000
I can't hold back anymore!

15:42.290 --> 15:45.170
Do you have a problem with women who smoke?

15:50.000 --> 15:51.210
Ms. Detective!

16:00.000 --> 16:01.210
Go ahead.

16:17.130 --> 16:18.580
There we go.

16:21.420 --> 16:22.420
Okay...

16:22.670 --> 16:24.710
You middle school kids there!

16:25.500 --> 16:29.830
Do you know what a vampire is?

16:33.170 --> 16:34.830
What's with this taste?!

16:34.830 --> 16:36.500
Is it supposed to be this bad?!

16:37.750 --> 16:39.670
Oh, I see.

16:39.920 --> 16:41.130
That's a surprise.

16:41.750 --> 16:46.750
My investigation didn't turn up any leads on you
so I suspected as much,

16:46.750 --> 16:48.790
but hearing that, I'm sure of it now.

16:49.290 --> 16:51.920
These past ten years since you became a vampire,

16:51.920 --> 16:55.210
you've never once eaten properly.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.000
But that's doesn't make sense.

16:59.290 --> 17:01.380
He tried to suck Akira's blood just now.

17:01.790 --> 17:02.790
Why?

17:02.790 --> 17:04.330
But it makes perfect sense.

17:04.790 --> 17:10.960
He restrained himself for ten loooong years,
and today was probably his breaking point.

17:10.960 --> 17:13.170
It's your fault for appearing on the scene.

17:13.790 --> 17:16.210
Then why didn't he drink any blood in the first place?

17:16.210 --> 17:17.420
What was the point?

17:18.420 --> 17:22.000
Yamori-kun, you should think a bit before you talk.

17:22.580 --> 17:26.250
Why would anyone want to become a vampire?

17:27.380 --> 17:28.380
Huh?

17:29.250 --> 17:30.580
Isn't that right?

17:30.580 --> 17:33.830
You didn't know, did you?
About vampires?

17:34.330 --> 17:35.750
That they exist?

17:37.170 --> 17:41.420
That's right, I was tricked!

17:41.790 --> 17:44.710
It's okay, you must have had a rough time.

17:45.290 --> 17:46.580
I know.

17:49.580 --> 17:51.000
You poor man...

17:51.380 --> 17:53.750
Has it been long since you've talked with anyone else?

17:55.250 --> 17:56.460
I...

17:56.750 --> 18:01.040
I couldn't believe I was a vampire for the longest time,

18:01.040 --> 18:05.130
but then I'd find myself craving human blood!

18:05.750 --> 18:07.170
Of course.

18:07.830 --> 18:09.130
That's terrifying.

18:11.210 --> 18:12.830
It's unforgivable, isn't it?

18:12.830 --> 18:14.330
It is...

18:16.000 --> 18:18.170
That woman tricked me.

18:18.710 --> 18:23.500
But the fact that I fell in love with a woman like that...

18:25.040 --> 18:27.710
How foolish could I have been?

18:28.040 --> 18:29.290
I know.

18:30.130 --> 18:32.790
That emotion alone carried you this far, huh?

18:33.250 --> 18:35.250
Resisting the urge to suck blood...

18:36.250 --> 18:38.330
I'm so glad I found you today.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.210
What are you...

18:40.750 --> 18:41.960
So here...

18:42.330 --> 18:44.960
I'm going to...

18:47.330 --> 18:49.880
...let you die as a human being.

18:52.420 --> 18:53.630
Don't resist.

18:54.170 --> 18:55.380
Don't let go!

18:55.630 --> 18:56.960
Hold on tightly.

18:57.250 --> 19:00.000
Remember the human you used to be!

19:03.960 --> 19:05.210
You've had it so tough!

19:05.880 --> 19:07.750
No one to praise you...

19:08.830 --> 19:10.960
No one to recognize you...

19:15.880 --> 19:20.500
I alone will praise and recognize you.

19:23.380 --> 19:25.790
You can die as a human being.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.460
Here comes morning.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.170
Sleep well...

19:42.250 --> 19:43.880
He's dead.
Is he-<b></b>

19:44.460 --> 19:46.460
He died just now.

19:48.210 --> 19:53.670
The teacher who went missing ten years ago
died as a human being.

19:54.250 --> 19:57.170
Though he was supposed
to die naturally today anyway.

19:59.080 --> 20:02.330
My name is Anko Uguisu, private detective.

20:02.330 --> 20:06.670
My job is to investigate cases from clients
and report back to them.

20:07.080 --> 20:09.670
Looking for missing people isn't unusual.

20:09.670 --> 20:12.710
The cause can be related to vampires...

20:13.130 --> 20:16.000
Well, not that often, but it happens sometimes.

20:16.500 --> 20:21.130
And as such, I inevitably need to know
ways to deal with vampires.

20:21.580 --> 20:23.960
It's been pretty difficult.

20:23.960 --> 20:25.380
Why did you kill him?!
First-<b></b>

20:25.830 --> 20:27.290
I don't know what his deal was,

20:27.290 --> 20:30.540
but you said that vampire guy was
supposed to die today anyway, right?!

20:30.540 --> 20:31.170
Ko...

20:31.170 --> 20:33.380
Did you have to go and kill him yourself?!

20:33.380 --> 20:34.420
There must have been ways-

20:34.420 --> 20:36.540
Do you mean he should have lived life as a monster?

20:37.040 --> 20:40.000
He struggled all this time
not even knowing what he had become.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.330
You're going to disregard all that?

20:43.710 --> 20:47.210
Yamori-kun, you know nothing about vampires.

20:47.880 --> 20:51.920
I'm sorry, but I have no intention
of letting you achieve your idiotic dream.

20:55.380 --> 20:57.750
You had better watch out.

20:58.170 --> 21:01.170
You don't know it, but vampires come in all kinds.

21:01.540 --> 21:03.790
Let me give you two my card, too.

21:03.790 --> 21:06.500
If you ever question the situation you're in,

21:06.500 --> 21:08.460
come find me.

21:22.040 --> 21:25.670
<i>I still know nothing about vampires.</i>

21:29.500 --> 21:31.290
The call of the night

21:31.290 --> 21:33.380
Shine on me moonlight

21:33.380 --> 21:35.500
Eye caught by blue light

21:35.500 --> 21:37.790
The two-faced sides of neon lights

21:37.790 --> 21:39.580
The call of the night

21:39.580 --> 21:41.670
Take me away, midnight

21:41.670 --> 21:43.790
Bloodshot red eyes

21:43.790 --> 21:46.460
A lullaby for grownups

21:46.630 --> 21:48.750
Loved the nights since I was a kid

21:48.750 --> 21:50.920
I kinda hated going to bed at nine

21:50.920 --> 21:53.040
It just felt like a waste somehow

21:53.040 --> 21:55.040
I wanted to get to know you better

21:55.040 --> 21:55.880
Hey hey

21:55.880 --> 21:57.420
The early bird catches you know what

21:57.420 --> 22:00.380
I wanna see deeper, deeper, deeper

22:00.380 --> 22:01.580
Unravel in deep shades

22:01.580 --> 22:03.920
From 12 o'clock to 2 o'clock

22:03.920 --> 22:05.830
The first time I stepped over you

22:05.830 --> 22:08.580
No, the first I mounted you was at fourteen, I think

22:08.580 --> 22:10.210
Me, just an ignorant wannabe

22:10.210 --> 22:12.250
Led by the hand, everything was new

22:12.250 --> 22:14.290
Your physique and that scent

22:14.290 --> 22:16.500
That dark skin that fits well with the quiet

22:16.830 --> 22:19.670
I was drawn in, submissive to the beckoning

22:19.880 --> 22:22.500
Then you gave me music

22:22.500 --> 22:24.670
You showed me a woman's naked body

22:24.670 --> 22:26.670
Sipped on booze I'd never had

22:26.670 --> 22:28.830
Smoked my old man's butts

22:28.830 --> 22:30.460
Flooded with don't do's

22:30.460 --> 22:32.250
Smeared with shouldn't know's

22:32.920 --> 22:34.630
Under the screen of darkness, coming to get us

22:34.630 --> 22:36.380
You're always so capricious

22:36.380 --> 22:38.080
The call of the night

22:38.080 --> 22:40.170
Shine on me moonlight

22:40.170 --> 22:42.250
Eye caught by blue light

22:42.250 --> 22:44.630
The two-face sides of neon lights

22:44.630 --> 22:46.420
The call of the night

22:46.420 --> 22:48.460
Take me away, midnight

22:48.460 --> 22:50.540
Bloodshot red eyes

22:50.540 --> 22:53.380
A lullaby for grownups
