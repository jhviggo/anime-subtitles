00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.290
That day we were accomplices under the apple tree

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.540
We tried stepping over the line

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.630
Immediate black out

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.000
Oops, you're angry...

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.330
Chased away to this unfortunate dimension

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.750
I can't believe I...

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.040
Someone like me...

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.250
Of all people, I couldn't...

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.290
Wait, no way

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.500
I blamed you

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.710
Got hold of a secret

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.080
The fig leaves go right and left

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.540
In a blink of an eye I wake up

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.880
But then I'm falling toward the sky

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.130
I don't know, I just can't stop

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.040
Just one more bite

It's a drag when this starts happening.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.580
I was considering making him one of my offspring...

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.540
but honestly, I'm not feeling it anymore.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.290
'Course, I can just kill him if it gets too messy.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.080
Ya-mo-ri-kuuuun!

Wh-what the?!

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.380
Whoa...

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.580
Whoa, whoa...

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.380
Why?

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.630
You're dead.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.670
She's right, you know.
How could you?

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.080
She hasn't done anything to me yet!

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.830
Ko-kun, did she do anything to you?

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.210
I just wanted to protect you.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.670
I just said she didn't!

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.830
Thanks, though?!

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.460
Sorry, the truth is her face annoys me,
so my leg just acted up.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.040
The most important bit about
wanting to protect me vanished!

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.170
Don't worry, vampires are tough!

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.920
That wasn't nearly enough to break-

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.040
her!

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.040
Why, Nazuna you little...

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.170
It's a fight you want, huh?!

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.330
You know you're the one who started it!

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.000
Look, just hear me out.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.880
I really had no intention of hurting Yamori-kun, okay?

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.080
You've been guilty before.
It's your own fault if I got the wrong idea.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.040
Besides, why would you go near Ko-kun then?

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.880
I thought you said getting friendly with humans
when you aren't going to suck their blood isn't normal.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.000
That's right.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.170
I just wanted to mess with him a bit, that's all.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.920
See ya, then!

Uh, was that really all?

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.630
Didn't you want to talk about something?

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.380
You said before that things haven't been fun lately.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.380
I was lying, obviously.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.960
I just made up a likely problem to spark your interest.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.380
Really?

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.380
From what I remember,
you didn't look like you were lying.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.500
If I'm wrong, that's fine.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.420
But I figure even vampires can
have problems, you know?

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:18.710
Hey, wanna go sing karaoke?

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.670
So where's Nazuna?
She okay with this?

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.000
She was exasperated but said to do whatever.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.380
Well, so anyway, I'm like, crazy popular.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.750
That makes it sound like you have no problems at all.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.540
But honestly, that's been kind of a hassle lately.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.830
Like, it's a drag having to deal with those guys.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.880
Sorry, you wouldn't get it.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.000
I kind of get it.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.670
I get annoyed at people who think
romance is the essence of life.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.460
Yeah, right?

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.080
I guess that's why you're Nazuna's...

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.540
'Course, I can just kill them if it gets too messy.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.830
Th-that's pretty outrageous.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.630
'Kay! As long as we're here, we might as well sing!

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.540
You're gonna sing too, right?

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.540
Uh, sure.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.580
Let's cue up songs with some mad vibes.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.040
Dude, what?

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.040
Huh?

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.630
You don't even try to liven things up while I'm singing.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.250
You're just searching for songs?

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.710
At least chime in or something!

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:40.670
But how can I when I don't even know this song?

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.080
What, for real?!

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.670
But it's like THE song right now.

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.960
I haven't been watching TV lately,
so I don't really know.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.540
Jeeez! You brag about not watching TV?!

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.670
Not watching TV is worth bragging about?

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.920
Stop it with your uber innocent reactions!

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.080
Whatever, just cue something up already.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.880
Isn't it a drag having to choose a song
just to liven things up?

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.920
You haven't chosen a song yet, Seri-san?

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.210
Hold on, what was that song?!

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.670
Isn't it super old school?

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.540
It's one of those sentimental buzzkills.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.920
Well yeah, I think it's from
thirty years ago or something?

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.380
That's way before your time!

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.750
Why the heck do you like it?!

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.380
Wh-why not?

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.580
Who cares?

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:40.830
I just like it.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.710
Well, it is a good song.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.130
I'd only ever heard the chorus before.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:51.830
I never knew what the lyrics were like.

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.830
Hey, are there any other good songs by that group?

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.790
Sure there are, but aren't we going to take turns?

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.790
It's fine!
I wanna hear more.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.920
Whoa! Wh-what's that?!

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.330
Y-you think he has the wrong room?

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.000
Nah, sorry Yamori-kun.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.670
Remember what I said?
I'm crazy popular.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:17.540
Seri-chan...

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.080
Seri-chan?

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:23.630
That's freaky!

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.000
If you know him, can't you do something about it?!

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.670
Well, I really dunno what I could do.

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:32.920
It happens quite a lot.
Guys turn into mental psychos.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.710
I don't think you can say that these days.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.130
Guys who are complicated or insecure
are only cute in manga and stuff.

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.080
In real life, they're a total drag.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.580
Uh! Why are we still chatting?!

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.420
You can tell me about that later!

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.290
No, just let me say this!

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:50.790
There really have been a bunch of draggos lately.

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.040
"Draggos"?

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.130
Guys who are a drag - draggos.

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:58.960
Um, he's really banging on the door
and it's freaking me out!

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.500
What do we do if he comes in?!

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.830
Oh, don't worry.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.750
He doesn't have the guts to do that!

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:04.960
Watch this.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:06.830
Heyah!

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:14.670
Those types only care about getting attention,
so that's enough to placate them.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:16.960
I-I see...

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.790
Uh, this is the kind of thing
you've been having an issue with, right?

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.750
What you call "a hassle"?

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:29.460
What do you want to do about it, exactly?

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.630
What would make things better for you?

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:37.500
What the hell, man?

00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:40.580
Don't try to give me proper advice.

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.210
You'll enjoy hanging with Nazuna
but not with me?

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.170
Just laugh and brush it aside, that's all I want.

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.540
The solution's really simple.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.540
Huh?! Wh-what is it?

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:58.210
Like I said, I can just kill them if it gets too messy.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.210
Y-you can't do that!

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:02.460
Why not?

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.380
It's only natural for humans to get killed by vampires.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:07.920
Y-your kind is so arrogant!

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.130
Excuse me?

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.460
You lot are the arrogant ones.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.880
You don't actually give a damn when other people die,

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.750
but you denounce killing without even thinking.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.460
Can you really tell me why it's wrong?!

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.920
Human rules don't apply to us.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.830
No! That's not what I'm saying at all!

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.040
I never said you can't kill anyone!

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.460
I'm sure you have to sometimes, what do I know?!

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.670
But that guy isn't one of them!

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:35.540
He might be a hassle,
but if you talk it through I'm sure he'd-

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:36.750
Are you fighting?

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.710
W-were you arguing about me?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.210
...understand.

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:43.670
You were, huh?

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:48.790
<i>H-his eyes tell me he can't be reasoned with.</i>

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:52.250
See? It's a hassle when they get this way.

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:56.500
The easiest way is to kill him quickly,
and forget about it all!

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:58.920
Huh?

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.460
What? I don't get it.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:07.670
What just happened?!

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.710
Yamori-kun, wanna get outta the way?

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:10.710
No.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.040
You'll die, too.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:13.630
You think I care?

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:14.420
Mr. Draggo!

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:15.250
Dr-Draggo?
Mr. Draggo!<b></b>

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:15.790
Dr-Draggo?
We're gonna run for it!<b></b>

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:16.250
Wh-why?
We're gonna run for it!<b></b>

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:17.670
Wh-why?
Just run!<b></b>

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:18.920
O-okay!

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:30.000
She's not coming after us, I guess?

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:32.000
Um...

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.040
I don't get what's going on at all, but...

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.790
what are you, to Seri-chan?

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:39.580
Nothing.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.880
As if I'd believe that!

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.540
Then what are you to Seri-san?

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:47.960
I...

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:51.960
I wonder what Seri-chan thinks of me?

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.330
<i>Huh?</i>

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.630
<i>This isn't quite what I expected.</i>

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.630
<i>He's just plain insecure now.</i>

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:03.750
What am I?

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:07.130
<i>But still, the thing that
changed him this much must be...</i>

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.210
Hey!

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.790
You like Seri-san, don't you?

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.130
Don't worry!

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:21.750
Please tell me!
What you're struggling with!

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.290
About proper romantic feelings!

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:33.080
<b>9th Night: No Fair</b>

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:34.790
Ow!

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.420
Shoot, my glasses.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.670
You okay, big guy?

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:43.960
Want me to buy you some water?

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:47.290
Whoa, your eyesight sucks, huh?

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.080
You know how they say love is blind?

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.960
It's true, in a way.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.130
What d'ya mean?

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:02.830
Well see, when people fall in love,
their brains release more dopamine.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:08.000
They say the resulting sensation is very similar
to taking certain types of drugs.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.000
You fall in love thinking about that kind of thing?

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:14.960
No, no, that's not it.

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:17.040
But how my girl-

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:20.540
How my ex-girlfriend made me feel,

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:23.250
thinking back now, wasn't quite normal, I think.

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:27.750
I would get worried for no reason, get jealous...

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:33.130
Honestly, not being able have normal conversations
anymore because of that is creepy, you know?

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:35.330
You think so?

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:37.880
Is it creepy?

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:44.380
Seri-chan probably just spoke to me
because I got drunk and tripped,

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:47.040
and she didn't mean anything by it.

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.670
She just felt sorry for me.

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:52.630
And I was fine with that, at first.

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:57.540
When Seri-chan acted like she was flirting to tease me,
it made me happy.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.080
I was that blind.

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.420
But you're not anymore?

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:05.330
I don't know.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:10.580
But I'm definitely not Seri-chan's boyfriend,
or her closest friend, either.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.630
I don't actually care where I rank...

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:15.670
as long as I get to see her.

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:23.080
But the times I wasn't with her
seemed to get longer, and longer...

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:25.920
"What is she doing now?"

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:28.210
"Who is she with now?"

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.380
"Who is she complaining to about me?"

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:37.500
Once I started thinking that I couldn't stop,
and I'd kept sending her messages.

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:39.710
Thinking about it calmly,

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:45.000
that kind of conjecture just comes from
overthinking stuff in a pessimistic way.

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:47.290
Seri-san really did complain about you.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:50.500
What...

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:51.710
Just listen.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:55.790
When I say, she complained,
it wasn't about you in particular.

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:57.500
But that's not the issue.

00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:02.420
Like you said, they're usually just
pessimistic conjectures.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.750
But you sensed from what
limited interactions you had

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.250
that she probably doesn't think kindly of you.

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.960
I finally found you.

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:14.670
You're really talking out of your ass there.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:16.750
Seri-chan...

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.960
Okay, time to kill him.
Move.

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:21.040
U-um, Seri-chan?

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:23.080
What do you mean,"kill"?

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.330
Uh, exactly what it sounds like.

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:27.880
Sorry!

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:31.710
I was tricking you this whole time - I'm a vampire!

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:33.040
Not a human!

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.710
I look for humans who might fall in love with me

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:38.080
and talk to them so I can turn them into offspring.

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:41.580
Oh, the reason it has to be people
who might fall in love with me

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.880
is because they can't become offspring otherwise.

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:46.880
Seri-chan, what are you talking ab-

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.130
You don't have to get it.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.040
You're gonna die now anywa-

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.040
No!

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.170
I won't let you kill him.
I swear.

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:55.380
Fine.

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:57.080
Then wanna die first, Yamori-kun?

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:04.880
Nazuna, huh?!

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:09.380
Did you really think I would leave you
alone with Ko-kun?

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:12.290
That's way too naïve.

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:13.960
Why are you getting in my way?!

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:17.790
Well, of course I'm gonna to step in
if you try to harm Ko-kun.

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:19.080
Okay!

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:21.540
I won't touch Yamori-kun.

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:23.170
That's fine then, right?

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.210
Listen, this is just me being curious,

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:31.210
but why did you decide you're gonna kill for once?

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.250
C'mon, Seri.

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:37.130
What's the deal with Mr. Glasses here, huh?

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:40.830
Stop.

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.210
Stop that, please.

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:45.920
It's not Seri-chan's fault.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.920
I was never supposed to fall in love.
I forgot.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.130
Don't...

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:54.580
Because we're friends.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.210
<i>Maybe...</i>

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.380
<i>Maybe with this human...</i>

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:13.630
Friends? What do you mean?

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.500
Exactly what it sounds like.

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:21.380
I never intended to turn Akkun into offspring
and just hung out with him sometimes.

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.000
Akkun?

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.290
Oh, that's me.

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:25.670
My name's Akiyama.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.710
Oh, hi, I'm Yamori.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:32.920
But vampires approach humans to
make more offspring, don't they?

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:34.710
Why not Mr. Draggo?

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:37.630
I got tired of all that.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:39.790
I got bored.

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.920
But who could I possibly talk to about that?

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:47.670
That I'm tired of having romance be a part
of every human interaction I have?

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.920
But I don't know how to communicate
like an ordinary friend.

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:53.500
<b>I miss you.</b>

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:56.790
I unconsciously act to make people
fall in love with me.

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:57.380
<b>Drinking with some buddies.</b>

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:57.380
<b>Wanna join?</b>

00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:00.630
Like, "Oh, if I make a move now,
he'll fall for me for sure."

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:02.920
I'm tired of that.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.080
Nazuna...

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:10.040
That hurts.
Won't you get off?

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.290
I won't do anything.

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:17.880
Sorry 'bout that.

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:22.500
Anyway, that's how it is.

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:25.580
Akkun, let's stop seeing each other.

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:30.420
Let's just say nothing ever happened, Akkun.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.540
Seri-san...

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.290
What do you want to do, exactly?

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:47.210
Huh? I just told you.

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:49.000
That's why you decided to kill him?

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:52.000
Kill him and say nothing ever happened?

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:54.580
That's right...

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:55.790
But then...

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:58.580
you're the one who's hard to deal with!

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:02.580
If anything, Mr. Draggo here isn't such a drag!

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.080
He's actually pretty reasonable!

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.540
Th-the name's Akiyama.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:10.670
You enjoy having a friend, and you don't want to ruin
that relationship so you're gonna kill him?!

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:12.170
That's ludicrously hard to deal with!

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:13.710
What's that, punk?!

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:20.000
Then at least, seeing as you're so similar,
why don't you talk it through as friends first?

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:24.630
Uh, Akkun...

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:28.710
Like I said earlier, I'm actually a vampire.

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:30.170
R-right...

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:36.420
Nazuna and Yamori-kun there are doing the whole
vampire-human friend thing,

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.040
but that's a total exception.

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:40.170
It's not normally allowed.

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:45.330
For us vampires,
a friendship with humans just doesn't work.

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:48.630
So, I'm sorry.

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.630
After today, it's goodbye...

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:53.670
Huh?

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:59.040
Seri-chan?!

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:01.670
I don't wanna quit being friends!

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:03.170
S..Seri-chan!

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:06.290
It was really fun, y'know?!

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:07.710
Uh, th-thanks.

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:08.920
It was?

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:13.170
I had fun, too...

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.500
But I fell in love.

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:21.040
To tell you the truth,
I was prepared to get rejected properly.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:22.960
But I can't.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.420
I don't want to be apart from you.

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:31.380
Will you make me into your offspring?

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:37.460
You sure?

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.710
Your life until now...

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:42.290
You might lose all of that.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.170
It's fine.

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:45.500
Thanks.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.880
You were thinking about me because we're friends.

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:51.580
But it's okay.

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:54.040
You're a vampire, aren't you?

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:58.540
Don't concern yourself with human matters.

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:07.170
<i>In retrospect, it was a simple matter.</i>

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:09.420
<i>A vampire and a human...</i>

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.710
<i>That's all this was about.</i>

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:15.830
<i>Watching them, I found myself thinking,
"Aw, no fair,"</i>

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:17.580
<i>because I want what they have.</i>

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:24.460
Ko-kun...

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.830
You're thinking this isn't fair, huh?

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:28.290
W-well...

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:30.920
Your meddling caused this, you know.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:33.210
I-I know that.

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:35.670
Well, we can just take it slow.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.000
For now, I just...

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:41.130
want to suck your blood already.

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.170
Hey, what're you two doing?

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:51.630
Let's get going!

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:52.830
Where to?

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.580
Karaoke to celebrate my new offspring, what else?

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:58.670
Hey, I'm Akiyama the offspring now.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:19.830
<i>You know, this is kind of fun.</i>

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:26.080
<b>Song 1   Romantic Flight</b>

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:26.080
<b>Cued up</b>

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:24.880
What's with the old school song?

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:31.460
The call of the night

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.540
Shine on me moonlight

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:35.670
Eye caught by blue light

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:37.960
The two-faced sides of neon lights

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.750
The call of the night

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:41.830
Take me away, midnight

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:43.960
Bloodshot red eyes

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.630
A lullaby for grownups

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:48.920
Loved the nights since I was a kid

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.080
I kinda hated going to bed at nine

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.210
It just felt like a waste somehow

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:55.210
I wanted to get to know you better

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:56.040
Hey hey

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.580
The early bird catches you know what

00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:00.540
I wanna see deeper, deeper, deeper

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:01.750
Unravel in deep shades

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.080
From 12 o'clock to 2 o'clock

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.000
The first time I stepped over you

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.750
No, the first I mounted you was at fourteen, I think

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:10.380
Me, just an ignorant wannabe

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:12.420
Led by the hand, everything was new

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:14.460
Your physique and that scent

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.670
That dark skin that fits well with the quiet

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.830
I was drawn in, submissive to the beckoning

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.670
Then you gave me music

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:24.830
You showed me a woman's naked body

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:26.830
Sipped on booze I'd never had

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:29.000
Smoked my old man's butts

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.630
Flooded with don't do's

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:32.420
Smeared with shouldn't know's

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:34.790
Under the screen of darkness, coming to get us

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:36.540
You're always so capricious

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:38.250
The call of the night

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:40.330
Shine on me moonlight

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:42.420
Eye caught by blue light

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.790
The two-face sides of neon lights

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:46.580
The call of the night

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.630
Take me away, midnight

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:50.710
Bloodshot red eyes

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:53.540
A lullaby for grownups
