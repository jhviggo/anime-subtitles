00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.830
Huh?

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.380
It's still late afternoon.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.290
That day we were accomplices under the apple tree

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.540
We tried stepping over the line

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.630
Immediate black out

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.000
Oops, you're angry...

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.330
Chased away to this unfortunate dimension

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.750
I can't believe I...

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.040
Someone like me...

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.250
Of all people, I couldn't...

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.290
Wait, no way

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.500
I blamed you

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.710
Got hold of a secret

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.080
The fig leaves go right and left

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.540
In a blink of an eye I wake up

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.880
But then I'm falling toward the sky

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.130
I don't know, I just can't stop

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.040
Just one more bite

Again, Fallin' fallin' down in a spiral, falling on a skyscraper

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.210

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.540
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, forever

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.790
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, I let myself go

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.250
And just like that

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.040
The wounds are being filled, yeah

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.830

No, stop!

What's up with that crappy item?!

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.170
This is such a crap game that
I'm never playing it again, I swear!

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.790
Damn it...

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.670
I'll thrash Ko-kun with that next time to feel better.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.000
That thing I scheduled for delivery
should be coming soon.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.380
I wonder when it's gonna come?

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.830

Why?!

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.080
I specifically asked for a time I'd be awake
because I'm asleep during the day!

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.920
Sheesh!

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.880
Maybe I should specify pickup at a convenience store.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.250
I feel bad making them make multiple delivery attempts.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.080
Maybe I should clean the place?

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.960
But it's nighttime...

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.960

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.380

Didn't you already take one, Nazuna-chan?

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.580
I had to get out early because of a certain someone,

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.460

<i>you tend to remember stuff
you don't want to in the bath.</i>

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.630
<i>I was trying not to think about it.</i>

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.330
<i>The concern and anxiety over whether
I should really continue with this.</i>

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.000
<i>It's fun hanging out with Nazuna-chan.</i>

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.080
<i>It gives rise to a lot of emotions
I never even knew I had.</i>

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.960
<i>But that also means my heart is always busy.</i>

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:15.670
<i>I learned that the feeling of having fun
is an emotional strain in itself.</i>

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.170
Hey, how was the bath?

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.330

<i>Is it because the bath improved my blood flow?</i>

<i>One is that it calms any strong emotions

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.540
<i>The other is to assess my feelings.</i>

<i>well, feeling a kind of attraction in this relationship,</i>

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.420
<i>and it's only natural that my brain is
tricked into thinking I'm in love.</i>

<i>I want to fall in love with her, I want to be like her,</i>

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:00.880
<i>and that's why I'm where I am right now.</i>

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:04.460

<i>So I can't tell.</i>

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:14.290
<i>I give my blood to know my own feelings.</i>

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.250
<i>A confirmation process: that's the benefit.</i>

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.380
<i>I'm sure everyone's scared their first time.</i>

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:27.080
I was just feeling hungry.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.500
Sorry, but I won't be able to hold back.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:30.500
Huh?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.290
<i>Having my blood sucked is both painful and arousing.</i>

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.250
<i>I see, it IS like copulation.</i>

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.210
You okay?

00:09:58.210 --> 00:09:59.210
Yeah...

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:01.630
Sorry, it was just too tasty.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.330
Uh, well...

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:05.920
I just need a bit of a rest...

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.420
<b>To Rest</b>

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.290
Nazuna-chan, there's a place there for resting!

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.000
You're right...

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.210
You wanna "rest"?

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:15.330
I do! It says they have video games, too!

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.130
If you knew, you could have just said
what this place was for.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:24.750
You're the worst, Nazuna-chan...

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:25.750
What?

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.380
I thought you brought me here knowing what was up!

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:29.960
You're such a letch!

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.790
Why would you think that?!

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:33.960
So...

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:43.960
Were you able to assess your feelings,
vampire-wannabe boy?

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:50.880
When I suck blood, I can get an idea of
what you're thinking from the taste.

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:55.040
Like what kind of desires you have
when you look at me, you know?

00:10:56.710 --> 00:11:01.920
Was my look after the bath so alluring
that you got confused again?

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:03.750
You're the worst...

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.580
Did I go too far with the teasing?

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.580
Honestly, I hate this.

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:14.830
Because I think of you as a friend.

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:18.080
Sure, my goal is to fall in love with you.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.080
Right...

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.920
But having those kinds of thoughts about a friend...

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:26.500
It kind of feels really immoral.

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:29.380
I didn't really want you to know.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.710
When you're enjoying the night,
immoral's just about right.

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:34.960
Don't worry about it.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.380
Those emotions add variety to how your blood tastes.

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:39.880
I see that now.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:46.670
By provoking your emotions,
I get to enjoy the taste of your blood more.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:52.040
So, let me keep savoring
the different emotions you have.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:56.920
This agreement we have only works to begin with
because your blood is so tasty.

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.080
Don't be lazy about your emotions.

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:04.420
Fun, pain, joy, sadness...

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.580
Everything you feel...

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.880
feel them for me.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.540
Your flavor today was delicious as always.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:17.460
Nazuna-chan, than-

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:18.960
Oh, that's right!

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:22.330
I think you're supposed to be able to watch
naughty videos in these kind of places,

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:25.380
so let's play one at max volume and
put some pressure on the people next door!

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:27.210
What?! Your idea of fun is awful!

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.170
<b>This is a pay-to-view HD broadcast.</b>

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.170
<b>Please buy a ticket (1,000 yen/stay)</b>

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.170
<b>at the machine.</b>

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.830
You have to pay to watch?!
The inconsiderate jerks!

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:35.920
It's probably a measure against obnoxious
customers like you, Nazuna-chan.

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:42.000
<i>Fun, pain, joy, sadness...</i>

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.670
<i>I hoped that what all my different emotions
eventually lead to would be...</i>

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:49.330
<i>falling in love.</i>

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:58.000
<b>5th Night: Well, That’s a Problem</b>

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.330
<i>Nazuna-chan says my blood is tasty.</i>

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.710
<i>She could only say that
if she knows the taste of other blood.</i>

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:09.580
Hey look, Ko-kun.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.830
There's a drunk guy puking again.

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:15.080
<i>Whose blood?
And from how many people?</i>

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:16.880
You're right.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.130
<i>I kind of want to ask, but I don't.</i>

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:20.880
<i>It's complicated.</i>

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.630
<i>If she said, "I've sucked his blood before,"
I'd really hate that.</i>

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:28.040
Oh, I've sucked blood from that dude before.

00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:29.330
Huh?!

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:30.330
What?

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.710
You are such an insensitive woman.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.290
Uh? What do you mean?

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:41.630
What, is it like, you don't want to hear about
the other guys I've been with?

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:43.500
You jealous?

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.630
Aww, you're such a cutie!
There, there, there!

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.960
Th-this is really infuriating...

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:50.880
Anyway, don't worry.

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.880
I sucked blood from women too, you know?

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.080
And now you're the only one.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.170
You said "now."

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:02.040
Then what did you do before?

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.170
You didn't have someone like me that you
consistently took blood from, did you?

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:08.880
Oh, well obviously, it's just like when
I invited you to my place.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:15.710
You picked up customers by pretending
you sold naughty services?

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.500
I don't think that's right.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.540
I don't sell naughty services!
That's insulting!

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.750
I guess I never told you,
because you've been around lately.

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:28.830
I've always worked as...

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:31.170
...a professional cuddler.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:33.000
Welcome!

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.130
So you did provide naughty services!

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:38.420
What's with the cosplay?!

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.080
It's not naughty.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.460
Just a guy and a girl sleeping together.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:42.920
Like that's not plenty?!

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.000
It's not cosplay, you know.
It's an official costume.

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:47.630
Here you go.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.500
<b>CUDDLE BUDDY NANAKUSA</b>

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.500

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.080
Oh, don't worry.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.960
I wouldn't charge you, Ko-kun.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.500
Only for the add-ons.

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:56.750
Uh?

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.000
Okay, the Massage Course, then.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.210
You're tired?

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:05.880
How's that, sir?

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.460
Does this feel good?

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:09.670
I guess.

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:18.000
<i>I swear, I had nothing dirty on my mind
when I chose the Massage Course.</i>

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.710
<i>Definitely nothing dirty!</i>

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.750
I'll work from the head end of you now.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:27.960
There we go...

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:35.790
<i>I swear...</i>

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:37.540
<i>I swear!</i>

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:41.000
Your lymph fluid can build up, you see.

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:52.790
In order to get easy access to people's blood,
I came up with a bunch of ideas.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:55.000
You can't just ambush people these days, y'know?

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.880
I taught myself how to give massages.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.170
Not bad, right?

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.250
I'm sure the Massage Course was very popular.

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:06.670
You can tell?
I guess it's obvious.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.630
<i>And then she sucks their blood
once they've relaxed and dozed off.</i>

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:16.500
<i>I know, I'm probably more jealous than I think.</i>

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:19.290
<i>But that's not all.</i>

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:21.080
<i>I want to learn more...</i>

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:22.790
<i>about Nazuna-chan.</i>

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:25.670
Ko-kun, get up for a moment.

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:30.500
Ko-kun, don't worry.

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:31.750
Huh?

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.500
Look, just relax.

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:37.000
Make a loose fist.

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:38.500
Good.

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.460
This place between the tips
of your index and middle fingers...

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:42.460
Here.

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:45.790
This is a pressure point called the rokyu.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.960
The rokyu improves your blood flow,

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:54.920
delivering oxygen to your whole body
to relieve fatigue.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:58.460
It also helps straighten out
your autonomic nervous system,

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:01.210
so it's perfect for remedying insomnia.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:06.170
The superstition of drawing a spiral on
your hand and swallowing it to relax

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:09.170
may have come from this pressure point,
according to some.

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:11.000
<i>I...</i>

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:13.750
<i>I can't believe this is so informative.</i>

00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:17.210
This is the shitsumin pressure point.

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:18.790
O-ow! Ow!

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:20.000
The hyakue...

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.580
Wow, that feels good.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:23.000
The danchu...

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:24.830
I can't breathe...

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:26.290
And finally...

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:29.170
the kankotsu, and here's...

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:32.000
...the one for restful sleep.

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:35.710
You sleep really well after having
your blood sucked, right?

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:39.170
Maybe it has to do with this pressure point.

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:43.460
Ko-kun, come here.

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:48.380
It's about time, isn't it?

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:55.920
S-someone's here?

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:01.630
I-I'm just gonna go take a look.

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:03.670
I'm sure it's a mistake, anyway.

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:05.710
O-of course.

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:10.420
<i>This is like that thing when the parents
come home unexpectedly.</i>

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.960
Oh crap, it's a customer.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:17.790
Huh?

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:19.750
I guess I forgot to take down the sign.

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:21.580
What should I do, Ko-kun?

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:23.630
What do you mean, "what should I do"?

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:25.380
I'm all tired out.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:29.880
Ko-kun, could you answer it instead?

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:31.750
Why?

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:34.330
Giving massages is pretty tiring.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:35.960
Okay.

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.960
So I should turn them away for today?

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.790
That customer was into the Massage Course.

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:42.000
I'm counting on you.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.960
You're going to be the cuddle buddy!

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:46.580
Huh?

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:55.960
U-um, welcome, miss.

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.580
Please, come in.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:03.670
O-oh? I thought a girl worked here...

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:07.000
Nazu- The boss is resting at the moment.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:08.670
I see...

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.000
The Massage Course, please.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.250
Sure thing.

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:17.960
Please wait here for a moment.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:19.960
Nazuna-chan!

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.290
Heck yeah!

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:22.710
I'm number one!

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:24.580
You're gaming?! Why?!

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:27.460
Ko-kun, you handling the customer okay?

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:28.830
And you're not even sorry!

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:33.460
Settle down, this is a pretty good deal for you, y'know.

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:35.880
Let's hear it, then.

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:38.880
Kiyosumi Shirakawa, twenty-four years old.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.630
Two years in at a publishing company.

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:42.420
A slightly tired office worker.

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:46.250
And you get to touch her body.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.790
Just imagine it.
Isn't that titillating?

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:51.830
You're awful!
Shut the business down!

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:52.960
Wait, what?!

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.210
They come in with complete trust.
They're a customer!

00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:58.750
That kind of sleazy attitude is so not okay!

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:00.040
You should be ashamed!

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.420
Sheesh, I can't argue with that.

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.040
What are you, a goody-goody?

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:06.630
I was sure the lewd pitch would get you into it!

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:09.000
No way! There's no convincing me now!

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.130
I feel bad for her, but let's ask her to leave.

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:12.330
I can't do that!

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:13.540
Why not?

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:15.040
Then why don't you just do it?

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:17.170
I'm tired now, so I don't wanna!

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:18.500
You "don't wanna"?!

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.250
Listen, Ko-kun.

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:22.540
What?

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:26.380
You see, I make a living off of the cuddling business.

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:30.210
But recently, because of you,
I haven't worked at all this month.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.130
Which means, I have no money.

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:34.920
But that has nothing to do with me.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.080
Jeez! Of course it does!

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.170
Enjoying the night can cost money, too!

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:42.750
Aren't you ashamed you made
the girl pay for the hotel?!

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.250
Come on, Ko-kun, I'll even compensate you!

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:49.290
What? Really?!

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:50.330
Really, really!

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:52.630
Half the price.
How's 2,000 yen sound?

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.540
A-a whole 2,000 yen?!

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:59.830
But jeez, I've never even given a massage...

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:03.830
Oh, you'll be fine.

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:06.420
Just do exactly what I did!

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.880
Is 2,000 yen not enough?

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:12.880
No, that's not it...

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:21.000
If you do this for me, I'll reward you,

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.040
by giving you another kiss.

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.080
Okay?

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:31.380
The call of the night

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:33.460
Shine on me moonlight

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.580
Eye caught by blue light

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.880
The two-faced sides of neon lights

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.670
The call of the night

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:41.750
Take me away, midnight

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:43.880
Bloodshot red eyes

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.540
A lullaby for grownups

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:48.830
Loved the nights since I was a kid

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:51.000
I kinda hated going to bed at nine

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.130
It just felt like a waste somehow

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:55.130
I wanted to get to know you better

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:55.960
Hey hey

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.500
The early bird catches you know what

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.460
I wanna see deeper, deeper, deeper

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:01.670
Unravel in deep shades

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:04.000
From 12 o'clock to 2 o'clock

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.920
The first time I stepped over you

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.670
No, the first I mounted you was at fourteen, I think

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:10.290
Me, just an ignorant wannabe

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:12.330
Led by the hand, everything was new

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:14.380
Your physique and that scent

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.580
That dark skin that fits well with the quiet

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.750
I was drawn in, submissive to the beckoning

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.580
Then you gave me music

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.750
You showed me a woman's naked body

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:26.750
Sipped on booze I'd never had

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:28.920
Smoked my old man's butts

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.540
Flooded with don't do's

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.330
Smeared with shouldn't know's

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.710
Under the screen of darkness, coming to get us

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:36.460
You're always so capricious

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:38.170
The call of the night

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:40.250
Shine on me moonlight

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:42.330
Eye caught by blue light

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.710
The two-face sides of neon lights

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:46.500
The call of the night

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.540
Take me away, midnight

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:50.630
Bloodshot red eyes

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:53.460
A lullaby for grownups
