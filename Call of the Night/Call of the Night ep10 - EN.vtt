Whoa! It's a maid!

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.960
Can I get one of those, too?

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.540
Yes, please take one.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.210
We'll come sometime soon!

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.710
Yeah, sometime soon!

Okay, but what are we gonna do?

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.130
Is anyone I know free today?

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.210
But the only ones I could ask are all vampires.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.500
And man, I don't want it to become
a popularity contest.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.630
If only there was someone convenient
who doesn't hit it off with guys at all.

Hey, it's Midori.

Shhh! You can't, Master!

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.210
Uh no, it's not like that.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.710
Midori-chan doesn't embellish herself at all.

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.540
Neither her appearance or her personality.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.380
She took the number one spot
as soon as she started here.

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:08.750
Wow...

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.500
I may not look it, but I was actually
number one before Midori-chan came.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.750
Really? Wow!

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.710
<i>I feel like I've only said "wow" today.</i>

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.880
I'm not really supposed to be talking about this,
so keep it a secret.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.330
Oh, okay.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.920
Midori-chan's amazing.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.670
I envy that...

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:34.460
<i>It's probably because I know that
Kohakobe-san's a vampire,</i>

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.040
<i>but in all honesty,
I didn't notice that much of a difference.</i>

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:45.040
What do you think, Ko Yamori?!

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.670
Cute, aren't I?

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.040

Beer after a hard day's work is so sweet!

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.830
You always drink like it's good regardless.

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.170
Oh hey, Nazuna-chan.

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.830
I'm gonna post on the store's social media account.
Let me take a pic.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.710
You're pretty conscientious.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:07.790
It's important for the store.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.040
Uh, why would you zoom in on that?

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:22.500
That's messed up.

Don't look so closely!

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:38.630
Nope, none of you here.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.330
Huh?! They didn't take any of me,
the number one maid?!

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.920
But I'm the obvious first choice!

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.210
Huh? You wanted your pics taken?

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:45.670
No, of course not!

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.500
That's not what I mean.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:50.130
These are only targeting Arisa-san.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.710
I see...

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.290
Then the culprit is a customer who likes Arisa-chan.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:09:01.330
But do you have some kind of skill in telling
who a girl is just by looking at her lower body?

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:02.790
That's pretty creepy.

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:04.830
Of course not; that's insulting.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.420
You can tell if you take a proper look at the photos.

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:11.630
She wears her uniform a little differently,
and her face is in some of them.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:12.920
True.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.460
Yamori-kun!

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:16.460
Yes?

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.290
I want to catch the culprit.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:19.750
Can you help me?

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.000
Sure.

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:31.080
<b>10th Night: Enlarge the Peeping-Tom Photos</b>

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:31.790
<b>The Next Day</b>

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:37.710
There are some where she's changing, too...

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:41.670
When you stare at them like that,

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:43.330
it's a little embarrassing.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:46.040
Good evening, Yamori-sama.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.460
G-g-g-good eveni...

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:49.880
Did you just get here for work?

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:50.880
Yes.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.670
I'm sorry I'm causing you so much trouble.

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:55.750
I heard from Midori-chan.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.500
If only I had been more careful,
I wouldn't have had those photos taken of me.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.880
No, that's obviously not the issue.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.040
<i>Sneaking photos of her changing
is a pretty risky move.</i>

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.750
<i>It had to be in this room, right?</i>

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:13.750
<i>Then it was probably from that window.</i>

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:17.040
I see...

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.290
<i>A balcony...</i>

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:21.920
<i>Then it would have been possible to
take photos from outside.</i>

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:24.580
Um, Yamori-san?

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.040
Yes?

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:31.920
Uh, I have to get changed and
go serve the masters pretty soon...

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:37.460
I-I'm sorry I didn't realize!
I'll get out right away!

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:38.670
Not at all!

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:41.630
I'm sorry, when you're helping us find the culprit.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:44.250
Yo!

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:46.210
How's it going? Any leads?

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:47.830
You on a break, Nazuna-chan?

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:54.380
Moe, moe, kyun!

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:58.920
I kept my eyes open in there,
but there weren't any sketchy customers.

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:02.460
Well, I figure they won't come today
if they came yesterday.

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:09.710
Do you think this door leads out to the balcony?

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:11.380
Dunno. Why?

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:14.380
The culprit had to have taken some
photos from the balcony,

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.170
so I want to go check.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.170
There's a lock on here.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.580
Shall we break it?
Like, "twist"?

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.880
I feel like we probably shouldn't break it.

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:30.920
Hmm, I was thinking maybe we could climb up, but...

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.130
Nazuna-chan, can you lend me a hand?

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:34.330
You got it.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.170
This is probably the only place to
get a photo of her changing.

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:41.460
Angle-wise, too.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:43.960
But in order to get out on the balcony from inside,

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.460
you have to open this door that's locked.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.580
To access the balcony from outside,

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:51.830
you would need to be as acrobatic
as Nazuna-chan is.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.000
Then that must mean the culprit is Midori?!

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.420
Why would you think that?

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.920
But when you consider the factors,
she's the only possible one.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.040
If you say that, you're just as viable a suspect.

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.880
Hmm, what does this mean?

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:08.420
H-huh?! Yamori-san?!

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:09.670
Why?!

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:13.540
Whoa there, missy, don't you get the wrong idea.

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.000
We're looking for clues leading to the culprit.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.920
I'm sorry.  Honestly.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.540
Oh, uh, Nazuna-san?

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:24.170
So yeah, you change already and get to work.

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:26.460
We're busy here.

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.040
O-okay...

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.830
I'm sorry. Honestly.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:35.880
What d'ya think?

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:40.250
The angle's pretty much right, but...

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.670
something's not quite the same as that photo.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:47.210
Isn't that 'cuz there's no person in your shot?

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:49.380
I'll go stand there for you.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.250
What?! Ugh!

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:56.540
Okay you're asking for it.

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:57.750
Oh, ugh!

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:02.170
I think looking good in photos depends on
whether you're used to taking selfies

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:05.380
and knowing how to present your face, you know?

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:08.750
Used to taking selfies...

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.710
What's up, Ko-kun?

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:31.460
Nazuna-chan...

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:32.710
Yep?

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:34.920
I think I can find the culprit.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.130
Really?!

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:39.500
You're like a genius detective whose IQ bumps up
only when peeping Tom photos are involved!

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:43.040
If I don't get to be a vampire,
maybe I'll be a detective when I grow up.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.330
Only for peeping Tom photos.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:47.080
There's a detective's line I've always wanted to say.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.080
Can I?

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.710
Ooh, what's that?

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:52.750
When work's over, gather everyone together.

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:55.960
If what I've deduced is correct,

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.920
the culprit will definitely come to the crime scene!

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.540
So cool...

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.130
Yamori-kun!

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:04.460
Is it true you're going to catch the culprit?!

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.000
Most definitely.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.040
No...

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.330
Well, about eighty percent sure.

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.380
Maybe sixty percent?

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:16.170
Or more like forty or fifty.

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:18.960
Well, definitely is a strong word.

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:22.670
If I'm lucky I might figure it out, maybe?

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:25.250
He's losing confidence with every word!

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:28.040
This doesn't sound promising.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.830
Midori-san, is there anywhere you can hide?

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.880
Nazuna-chan, can you do what I asked earlier?

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.080
You got it.

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:41.710
Nazuna-san!

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:44.750
Oh, good work today.
You about to go home?

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:47.460
Yes, am I the last one?

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:48.670
Seems that way.

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.420
Lock up when you leave!

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:52.750
What?! You're going home like that?

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.420
Yeah. Why?

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:56.960
Uh, nothing.
Good work today.

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:11.790
Why're we in the same locker?

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:13.130
What was I supposed to do?

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.460
This was the only one that was unlocked!

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.790
Anyway, why are we hiding?

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:20.290
The culprit is after Arisa-san.

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:24.710
Her being alone is the most
convenient time for the culprit.

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:26.250
What do you mean?

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:28.790
I noticed when I was looking at those photos,

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:32.380
but they were all taken when Arisa-san was alone.

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:35.830
Weren't there some where's she's serving customers?

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:40.330
If you look closely, there aren't any other
staff or customers in them.

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:42.000
What, really?

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:46.210
Those peeping Tom photos were all taken
after closing hours.

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:47.420
What?!

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:49.250
Here, take a look at this.

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:50.460
Which one?

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:52.960
Hey...

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.460
Oh come on, Yamori-kun.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.830
Well I mean, we're putting our faces together
to look at these photos

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.170
when we're already pressed against each other.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:05.330
You say that when you told me I was a "no".

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:07.710
Most everyone's a "no" in my case!

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:09.460
Oh yeah?

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:13.630
The window just opened?

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:17.250
To tell you the truth,
I kind of suspected this from the start.

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:21.920
Or rather, looking at the photos,
that was the only way it made sense.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.460
But I don't understand the reason behind it.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:26.960
That's why...

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.500
we have to ask her directly.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:31.130
Arisa-san!

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:34.130
Uh, Yamori-san?!

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:38.130
Ohh, you used a timer to take them.

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:39.460
I see...

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.500
Oops, I took one of my face.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:44.880
I'm sorry, Arisa-san.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:47.380
I'm sure you didn't want anyone to find out.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.630
But why did you take selfies like these?

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:53.960
Uh...

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:58.880
Can I put on some clothes first?

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.920
I'm so very sorry.

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.420
But I'm amazed you figured it out.

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:06.500
How?

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:11.420
Well, to put it simply, the photos looked too good.

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:17.830
I imagine when you sneak photos,
the main goal is to get the photos.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.670
So when it comes down to it,
as long as the target is in the photo,

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:26.170
it shouldn't matter if it looks cute or not.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:30.750
And I think some kind of selfie app
was used to take those photos,

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:33.460
but the photos themselves look too nice.

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.920
That and,
this was the decisive thing for me personally...

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:43.750
...but the thing was, a crucial thing was missing.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:45.500
Huh? What do you mean?

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:46.880
Uh, you know...

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.960
Most peeping Tom photos include some shots of...

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:52.210
Well, you know, under...

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:53.750
Oh...

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.040
Huh?! You were thinking there weren't any
upskirt photos from the start?!

00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.040
You creep!

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.420
Will you shut up?!

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:05.000
Well, so basically, the photos
specifically didn't show those parts.

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:08.580
I started off by wondering if that was intentional.

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:11.960
I see.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.830
We would never have realized
without a guy's perspective.

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:17.830
So a horny mind led to solving the case.

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:19.080
Will you shut up?

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:23.210
But Arisa-san, I don't understand why.

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.710
What did you do all this for?

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.710
Huh? You can't tell?

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.960
You're not very perceptive in that area, huh?

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:37.670
You had top popularity before I came
but now you're number two,

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:39.330
and you got frustrated, right?

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:47.130
So you made up an imaginary peeping Tom
to prove that you're still popular, right?

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:50.040
In order to satisfy your desire for recognition?

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:55.210
You know, that's called an illness.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.420
D-do you have to put it like that?

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:01.420
Why not?

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:02.460
It's true.

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.040
You're just as ill, Yamori-kun.

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.040
Huh?!

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:09.040
You're a middle schooler who can't go to school
and messes around all night long.

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.540
What else could it be?

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:13.670
I...

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:14.540
I'll quit!

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:15.920
So yeah, Arisa-chan.
I'll quit!<b></b>

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:18.290
It's okay to be ill.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:24.500
The way you're dealing with it isn't
weird or particularly bad.

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.670
I'm sure there are plenty like you around,

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:29.880
who try to satisfy their desire for recognition
in skewed ways.

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.040
Me included.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:32.830
<b>So cool!</b>

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:32.830
<b>The best.</b>

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:32.830
<b>I love this!</b>

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:36.290
I mean, the girls who work here are all like that.
Sure! I would recommend tea with milk to go with that cake.<b></b>

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:39.040
We're here because we want
ordinary people to fawn over us.
Sure! I would recommend tea with milk to go with that cake.<b></b>

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.830
The customers, too.
Thanks for the other day.<b></b>

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:43.170
They're here to fawn over ordinary people.
I had so much fun!<b></b>

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:44.880
That's really not normal!

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:47.330
You made a bit of a mistake this time,

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.500
but you're askew in a really normal way, Arisa-chan.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.290
They were nice photos, too.

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:58.920
Humans are pretty much all sick
in their own ways, you know?

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.500
We just have to learn to live with that.

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:05.210
<b>VAMP</b>

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:08.500

Windows glowing with life<b></b>

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:33.250

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:34.460

The mirror ball's the full moon above the clouds<b></b>

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:44.540

I'm a stranger stranger ichigoichie
I'm a stranger, stranger, a singular moment<b></b>

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.670

So shutdown the eyes of the passersby<b></b>

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:51.170
