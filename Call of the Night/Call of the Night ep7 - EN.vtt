<i>Times like this, I get a little worried
that someone I know might-</i>

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.420
Yamori-kun!

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.880
<i>Who's that?
What do I do?</i>

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.130
<i>Do I run?</i>

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.000
<i>No, there's no point thinking about it.</i>

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.670
<i>Bring it on!</i>

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.290
Good evening.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.130
Oh yeah, I get that too.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:37.290
If I'm shopping on a day off and spot my boss,
I quietly sneak away so that I don't get found out.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.040
You too, huh?

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.380
Totally!

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.040
Are you on the way home from work?

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.290
Yeah, I got off relatively early today.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.130
This is early?

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.830
You know, I wanted to thank you.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.500
Here!

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.500
Thank me?

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.880
You said you'd turn me into a vampire if I need it.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.960
Just knowing that really took a load off my shoulders.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.960
Thanks, Yamori-kun.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.920
<i>What is this?</i>

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.630
<i>This feels weird.</i>

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.330
<i>I'm used to people thanking me,</i>

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.210
<i>because I went out of my way
to be helpful at school.</i>

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.000
<i>But that image of myself was a lie.</i>

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.540
<i>I didn't do it for other people.</i>

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.500
<i>But I guess I had a personal interest
in wanting to help Kiyosumi-san.</i>

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.920
Rain...

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.630
Well, this isn't very-

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.830
<b>Komori Housing Complex Council

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.290
That day we were accomplices under the apple tree

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.540
We tried stepping over the line

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.630
Immediate black out

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.000
Oops, you're angry...

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.330
Chased away to this unfortunate dimension

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.750
I can't believe I...

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.040
Someone like me...

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.250
Of all people, I couldn't...

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.290
Wait, no way

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.500
I blamed you

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.710
Got hold of a secret

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.080
The fig leaves go right and left

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.540
In a blink of an eye I wake up

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.880
But then I'm falling toward the sky

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.130
I don't know, I just can't stop

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.040
Just one more bite

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.330
Again, Fallin' fallin' down in a spiral, falling on a skyscraper

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.170
Fallin' fallin' two all alone, we don't even notice the curtain call

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.500
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, forever

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.750
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, I let myself go

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.250
And just like that

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.040
The wounds are being filled, yeah

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.830
Again, Fallin' fallin' down in a spiral, falling on a skyscraper

The wounds are being filled, yeah

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.540
Wow, that was a surprise.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.670
It came down so suddenly.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.960
So, some people use smoking areas as rain shelters.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.790
Is he hitting on her?

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.830
She turned him down.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.420
Well, whatever.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.040
You were watching just now.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:48.880
Whatcha think?

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.500
<i>What? Who?!</i>

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.830
Huh? Uh...

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.210
Do you know what that was?

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.710
He made a move?

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.250
Yep! You got it.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.710
He offered to pay me money.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.750
Th-that must suck.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:05.960
For women.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.250
Not really.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.790
I mean, I was waiting to get hit on.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.580
Why?

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.670
An innocent question, I like it.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.830
Well, I guess 'cuz I'm bored.

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:23.500
I'm bored, so I mess around with men who pick me up
and pretend like we're dating.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.210
We sing karaoke, drink some booze...

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.670
Just to kill time.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.670
Why'd you turn that guy down, er, miss?

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.630
He wasn't my type.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.540
I don't just take anybody.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.500
I could go home, but that blows.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.250
<i>I'm not sure, and I have no right to be saying this,</i>

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.630
<i>but isn't this person's way of
enjoying the night a little dangerous?</i>

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.130
<i>That uniform doesn't look familiar,
but she's in high school, right?</i>

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.630
<i>I THINK she's older than me...</i>

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.630
What're you staring for, you perv?

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.630
Huh?!

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.790
N-n-n-no! That's not what I intended!

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.580
What? I don't mind.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.380
Hey...

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.210
Don't you want a better look?

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.790
Um, do you do this kind of thing with anybody?

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.960
I don't really think that's good...

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.130
You don't sound convincing
when you're ogling like that.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.540
N-no! I really didn't mean to do that!

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.880
You crack me up.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.000
I'm kind of curious now.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.170
Hey, my soda!

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.670
H-hey!

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.790
Will you give me back my drink?

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.670
Drank it all!

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:51.880
What?!

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.670
<i>What's her problem?</i>

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.380
Y'know recently, things haven't been fun at all.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.420
It's like, nothing's exciting.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.710
Nothing I want to do works out.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.000
I'm tired of trying to be agreeable, too.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.580
And it's not like I've got anyone
to talk to about this stuff.

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.040
<i>I see, she feels that way too.</i>

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:16.920
<i>Just like me...</i>

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.000
It'll be okay!

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:24.670
I'm the same as you.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.460
Thanks, you're so nice...

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.210
Ko Yamori-kun.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.500
Hey, you...

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.580
You think you can just take someone else's prey,
you friggin' hussy?

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:57.420
Nazuna...

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.330
Hey, Nazuna...

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.540
Everyone's talking about you.

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.210
That you're hanging with some human like an idiot.

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.920
And not even to make offspring.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.500
That kind of thing's against the rules.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.630
You know you've gotta reproduce properly.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:22.540
What are you, some naggy mother-in-law?

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.380
A vampire?

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:26.920
That's right.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.540
I heard Nazuna had a new human buddy,

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.710
so I wanted to see what he's like.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.330
But what the heck are you two doing?

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.000
If you're not gonna make him your offspring,
you can't let him live!

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.710
Sucking blood is for siring offspring,

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:46.750
or else it's a meal.

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:50.460
Meaning you suck your victim down
to the very last drop...

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.040
and kill him!

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.880
Ow...

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.710
Your brute strength hasn't changed!

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:07.790
But...

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:09.380
We got him.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.330
Nazuna, we're going to borrow this boy for a bit.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.290
Sorry, Nazuna.

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:17.920
That's what we were after from the-

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.000
Where'd she take Ko-kun?

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.330
You're totally pissed.
That's hilarious.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:29.670
<i>That freaked me out.</i>

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.170
<i>Nazuna-chan's...</i>

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:33.250
<i>Well, she's a vampire.</i>

00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:35.920
<i>Of course she's superhuman.</i>

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.330
Yamori-kun, was it?

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.170
Huh? Uh, yes.

00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:42.830
I hear you've been a good friend to Nazuna.

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:45.000
I guess?

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.580
We're going down.
Don't bite your tongue.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:50.880
Uh? R-right!

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:01.880
Welcome, human boy.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.500
Sorry for handling you so roughly.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.710
Wow, he's really just a kid.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.580
This is what Nanakusa-san's into?

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:11.880
That's kind of a surprise.

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:15.250
Nazuna's, well, a bit unusual, you know?

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.920
But he's pretty cute, isn't he?

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:21.580
<i>Are they all vampires?</i>

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:26.500
<i>Nazuna-chan once said that vampires
have attractive faces.</i>

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.210
<i>It's true...</i>

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.080
Yamori-kun, was it?

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.420
Let's cut to the chase.

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:36.380
Choose which of us you prefer.

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:39.920
The one you name will turn you into a vampire.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.540
Then we won't have to kill you.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.080
What?

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:48.420
Now that you know vampires exist
and might very well learn more about our habits,

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.420
you're a threat.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.830
So we're giving you a choice.

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:55.170
Choose me, Niko Hirata...

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.250
Midori Kohakobe...

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:58.500
Hatsuka Suzushiro...

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.540
or Kabura Honda behind you.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.540
Oh, the one you met first, Seri Kikyou,
is another option.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:08.750
Uh? I just want Nazuna-chan, actually.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.080
Seriously?

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.790
No, no, no, that can't be right!

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:18.460
We command maximum popularity power,

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:21.880
and you're rejecting us for a dunce
who'd fail romance for life?!

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:25.000
Uh, what's popularity power?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.920
<b>7th Night: Reproduce</b>

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.210
So anyway...

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.830
What the heck?!
This is insulting.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.170
Calm down.

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:42.210
Everything's just so sudden, right, Yamori-kun?

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:43.920
Don't worry.

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:49.210
You're eventually going to fall for me
in the end, anyway.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:52.080
Hey, I can't let that slide.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.330
Are you saying I'm not as good as you?

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.830
What? I never said that!

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:58.500
It's just...

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.000
Virgins don't dig your style, Niko-chan.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.920
U-uh, hey...  What?

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.920
Logically speaking, I'm the best fit.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.040
What are you fighting about?

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:11.210
Hey!

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:13.040
And I like virgins.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:17.130
For starters, why are you all arguing
under the assumption that I'm a virgin?!

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:18.630
Huh?! You're not a virgin?!

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:20.460
What?! Of course I am!

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:22.380
Don't startle me like that!

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:26.040
S-see? You wouldn't be a good fit, Niko-chan.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.790
That's not true.

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:31.750
I feel like I'd get along pretty well with Yamori-kun.

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:33.500
What? Really?

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:36.460
<i>There she goes.
Niko-chan's I think we'd get along tactic.</i>

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:41.000
<i>A clever preemptive move to make the person
feel more open to talking.</i>

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.210
<i>I use it, too.</i>

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:45.040
<i>It has the power to charm any man.</i>

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.630
<i>So she's serious about winning him over.</i>

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:50.290
<i>Is she going to beat us to it?!</i>

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.630
Niko-san, was it?

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.290
Oh, but it's true,

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:58.630
you're the most like Nazuna-chan
out of everyone here.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.290
How?!

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:04.170
How the heck am I anything like
that unpopular letdown?!

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.710
Like, the way you talk and stuff.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.540
But I mean, are you saying Nazuna-chan isn't popular?

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:11.790
With those looks?

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.290
Well...

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:21.420
It's true, she does have a pretty face.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:24.540
The thing with Nazuna-chan is,
she doesn't try to be popular.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:30.080
In order to make humans fall in love with us
for efficiently making more offspring,

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.170
we vampires are adept at acting in ways
that attract humans.

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:34.750
That's how we've evolved.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.500
So we're all equally prone to popularity,

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.880
because we live lifestyles that make us popular.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.750
But she has an aversion to that.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:44.500
I don't understand why.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:49.250
Boys who have their heads full of
romantic feelings are so cute.

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:50.460
Right?

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:51.750
I know what you mean.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:55.290
That kind of desperation and yearning is so adorable!

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:58.630
<i>What's with the girl talk all of a sudden?</i>

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:01.580
What happened to that guy
you met at the bar the other day?

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.580
You're right, we haven't heard about him since.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.580
I got a text saying he broke up with his girlfriend.

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:06.580
Ooh!

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.080
Whoa, that's when things get the most interesting!

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.210
<i>I really can't deal with this vibe...</i>

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.290
I've always thought this:

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.920
"I really hate that gossipy, girly way you lot talk."

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:21.920
Uhhh...

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.130
Listen, Nazuna...

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.630
Sure, we all know your deal.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:27.630
You blush way too easily.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:29.000
Shut up.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.130
Still, to fool around with a boy you don't intend to turn,

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:36.210
a human you're not going to try to win over...

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:39.040
We all think that's asking for trouble.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.330
You realize he's the one in danger at this rate.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.790
I have no idea why you're fooling around
with a human kid, but-

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:48.330
I know that, okay?

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:49.670
No, you don't!

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:51.420
That's why we've gone out of our way to-

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:53.040
To what?

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.960
Get killed?

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:57.750
Besides...

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:01.210
Well, uh...

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:04.630
I do have plans to make offspring.

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:06.250
What?! For real?

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:08.710
This isn't your usual bluff to get by, is it?!

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:10.080
What, you have a guy?!

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:12.130
Well, kind of...

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:15.210
Then the kid was really just a diversion, huh?

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:16.790
Don't worry.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:21.000
We'll make sure we turn him into one of our own,
or kill him!

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.080
No, I mean...

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:25.960
What I'm saying is...

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:27.580
Yamori-kun...

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:30.540
I want to hear more about you, Yamori-kun.

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:32.170
<i>There it is.</i>

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:34.250
<i>Midori Kohakobe's favorite tactic...</i>

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:36.380
<i>...the "I'm Interested in You" move!</i>

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.750
So Yamori-kun, what's your ideal type of girl?

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:43.670
<i>She has a way with words that has
supposedly ruined many a community.</i>

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.080
Oh hey, I like being closer to people when we talk.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.380
Can I come over by you?

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:52.420
<i>Such fluid command of the conversation
and a natural seat relocation.</i>

00:14:52.420 --> 00:15:00.210
<i>Generally, they say a seat diagonally across is the
most effective for getting closer to a person...</i>

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:05.130
<i>...but I guess right next to him is ultimately
more advantageous to make an assertive move.</i>

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:06.710
There we go.

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:10.380
So? Is Nazuna-chan your type?

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:13.290
Well, I wouldn't say that...

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:15.130
And what about me?

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:16.630
Maybe? No?

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:18.790
Oh, actually, never mind!

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:20.000
What?

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.210
Well...

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:26.250
If you said I was a "no," I'd be devastated.

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:27.460
Kohakobe-san...

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:30.960
<i>No guy can say "no" after hearing that.</i>

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:35.920
<i>And once he replies, "You're a definite yes!"
whether he means it or not, he'll get sucked in.</i>

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:39.170
<i>Oftentimes, he really ends up thinking "yes."</i>

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:42.540
Well, if I had to choose, it would be a "no."

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.330
<i>What?!</i>

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:47.210
<i>This kid is something else.</i>

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:48.540
<i>She froze...</i>

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:51.960
Well actually, I don't really understand the
whole thing about liking someone.

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:55.670
It's not that you're specifically a "no," Kohakobe-san.

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:59.960
I just don't understand when someone is a "yes,"
at least, not yet.

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:02.420
<i>This is the first time a guy said I'm a "no."</i>

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.250
But you know...

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:07.500
If you don't choose one of us to like
and become a vampire,

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:08.920
you're going to be killed.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.130
By us.

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:14.670
Do you not understand the situation you're in?

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:18.630
We're showing mercy by giving you a choice.

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:22.080
We don't want to kill if we don't need to.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:26.750
If you don't experience romantic attraction
and you don't intend on becoming a vampire,

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.130
we cannot allow you to keep seeing Nazuna.

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:31.750
But I do want to become a vampire.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.170
Huh?

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:36.130
What?!

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:37.130
What?

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:38.130
What do you mean?

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:40.750
You're not just lying because you don't want to die?

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:42.170
It's true!

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:44.330
I thought the conversation wasn't clicking somehow.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:47.080
And Nazuna?
Does Nazuna know about this?

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.130
I mean, that's why I want...

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:52.880
...to fall in love with Nazuna-chan!

00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:58.830
<i>Is she pissed?</i>

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:00.170
Nazuna...

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:01.420
Nazuna-chan?

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:05.000
Wait, is she...

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.460
No good, her face is all red!

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:12.460
She won't be doing any talking for a while.

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:16.790
Is she still not over her embarrassment
of romantic topics?

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:18.040
Nope.

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.130
N...Nazuna-chan, you okay?

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:22.540
Shut up.

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:23.960
Don't talk to me.

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:29.460
See, that attitude is why guys
don't dig you, Nazuna-chan.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:30.830
Yeah, that's right!

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:33.920
You should've said thanks and
when he lends you his shoulder to stand up,

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:34.960
you throw yourself at him!

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.170
Shut it!

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:39.580
Let's go, Ko-kun.

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:40.790
Oh, uh, right.

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:44.210
Hold on, not so fast, Nazuna.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:46.790
You really think we'll just let you go?

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:50.540
Isn't there something you need to tell us?

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:51.920
What, Niko?

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.630
You want me to apologize for the trouble?

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:57.330
No idiot! It's the love talk, what else?!

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:58.540
Right, people?

00:17:58.540 --> 00:17:59.750
Obviously!

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.500
How are you going to get Yamori-kun to fall for you?

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.290
Tell us, Nanakusa-san.

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.250
You can't be serious...

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:08.500
Do you have a concrete plan?

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:10.580
Why would-

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.080
Of course you don't.

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:18.960
You never involved yourself with anyone, not even us.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:23.170
You never made offspring no matter how
many times we said you should.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.880
So why is this boy special to you?

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:32.380
I'm so intrigued to know
what Nazuna's favorite tastes like.

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:36.920
When Nazuna isn't available,
why don't you try hanging out with me?

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.750
<i>There she goes, that bad habit of hers.</i>

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.500
Come on, Yamo-

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:45.210
Don't go touching my prey
with your filthy hands, Kabura.

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:47.880
Or I really will kill you.

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:51.250
Whoa, now, that's enough, Nazuna.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:52.830
You too, Kabura.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:56.420
I can't just let you kill amongst ourselves.

00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:00.500
Besides, Kabura's comment makes sense.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.960
We're very confused right now.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.920
You, Nazuna, the one who was so
averse to making offspring,

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:09.880
are now spending nights with a human child.

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:14.000
How is Ko Yamori different
from the other humans before?

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:15.830
Answer me, Nazuna.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:20.420
I would really prefer to hear some love talk
and leave it at that.

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:22.130
If not...

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:23.380
You understand, don't you?

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:26.540
If you lot try anything funny with Ko-kun, I'll-

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.580
Nazuna-chan said my blood was tasty.

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:35.040
And after meeting Nazuna-chan,
I decided I wanted to be a vampire.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:39.330
So our situation is built on an
agreement between the two of us.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:44.460
Nazuna-chan wants to suck my blood
and I want to become a vampire.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.960
Is there anything more that needs to be said?

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.290
That depends on Nazuna.

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:57.380
You wouldn't understand Yamori-kun,
but we don't trust Nazuna yet.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.790
Maybe she has no intention of
making you her offspring,

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:03.580
and is lying to all of us.

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:05.420
Why you little...

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:09.580
Nazuna-chan told me,
"If you wanna fall in love, go ahead."

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:16.960
I see, I see.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.080
So that's your deal, Nazuna.

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:23.420
Well, then that's good enough!

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:24.710
What does that mean?

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:28.960
Um, I think Nanakusa-san's trying
to hide her embarrassment,

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:32.290
but I think he doesn't have to tell her 
when he falls in love.

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:36.670
She'll suck his blood,
and he can just turn into a vampire whenever.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.630
A kind of unspoken agreement, if you will.

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:42.710
What? That's not romantic at all!

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:47.420
But isn't that more fun,
like a wham-bam, shotgun marriage?

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.130
There she goes again...

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:52.880
That's really unbecoming of Nazuna, don't you think?

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:53.920
I know!

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.540
She could restrain herself a bit, right?

00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:00.380
<i>So Nazuna-chan's the only one who likes dirty jokes.</i>

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.540
Anyway, fine.

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:06.170
We're going to accept you, for now at least.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.630
So we won't suddenly kidnap Yamori-kun and kill him.

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:12.290
Though if you take too long, we may rethink things.

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:13.710
Don't worry.

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:17.040
I intend to become a vampire
no matter how many years it takes.

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:22.630
Uh...

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:25.040
Wh-what is it?

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:31.380
The call of the night

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:33.460
Light it up, moonlight

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.580
Eye caught by blue light

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.880
Neon signs call to the surface and below

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.670
The call of the night

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:41.750
Take me away, midnight

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:43.880
Bloodshot red eyes

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.540
A lullaby for grownups

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:48.830
I liked the night from when I was a kid

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:51.000
I kinda hated going to bed at nine

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.130
It just felt like a waste somehow

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:55.130
I wanted to get to know you better

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:55.960
Hey hey

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.500
The early bird gets the worm

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.460
But forget that, I want to see further and further and further in

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:01.670
Unravel in deep shades

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:04.000
From 12 o'clock to the hours of the ox

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.920
The first time I stepped over you

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.670
No, the first I mounted you was at fourteen, I think

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:10.290
Me, just an ignorant wannabe

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:12.330
Led by the hand, everything was new

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:14.380
That appearance and that fragrance

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.580
That dark skin that fits well with the quiet

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.750
I was drawn in, submissive to the beckoning

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.580
Then you gave me music

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.750
You showed me a woman's naked body

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:26.750
I put my lips to alcohol I'd never drank before

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:28.920
And snuck a cigarette from my pops and lit it

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.540
Things I shouldn't do flood the space

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.330
Things I shouldn't know all over the place

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.710
Hidden in the darkness that comes to greet me

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:36.460
You were always so fickle

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:38.170
The call of the night

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:40.250
Light it up, moonlight

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:42.330
Eye caught by blue light

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.710
Neon signs call to the surface and below

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:46.500
The call of the night

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.540
Take me away, midnight

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:50.630
Bloodshot red eyes

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:53.460
A lullaby for grownups
