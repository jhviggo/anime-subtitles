<i>They're awful.</i>

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.830
<i>I want to hurry up and go home.</i>

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.500
<i>And even if I can't go home,
I'd rather be working at the office.</i>

<i>Are you kidding me?!
Take me home?! What the hell?!</i>

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.830

about going out for drinks.

That place!

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.960

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:06.830

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.170

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.630

<i>Getting paid 2,000 yen.</i>

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:13.960

Uh, yes?

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.000
You look awfully young, but can I ask how old you are?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.380
I'm fourteen.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.080
Oh, can you get up for just a sec?

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.500

WHAT?! FOURTEEN?!

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:06.170
Yes!

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.750
You're in middle school?

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.080
Yes, in my second year.

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.330
Second year...

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.830
I never worked when I was in middle school.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.750
This is my first day, actually.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:19.750
Huh?!

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.250
<i>Maybe he has some complicated reasons.</i>

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.750
<i>Maybe I shouldn't have said that.</i>

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.630
Why are you working?

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.880
"Why", you ask?

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.330
Because I want the money?

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.540
<i>It's not for a kiss.</i>

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.710
<i>Maybe it really is complicated.</i>

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.170
That and...

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.580
Well, let's see...

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.380
There's this thing I want to do.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.380
Something you want to do?

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.710
I stopped going to school,
and because I don't use the energy,

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.170
I couldn't sleep.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.330
And for some reason,
I decided to go out alone at night for the first time.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.750
I don't know what it is about it.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.540
The same streets I always walk on seem oddly exciting,
just because it's at night.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.380
I don't want to lose that feeling.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.000
I want to enjoy the night.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.920
I'm not sure I made any sense,

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.960
but that's the gist of it, I guess.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.250
This area...

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.670
It's not a huge city so there aren't that many cars,

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.460
so you can walk right down the
middle of the road, huh?

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:39.880
Exactly!

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.750
It feels so free, you know?

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.250
Or you can even sing out loud.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.080
And then get embarrassed when
you notice the people nearby!

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.290
When I was around your age, I thought the same thing.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.420
That's ten whole years ago already.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.830
I went out at night for the first time

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.210
and bought a pork bun and tea at a convenience store.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.830
It felt like it was a private place, just for me.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.630
I had forgotten about that.

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.380
Um, did I tell you my name?

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.250
Oh, I heard it from Nazu- from the boss.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.330
Shirakawa-san, right?

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.460
My name is Ko Yamori.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.330
Why did you stop going to school, Yamori-kun?

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:27.130
Because it got boring.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.580
Oh, next let's take a little look at your hand.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:32.630
<i>"A little look"...</i>

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.750
I may not look it, but I used to be a model student.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.420
But well, I just got tired, I guess.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:45.290
A model student?
How far you've fallen, up and about so late.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.710
Me, too.
I'm just a bit tired.

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:52.750
That's why you came here?

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:53.750
Yeah.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.040
The work itself is fun.

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:59.830
But the work can't be done alone, you know?

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.130
Taaaaaake thaaaat!

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.330
I deal with bosses, and colleagues.

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.380
I have to pretend I'm having fun...

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.290
and laugh even if something's not funny.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.040
Uh...

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.380
I had forgotten.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.380
I can't...

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.540
...take it anymore!

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:32.750
I don't wanna go to the office or for after-work drinks!

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.290

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.750
<i>Well, she said herself that she has to go.</i>

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:08.830
<i>But I mean, if she leaves halfway,
maybe I won't get paid...</i>

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:12.080

Why are you holding the door closed?

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:42.880
I need you to do something.

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:50.420
Just do it!

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.830
Okay, whatever.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:54.040
Just don't let her go to work, huh?

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.000
Open that window, Ko-kun.

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:57.000

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:42.880
I can't get up...

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:44.130
You okay?

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:45.710
Why would she be okay?

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:48.460
Kiyosumi-san...

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.630
I'm sorry for the rough handling.

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:55.750
But I thought it would be wrong to let you leave.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.250
I didn't WANT to let you leave.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.710
Why?

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:01.920
You were crying.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:05.540
If something's so bad you cry,
you shouldn't have to do it.

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:11.130
You're still a kid.
You wouldn’t understand.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.790
It's work - my job.

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.790
It's not the same as school!

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.500
<b>The Boss</b>

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:22.170

<b>The Boss</b>

<b>Subject: Re: Re: URGENT!!!!!</b>

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:27.210
A proper adult has to put up with stuff,
even if it's so bad you cry!

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:28.920
Hey now, that's not-

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.130
Nazuna-chan...

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.710
I want to be a vampire.

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:38.710
Huh?

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:40.960
Nazuna-chan is a vampire.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:44.750
I'm planning to have her turn me into a vampire.

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:48.130
At least, it's obvious she's not human, right?

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.670
Like you say, I'm still a kid,

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.080
and I don't know anything about work or society.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.580
I realize I'm naïve.

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:58.710
And probably crazy.

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.500
But!

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.830
Any boss calling you at this hour is even crazier!

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:05.500
It's 2 a.m., you know!

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.710
If you're going to be crazy anyway,
you might as well have fun!

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.250
Plus, vampires don't have to be rational.

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:15.830
Because they're not human.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.420
<i>This is such ridiculous logic.</i>

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:24.380
<i>Basically, he's saying he wants to be a vampire
so he can enjoy the night.</i>

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:27.460
<i>But I admit...</i>

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:29.750
<i>I envy that.</i>

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:32.750
What are you saying?!

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:35.000
You're really weird!

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.500
Huh?! Well, I guess...

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:39.040
Why are you laughing?

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.960
I mean... I mean, THAT'S the reason
you want to be a vampire?!

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.040
That is some EXTREME logic!

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:47.750
<i>Is it?</i>

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:49.750
<i>Maybe it is.</i>

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.080
Well, you said it yourself.

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:55.580
You can walk right down the middle of the road.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.790
How could you ever give that up?

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:03.750
You've got that right.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.540
I remember this feeling.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:22.170
It's not really allowed, but why is this so fun?

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.670
Probably because you're crazy too, Kiyosumi-san.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.920
You're pretty cheeky.

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.460
But I can't keep doing this.

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:38.880
Because I'm an adult.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.750
I'm going to go to work, after all.

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:44.580
I'm obligated...

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.130
and thanks to you I feel a lot less pressure now.

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.460
I hope you get to be one, a vampire.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.330
I wish I could too...

00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:59.920
Kiyosumi-san!

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:08.250
If I get to be a vampire, I'll turn you into one, too.

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:15.630
If you really need to, you can quit being human.

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:19.420
As long as you know that, won't things feel easier?

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:31.380
You know, that was a pretty bold declaration.

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:32.920
Huh? Why?

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:39.330
First of all, you don't even know
if you'll become a vampire,

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.750
and if you're gonna make that businesswoman
your offspring, well...

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:45.040
I mean...

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.460
I need to make her fall in love with me, right?

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.580
Don't say, "fall in love"!

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:50.790
It'll be fine.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:52.630
Girls tend to like me, you know.

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:56.210
Wow, gross...

<b>6th Night: Might as Well Have Fun</b>

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:08.210
Good evening...

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.750
Hey, come up with something fun to do.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.420
You sound like an evil tyrant in power.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.080
Come on, offer up some ideas for once.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:19.380
We'll get tired of the same thing every day, you know?

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:22.420
What about karaoke?

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:26.130
I don't feel like singing right now,
but yeah, stuff like that.

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:27.380
A movie?

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:28.670
A movie, huh?

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.250
Arcade?

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:31.710
Not bad, but...

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:32.920
Darts.

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:34.960
Skateboarding.

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.420
You know you don't do that.

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:37.460
Magic?

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:38.460
Oh, come on!

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:41.170
A-a nighttime pool maybe?

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.580
Are you serious?
A nighttime pool?

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.130
I'm sorry.

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:46.830
We're in for some mad vibes tonight!

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:49.170
Nazuna-chan's talking like a party girl!

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:51.210
What are you, the king of hip?

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:53.000
Huh? Y-yaay!

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:54.540
Time's a wastin'!

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.880
Let's dress to kill and get moving!

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:01.250
Uh, I only brought this tracksuit, though.

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:18.040
<i>"So nighttime pools really are like this,"
was my first thought.</i>

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.420
<i>I also thought,
"I don't even have a swimsuit or anything,"</i>

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:25.170
<i>but we found out they apparently
rent them at the place.</i>

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:29.000
<i>This is a different kind of night and
entertainment from what I know.</i>

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:30.580
A toast to your beautiful eyes.

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:31.250
<i>It's so grown-up.
</i>A toast to your beautiful eyes.<b></b>

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:33.040
<i>It's so grown-up.
</i>A toast to your reflection in them.<b></b>

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:37.750
<i>It's still a pool, but it's completely different
from swimming in phys ed.</i>

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:40.170
<i>The atmosphere's oddly ethereal.</i>

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:48.130
<i>I wonder what Nazuna-chan's swimsuit is like?</i>

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:50.380
<i>I'm excited, I guess?</i>

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:55.210
<i>Well, but that thing she always wears
under her jacket is like a swimsuit, anyway.</i>

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:56.960
<i>This doesn't feel particularly special.</i>

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:00.830
'Suuup? Sorry for the wait.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:05.040
Yo! What's with the bleak face?

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.290
That's not a swimsuit.

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:11.880
Huh? I'm wearing it underneath.

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:13.500
See?

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.130
I'm gonna go grab a drink.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.630
They have booze here, too.

<i>And yet, why?</i>

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:34.420
<i>Why is that more erotic than usual?</i>

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:37.500
Hey, look.
Check out that cute chick.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.330
Whoa, she's mad hot.

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:41.630
She really looks like a doll.

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.130
Think she's alone?

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:44.500
No way, look at her.

'Scuse me, I'd like a beer!

<i>So many people's voices...</i>

You're crazy cute.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.710
Yeah, totally slaying it.

What, really?

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:27.580
That's too bad!

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:29.670

C'mon, hang with us!

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:37.460
Well, I guess if you're gonna pay for stuff,
I might think about it.

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:38.670
What, you serious?

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:39.920
What about your friend?

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.380
Dunno.
Maybe he left?

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:45.040
Like that would happen?

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.000
But hey, we're usually really lazy.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.920
We don't hit on girls that often.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:50.920
Yeah, that's right.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.250

So yeah, we wanna be friends.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.210
Sorry!

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.670

Don't leave your girl alone, man!

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:27.630

Hey, don't be mad!

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:36.710

It was just crowded and not fun at all.

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:57.380
Hearing what other people
thought of you wasn't fun,

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:59.920
and I'm tired from all the people.

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:03.750
Seeing them try to be friends with you so casually...

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:07.040
I kind of didn't like that...

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:16.710
Ko-kun...

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.880

Wh-whoa! Whoa?!

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:28.210
What?! I'm scared!

C'mon, take a look Ko-kun.
