WEBVTT

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.790
Guess I should go.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.880
<b>Komori Housing Complex Council
Nazuna Nanakusa
Ko Yamori</b>

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.290
That day we were accomplices under the apple tree

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.540
We tried stepping over the line

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.630
Immediate black out

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.000
Oops, you're angry...

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.330
Chased away to this unfortunate dimension

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.750
I can't believe I...

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.040
Someone like me...

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.250
Of all people, I couldn't...

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.290
Wait, no way

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.500
I blamed you

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.710
Got hold of a secret

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.080
The fig leaves go right and left

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.540
In a blink of an eye I wake up

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.880
But then I'm falling toward the sky

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.170
I don't know, I just can't stop

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.080
Just one more bite

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.380
Again, Fallin' fallin' down in a spiral, falling on a skyscraper

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.210
Fallin' fallin' two all alone, we don't even notice the curtain call

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.540
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, forever

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.790
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, I let myself go

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.250
And just like that

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.040
The wounds are being filled, yeah

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.830
Again, Fallin' fallin' down in a spiral, falling on a skyscraper

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.790
Fallin' fallin' two all alone, we don't even notice the curtain call

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.130
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, forever

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.670
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, I let myself go

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.880
And just like that

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.790
The wounds are being filled, yeah

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.920
Why don't you come in?

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.630
I'm home.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.500
There's someone here?

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.330
Of course there is.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.630
Welcome home!
Hatsuka-sama!<b></b>

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.040
Hey, everyone.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.790
I did just as I was told!

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.420
Me too, me too!

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.420
I did my very best to make you proud, Hatsuka-sama!

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.880
Yeah? Good job.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.380
<i>What... Â What is this?
</i>She praised you!<b></b>

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.040
I'm so jealous!

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.040
<i>Sama?
</i>I'm so jealous!<b></b>

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.250
<i>What's their relationship?!</i>

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.960
Me too, me too! Say I did good! Please!
I was standing the whole time! Hatsuka-sama, I swear!<b></b>

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.670
Anyway, I'm sorry this is so sudden
but I have a guest tonight.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.880
Can you all leave?

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.500
But why?!

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.250
A guest?! Who is he?!

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.080
It's not fair you're gonna hang out
with some little squirt!

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.130
You won't do as I ask?

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.250
Didn't I say he's my guest?

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.130
And you're going to badmouth him?

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.170
I don't like that kind of behavior.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.420
You can be good and do as I say, can't you?

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.750
<i>So I'm supposed to sit and wait,</i>

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.750
<i>but why is there only one sofa seat?</i>

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.130
<i>Besides, what was the deal with those people?</i>

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.670
<i>They're not family, are they?</i>

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.920
<i>Then I guess they're offspring or potential offspring.</i>

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.920
<i>But there were both men and women.</i>

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.040
<i>I guess that can happen?</i>

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.130
<i>And what's the deal with Hatsuka-san?</i>

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.790
<i>She seems kind of unusual, even compared
to the vampires I've met so far.</i>

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.540
<i>Or maybe she's normal, and I just don't know.</i>

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.250
<i>I just know so little about vampires.</i>

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.880
<i>I didn't get any new information,</i>

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.460
<i>and now the night feels distant.</i>

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.540
<i>I let her turn this night into a disappointment.</i>

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.750
<i>Shoot, and now I'm getting confused!</i>

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.170
Yamori-kun!

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.830
Can you come here for a sec?

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.920
I forgot to grab a towel.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.880
Sorry, but could you bring one for me?

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:19.210
I kinda spaced out.

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.630
I don't usually get one ready myself.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.920
Hey, sorry about that.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.080
I thought you knew already.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.130
Did I give you a shock?

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.540
Um, I just want to get this straight.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.040
You're a guy?

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.250
Yeah.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.130
What's the matter?

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.670
Uh, it's just too much for my brain to take.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.040
Well, I'm surprised too.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.960
I assumed you would've heard from Nanakusa-san.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.210
Nazuna-chan never tells me anything.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.750
Rather, I never made an effort to ask properly,

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.290
even though there must have been
plenty of opportunities.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.830
I don't know.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.080
Nanakusa-san does have a way of being evasive.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.750
What? Are you two fighting or something?

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.670
So yeah, I don't think Ko-kun is going to be a vampire.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:25.880
Sorry.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.500
Uh? What's this all of a sudden?

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.960
Why don't we discuss this proper-

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.420
Even if he doesn't, I want you to leave him alone.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.960
I want you to give him a pass
even if he doesn't become a vampire.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.710
What do you mean by that, Nazuna?

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.630
He has the potential to alert humans to
the existence of vampires,

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.500
and you want us to just leave him alone?

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.880
That's awfully different from what we agreed on.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.170
Stop with the annoyed look!

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.630
So I apologized, didn't I?

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:01.830
What the hell, idiot?

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.960
You think "sorry" is gonna cut it?

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.250
I'll friggin' murder you!

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.380
If you murder me and end it at that, go ahead.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.500
I won't die that easily, anyway.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.130
Nazuna...

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.250
Oh jeez, you pulverized the table.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.630
Niko-chan, you shouldn't take your anger out on stuff.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:19.830
Shut it.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.330
You obviously came here prepared to face
some kind of consequence.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.170
But did you really think it would be that easy?

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.040
Killing amongst ourselves
isn't technically allowed, you know.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.790
Honestly, I'm not feeling it, either.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:41.710
So killing Yamori-kun is way easier
and solves everything.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.040
Then, I'll be the one killing you.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.960
That ain't the way to go about
asking for something, is it?!

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.250
I asked you once before, didn't I?

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.540
Just what is Ko Yamori to you, huh?!

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.710
How's he different from the other humans before him?!

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:03.920
You'd better answer me, Nazuna.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:10.790
If at all possible, I just want to enjoy some love talk
and leave it at that, y'know?

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.580
Huh?! What?!

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.670
You're not sure whether you want
to be a vampire, after all?!

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:20.460
After you went and made a big show of
declaring you're going to be one?!

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:22.330
Uh, well...

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:23.630
Th-that's so lame...

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:24.920
A lot of stuff happened, and-

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.330
Wait! Lame?

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.460
A human who can kill vampires, huh?

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:34.130
You're right, that's a huge problem.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.170
Any idea how she did it?

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.210
I think she deliberately made him drink her blood,

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:42.580
and the vampire said it tasted awful.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.670
And she handed him something, I think.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.920
Then he was exposed to the sunrise,

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.290
and he turned into something like ash
and disappeared.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.080
Ash...

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.960
<i>I thought so.</i>

00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:59.460
I can't say anything for certain,

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:04.750
because to tell you the truth, vampires don't
know much about vampires, either.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:09.080
Humans don't really know that much
about humans either, do you?

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:13.210
You have a vague idea from what you've
learned from smart people,

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:14.790
but you don't fully understand.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.460
Vampires don't do anything other than live life.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:21.420
That's why none of us actually know anything at all.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:26.540
So I don't think Nanakusa-san is trying to
withhold information from you.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.040
You just talked about awful tasting blood,

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:35.040
but we don't really know why there's a difference
between good and bad tasting blood, either.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.250
I-I see...

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.790
By the way, your blood's supposed to be tasty, right?

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:43.580
At least according to Nazuna-chan.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.210
I see, that's intriguing.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:53.000
By the way, you would've been in a fix tonight
if I hadn't given you a place to hide, right?

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.130
Y-you can't tell me I owe you!

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.290
Don't worry.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:00.380
See, I totally look like a girl, don't I?

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:01.960
So come on.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.460
That's beside the point!

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:06.380
H-how come you dress like a girl, anyway?

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:10.170
Because I look good that way, of course.

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:12.080
Th-that's your reason?!

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:14.170
Well, yeah.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:19.460
For some reason, both men and women
are attracted to me this way.

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.080
I see...

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.960
I don't really understand that kind of thing.

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:31.080
I tend to assume people like what they do
or someone's making them do it.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.460
Well, I do enjoy it because I look so good.

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:43.460
Um...

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:46.080
You fell in love once too, right?

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.630
With a vampire?

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.630
Before you turned, were you conflicted at all?

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:52.960
Or scared?

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.830
O-oh, that's mine.

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:57.460
What's this?

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:02.080
Yamori-kun, this might be bad.

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:07.080
Nazuna, you'd better explain yourself.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.420
C'mon, let's talk about love.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:26.040
Do you get what Nanakusa-san was saying?

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.040
Yeah.

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:31.710
If I don't become a vampire,
I could be killed at any point.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.710
That and also that Nazuna-chan's
trying to protect me.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Yeah.

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:42.000
Just so you know, you being killed isn't a definite thing.

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:44.580
Vampires have no clear cut rules.

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:49.880
So I really don't know what will happen to you
and Nanakusa-san from here on out.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.330
But there are consequences.

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:57.830
And sometimes we demand harsher consequences
from each other than from humans.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.290
Right now, you're not the one
in real danger, Yamori-kun.

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:03.880
It's Nanakusa-san.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:11.130
So here's my proposition.

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:15.000
You should become one of my offspring.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.170
Why?

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:22.380
How can you save Nanakusa-san, who's about
to face the consequence for her actions?

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:25.920
By becoming a vampire.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.630
Exactly, that solves everything.

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:30.290
B-but...

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:34.330
It's extremely unlikely that you're going to
fall in love with Nanakusa-san.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:36.710
Nanakusa-san may be odd,

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:39.170
but you're a fourteen-year-old
in the midst of adolescence

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:41.630
and you don't feel even an inkling
of attraction right now.

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:47.130
But still, that doesn't mean it has to be you.

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:49.670
Why? Because I'm a guy?

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.960
Uh, no, I don't mind that...

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.630
My point exactly.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.250
You know now that I'm a guy,

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:04.290
but in all honesty, you don't really care.

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:06.210
I mean, you have a cute face, after all.

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:11.420
It's true; I am pretty cute.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:15.210
Yamori-kun, you don't hold back, do you?

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:16.500
Why are you embarrassed?

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.130
Well, you don't seem like the type who'd say that.

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:20.540
You caught me off guard.

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:25.170
Anyway, being who you are,

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:30.080
I think I'm the only one who can really understand
how you feel as a guy.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:37.210
I'm positive I can turn you into a vampire.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.460
<i>It's true, there's a big divide between men and women.</i>

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.380
<i>I've always felt that the two sides will
never truly understand one another.</i>

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:56.460
<i>But is that really true?</i>

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:04.540
You said I don't feel an inkling of attraction,
but isn't that true towards you, as well?

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.170
Oh, that's easy.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.830
I'm not nice like everyone else.

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:16.210
All I have to do is to trick your brain
into thinking you love me.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:20.830
Romantic attraction is basically like
being brainwashed, anyway.

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:24.920
That's why my offspring all seem really happy.

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:27.250
<i>Uh, are you kidding me?</i>

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:30.920
So yeah, why don't I turn you?

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.130
No thanks.

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.880
It's true, I think there's a big divide
between men and women.

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:39.790
We can't understand each other.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:44.170
But when I think about it,
that has nothing to do with gender.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.750
I've never really understood anyone else in my life.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:53.880
I don't think I'll ever understand Nazuna-chan,
nor will I ever understand you.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:56.750
It's not a matter of gender.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.380
Even if I were a girl...

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:05.250
I'd still want to fall in love with Nazuna-chan.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.080
I think.

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:10.330
Then what are you going to do?

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.250
Niko-chan's pissed.
Who knows what she's going to do?

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:17.750
I know I said, you being killed isn't a definite thing,

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:21.580
but in other words,
that doesn't mean you won't get killed, either.

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:24.040
Are you prepared for that?

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.750
Do you intend to kill me, Hatsuka-san?

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:31.460
If you don't intend to kill me, I figure it'll be okay.

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:34.540
I'm not prepared at all.

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:36.790
But...

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:51.880
...I just don't want Nazuna-chan to be bored, I guess.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:56.330
Thanks! I feel a lot better.

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:57.880
I'm gonna go!

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.580
Hey, boy, you're late.

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:31.290
Nazuna left just a moment ago.

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:34.330
Then Nazuna-chan's okay.
That's good.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:35.880
I don't know about "okay".

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:40.920
She won't be capable of proper
conversation for a while.

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:43.960
It's in return for your safety.

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.210
A cheap consequence wouldn't cut it.

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:50.420
What did you do to Nazuna-chan?

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.420
Where are you going?

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:57.830
I'm going to go look for Nazuna-chan.

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.920
Nazuna said she doesn't want to see you right now.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.880
Will you shut up?!
I want to see her, okay?!

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:14.330
Did he leave already?

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:18.130
Honestly, this is too much.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.380
What am I, stupid?

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.540
I forgot that detective called the cops on me.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:29.540
Hey!

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.880
Hey there, kid, can we talk to you?

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.000
<i>Nazuna-chan, the night isn't all fun and games.</i>

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:37.790
Oh, don't be frightened.

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:39.540
<i>It can be scary or boring.
</i>Oh, don't be frightened.<b></b>

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:41.330
<i>That's definitely true, I guess.</i>

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:42.330
<i>But I wonder why?</i>

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.710
<i>But I wonder why?
</i>We just want a quick word with you.<b></b>

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.170
<i>I was actually scared...</i>

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.420
<i>Actually worried...</i>

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:50.710
What?

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:52.750
<i>But really, to tell you the truth...</i>

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.170
<i>it was kind of fun!</i>

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:00.460
He's fast!

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:10.790

<i>That the night can be so much fun!</i>

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:33.040
<i>I wonder if Ko-kun's pissed?</i>

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:35.830
<i>I hope he isn't.</i>

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:38.920
<i>But man, all I did was lie to him.</i>

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:42.460
<i>I don't really know how to have fun at night.</i>

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:46.250
<i>I go on walks, drink booze, or play video games...</i>

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:48.210
<i>That's about all I know,</i>

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.960
<i>but I tried to act all cool in front of Ko-kun.</i>

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:57.460
<i>I wonder why?</i>

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.290
You're buying booze again.

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:02.000
Nice...

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:09.380
I finally found you.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.250
Wh-why?! Why're you here?!

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:13.960
Because I wanted to see you, duh.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.630
That's not what I mean!

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:17.420
I looked all over for you!

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.460
Huh? Wait...

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.170
What?

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:23.880
A-are you okay?

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.880
Aren't you, like, injured?

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:29.000
Nah, I'm fine.
Don't worry about it.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.630
What?! R-really?
But Niko-san said-

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:33.420
I said I'm fine, didn't I?!

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.710
Nazuna-chan...

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.330
Sure, consequences are important.

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:45.960
But y'know, no amount of beating
is gonna get through to that moron.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.920
Plus violence isn't my thing.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.250
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:51.580
What I like is to talk about love.

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.170
And that's how I ended things, like I promised.

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:57.790
Nazuna-chan, I want to apologize!

00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:00.460
No need, that's all over already.

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.040
Huh?! It's not over though!

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.460
Seriously! It's done!

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:08.080
I was always bored until I met you, Nazuna-chan!

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:09.880
But not anymore!

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:14.540
We're going to go all out and
root for you two lovebirds.

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:17.000
What about you, Nazuna-chan?!

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:21.540
So Nazuna, you'd better do whatever it takes
to make Yamori-kun fall for you.

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:24.580
That's the condition for us not killing him.

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:27.580
Sure, it's been fun.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:31.130
So much so that I forgot that I'd been bored for ages.

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:34.920
That's not any different from our initial agreement, is it?

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:39.920
I hung out with you like a know-it-all just to look cool.

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:43.330
But I never intended for any of it to be a lie.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:45.000
Sorry.

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:49.080
Everything we did was so new and fresh to me.

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:52.710
I'm sorry about our date.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:55.790
But it was fun in the end.

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:57.830
That's why...

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.330
<i>That's why I have to say it.</i>

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:01.920
<i>Ko-kun, Ko-kun, I promise...</i>

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:05.040
Then we're okay!

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.420
Me too! I had fun, too!

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:10.630
Everything was new to me.

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:16.460
If you thought so too, then we just have to
keep finding new things to do!

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.750
You and me both, we're no good at being alone.

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:25.670
Nazuna-chan, I'm going to fall in love with you!

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:30.000
So, I won't let you ever get bored.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.250
Let's stay together!

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.880
Uh, s-sorry!

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:41.330
I got too excited and I wasn't thinking
about how to phrase things!

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:45.500
I'm just glad you're not hurt, Nazuna-chan.

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:49.290
<i>Ko-kun, Ko-kun, I promise...</i>

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:52.250
I was really worried they might actually kill you.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.920
<i>...I'll become a vampire worth falling for.</i>

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:01.250
Cheers!

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:23.380
<b>13th Night</b>

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:25.420
So we're in this, together.

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:31.330
The call of the night

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:33.420
Light it up, moonlight

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.540
Eye caught by blue light

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:37.830
Neon signs call to the surface and below

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:39.630
The call of the night

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:41.710
Take me away, midnight

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:43.830
Bloodshot red eyes

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:46.500
A lullaby for grownups

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:48.790
I liked the night from when I was a kid

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:50.960
I kinda hated going to bed at nine

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:53.080
It just felt like a waste somehow

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.080
I wanted to get to know you better

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:55.920
Hey hey

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.460
The early bird gets the worm

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:00.420
But forget that, I want to see further and further and further in

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:01.630
Unravel in deep shades

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:03.960
From 12 o'clock to the hours of the ox

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.880
The first time I stepped over you

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.630
No, the first I mounted you was at fourteen, I think

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:10.250
Me, just an ignorant wannabe

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:12.290
Led by the hand, everything was new

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:14.330
That appearance and that fragrance

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:16.540
That dark skin that fits well with the quiet

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.710
I was drawn in, submissive to the beckoning

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.540
Then you gave me music

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:24.710
You showed me a woman's naked body

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:26.710
I put my lips to alcohol I'd never drank before

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:28.880
And snuck a cigarette from my pops and lit it

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.500
Things I shouldn't do flood the space

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.290
Things I shouldn't know all over the place

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.670
Hidden in the darkness that comes to greet me

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:36.420
You were always so fickle

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:38.130
The call of the night

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:40.210
Light it up, moonlight

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:42.290
Eye caught by blue light

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:44.670
Neon signs call to the surface and below

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:46.460
The call of the night

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:48.500
Take me away, midnight

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.580
Bloodshot red eyes

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:53.420
A lullaby for grownups
