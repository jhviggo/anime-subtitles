00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.330
Nazuna-chan said my blood was tasty.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.790
And after meeting Nazuna-chan,
I decided I wanted to be a vampire.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.080
So our situation is built on an agreement
between the two of us.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.210
Nazuna-chan wants to suck my blood
and I want to become a vampire.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.790
Is there anything more that needs to be said?

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.920
That depends on Nazuna.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.540
You wouldn't understand Yamori-kun,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.130
but we don't trust Nazuna yet.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.580
Maybe she has no intention of making you her offspring,

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.250
and is lying to all of us.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.330
Why you little-

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.290
Nazuna-chan told me,
"If you wanna fall in love, go ahead."

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.750
I see, I see!

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.880
So that's your deal, Nazuna.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.250
Anyway, fine.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.880
We're going to accept you, for now at least.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.290
So we won't suddenly kidnap Yamori-kun and kill him.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.040
Though if you take too long, we may rethink things.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.500
Don't worry.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.710
I intend to become a vampire
no matter how many years it takes.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.210
Wh-what is it?

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.580
Oh!

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.580
Huh?

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.670
Yamori-kun, "no matter how many years" isn't possible.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.080
The reason being...

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.330
vampires have a time limit of one year.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.250
Time limit?

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.500
If a human doesn't become a vampire within one year of
when they have their blood sucked for the first time,

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.880
they will never become a vampire.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.130
Basically, they don't qualify.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.170
I forgot about that!

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.380
Huh?

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.040
Whaaaaaaat?!

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.080
Anyway, I'm taking Ko-kun back.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.630
Got it.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.420
Look what we brought!

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.960
Yeah, let's drink!

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.460
Cheers!

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.250
Oh, yeah, Ko-kun, I forgot.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.130
There's one more thing.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.710
There's something else?

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:18.210
Yeah! That's the stuff!

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.040
You know, for the massage the other day.
Yeah! That's the stuff!<b></b>

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.500
You know, for the massage the other day.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.250
Uh, with Kiyosumi-san?

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.460
What about it?

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.580
'Kay, time to go?

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.000
D-did you have to do that here?!

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.460
Huh? Quit yapping.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.000
You have a problem with that?

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.380
<i>That was one intense night.</i>

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.420
<i>I could have been killed, right?</i>

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.210
<i>By those people?</i>

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:55.960
What's up?

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.130
Well, you're pretty unusual even for a vampire, huh?

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.210
What do you mean, "even for a vampire"?

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.750
I'm not sure how to say this,

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.580
but I'm glad you're the one I met, Nazuna-chan.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.080

So yeah, I now have a time limit.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.580
A limit of one year.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.630
Isn't that pretty bad?

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:57.960
You think so too?

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.330
Yeah, a future dream is something
you spend years to achieve.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.580
But being barred for life if you fail after
trying for one year is pretty harsh, isn't it?

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.670
No, I don't mean that.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.040
A human who knows too much about vampire habits
is a threat, so they'll kill you.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.170
They said something like that, didn't they?

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.710
Yeah.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.580
But they let me off on that one.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:26.580
Well, that's only because they realized you
want to become a vampire, right?

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.210
Doesn't that mean if you aren't a vampire a year later,

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.420
you'll be a human who knows a lot about vampires
but can never be a vampire yourself?

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.250
When that happens, won't they kill you?

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.080
Uh, seriously?!

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.000
You really didn't realize, huh?

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.750
What do I do, Akira?!

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.460
Do I only have a year left to live?!

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:52.750
Calm down.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.330
You're going to fall in love, aren't you?
With Nazuna Nanakusa?

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.250
I can at least give some advice.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.540
Akira!

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.130
I'm pretty screwed, aren't I?

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.330
<i>Having said that, I wonder if he'll be okay?</i>

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.210
<i>I don't think we can count on that woman.</i>

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.960
<i>Besides, why is Ko so good at studying</i>

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.380
<i>but oblivious when it comes to that kind of thing?</i>

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.750
<i>I see...</i>

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.210
<i>Ko's act of pretending to be
a model student must come from-</i>

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:43.880
Huh?

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.540
Mahiru?

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:50.500
Oh, it's you, Akira.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.710
Good morning.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.630
What are you doing?

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.830
Yeah, sorry.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.460
I didn't think anyone would come this way.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.500
I was totally zonked out!

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:04.210
Why?

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.330
I was out having fun all night.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:09.540
Seriously?

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.130
Is going out at night trending or something?

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:13.790
What do you mean?

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:14.790
Nothing.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.710
Last time I checked, you were a pretty good student.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.000
You were out all night?

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.420
What were you doing?

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.080
Well, actually...

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.040
there's this person I like...

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:35.460
Th-that's kind of corny!

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:37.420
Say what you want.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:42.500
Apparently the person can only make
time at night, so that's why.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.000
It's someone older?

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.040
I hope it's not a vampire.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.080
What? What's that supposed to mean?

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:50.210
Oh, it's nothing.

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:52.790
Anyway, forget about my stuff!

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.880
By the way, Ko hasn't been coming
to school lately, has he?

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.040
Yeah, seems that way.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.830
I knew it.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:04.630
I thought I hadn't seen him around.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.500
I hope the three of us can hang out again.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.130
Did the three of us ever hang out at all?

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:14.330
What? Ouch!

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.420
Am I the only one who thought we were friends?

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.500
You have so many friends, Mahiru.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.130
You always have other people around you,

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.790
so I don't have that many memories
of us three being together.

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:27.670
Aw, you're making me blush.

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:30.630
I don't think I said anything to make you blush.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.500
Why hasn't Ko been coming?

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:37.420
Have you talked to him recently?

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:39.540
Kind of.

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:40.790
Was he doing okay?

00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:42.880
I see.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:45.750
Okay, then, I'll contact him as well,

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:48.540
but if you see him again tell him I was worried, too.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:50.670
Will do.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.420
So Mahiru has a love interest, huh?

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:58.580
And someone older, at that.

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:01.130
That's kind of unexpected, I guess?

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:05.960
Akira! Ko!

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:07.880
What're you doing?

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:11.080
He's watching ants carry bugs to their nest!

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.580
Is that fun?

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:15.960
Kind of!

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.630
That sounds fun too,

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.670
but we don't have enough people for baseball.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:20.880
Can you join us?

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:23.920
I don't know the rules.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.540
Don't worry!

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:27.290
I'll teach you, okay?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.250
C'mon, Mahiru, please?!

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.500
I already told them you'd come!

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.380
Sorry, man, honestly!

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:43.960
There's this thing I really can't miss.

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:46.250
You always say that these days!

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.080
Well, I've hardly had time to sleep lately.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.420
Come on, people, get some proper sleep.

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.170
If it isn't Yamori-kun!

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:57.420
'Sup?

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.000
Huh? Who do you mean?

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.250
You must be mistaken and now I gotta go, bye!

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.290
Don't run!

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:10.670
Don't worry, kid.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:12.130
I'm not gonna kill you today!

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:14.830
By the way, I heard your blood's mad tasty?

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:16.290
I'm so intrigued!

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:17.580
You totally intend to drink it!

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:21.080
So how were things after that?

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.290
Any progress?

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:26.790
I'm not sure what to do.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:33.420
To become a vampire,
I have to fall in love with Nazuna-chan,

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:37.210
and I meant to do that
no matter how many years it took, but...

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.500
The one year limit.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.710
So now that won't work anymore.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:48.130
Nazuna-chan's stance is to
go ahead and do what I want,

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.710
but she's not going to actively turn me into a vampire.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.330
I have to figure it out.

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.460
I have to be the one to change.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.500
But...

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.210
how do I fall in love?

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:02.580
To like someone...

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.420
To fall in love, what is that like?

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:12.670
<i>H-holy crap!</i>

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.170
<i>A pure and innocent middle schooler asking,
"What is love like?"</i>

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:17.540
<i>Ahhhh!</i>

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:19.380
<i>Is this for real?</i>

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.040
<i>I can't even!</i>

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.250
I-I see...

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:30.960
Right!

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.960
Just leave it to Love Master Kikyo Seri-chin
to help you out!

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:36.790
"Love Master Seri-chin"...

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:40.380
Here's a surefire way for a guy and girl to get closer...

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.170
Nazuna-chan, let's go on a date!

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:45.380
Don't wanna.

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:54.250
Oh, found some diamonds! All right!

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:55.750
Because you're gaming?!

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.420
You won't go on a date with me
because you're GAMING?!

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.040
I mean, look at this Ko-kun!

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.080
I found diamonds!
Isn't that sweet?!

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.330
When I don't understand their value,
I have no idea what's so sweet about it!

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:07.580
You sad human being.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:08.790
Take that.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.210
How could you do that?!

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:13.790
I'm sorry.

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:16.460
Thank goodness these recent consoles autosave,

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:18.630
but if this was a retro game it could've been awful!

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:20.670
Fine, fine.
Let's just go on a date, okay?

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:22.170
He doesn't get it at all!

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:23.420
Come on, forget about it.

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:24.420
Jeez!

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:27.330
So what?

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.290
I'm really not into this date idea.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:30.880
Come on, just give it a try.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.880
<b>Cinema Mode 1 & 2</b>

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:36.250
Honestly, you can't do anything without me.

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:39.210
Wh-what? That's so not true!

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:40.710
Don't be so stubborn.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.630
You know I understand you more than anyone.

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:45.250
I hate you, okay?!

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:46.330
You're such a liar.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:46.880
Hey, Ko-kun...
You're such a liar.<b></b>

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.080
Hey, Ko-kun...
Just say you love me.<b></b>

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:50.000
Y-yes?

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:51.750
Are you trying to get on my nerves?

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:54.500
Th-that definitely wasn't my intention.

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:58.540
Why else would you choose a romcom, then?

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:01.920
All I can do is clench my face muscles
and try to stay sane!

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:05.000
S-sorry, shall we leave?

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:10.500
<i>Uh, what's next?</i>

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:11.130

Wh-what did you think about the movie?

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:21.000
Sorry, never mind!

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.460
<i>I know!</i>

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:28.540
<i>I know I shouldn't, but I can't stop
following the advice word-for-word!</i>

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:32.580
Hey, someone put ideas in your head, didn't they?

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:34.830
Who was it?

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.250
No, uh...

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:39.000
Here, take this.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:42.500
Oh, you probably shouldn't tell her
you heard this from me.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.710
'Cuz Nazuna hates me.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:48.920
Hey!

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.130
Seri, huh?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.790
A movie, a café, the arcade, karaoke,
an aquarium, window shopping,

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:03.000
and finally, a meal overlooking the nightscape, huh?

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:06.960
Lame.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.170
I'm going home.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:15.880
<i>Failing your first date kinda kills you inside.</i>

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:19.380
<i>What did I do wrong?!</i>

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.580
<i>Well, everything, of course!</i>

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:31.670
I'm hungry.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:57.580
Yo!

00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:58.790
Nazuna-chan...

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:03.330
I figured it would suck too much for you
if we ended things the way we did.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.710
Wanna do the last bit of the date properly, at least?

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:08.460
The last bit?

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:13.960
A meal overlooking the night lights, right?

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:16.540
Tell me, Ko-kun.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.580
What is a date, exactly?

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.630
Is this a date?

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:30.210
Then we're always going on dates, aren't we?

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.460
Hey! Long time no see!

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.960
Just a few streets away and
there are a lot fewer people around.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:52.830
Yeah...

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:56.670
U-um, is this okay?

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.710
Weren't you out with friends?

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:01.210
Oh, it's fine.

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:02.420
I told them what's up.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:07.710
And I mean, I'm surprised you knew it was me.

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:08.960
It's been ages.

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.000
Of course I could tell!

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.210
We're friends, aren't we?

<i>"From what point are people friends?"</i>

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:19.790
<i>is a question I always have,</i>

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:24.330
<i>but I'm pretty certain that Akira and Mahiru-kun
were most definitely my friends.</i>

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:27.920
<i>Still, Akira was a girl,</i>

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:33.250
<i>and a part of me back in elementary school
wasn't too sure how to interact with her.</i>

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.830
<i>On the other hand, things were easy with Mahiru-kun.</i>

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.540
<i>From my perspective...</i>

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:44.420
<i>from anyone's perspective really, I'm sure of it.</i>

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.790
<i>Mahiru-kun was perfect.</i>

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.830
<i>He has good grades, excells at sports,</i>

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:53.880
<i>and never hesitates to get up in front of people.</i>

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:58.290
<i>All the teachers trust him, but he isn't too serious.</i>

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:01.210
<i>To top it off, his family runs a flower shop.</i>

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:03.460
<i>All of his factors are just so amazing.</i>

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.750
<i>I'm sure nobody has anything bad
to say about Mahiru-kun.</i>

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:12.000
<i>So being told I'm a friend of his
makes me super happy.</i>

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:17.540
You have kind of a unique presence,
so I can tell right away, like,

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.420
"Hey, that's Ko!"

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.460
Y-you think so?

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:25.420
You're the one who stands out.
I could spot you anywhere.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.540
I guess we always noticed each other
but never got the chance to talk, huh?

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:31.960
Y-yeah, me too.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.790
I'm happy I get to see you for the first time in-

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:36.080
This conversation's a little too corny for me.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.420
Whoa, you startled me!

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:39.420
Yo.

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.540
Are you heading home now?
It's awfully late.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:43.250
No, I just got up.

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:44.540
That's awfully early!

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:46.500
Is it early?

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.130
Akira's sleep cycle is way out of whack.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:51.290
I defintiely don't want to hear that from you.

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:56.380
You're skipping school and
fooling around with a girl at night?

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:59.210
That's right!
Tell him, Mahiru!

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:01.420
Tell him he should at least come to school.

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:03.210
<i>What's the big deal?</i>

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:06.000
What do you do with her, specifically?

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.540
We go on walks, play video games...

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:12.960
Spending time with her...

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:14.540
Is it fun?

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:16.080
Uh, yeah.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:18.290
I see.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.500
Oh, sorry you two.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:23.920
I'm supposed to meet someone.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.130
They're already there.

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:26.880
I should go.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.170
Oh, okay.

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.080
Ko...

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:36.080
Thanks, you've encouraged me a bit.

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:37.750
See you!

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:44.920
I don't know what just happened,
but Mahiru-kun thanked me.

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:46.630
I'm so happy!

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:49.880
You know, around Mahiru you really get corny.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.380
Wh-what do you mean?!

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:52.920
I mean, it's Mahiru-kun!

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.710
Fine, fine, he's your role model.

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:57.670
He's everyone's role model!

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:02.130
Well, actually...

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.080
there's this person I like...

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.080
I'm going to go home to sleep again.

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.880
You're looking for Nazuna Nanakusa, aren't you?

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.920
Yeah.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.130
Goodnight.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.080
That wandering Ko-kun!

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:27.170
Where'd he go?

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:39.630
Nazuna-chan!

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:41.880
I finally found you!

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.290
What's wrong?

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:47.920
It seems illicit with a middle schooler, doesn't it?

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.250
Huh? What does?

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:50.790

I take my eyes off you and you disappear right away!

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.880
That's you, isn't it?!

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.290
