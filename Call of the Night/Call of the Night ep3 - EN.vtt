00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:07.380
Yamori...

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.210
What are you doing?

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:12.750
Akira...

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.040
I keep meaning to ask,

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.330
but do you really have no friends at all?

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.670
Uh, what's with the face?

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.170
From what point are people "friends"?

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.080
What?

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.630
What do you mean by that?

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.540
Exactly what it sounds like.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.710
From what point?

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.420
When you think they're friends, I guess?

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.170
When you think they are?

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.830
Oh, sorry.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.080
That's still too complicated for you, huh, Ko-kun?

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:02.920
Sorry.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.960
But considering you can't just ask,
is it okay to assume someone's a friend?

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.630
Oh right, 'cuz you have no friends.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.710
Hey, I did have friends when I was little, you know!

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.790
We played together a lot.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:25.460
But I thought calling someone a friend
when you haven't seen them for years might be rude.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.540
So it's not that you don't want friends.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.580
This sad little transceiver...

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.290
I think I got it because I wanted to
communicate with someone.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.750
Does that mean you thought you wanted a friend?

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.540
Maybe?

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.170
I'm not sure.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.880
<b>Komori Housing Complex Council
Nazuna Nanakusa
Ko Yamori</b>

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.290
That day we were accomplices under the apple tree

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.540
We tried stepping over the line

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.630
Immediate black out

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.000
Oops, you're angry...

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.330
Chased away to this unfortunate dimension

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.750
I can't believe I...

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.040
Someone like me...

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.250
Of all people, I couldn't...

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.290
Wait, no way

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.500
I blamed you

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.710
Got hold of a secret

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.080
The fig leaves go right and left

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.540
In a blink of an eye I wake up

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.880
But then I'm falling toward the sky

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.130
I don't know, I just can't stop

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.040
Just one more bite

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.330
Again, Fallin' fallin' down in a spiral, falling on a skyscraper

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.210
Fallin' fallin' two all alone, we don't even notice the curtain call

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.540
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, forever

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.790
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, I let myself go

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.250
And just like that

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.040
The wounds are being filled, yeah

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.830
Again, Fallin' fallin' down in a spiral, falling on a skyscraper

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.750
Fallin' fallin' two all alone, we don't even notice the curtain call

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.080
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, forever

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.670
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, I let myself go

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.880
And just like that

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.790
The wounds are being filled, yeah

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.040
Why do you have my transceiver?

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.790
"Why"?

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.250
I never threw it out because
you gave it to me, remember?

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.250
Huh?

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.630
<i>Wait...</i>

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:34.830
<i>What's going on?</i>

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.670
<i>I gave it to her?</i>

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.330
We were always in different classes,

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.500
and you became a lot more outgoing
around sixth grade

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.170
and made a lot of friends.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.460
I kind of missed my chance to talk to you again.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.500
I waited for you to send a call signal but you never did.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.170
I thought you had forgotten about it, so I left it.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.210
But you haven't been to school lately so...

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.710
Well, I called to see how you were.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.710
Then I heard a sound from nearby.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.460
That was a surprise.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.080
H-hold on just a sec!

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.210
That transceiver...
Did I hand it to you?

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:10.210
No.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.830
I thought so, then-

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.880
But you left it on our mailbox, remember?

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.420
<i>I never knew Akira's room number until now!</i>

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.580
Akira...

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.330
Uh...

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.080
But anyway, I'm glad you seem okay.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.920
Everyone else updated their image of you
with what you're like now,

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.000
but you used to be pretty gloomy, you know?

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.040
I was worried.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.670
Because we're friends.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.290
Friends?

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:50.380
You were standoffish and I wasn't sure
you really thought of me as your friend,

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.830
but you thought about it in your own way
and gave me a token of how you felt.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.710
It made me happy, so thanks.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.500
<i>This... this misunderstanding...</i>

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.790
<i>This is really bad, isn't it?</i>

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.210
Hey!

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.790
Come play with us, Ko.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.170
What are you doing?

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.670
I'm watching some ants carry a dead insect.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.250
Seriously, what are you doing?

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.250
It's pretty fun.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.750
You don't have to run around to play, do you?

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.580
I'm having fun with everyone in my own way,
so don't worry about me.

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.210
We're friends, aren't we?

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.210
Huh?

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.250
Uh, I don't...

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.040
Well, I guess?

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.330
Oh, good!

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.000
A-Akira...

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.080
It's been a while.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.290
Wait, why are you in your uniform?

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:34.500
Are you going home now?

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.960
Of course not.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.210
I'm heading out now.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.460
But it's 4 a.m.!
The middle of the night!

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.670
You mean early morning.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.000
I always wake up early.

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.420
So I take walks in the morning before school.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.630
<i>I'd never do that.</i>

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.080
What are you doing, Yamori?

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.790
Taking a walk on the way home... I guess?

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.250
Oh, hey then...

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.710
Can we meet again, same time tomorrow?

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.130
Yeah? What's up, Ko-kun?

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.330
I was just about to go to sleep. Over.

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:09.290
Nazuna-chan, I've got news.

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:10.290
Huh?

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:12.710
Apparently, I did have a friend.

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:14.500
One friend.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.080
Only one?

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:19.500
G'night.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.750
Seems like you're going home earlier
these days, Ko-kun.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.290
Really? But it's already 3:30 a.m.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:42.500
Are you kidding?

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.630
The night's just beginning, yo!

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.830
Definitely not just beginning.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.500
You do your thing and then leave right away...

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.580
So this is just a physical relationship, huh?

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.920
If anything, that pertains to you, Nazuna-chan!

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.540
It's okay, I don't mind.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:03.040
You really get a kick out of that, don't you?!

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.750
You're going to go see another woman, aren't you?

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.420
I know about that.

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:12.630
Um, n-no, it's not like that...

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:17.830
Uh, for real?

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:19.630
N-no...

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:22.630
No! No!

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.290
It really isn't like that at all!

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:25.500
Really!

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:27.830
R-really!

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:29.460
Anyway, see you tomorrow!

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:30.750
Bye, Nazuna-chan!

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.000
Ugh, I can't drink any more...

00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:37.500
Yeah...

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.710
Akira!

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:50.210
Yo.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:53.710
You ran here?

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.000
Uh, yeah.

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.420
<i>After hanging out with Nazuna-chan,</i>

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.750
<i>it's become my routine to meet with Akira
before she goes to school.</i>

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:08.380
<i>Though it's not like we really talk that much.</i>

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.380
<i>We just make random small talk sometimes.</i>

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:17.460
<i>I mean, didn't she used to be more talkative and lively?</i>

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:20.670
<i>I feel like she wasn't quite like this.</i>

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:24.670
What?

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.130
Well...

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.750
I just wondered if it's fun for you hanging out with me?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.750
Is it not fun for you, Yamori?

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.420
It's not that it's not fun...

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.290
Then that's fine.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.460
It's pretty fun for me.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.250
<i>Huh...</i>

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.540
<i>If I'm wrong, that's totally fine...</i>

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.750
<i>but is this, like, you know...</i>

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.210
<i>Does she like me or something?</i>

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.210
<i>If she does...</i>

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:07.250
I see how it is.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:08.710
Wait, what? Who's that?

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:11.630
I was wondering what you were doing behind my back.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:13.580
<i>Sh-she's pissed?</i>

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:14.830
<i>Is she pissed?!</i>

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:16.460
<i>Crap, crap!</i>

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:17.830
<i>What do I do? What do I do?!</i>

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:19.920
<i>What do... What... What... What do I do?!</i>

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.830
What'cha doing, playing hanky-panky
in a place like this?

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.040
Huh? Huh?

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.250
You go, you!

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.000
Uh, hanky... What's that?!

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.210
Well, of course!

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:30.420
What else would a young boy and girl
be doing this late,

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:31.790
other than playing hanky-panky?

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:34.420
"Hanky-panky"?
What does that even mean?!

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:35.830
Uh, um...

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:37.290
Do you know this person, Yamori?

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:38.500
Well, yeah...

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.960
Oh, no need to worry!

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.380
My relationship with him is purely physical,
so you can relax, missy.

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.880
Don't say it like that!

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:49.330
Y-Yamori, it's okay that you're not coming to school,

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.290
but you shouldn't have too much risky fun.

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:52.830
N-no! It's not like that!

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:53.880
You hear that, Ko-kun?

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.880
Will you shut up, Nazuna-chan?!

00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:59.500
Ko-kun... Nazuna-chan...

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.460
So that's what it's like, huh?

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:06.130
What part of that registered with you?

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.250
Like I said, it's purely physical.

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:09.460
Shut up, jeez!

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.500
You like her, don't you?

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.170
That's great.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.540
Don't say he likes me, how embarrassing.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.040
<i>She's blushing...</i>

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.460
Aw, jeez! Enough of that!

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:22.500
You schoolkids like to link everything to romance!

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.380
Uh, why is your face all red?

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.380
Shut it! Keep your mouth shut, kid!

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:28.790
Honestly! Do we have to do this?

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.630
Ko-kun, stand up a sec.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.420
Okay...

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:37.920
I'll show you.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.130
You better not look away.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:43.290
Uh, w-wait! Really?!

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:55.920
Pl-please, st-stop it!

00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:00.080
Don't do it in front of my friend!

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.670
Ahh, delicious!

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:05.250
What? What was that?

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:06.960
What's that?

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:08.830
Your neck...

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.710
She drank your blood?

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:15.460
You... What are you?!

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:22.210
A vampire, of course.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.960
<b>3rd Night: A Lot Came Out</b>

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:37.670
Beer okay for you guys, too?

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:39.000
Why would that be okay?

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:42.540
Excuse me, can I get the breakfast special
with some hot coffee?

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:43.880
You, Yamori?

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.580
Uh, then I'll have a hot coffee, too.

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:48.040
Understood.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.880
What? You guys are no fun.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.460
You can't drink alcohol if you're under-aged.

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:56.790
Yamori, I've got to ask you again.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:58.250
What's with this person?

00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:59.380
Uh, well...

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.790
'Scuse me! Another beer!

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:08.170
Why are you letting her drink your blood?

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.460
Is this a usual thing?

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.330
Does it have anything to do with
you not coming to school?

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:21.500
I thought you might not want to talk about it,
so I made a point of not asking...

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.920
but why did you stop coming to school?

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.670
Who cares if he doesn't go to school?

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:29.460
As if it's worth anything.

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:31.960
Will the monster please stay quiet for bit?

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.790
"M-monster"?

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.130
Hey, Ko-kun, this girl's really something!

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.710
'That so?

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:42.130
Akira...

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:43.330
What?

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:46.210
I feel bad that I never told you,

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:50.250
but I don't really know how to explain it.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.670
I thought I was getting by fine at school,

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:57.500
but then I just couldn't be bothered anymore.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:59.960
I wasn't having fun.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.040
When that suddenly happens,

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.750
how are you supposed to deal with that emotion?

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:08.040
It's the same for me.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.080
Every day, I don't enjoy being at school or at home.

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:12.830
But I have to go.

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:16.960
Sometimes, I can't tell if my friends are still friends.

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:20.750
So I was glad I ran into you
for the first time in a while, Yamori.

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:24.080
And seeing your face looking like
it did back in elementary school.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:31.540
Yamori, come to school with me.

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:35.330
It's more fun for me with you around.

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:37.420
Akira...

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.040
You're interesting, missy.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.040
What's your name again?

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.040
I'm Nazuna Nanakusa, a vampire.

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:00.290
Akira Asai, human.

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:05.000
I mean, I still not sure I believe this whole vampire thing.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.170
You don't have to believe me.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:09.790
I'm still just a vampire either way.

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:14.040
Asai-chan, you're Ko-kun's friend, aren't you?

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:16.670
I am.

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.630
You hadn't seen him in a while?

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:21.540
What were you doing all this time?

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.670
Didn't you think to contact him?

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:35.670
I'm leaving.

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:37.630
Wait, what?! Nazuna-chan?!

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:45.580
Nazuna-chan left without paying her bill.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.080
What's with that person?

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:52.790
Yamori?

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:54.000
Use this!

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.960
<i>So is she angry?</i>

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.130
<i>Because of Akira?</i>

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:08.880
<i>But is she really?</i>

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.670
<i>I mean, Akira's just a friend,</i>

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:15.080
<i>and she seemed like she was having fun,
and she even had beer...</i>

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:17.670
Uh...

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.290
Are you angry?

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:22.630
I'm not angry.

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:23.420
But you are.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:24.580
I said I'm not angry.
But you are.<b></b>

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:27.710
Then what is it?

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:32.170
How am I supposed to know if you don't tell me
what you're angry about, Nazuna-chan?!

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:33.670
Argh, shut up!

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:35.500
Just shut up, you idiot!

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:36.920
You goody-goody piece of crap!

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:38.960
Think for yourself, dimwit!

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.380
So you are angry-

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:44.960
Hey! Where are you going?!

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.880
Dammit, what is Nazuna-chan so angry about?!

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:55.460
Dammit, I'm not gonna lose sight of you!

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.130
I totally lost sight of her...

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.580
She's nowhere...

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:13.000
<i>I don't get why she's angry.</i>

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:14.880
<i>And is this a fight we're having?</i>

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.250
Ow...

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.000
I hope none of my teeth broke.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.170
Uh, Nazuna-chan?

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.790
Um, I'm sorry.

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:44.420
Over.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.330
About what?

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.790
Because you're angry.

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:56.380
What, you apologize because someone's angry?

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:00.960
Because I was seeing a friend in secret.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.290
What? Why should I get angry over that?

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.040
Um...

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.130
It's great that you have a friend.

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:12.460
Nazuna-chan...

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:17.540
I've hardly ever been in a fight with someone before,
so I really don't get it -

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.420
why you're angry.

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.250
So I want you to tell me if you can.

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:23.920
And...

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.880
I want to make up with you, Nazuna-chan.

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:34.630
Our relationship warrants making up, huh?

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.000
N-Nazuna-chan?

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:40.790
What we have is purely physical.
And you want to make up?

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:43.080
Can we put that aside for a moment?

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:45.960
I'm not angry, really.

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:48.000
I just got ticked off, that's all.

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:51.080
<i>Angry and ticked off are different?</i>

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:54.080
Asai-chan, was it? Your friend?

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:58.330
Remember she said, "Come with me to school"?

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Why couldn't you answer right away?

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.130
Huh?

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:06.580
That's what got to you?

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.710
Well, yeah...

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:15.880
Nazuna-chan, at the moment,
there's no way I'd go to school.

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:17.210
Huh?

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:23.580
The reason I hesitated was because
I don't know how to tell a human friend

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.630
that I won't go because
I want to become a vampire.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.250
Touché.

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:32.330
Right?

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:36.460
What happened to you?

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:38.080
There's blood on you.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.330
Oh, I tripped just now.

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:44.330
Oh my, a lot came out.

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:45.880
What are you say-

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:00.500
You said "human friend."

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:03.380
Does that mean you have a vampire friend, too?

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.250
I won't take any more blood from you today.

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.790
See you tomorrow, friend.

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:18.710
Nazuna-chan...

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:21.540
Friends...

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:24.330
don't usually kiss and stuff.

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:31.380
The call of the night

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:33.460
Shine on me moonlight

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.580
Eye caught by blue light

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.880
The two-faced sides of neon lights

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.670
The call of the night

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:41.750
Take me away, midnight

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:43.880
Bloodshot red eyes

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.540
A lullaby for grownups

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:48.830
Loved the nights since I was a kid

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:51.000
I kinda hated going to bed at nine

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.130
It just felt like a waste somehow

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:55.130
I wanted to get to know you better

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:55.960
Hey hey

00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:57.500
The early bird catches you know what

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.460
I wanna see deeper, deeper, deeper

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:01.670
Unravel in deep shades

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:04.000
From 12 o'clock to 2 o'clock

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.920
The first time I stepped over you

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.670
No, the first I mounted you was at fourteen, I think

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:10.290
Me, just an ignorant wannabe

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:12.330
Led by the hand, everything was new

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:14.380
Your physique and that scent

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.580
That dark skin that fits well with the quiet

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.750
I was drawn in, submissive to the beckoning

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.580
Then you gave me music

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.750
You showed me a woman's naked body

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:26.750
Sipped on booze I'd never had

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:28.920
Smoked my old man's butts

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.540
Flooded with don't do's

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.330
Smeared with shouldn't know's

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.710
Under the screen of darkness, coming to get us

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:36.460
You're always so capricious

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:38.170
The call of the night

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:40.250
Shine on me moonlight

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:42.330
Eye caught by blue light

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.710
The two-face sides of neon lights

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:46.500
The call of the night

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.540
Take me away, midnight

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:50.630
Bloodshot red eyes

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:53.460
A lullaby for grownups
