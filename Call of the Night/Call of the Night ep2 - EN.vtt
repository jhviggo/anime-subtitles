00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.250
<b>Ko Yamori</b>

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.040
It's another great night out!

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.330
That's not quite right, boy.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.460
Huh? It's not?

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.210
It's true I think of sucking blood like eating,
but it's also a way to make offspring.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.920
Under certain conditions,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.830
drinking a person's blood can turn them into a vampire,

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.210
and that's how we vampires produce more offspring.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.960
Which means...

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.080
Sucking blood is like eating and
copulating at the same time!

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.830
Why do you always say copulating?

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.000
Huh? You don't know?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.170
Copulating means to unite the stamen and the pistil...

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.670
I know that!
That's not what I mean!

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.500
Come on, have you forgotten your objective?

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.830
Why are you here, anyway?

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.290
Well, not that I care either way.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.500
Of course I remember.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.210
It's what I want to be someday.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.920
I want to be a vampire.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.710
That's why I'm here.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.460
Got it, got it!

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.880
That's why...

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.170
I said I got it!
That's why...<b></b>

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.080
...I need to fall in love with you, Nazuna Nanakusa!

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.960
I got it, jeez!

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.170
So what's your request, then?

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.790
When I said I wanted to be a vampire,
you were about to say something.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.460
Your blood...

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.210
I just want another taste.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.460
Okay, sure.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.670
Want some now?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.210
H-hey!

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.750
Why would you show me that?!

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.250
You perv! You slutty perv!

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.710
Man, you took me by surprise...

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.290
Cover that up, quick.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.250
You're such a kinky kid, you know that?

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.580
What the heck are you talking about?

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.040
Plus your reaction's sketchy.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.540
Seriously, you can't look all,
"Drink my blood now [heart]" like that.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.880
That's way too lewd.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.290
Besides, you gotta think about timing.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.580
Timing?

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.670
<i>When a person falls in love with a vampire
and has that vampire drink their blood,</i>

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.670
<i>only then will they turn into a vampire.</i>

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.460
<i>In other words, if the person thinks
nothing of the vampire,</i>

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.250
<i>they'll stay human no matter how much blood they give.</i>

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.380
<i>That's why I have to fall in love with her.</i>

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.460
<i>This is the story of my quest to fall in love...</i>

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.210
<i>with a vampire.</i>

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.380
Hey, did you know?

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.670
Your blood tastes super good.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.290
Where is Nanakusa-san?

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.290
I can't find her anywhere.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.670
It's not like we have a set time or place.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.000
<i>Somehow, things look kind of pretty.</i>

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.460
Let's hit 'nother one! 'nother one!

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.080
Nah, we shouldn't.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.500
I wanna drink!

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.880
Are you listening to me? Jeez!

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.210
I wanna!

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.880
<i>I'll go back near my place...</i>

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.960
<i>and look for Nanakusa-san.</i>

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:48.670
<i>But even if she sucks my blood now,
it's not like I'll get to be a vampire.</i>

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.000
<i>Then I guess I don't absolutely
have to see her every night.</i>

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.460
Yo!

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.000
"Yo"? Give me a break!
I looked all over for you!

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.330
Where were you?

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.170
Oh yeah, sorry 'bout that.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.830
I was wandering around looking for
some rando to suck blood from.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.420
You slutty she-devil.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.500
S-slutty she-devil?!

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:23.960
You're awful.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.580
What about me, huh?

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.580
What do you mean, "slutty she-devil"?!

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.080
You think you're so clever with words!

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.460
What's the big deal if I suck someone else's blood?

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.290
You eat both rice and bread, don't you boy?

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:36.920
Same difference, right?

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.130
Like a meal?

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.460
Yeah, just a meal!

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.130
But you said it was copulation too!

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.670
You copulate with just anyone then?

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:52.250
I mean, that's what a vampire does!

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.790
We copulate with anyone!

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:54.630
Wow, sassy.

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:55.830
What's that?!
Wow, sassy.<b></b>

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.460
Anyway, I looked all over for you.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.380
I went all the way to the station!

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.080
But we found each other, right?

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:06.040
I don't want to have to search this hard every time!

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.250
So...

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.040
let's exchange each other's contact info.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:10.830
Contact info?

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.040
There's this line I've always wanted to say,

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.210
but can I say it now?

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.130
G-go ahead...

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.080
Do you do LINE?

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:27.420
I don't.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.670
I don't either!

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:29.880
Then why did you ask?!

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.330
Anyway, let's just exchange numbers.

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.130
Well, I don't even have a cell phone.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.000
What?! You can live without a cell phone
in this day and age?!

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.130
Sometimes you sound like a proper youngster, huh?

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.250
Then what should we do?

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:45.710
You don't want a cell phone?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.830
I mean, I don't need one.

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:49.540
Wait, though...

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.580
I think a long time ago...

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:55.670
Hey! Let's go back to my place!

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:56.670
Huh?

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.960
Hmm, now where did I put it?

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.210
I think it's somewhere around here...

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.290
Oh! Here it is!

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.170
A cellular phone!

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.130
What the heck is that?

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:15.960
Like I said, a cellular phone.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:19.250
What? It's huge.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.710
But bigger's cooler, right?

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.040
Well, if you're okay with it, that's fine.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.880
Then carry that around with you, okay?

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.170
I'll call when I leave the house.

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:31.920
No way I'm carrying around that huge thing.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.630
What the heck is wrong with you?!

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.040
I bought it ages ago 'cuz I thought I might need it,

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.750
but it's unwieldy and heavy,

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:43.880
and in no time at all they came out with smaller ones
and I couldn't be bothered anymore.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:46.880
That's why I don't need a cell phone.

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.250
Now, then!

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.460
Why are you acting like its time to sleep?

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:57.210
I was flying around looking for people
so I'm all tired out!

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.960
Hey, what are you waiting for?

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.580
Come join me already.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.750
<i>I really dunno.</i>

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.500
<i>I mean, I'm not in love yet or anything...</i>

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:28.420
<i>Besides, anyone would be flustered in this situation.</i>

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:34.080
<i>Isn't it normal that I don't want her
doing this with other people?</i>

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:36.790
Hey, you...

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:39.420
Can I suck your blood soon?

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:42.670
Nope.

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:44.080
Huh?! Why?!

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.080
You promised you'd let me!

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.080
Liar!

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.290
I thought you wanted to become a vampire!

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:54.960
Even if you suck my blood now,
I won't become a vampire yet.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:59.080
If you want to that much,
why don't you go find someone else today?

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:02.040
You said you could find one.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.130
<i>What am I saying?</i>

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.380
Listen, Ko Yamori...

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:23.630
I was looking for you.

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:25.540
Huh?

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:29.210
I was just embarrassed to say so.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:30.750
I'm sorry, okay?

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:36.250
Besides, it'd be tough finding someone
with blood as tasty as yours.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.040
Here...

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.670
<i>I realized I felt relieved.</i>

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:11.170
<i>Not because my blood is tasty,
but because we both felt the same way.</i>

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:16.500
<i>The reason didn't matter too much.</i>

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:21.460
<i>I just wanted to see her.</i>

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.960
<b>2nd Night: Do You Do LINE?</b>

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:05.880
Once again, I can't find her.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:12.460
Yo!

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.630
"Yo"? Give me a break, jeez!

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:20.500
I looked all over for you again!

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:21.880
Sorry, sorry.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.290
I was looking for you too, so cut me a break!

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:31.210
Which is why I bought this thing today!

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:33.000
What's that, a watch?

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:39.000
Actually, this here is a wristwatch transceiver!

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.460
Super cool!

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:45.500
Isn't it?!

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.130
<i>She's more excited than I thought.</i>

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:49.460
So we're gonna play with them, right?!

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:50.710
They're for getting in touch.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:54.540
As long as we use them for that,
we can also play with them, right?!

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:56.330
Y-you want to play with them that much?!

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:57.330
I mean sure, but...

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:00.880
Why else would you buy transceivers?!

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:04.080
I not sure about that comment...

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:08.630
But true, when I was a kid I bought some
so I could play with them.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.790
You have friends?

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.460
You can't play with transceivers
if you don't have friends.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.920
That's insulting.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:19.960
I'm not some idiot who can't find ways to play
just because I don't have any friends!

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.380
I see; sorry.

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:26.210
Here's what happened.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.210
I think it was when I was nine.

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:32.830
"These are totally gonna be fun, and cool!"

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:35.580
Before I knew it, I was in the checkout line.

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:37.710
I racked my brains.

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:38.960
How should I play with them?

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.790
How could I get the most out of them?

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.630
Shouldn't you have started by making a friend?

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:45.790
Shut up, you.

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:48.170
And then I thought of it.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.540
I would hide one of them.

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:55.000
I would hide one of the transceivers somewhere
just hard enough to find easily.

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:59.210
I thought it might be interesting to
communicate with whoever found it.

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:05.630
But I didn't get a call signal even after a while,
so I went to take a look.

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.170
Someone found it.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.330
That means if I call it someone will-

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.460
I don't have a clear memory of
why I made that decision,

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.170
but I didn't make the call.

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:25.040
I decided to wait.

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:29.830
S-so bleak...

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.210
That's such a sad little game...

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:34.830
Good story, right?

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:36.880
But I found it interesting, anyway.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.000
So yeah...

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.920
this is the sad little transceiver from back then.

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:48.500
Why are you wearing that?!

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.210
I thought it might be funny.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.170
Anyway, let's do a test run for play.

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.710
"Foreplay"? What a dirty boy.

00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:59.040
It's not dirty!

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.250
If this is a test run,

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:03.460
I bet the real thing is gonna be really stimulating!

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:06.170
Why do you talk about stuff like that?!

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:07.750
You're such a perv!

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:09.170
Anyway...

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:10.170
So-

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.460
Shall we begin?

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.170
The test run?

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:31.960
<i>I'm alone.</i>

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:38.130
<i>But it's somehow different from when
I'm alone looking for her with no leads.</i>

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:42.960
<i>It's not like I ever thought being alone was sad, though.</i>

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.750
<i>Sometimes it's even lonelier
when you're around people.</i>

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:53.460
<i>I wonder how everyone else
deals with these emotions?</i>

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:59.790
But right now, me being alone isn't
about wanting to be alone.

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:02.250
There's a point to it.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:07.040
I guess I'll try calling the other one.

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:10.540
I think the communication range was 150 meters.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.960
<i>I've never pressed the call button on one of these.</i>

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.540
<i>I don't use my cell phone at all, either.</i>

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:22.420
<i>I haven't talked to someone over a distance
in a long while, actually.</i>

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.540
<i>I'm nervous for some reason.</i>

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:27.790
Whatever, here goes nothing!

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:30.920
That's loud!

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:34.830
I've never said "Here goes nothing" in my life.

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:37.880
I got a response.

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:41.500
That means she's within 150 meters.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.790
Yoohoo! Over.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:46.830
Oh, uhh...

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:49.380
G-good evening! Over.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.330
What do you mean, "good evening"? Over.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.250
Well, we gotta greet each other first, right? Over.

00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:00.040
That's true.
Top of the evening to you.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.040
"Top of the evening"?

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:04.710
Enemy sighted up ahead.

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:06.500
Should I kill them all? Over.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:10.420
Not yet.

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.670
Watch what they do for a bit. Over.

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:16.500
Roger that.

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.540
I-I'll keep following them! Over.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.170
You made me do it! Jeez!

00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:26.920
It's pretty fun playing with transceivers, huh?

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.710
I'm glad I bought them.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:30.790
Oh yeah?

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:32.630
Over.

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:33.830
It's like...

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.790
...we're a couple who just started going out.

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:39.000
Don't say embarrassing things like that!

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.790
This really is fun.

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:45.290
I hope I fall in love soon.

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:52.210
You talk to yourself too loudly, idiot.

00:17:56.830 --> 00:18:00.250
Well, I bet today's blood is gonna be especially tasty.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:06.790
I've never been to school at night before.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.630
<i>Well, I haven't been during the day lately either,</i>

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:12.500
<i>and I'm a little nervous,</i>

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:16.130
<i>but the knowledge that no one's here
is really reassuring.</i>

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:20.250
The night drastically changes the
way one perceives things.

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:23.420
Even the school you hate...

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:26.130
...doesn't seem so bad, does it?

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:31.380
You're right.

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:47.790
Aww, man!

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:49.460
It's really so tasty!

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:51.710
<i>Somehow...</i>

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:53.080
<i>Somehow that felt dirty.</i>

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:55.210
At school, too!

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:57.380
Talk about indecent behavior!

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.000
<i>Come to think of it,</i>

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.580
<i>Nanakusa-san likes lewd jokes,</i>

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.460
<i>but gets awfully embarrassed
talking about love and romance.</i>

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:12.790
<i>If she's a vampire and doesn't want to make offspring,</i>

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:16.170
<i>I guess that means she's never
gotten intimate with a human being.</i>

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:18.670
What's the matter, boy?

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:19.670
Nazuna-chan!

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:22.790
"-cha"...

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:25.250
Can I call you that?

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:26.460
From now on?

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.420
So we can get a bit closer?

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:32.250
And when I call you on the transceiver...

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:35.750
You're full-on embarrassed.

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:38.540
Hey, Nazuna-chan.

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:41.330
That's "-san" to you!
Add the "-san!"

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.540
I thought we could start by being friends.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.460
You don't even have any friends!

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.420
Come to think of it...

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:06.920
I wonder what happened to
this sad little transceiver's pair?

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:09.210
I wonder if someone still has it?

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:11.670
Yeah, right.

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:15.000
Nazuna-cha...

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:16.920
No...

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.830
It's this one! Why-

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:20.040
Yamori...

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:25.960
What are you doing?
