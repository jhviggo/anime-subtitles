00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.080
You know nothing about vampires.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.080
I just don't get what's going on.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.960
I mean, vampires? What?

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.330
<i>That's right, I know nothing about vampires.</i>

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.290
<i>They're pretty, and rational
despite the ridiculous things they say.</i>

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.750
<i>They like humans and they coexist with them.</i>

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.920

I can't wait any longer.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.540
Can I?

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.130
Well, okay...

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.380
I-I-I'm gonna go for it!

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.630
Fine, fine.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.960
I was really at my limit there.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.670
I was pretty close to losing it completely!

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:37.830
Uh...

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.540
S-sorry! I didn't mean that!
It's not that I don't-

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.750
What happened?

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.130
Just tell me, for starters.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.080
A vampire who lost control, huh?

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.000
I assume he was just plain starving.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.130
He probably couldn't control his need to feed anymore.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.250
Would you ever get like that, Nazuna-chan?

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.250
What?

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.460
You were hungry today, weren't you?

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.790
You said you couldn't wait...

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.880
Yo, idiot! Look at me!

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.670
Don't bundle me together with that geezer.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.080
That's not something you need to think about, Ko-kun.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.420
Why don't we go on a walk?

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.960
I don't know much about it,

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.630
but I've heard that vampires die
if they don't drink blood for ten years.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.170
In other words,
we can go for ten years without drinking blood.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.210
I hear it happens sometimes:

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.210
Vampires who refuse to accept what they've become
and die without feeding.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.040
I see...

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.460
So, what's the deal with this detective person
you talked about?

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.330
I don't know.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.210
I do get the sense that
she doesn't like vampires, though.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.670
She knows that I want to be one,
and she's trying to convince me otherwise.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.670
Uh, so what?
You're quitting?

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:57.670
Huh?!

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.580
I don't intend to, but to be honest I'm a little worried.

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.040
Worried?

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.710
That detective knew how to kill vampires.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.380
And she actually killed one.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.920
Is it really possible for a human to kill a vampire?

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Nazuna-chan...

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.960
I wouldn't want you to get killed because of me.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.420
Akira had a terrifying experience.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.460
I'm sure Mahiru-kun was scared, too.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.080
I was scared...

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.380
This was the first time I thought that you-

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.920
...that vampires are scary!

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.290
A bit late, huh, idiot?

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.580
<i>I'm probably just worked up emotionally.</i>

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.130
<i>That's why I felt scared of vampires after all this time.</i>

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.380
Nazuna-chan, I'm sorry about earlier.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.210
But I'm okay now.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.170
I want you to suck my blood!

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.880
Ooh, finally.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.040
<i>Now that I've identified the fear within me,
I can manage that emotion.</i>

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.580
<i>Fear isn't actually that bad.</i>

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.130
Yo!

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.130
Oh, Mahiru-kun!

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.630
I appreciate it, as always.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:28.920
Wanna stay for a drink?

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.580
I'll come as a proper customer once I'm twenty.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.460
You have a friend with you today.

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.630
Mm, young boys are so nice!

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.040
Why would you say that?

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.920
Can't take your eyes off of them?

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.630
Huh?! Uh, I'm super sorry!

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.250
You're more of a lech than I thought, Ko.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.040
Uh, really?!

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.880
Wouldn't most people stare at that?

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.290
Well, you gotta be a bit more discreet, y'know?

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.670
Then you look without making it seem like it?

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.670
Oh, I'm the master of that kind of thing.

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.460
I pretend like I don't even care,
but I never miss a stroke of raunchy luck.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.710
That's super cool!

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.130
Listen, Ko.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.080
Why do you want to be a vampire?

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.040
What you think of as fun...

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.170
Do you have to be a vampire to do it?

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.380
I know you don't like fitting in,

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.170
and that you were trying really hard
to fake it when we got to middle school.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.500
You got tired of all that, right?

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.880
I get it, but-

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.290
H-hold on!

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:27.540
Why...

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.790
What we saw at school the other night...

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.000
That was a vampire, right?

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.880
Th-that's a misunderstanding!

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.710
Or rather, a really unusual case!

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.500
But it was, wasn't it?

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:43.170
It attacked Akira,
and she could have been killed, right?

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.540
Is that what you want to be?

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:47.210
Well...

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.830
I dunno about that...

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.710
Look, Ko...

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.580
We kind of drifted apart once we
got to middle school, y'know?

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:57.830
We weren't in the same class,

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.710
and I didn't want to get in the way
when you were trying to change your image.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.710
So when we ran into each other for the first time
in a while, I was a little worried.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.330
Whether we'd be able to talk like we used to.

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:11.670
But I didn't need to worry.

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:16.540
I was happy to realize, "Oh, we're totally still friends."

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:23.790
What is it you want to do by becoming a vampire?

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.170
<i>What I want to do?</i>

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:29.960
<i>As a vampire?</i>

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:31.790
<i>Why do I want it?</i>

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.500
<i>Because there's freedom?</i>

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.750
<i>Then, am I not free now?</i>

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:37.580
<i>It's not like I'm going to school.</i>

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.250
<i>I wander around at night.</i>

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.540
<i>Why did I want to become one again?</i>

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:44.830
<i>Because of Nazuna-chan?</i>

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:48.330
<i>No, I hang out with Nazuna-chan
because I want to be a vampire.</i>

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.250
<i>Because I want to fall in love...</i>

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.330
<i>No, the order's mixed up.</i>

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.210
<i>I'm trying to fall in love
so that I can become a vampire.</i>

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.080
C'mon, tell me!

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.210
Are you going to become a vampire
and trick people to suck their blood?

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.830
Or are you not going to drink anyone's blood,
lose control and become like that thing?

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:09.080
Either way, I...

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:11.790
Uh...

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:14.170
You don't have to decide right away.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.330
But I want you to think about it.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:20.170
About what it means to become a vampire.

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.210
What did your friend want?

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:24.420
Whoa!

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.460
Wh-what's the matter Ko-kun?!

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.380
Can't hold in the raging passion anymore?!

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:32.130
Sorry, Nazuna-chan, just for a bit.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:34.830
Just for a bit...

00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:40.580
<i>Nazuna-chan, tell me!</i>

00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:43.880
<i>What am I thinking right now?</i>

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:54.080
Hey, couldn't we have stayed at your place like always?

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:55.670
Or somewhere outside?

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.790
Oh come on, just for tonight.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.500
I don't think there's anyone home, but hold on.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:02.330
Sure thing.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.210
<b>For Meals</b>

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:05.960
It's okay.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.330
Come on in, Nazuna-chan!

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:10.880
So this is your room, huh?

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:12.920
That's odd.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:13.920
What is?

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.580
I can't find any porn.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:17.920
But it's a middle school boy's room...

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.250
You can't because there's none here!

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:21.630
That's impossible.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.290
What about your parents?
Are they working at this hour?

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:28.210
Mom's probably at work,

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:29.920
and Dad hasn't lived here since the divorce.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.130
So don't worry.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:33.710
Then that means...

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.750
"Hey, my mom's out tonight."

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:39.630
"Wanna come over?"

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:40.960
The classic situation!

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.960
But you're the one who said you wanted to come over.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:49.130
<i>This is the first time I've had a girl in my room
since I started middle school.</i>

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.790
<i>And she just has to sit on the bed.</i>

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:53.000
<i>Why there?!</i>

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.630
What about the space between the wall and the bed?!

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:55.630
No!

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:57.670
<i>And now she's lying down...</i>

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.790
Hey, this bed smells like you, Ko-kun!

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:02.210
That's kind of raunchy!

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:03.460
<i>And she's sleazy.</i>

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.210
Oh, there's a used tissue.

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:07.540
I blew my nose with that, obviously!

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.670
<i>This is so unnerving!</i>

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:12.960
Up we get...

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:14.540
Anyway...

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.880
Have you reconsidered, after all?

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:19.750
What do you...

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:21.580
You met with your friend, didn't you?

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.210
I don't have to suck your blood to tell.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:26.710
You're unsure, Ko-kun.

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.000
The vampire who never sucked blood...

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.250
Your friends...

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.420
A detective who can kill vampires...

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.170
It'd be weird if you weren't unsure.

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:39.830
Actually, a normal person wouldn't be unsure.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:42.630
He'd give up becoming a vampire
in favor of his friends.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:47.580
He asked me why I wanted to be one.

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:49.710
Why become a vampire?

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:51.130
And?

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:55.170
I thought about it, but it's because I like the night.

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.000
The night's free.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.750
It's like a whole different world,
and people can be different there, too.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:02.460
That's why I like it.

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:07.250
But lately, I've started seeing that it's not all just fun.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.170
I was okay with that, though.

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:12.960
Because you acknowledge all of my emotions.

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:16.330
But it's different if there's actual harm.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.540
It's one thing if it's just me,
but if I were to hurt my friends...

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:25.170
And when I think about it,
I have plenty of fun as it is right now!

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:30.290
I mean, it's not like you're that eager to
make me your offspring, anyway!

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.130
Even if I don't become a vampire...

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:37.830
Yeah...

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:47.130
Let me help you with your decision.

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:48.460
Listen up.

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:52.130
Why do you think the night felt so fun to you?

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:54.830
Because there's freedom?

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:56.790
Yeah, that's definitely true.

00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:02.500
But taking that further,
it's because it's out of the ordinary.

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:05.630
Your ordinary is daytime and school.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:07.290
Nighttime is the opposite.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:09.330
I'm sure it was exhilarating.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.380
But think about it.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:15.170
Right now, do you get equally
as exhilarated or more

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:17.960
compared to that first night you went out?

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:22.710
Isn't the fun you feel part of the ordinary now?

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:31.130
Ko-kun, anything out of the ordinary
never lasts for long, you know.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.460
Being a vampire's just boring.

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:39.170
I'm sorry I lied to you.

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:43.330
It's been decades since I became a vampire,

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.130
but I've never been anything but bored.

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:49.420
I just wait for time to pass as I spend
each shallow, meaningless day.

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:53.580
Well, thanks to that I'm a boss at
video games now, though!

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.080
Why?

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.580
Why did you try to show me just the fun stuff?

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:01.960
Why did I?

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.580
Maybe because that's how I wanted to be.

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:09.420
I see...

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.250
Anyway, I'm gonna head home for now.

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:14.710
Huh? H-hold on! I still-

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:30.330
What?

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.460
S-sorry! I didn't mean-

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:39.790
Thought I was gonna kiss you?

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:41.380
<i>You weren't?!</i>

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.920
<b>12th Night: My Mom’s Out Tonight</b>

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.630
<b>Private Detective</b>

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.630
<b>ANKO UGUISU</b>

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.630
Hey, Yamori-kun.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.670
I thought it was about time you called.

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:11.960
"Can you spare some time, miss?"

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:16.170
"Why don't we go to a cafe or something and
slip into a scandalous relationship?"

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:21.830
Wait, that's not it?

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:23.670
Why did you think it was?

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:26.790
Jeez, I totally had that wrong!

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:28.250
Now that's embarrassing.

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:29.630
You were serious?!

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:31.170
Of course I was serious!

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.630
I told you to hit on me properly next time, remember?!

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:36.580
Why are you kind of angry?

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:40.000
I like the idea of stringing
a middle schooler along for a change.

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:44.330
I don't think it's such a bad deal for you, Yamori-kun.

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:46.460
Where are you going?

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.630
You want to talk about vampires, no?

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.250
Um...

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:56.130
How much do you know about me, Miss Detective?

00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:01.420
You mean your idiotic
"Ooh, I wanna be a vampire dream"?

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:04.750
Other than that, let's see...

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:09.380
Your name is Ko Yamori, fourteen years old.
Single-mother household.

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:12.710
You don't go to school but your grades
are reasonably good.

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:17.790
You don't have a lot of hobbies but you like sneakers
and collect them secondhand for cheap.

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:22.210
You have no experience with romance,
but you like girls with big boobs.

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:27.130
You don't own porn but you sometimes save
those kinds of images on your phone,

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:31.330
then delete them out of embarrassment later,
only to regret it and do it all over again.

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:32.920
Huh?! Uh, what?! That's freaky!

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:33.540
The first time you eja-

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:34.750
That amount of detail is freaky!
The first time you eja-<b></b>

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:36.000
What? How?!

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.380
Just joking!
Ha ha, gotcha!

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:40.830
It's all speculation!
Deductive reasoning!

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:42.250
Because I'm a detective, remember?

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.880
<i>How much of what she says is true?</i>

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:52.130
Um, about wanting to be a vampire...

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:56.040
Why are you against it, Miss Detective?

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:57.880
That's a weird question to ask.

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:01.960
Because vampires are evil from the
human perspective, of course.

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:08.920
See, I think humans causing misfortune for
other humans is inevitable sometimes,

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.000
depending on the time and situation,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.500
but I think it's unacceptable for a vampire to cause it.

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:19.040
People live among other humans.
You can't avoid conflict.

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:23.130
But I can't allow misfortune that
never should have existed,

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:25.290
intended by something that isn't human.

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:27.670
Vampires only ever make people unhappy.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:30.500
You saw an example of that too.

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:34.290
But you said that was only because
he didn't drink blood for ten years!

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:35.500
That's right.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:39.710
Because he was a honorary human, who maintained
his pride as a human being to the very end.

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:42.750
Can you say for sure?

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:47.880
That when you become a vampire,
you'll be okay with drinking human blood?

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:52.670
Or else never drink any and
live with the pain for ten long years?

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:05.040
Besides, considering you haven't fallen in love yet
despite the amount of contact you've had,

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:08.250
I honestly doubt you'll ever get to be a vampire.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:08.880
That's not-

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.580
Have you ever considered...
That's not-<b></b>

00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:15.000
that you might lack romantic urges to begin with?

00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:20.420
That would be a problem, wouldn't it?

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:24.130
You definitely wouldn't get to be a vampire, 100%.

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:26.750
But that's good, actually!

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:31.380
There's no need for me to convince you otherwise now.

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:33.250
But wait...

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:35.750
Now there's a problem, isn't there?

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.960
You know about their existence,

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:42.330
which means you're a liability for the vampires.

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:45.540
Simultaneously, the vampire
who invited along an anomaly like you...

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.580
Nazuna Nanakusa, was it?

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:50.670
I don't think she'll be safe, either.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:54.080
They might just murder the both of you, you know?

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.710
I-I don't want that!

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:57.420
Then make your decision now.

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:02.540
You can live as a human,
or become a vampire and get killed by me.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.080
Decide right now.

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:08.420
Do you really have the ability to kill vampires?

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:09.880
You saw, didn't you?

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:13.210
I can't tell you how,
but your fate depends on your answer.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:19.880
If it means you'll choose the proper life as a human,

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.880
I'll do anything.

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:24.170
I'm prepared to do that.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.790
But won't I get killed by the vampires?

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:29.920
Not to worry!

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:33.790
Because I'll kill every single one of them.

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:36.920
N-no!

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:39.750
You can't!

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:42.710
I can't believe that those people are really that evil.

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:44.960
They fret over things just like us,

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.500
and they have something akin to respect for humans.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.960
They have the ability to understand
people's vulnerabilities.

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.540
Saying that they only ever cause misfortune is a lie!

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.000
I can't agree with your reasoning!

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.210
Fine, be that way.

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:05.790
I didn't want to deny you your nocturnal roamings,

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:08.250
but I'll have to take the easiest route.

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:12.380
Hello? There's something I would like to report.

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:18.040
Recently in the neighborhood,
there's been a boy of about middle school age

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.080
fooling around late at night, alone.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.920
It scares me a little.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.040
Yes, that's right, around that area.

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:30.040
If you could talk to him if you see him...

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:34.380
Yes, thank you very much.

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:40.290
So, policemen are really quite dedicated.

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:42.710
One call, and they come immediately.

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:45.630
Before you have to give up your beloved nighttime,

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:48.000
I think you'd better hurry on home.

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:54.500
Go on, run!

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.420
<i>Dammit... Dammit!</i>

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:14.500
<i>I didn't get to ask her anything.</i>

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:16.630
<i>How she kills vampires,</i>

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:19.080
<i>why the guy said her blood tasted awful,</i>

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.210
<i>why they say my blood tastes good,</i>

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:26.290
<i>or what and how much that detective
knows about vampires...</i>

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:27.880
<i>Nothing!</i>

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:53.880
<i>What should I do?</i>

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.380
<i>Should I go to Nazuna-chan's place?</i>

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.210
<i>No...</i>

00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:59.500
<i>That detective made it sound like a joke,</i>

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.830
<i>but she obviously investigated me quite a bit.</i>

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.540
<i>I don't want to cause trouble for Nazuna-chan.</i>

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.290
Nazuna-chan...

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:09.920
I want to talk with her.

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:12.040
About random stuff that doesn't matter.

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:14.920
I thought it was you, Yamori-kun.

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:17.670
Wait, is Yamori-kun right?

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.580
Do you remember me?

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:24.080
Hatsuka-san was it?

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:25.830
Oh, that's right.

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:31.330

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:33.420
