00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.540
This is so nice.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.540
<i>For the first time ever,</i>

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.250
<i>I ventured out at night without telling anyone.</i>

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.380
It feels so free.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.380
This is where I belong.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.080
I wish!

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.670
<i>I mean, I probably have to go to school
and sleep at night.</i>

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.170
The swings are so fun for the first time in forever!

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.750
<i>Just recently, I started having trouble sleeping.</i>

<i>I was getting by just fine...</i>

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.630
<i>I think.</i>

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.630
I'm sorry.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.290
I just don't really understand dating.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.630
<i>It's not that I wasn't happy.</i>

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:21.670
<i>But what could I do?</i>

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.750
<i>I really don't get the whole thing about
liking or not liking somebody.</i>

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.170
Yamori-kun, why did you reject her?

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.830
She was crying, you know.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.460
Sorry.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.330
What, that's all?

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.580
You're the worst.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.750
<i>Suddenly, I just couldn't be bothered anymore.</i>

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.670
Ow...

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.920
Swings have more momentum than I thought.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.920
<i>The most pressing issue is that I can't sleep.</i>

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.960
<i>Advice online said I should talk to family
or someone I can trust.</i>

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.080
Someone I can trust, huh?

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.130
If I had someone like that this wouldn't be an issue!

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.960
Cr-crap!

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.380

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.130

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.920
Relax.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.170
can you, boy?

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.330
Let me help you.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:11.290
Why do you think people stay up at night?

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.460
Because there's a show they want to watch
or something they want to do?

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.330
Or they're worried about tomorrow?

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.250
<i>What's with this woman?</i>

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.290
<i>A woman...</i>

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.710
<i>A woman, right.</i>

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:26.960
<i>What does she mean by "help"?</i>

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:32.380
It all boils down to one reason.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:36.000
They aren't satisfied with how they spent the day.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.210
Take a look.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.790
See how satisfied they look!

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:42.880
Fast asleep, with no discontent whatsoever!

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.540
Aren't they just totally wasted?

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:46.750
Hey, old man!

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:48.000
Huh?

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.920
Didja drink plenty?

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.380
Yeah, plenty!

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:54.380
Plen'y.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.580
Plenny...

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.000
Yeah!

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:58.960
Yeah! Yeah!

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:02.580
'Kay, later then!

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.420
Make sure you get home and sleep.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.170
Okay!

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:09.330
Hey!

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:11.790
Did you know those people?

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.710
Nope, not at all.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:14.960
Really?!

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.920
You're that casual with strangers?

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.500
What are you talking about?

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.670
This is the nighttime, y'know.

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:23.330
The time of freedom.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:28.170
You'll never be satisfied
if you don't release your inhibitions...

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.710
boy.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.880
H-hey! Are you going home?

00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:38.750
<i>I don't get it.
Seriously, I don't!</i>

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:40.500
<i>Release inhibitions?</i>

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.710
<i>I wouldn't be in this fix if I could do that!</i>

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:44.670
Old man!

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:47.170
Y-yeah!

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:48.460
Oh!

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:49.460
Yea-

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:55.460
I-is he okay?!

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.250
He's fine, he's fine.

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:59.460
He's always like this.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:03.460
He went and did it, huh?

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.630
That was a lot...

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:09.540
Old man, don't let the drink consume you!

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:10.920
Yeah.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.630
And clean that up!

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.000
Yeah...

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:17.920
Here.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:20.670
Y-yeah!

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:21.540
Yah.
Y-yeah!<b></b>

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.040
So?

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.710
How's it feel to release yourself a bit?

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:30.830
Not too bad.

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:32.830
Good.

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.710
Hey, you getting sleepy at all?

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.040
I guess...

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:44.460
Okay.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:46.460
Then let's go.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:47.670
To my place.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:49.790
Huh?

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:58.000
I want to give advice to people who can't sleep
and help them resolve their issues.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.380
<i>This doesn't look like a smutty joint, at least.</i>

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:12.580
Okay then, lie down.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.080
Uh...

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.290
What's this...

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.130
Just my futon.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.130
Okay, let's sleep.

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.790
Y-y-y-you're gonna do dirty stuff to me?!

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.880
Huh? Nothing dirty.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.580
Just a guy and a girl, sleeping on the same futon.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:39.790
That's plenty dirty!

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:41.790
Sorry, gotta go 'cuz I'm scared, goodbye!

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:43.710
Not so fast, boy.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.540
Don't worry, don't worry!
I won't do anything.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.710
It's just the tip!

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:49.000
What tip?!

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.500
Don't you want to sleep?

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:55.500
Don't worry.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.580
When you wake up,
you'll feel refreshed like nothing else!

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.000
Close your eyes and don't think.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:10.330
Now slowly, let yourself breathe.

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:19.170
<i>What am I doing?</i>

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:21.880
<i>Do I just not care anymore?</i>

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:24.750
Still not sleepy?

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:27.460
Oh, uh!

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:28.670
I'm fine.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.580
<i>What is this?</i>

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.710
<i>Anyone can tell she's a nutjob.</i>

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.580
<i>And yet, why is this so relaxing?</i>

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.130
<i>This is what it feels like to sleep with someone?</i>

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:45.080
<i>She might be a bit weird, but I guess she's nice?</i>

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.330
<i>I'll pretend to be asleep for a bit and go home.</i>

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.170
<i>I'm really good at faking sleep, too.</i>

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.290
You asleep?

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:07.670
Wait, are you really asleep?

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:09.670
Hello?

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.540
Hey, but you're actually awake, right?

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:16.330
Hello? Boy?

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:31.290
Whew, thank goodness, you really fell asleep.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.290
I can't wait any longer...

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:40.750
Well then...

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:44.210
feeding time.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.210
Wh-what's with this kid?

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.540
He tastes so good!

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.380
What was that just now?

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.670
Wh-why're you awake?

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.250
Blood...

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:24.750
My blood?

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:31.170
A-a m-mosquito...

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:33.170
There was this huge mosquito.

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:35.170
Oh! A mosquito!

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:37.040
I got it with a good slap.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.130
I see, a good slap...

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:45.830
Not very convincing, huh?

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:47.920
Nope, not really.

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:49.750
Sorry.

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:51.460
You have blood on your mouth.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.170
No dice, huh?

00:13:54.670 --> 00:14:00.710
So, are you, uh, a vampire...

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.210
of some sort?

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:03.920
Yeah, I suppose I am.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:06.170
You are, huh?

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:12.710
Then does that mean I'm a v-vampire now?

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.920
Nah, you shouldn't be.

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:17.790
No worries there.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:19.630
Oh, I'm not?

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:25.580
Then, why aren't I a vampire now?

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:29.330
Rather, why didn't you turn me into one?

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:32.290
What do you mean?

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:33.500
Well, I mean...

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:37.750
Don't vampires suck blood in order to create offspring?

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.500
Oh! You mean that kind of thing!

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.080
I see, I see!

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.670
Yeah, I guess people tend to think that!

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.250
To me, sucking blood is like eating.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:50.790
Eating?

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.080
Yeah, I mean, think about it.

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:56.540
Wouldn't it suck if you got new
family members every time you ate?

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.040
Yeah, that would suck.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.420
Plus freak me out.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.630
Right?

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:03.330
So basically, it depends.

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:07.460
I hear there are vampires who create loads of offspring,

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.750
but I'm not interested in that kind of thing.

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:15.710
So?

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:16.710
Huh?

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:18.580
Don't "Huh?" me.

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.250
You never answered my question.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:22.830
Uh? What was it again?

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:24.080
Jeez!

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:28.460
I asked, why won't I turn into a vampire
even though you sucked my blood?!

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.540
All right, fine.
Man, you're loud.

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:32.170
L-loud?!

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:33.460
I'm not being loud!

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:38.880
See, I don't want to go around telling people this...

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.670
The reason you're not a vampire...

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:48.040
Or rather, the way a person can become a vampire...

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:53.040
is for that person to fall in love with one.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:57.710
Lo-

00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:59.460
Ah...

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:00.460
Huh?

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:02.080
Okay, I see.

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.330
Fall in love, huh?

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:09.880
Um, why are you all embarrassed?

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:15.330
Man, my face is burning!

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:17.080
The beer's so good!

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.330
Well anyway, uh...

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:27.080
Basically, when a person who's in love with a vampire
gets that vampire to suck their blood,

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.500
they become their offspring.

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:34.710
Just like how a child results when
a man and a woman in love copulate!

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:37.460
Uh, why the gross analogy all of a sudden?

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.000
But it is, right?

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.040
Humans can only create offspring through copulation.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.750
D-don't say "copulate"!

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:45.330
What's the matter?
How old are you?

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:48.080
I'm fourteen...

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.500
What?! You're still a little punk!

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.670
At fourteen, you should be all over
talk about copulation and stuff.

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:54.880
What's wrong with you?

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.170
That's ridiculous!
And why do you call it copulation?!

00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:00.630
And then comes the l-love gossip, and uh...

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:02.170
Love gossip, right?!

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:03.670
Why do you look kinda put off?!

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:05.670
Well, why do you look kinda embarrassed?

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:06.880
Shut up!

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:17.080
What can I say?

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.330
I really don't understand that kind of thing.

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:23.210
Don't you have a crush on anyone at school?

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:24.540
No...

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:27.830
Or rather, I don't like girls.

00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:30.290
Huh?! You mean you like boys?

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:32.130
Nice, I approve.

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:33.630
That's not what I mean.

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:35.420
Then what do you mean?

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.790
What, that's all?

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:41.210
You're the worst.

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:43.380
<i>Shut up, ugly.</i>

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.920
<i>This is why I hate girls.</i>

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.000
Okay, I'm off...

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:54.920
The hell with this.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.130
Middle school can be tough, huh?

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:05.830
So you stopped going to school
and started fooling around at night.

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:09.960
Well, I know I shouldn't be doing this kind of thing.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.040
Tell me, boy.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.500
How does your first night out feel?

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.830
What do you think now that you've
taken a step outside the norm?

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.290
This place is the furthest you can hope to get
from all those things you think are a pain.

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:32.500
It'd be a waste if you didn't keep this kind of thing up.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.710
<i>I was getting by just fine...</i>

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:43.710
<i>I think.</i>

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.290
<i>At least, I tried to do the right thing...</i>

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:50.380
<i>because there was nothing
I wanted to do or wanted to be.</i>

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:53.130
Who cares?

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.500
School's boring, right?

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:01.790
Stay up until you feel satisfied about your day.

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:04.880
That's not a bad way to live.

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.670
So yeah, do me a favor and-

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:10.670
Miss Vampire!

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:11.880
Huh? Y-yeah?!

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.080
I have a favor to ask of you!

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:17.130
Turn me into a vampire!

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:22.790
H-hold up a sec.

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:24.000
What?

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.580
L-like I said, a person has to fulfill certain conditions
in order to become a vampire-

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:29.960
I know that!

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:30.670
They need to fall in love with a vampire.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:32.750
Ah! Don't, it's embarrassing!
They need to fall in love with a vampire.<b></b>

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:35.830
I'd probably never take that leap.

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:40.710
I know I'll just go back to my old life
and spend my days in boredom.

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:43.210
But now I've seen it...

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:44.750
the night...

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:47.130
It's the first time I've wanted to be something.

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:49.380
I don't want to dismiss this feeling!

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:52.580
So please, let me fall in love with you!

00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:59.250
You're being ridiculous.

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:02.670
It's my policy to not create offspring, y'know.

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:08.210
Just so you know, I'm not going to do anything.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.130
I'm just gonna suck your blood
like the vampire that I am.

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:13.710
If you wanna fall in love, go ahead.

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.000
I'm Nazuna Nanakusa.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.210
You?

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.500
Ko Yamori.

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:26.750
Do you know when human blood tastes best?

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.500
At night.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:33.750
Especially right before a person falls asleep
to the moment that they do.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.790
That's because the blood is infused with night.

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:40.960
Um, why the roof?

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.790
Because we're closer to the moon, obviously.

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:45.000
What?

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.920
If you think about the distance to the moon,

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.830
the difference between the ground
and the roof is negligible.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:55.290
That's why I want to infuse more night in you, boy.

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:57.040
You mean I need to stay up late?

00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.130
Well, I plan on that anyway.

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:06.420
That too, of course, but in order to infuse blood
with night - in other words, to stay up late -

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.000
you can't just stay awake.

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:11.630
But you wouldn't know what I mean.

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:13.250
Huh?

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:15.630
So I'll teach you...

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:17.880
what it means to enjoy the night.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:20.710
I'm gonna die!

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:21.710
No, you won't.
I'm gonna die!<b></b>

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:30.040
The night is for fooling around.

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:32.630
Let's have some fun, boy.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:36.500
Hang on tight.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.710
What do you think, boy?

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.460
How do you feel?

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:47.420
Awesome.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:49.710
Isn't it?

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.330
<b>1st</b>

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.330
<b>Night</b>

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.330
<b>Night</b>

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.330
<b>Flight</b>
