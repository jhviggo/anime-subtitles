Hey!

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.500
Don't you sleep during class.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:18.790
Sorry.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.210
But hear me out!

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.750
I'm really sleep deprived.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.080
What were you doing?

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.250
Video games!

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.830
Okay class, going on!

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.960
What?! Come on!

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.710
Listen up, class.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.380
People have to sleep at night.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.250
You'll stay up late once you're an adult,
whether you like it or not.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.580
So get your body used to a healthy sleep schedule
while you're still young.

I'm much better at leaving the house quietly now,

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.960
I wonder where Nazuna-chan will be toda-

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.630
<i>She's usually impossible to find...</i>

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.130
<i>...but she's in a really easy place to find today.</i>

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.670
<i>Honestly, I don't want to see her just yet today.</i>

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.420
What's taking Ko-kun so long?

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.000
<i>I mean, I don't know what kind of look I should give her.</i>

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.130
<i>This is only if I'm not mistaken, but...</i>

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.830
<i>...the act of one's lips touching someone else's...</i>

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.170
<i>That's called a kiss, right?</i>

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.380
<i>So she kissed me.</i>

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.250
<i>What are you thinking, Nazuna Nanakusa?!</i>

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.880
See, it won't be long now.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.080
Yup.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.710
What's going on?

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.500
<i>A couple?</i>

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.210
Really, that's so nice.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.080
Talk about flaunting their relationship.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.290
C'mon, let's go chat about it over some more drinks!

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.540
<i>I-it's the first time I've seen people kissing!</i>

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.540
<i>I-I see...</i>

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.250
<i>Now that I think about it, it makes sense.</i>

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.630
<i>A kiss is something that couples
and people who love each other do.</i>

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.080
Huh? Wait, in that case...

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.040
<i>Doesn't that mean I love Nazuna-chan already?</i>

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.130
<i>My heart's pounding and all.</i>

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.080
<i>Then I guess that means, in other words...</i>

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.710
<i>I've achieved my goal of falling in love with a vampire?</i>

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.960
<i>Whoa!</i>

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.830
<i>Yay! That means I get to become a vampire!</i>

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.380
<i>Goodbye normalcy, ordinary life, tough times!</i>

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.500
<i>Good evening, new me!</i>

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:22.830
Hey, you!

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.920
What the heck are you doing here?!

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.880
I was waiting where you'd find me right away!

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.130
Nazuna-chan...

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.210
Your timing couldn't have been better.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.000
Why are you acting all weird?

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.500
I'm all ready for you!

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.080
Come on, whenever you want!
Have a bite!

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.460
Th-that's indecent!

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.000
Cut out the lewd pose!

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.250
What's with you today?

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.750
Something's off.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.460
Like, with your head.

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.880
Say what you want.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.580
I'll have you know that I, Ko Yamori,

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.630
have achieved what was thought to be
the toughest of missions:

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.920
to fall in love with a vampire!

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:08.380
Are you joking?

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.500
Why would I joke about this?!

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.580
I've never felt firmer about anything!

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.380
You feel "firm," huh?

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.580
So, what, you're...

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.000
in love with me?

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Yup!

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.380
Fine, then.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.670
Come here.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.130
<i>Is this it?</i>

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.290
<i>Am I going to be a vampire?</i>

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.040
<i>All that stuff about having to go to school,</i>

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.880
<i>morning versus nighttime,</i>

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.040
<i>friends, parents, being human...</i>

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.040
<i>I'll be free from all of it!</i>

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.330
<i>Finally...</i>

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.380
<i>Finally!</i>

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.380
Whew, that's mad tasty.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:15.920
Am I one now?

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.080
Why would you be, moron?

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:18.880
Huh?

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:21.250
Why?! This wasn't the deal!

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.500
"Why"?

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.130
Because you aren't in love, obviously.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.920
Huh?! But I am!
Excuse me?!

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.420
Look, I know what happened.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.830
You're confused because of yesterday.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.830
One little kiss and you thought you were in love, right?

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.250
You know what that is?

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:42.710
That's lust.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.080
R-really?

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.330
It's not healthy to think of romantic love
and lust as separate things,

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.710
but yeah, at least in this case,
that's probably what it is.

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.000
You mean when you kissed me...

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.130
I got aroused?

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:03.500
Guess so!

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.580
Did you enjoy it that much?

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:07.960
Want another one?

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.130
Y-you're awful!

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.790
It was my first ever and you're acting like it was nothing!

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.130
Oh really?

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:15.380
Sure, you've probably had plenty of others!

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.380
What a coincidence.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.040
It was my first, too.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:23.670
Um...

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:27.670
Is it okay that it was with me?

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:28.960
Why?

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:32.290
Kissing is what you do with friends!

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.880
Okay...

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.920
<b>4th Night: Isnâ€™t This a Tight Squeeze?</b>

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.830
It's still nighttime.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.000
<i>Lately, I haven't been sleeping well.</i>

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.500
Akira...

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.580
Yamori...

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:16.130
You're in uniform, which means...

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.170
Huh? You're not on your way home, are you?

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:19.710
I just got up.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.250
What? It's midnight.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.960
Are you sure you should be waking up now?

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:27.960
Doesn't the same go for you, though?

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.000
So, Yamori...

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.880
Are you going to see that vampire now?

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:36.880
Yeah.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:43.210
Look, Yamori, people need to sleep at night, you know.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:48.920
Our teacher said we should get our bodies used to
a healthy sleep cycle while we're still young.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.540
Doesn't the same go for you, though?

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.750
But I'm sleeping, unlike you.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:00.710
You're going to stay up and go straight to school, right?

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.210
That's the plan.

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:03.580
Okay, then!

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.420
Why don't you come hang out?

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:06.630
With Nazuna-chan and me?

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.670
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:12.960
Take that!

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:15.380
All right!

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:19.880
Yup, you suck bigtime!

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.750
Dammit! I can't beat you at all!

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:25.540
Nazuna-chan, I bet you've played this a million times!

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:29.420
Vampires have a lot of time our hands.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:32.170
You wanna try, Asai-chan?

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.540
If you win against me, I'll give you a kiss.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.500
Uh, that's a hard pass.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.920
Then do you want to play a different game?

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.710
It's the kiss I don't want.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:45.580
Huh?!

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.830
Wait, is the "kiss for winning"
something you're telling Yamori too?

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:49.830
Yeah.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:51.040
Hey, no you haven't!

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.330
Will you stop with that kind of thing?!

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.330
Well yeah, I guess we kiss
without those conditions, anyway.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:56.330
Hey, wha-

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:57.330
Huh?!

00:10:58.540 --> 00:10:59.750
Yamori...

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:01.290
Yes?

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:06.250
Look, I want to be supportive,

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:09.580
whoever you choose to like or go out with.

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:15.960
But you know, with an obscene monster like this,
it's hard for me to be understanding.

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:17.790
An obscene monster...

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.960
Just so you know,
Ko-kun doesn't like me or anything.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.080
Huh?

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.670
What do you want to play next?

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:26.670
Sorry I don't have a lot of party games.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.960
I'm not that into party games myself-

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.500

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:48.630
Right?

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.880
They all like the protagonist way too much
from the beginning, don't they?

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:53.790
Where's the fun in romancing them?

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:55.000
That's not it.

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:58.290
Hit on them once and he'll bed them
by the end of the day.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.460
You think they'll do it in the school bathroom?

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:01.880

What? You startled me.

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:13.000
You should go to school!

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:14.880
But I can't be bothered...

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:17.790
Why are you like that in the video game, too?

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:21.580
I mean, I never liked big groups to begin with.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:25.000
I don't know what they're after,
but I don't wanna go to school

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.250
with a bunch of people who crowd me in the morning
and talk at me in loud voices.

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:31.000
Your tone is way too serious.

This is bad, Ko-kun.

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:44.880
They're gonna take you anyway.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.420
Dammit, what was the point of the selection?

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.920

Her skirt's so short...

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.210

I liked that girl the best.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:17.080
Her tits are huge, too.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.330
Can you not say tits, please?

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.460
What's your deal, Ko-kun?

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:25.630
Are girls you don't have to talk with
whose bosoms are huge your type?

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.960
Why would you say "bosoms"?

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.170
It's more erotic to say "bosom"
instead of "breasts," y'know?

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:34.130
You don't have to sound erotic.

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:35.580
So do you?

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:37.630
Do you like big boobs?

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:45.920
I mean, b... b... don't really matter...

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.290
You're so embarassed, middle schooler!

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:51.170
Middle schoolers get embarassed, okay?!

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:57.540
<i>I'm a little relieved to know Yamori
hasn't changed much in that respect.</i>

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:02.580
<i>When he said he was fooling around at night, I thought
he might be up to something sketchy,</i>

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.000
<i>but it's actually pretty wholesome I guess?</i>

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:09.170
By the way, it's almost four o'clock.

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:10.710
Why don't we go to sleep soon?

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.210
I want some blood, too.

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:14.250
Oh okay, I'll save the game.

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:15.790
Let's continue when we wake up.

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:19.170
What?! Don't tell me you sleep together?!

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:22.710
Uh, well, but there's nothing indecent about it...

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:26.080
A guy and girl sleeping together
is indecent enough, isn't it?

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.580
Nazuna-chan! That's not what you said before!

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:33.250
And today, it's guy-girl-girl, you know?

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:37.540
Huh?

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:39.920
No, no...

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.290
No! No way!

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:42.540
Isn't this a tight squeeze?!

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:44.670
You say that after you lie down?

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:46.960
Something smells nice...

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.710
No, no! This is way too weird!

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:50.920
I'm going to school.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:53.000
The gates will open in about two hours, anyway.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.460
Huh? That's dangerous!
It's the middle of the night!

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:56.880
You mean early morning!

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.040
But you know, Asai-chan,
it's probably raining right now.

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:02.210
And I don't have any umbrellas.

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:07.500
Why don't you just wait out the rain?

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:11.500
No... No, no way!

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:13.540
Do that elsewhere!

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.960
I TOLD you not to do it in front of my friend!

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.540
Well, just hear me out.

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:27.170
Isn't guilty pleasure great for spicing things up?

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.960
Please don't use me for spicing things up.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:34.460
Anyway, what's the deal with that thing you're doing?

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:38.080
The "deal"?

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:41.080
Supply and demand.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.250
Supply and demand?

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.960
Ko-kun, see, has ridiculously tasty blood.

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:52.170
Okay, is that so?

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:55.920
And Ko-kun wants me to suck his blood!

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:57.580
Okay...

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Supply...

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.040
and demand...

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:00.630
...met!

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:01.630
Ow!
...met!<b></b>

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.750
Uh, I don't get it at all!

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:08.130
But that's really the only way to explain it.

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:09.210
Right?

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:10.630
Well, I mean...

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.710
Why do you want her to, Yamori?

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:16.210
Huh?

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:17.790
You're really gonna ask that?!

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:22.420
C'mon, tell her straight, Yamori-san!

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:25.710
Y-you see, Akira-san...

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.250
"-san"?

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.380
I'm hoping to become a vampire someday!

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:34.500
Yeah! You sure told her, Ko-kun!

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:38.460
Uh...

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:42.290
It's great you have a dream for the future, I guess?

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.830
Thanks so much for sugarcoating that
comment the best you could.

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:51.750
You never liked talking about what you
want to be someday, did you?

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.080
Right.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.630
What an unimaginative kid.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.830
Uh, if so...

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:00.790
Huh? If a vampire drinks your blood...

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:02.710
don't you become one?

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.330
Did it happen already?

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:06.460
Yeah! But this is the important part!

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.670
Well, no need to talk about that.
Let's just sleep.

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:10.080
No, Nazuna-chan!

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:12.000
This is the crux of the matter.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.250
Does it really matter?

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:14.460
I'm sleepy.

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.080
Then go ahead and sleep!

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:20.290
Just getting my blood sucked isn't enough!

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:23.750
When I fall in love with Nazuna-chan
and then have my blood sucked,

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:25.670
that's when I get to be a vampire!

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:28.790
Stop, stop! I'm so embarassed!

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:32.080
That's why I want to fall in love with Nazuna-chan!

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:34.670
Eek! Don't say that!

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:36.790
Do you understand now?

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:38.420
I guess.

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:40.630
What's up with her?

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:43.830
Nazuna-chan loves lewd jokes,

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:46.170
but gets really embarassed over talk about romance.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.210
But that's an issue you guys can't avoid.

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:50.960
I think so, too.

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.710
Hey, are the two of you done talking?

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:55.420
Let's sleep.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.750
No, really,

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.130
I'm leaving once the rain lets up,

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:04.290
so I shouldn't have to lie down with you two.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.500
Besides, I'm not sleepy.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.330
Oh, come on.

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:10.130
Don't be such a square.

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:12.580
If you stay lying down you just might fall asleep.

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:21.580
Akira...

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:25.960
Sorry I kinda dragged you into this.

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:30.540
It's just, I thought I should at least show you

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.500
what kind of stuff I'm doing at night.

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.170
Because I guess I made you worry.

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:40.170
Yamori...

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.750
Has it been fun, lately?

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:45.790
Yup.

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.710
Yamori, aren't your arms tired?

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:54.920
You can put them down.

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:57.040
That can't be comfortable.

00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:00.460
Are you worried your hand might touch me?

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:01.830
I don't mind.

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:03.670
U-uh, but...

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:08.210
If you don't release the tension in your shoulders
and relax, you won't get to sleep.

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:11.130
Well, I guess so.

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:22.920
Um, Akira, I said I want to be a vampire,
but don't you-

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.130
Oh, sorry!

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:31.750
I mean, even if you become vampire,
we can still be friends, right?

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:37.540
There's already precedence between
you and Nanakusa-san, Ko.

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.210
You be what you want to be.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.830
It's great that you found a dream.

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:48.880
Thanks.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.960
But I'm still gonna try and get you to come to school.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:53.960
Huh?

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:58.330
Even if you're going to be a vampire,
I still think it can't hurt to study.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:01.790
W-well, I'm pretty good at studying.

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:03.790
I know that.

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:11.960
If even a little part of you thinks about going,
let me know.

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:13.750
Okay, goodnight.

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:15.830
Goodnight.

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:20.830
<i>I haven't said goodnight in ages.</i>

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.000
<i>I always fall asleep so early.</i>

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:25.790
<i>Once the rain lets up, I'll go to school.</i>

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:27.790
<i>I'm not sleepy, anyway.</i>

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:33.630
<i>I hope he comes to school someday.</i>

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:38.130
<i>I'm sure it will be fun...</i>

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:42.920
Huh?

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:47.000
What?! Shoot!

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.420
Was I asleep for like, four hours?!

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:49.920
I-I'm going to be late!

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:52.580
Ko, I'm off.

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:54.580
Can I just leave?

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:57.920
Akira...

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.500
Have a good day...

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.380
Thank you...

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:06.960
Yo!

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.540
Didja sleep well?

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:13.880
People sleep well when
they're satisfied with their day, you see.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.670
Do you feel satisfied?

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:22.000
Who knows?

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:24.170
Maybe?

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:31.330
