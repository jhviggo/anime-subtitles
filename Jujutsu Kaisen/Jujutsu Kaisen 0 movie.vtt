WEBVTT

00:41.180 --> 00:44.010
Long time no see, Okkotsu.

00:45.010 --> 00:46.810
Don't come near me.

00:47.260 --> 00:50.940
Oh, come on, don't be so cold.

00:51.900 --> 00:53.570
I said don't.

00:54.150 --> 00:57.230
Do you know how much
I've wanted to slug you?

00:57.610 --> 01:00.700
Just imagine how I've felt.

01:00.700 --> 01:01.490
Right?

01:01.490 --> 01:02.620
Stop it.

01:02.950 --> 01:08.200
If you keep me on edge like this,
I might just kill you.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.200
Don't come near me!

01:09.200 --> 01:10.200
Rika-chan!

01:10.410 --> 01:12.670
Huh? Rika?

01:21.720 --> 01:22.640
I'm sorry.

01:23.970 --> 01:25.180
I'm sorry.

01:26.970 --> 01:27.970
I'm sorry.

01:28.510 --> 01:29.640
I'm sorry.

01:29.850 --> 01:31.730
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

01:33.360 --> 01:35.150
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

01:54.080 --> 01:56.960
A complete cover-up and a secret execution?

01:57.580 --> 01:58.920
That's ridiculous.

01:59.670 --> 02:02.010
The boy in question consented, though.

02:03.230 --> 02:04.210
He's underage.

02:04.800 --> 02:06.590
Just a 16-year-old child.

02:07.260 --> 02:10.220
We also don't know how
many he'd curse to death.

02:11.150 --> 02:14.810
He's already turned the tables
on three grade 2 sorcerers

02:14.810 --> 02:16.580
and a grade 1 sorcerer.

02:17.190 --> 02:19.650
That's why you've turned to me.

02:21.490 --> 02:23.320
Have you forgotten that?

02:24.950 --> 02:26.320
Then you're actually...

02:26.530 --> 02:27.780
Yes.

02:27.780 --> 02:29.320
Okkotsu Yuta...

02:30.070 --> 02:32.210
will be taken to Jujutsu High.

02:35.960 --> 02:37.170
What is this,

02:38.080 --> 02:39.750
Okkotsu Yuta-kun?

02:40.840 --> 02:43.510
It used to be a knife.

02:45.260 --> 02:46.760
I tried to die,

02:48.720 --> 02:51.440
but Rika-chan interfered.

02:53.050 --> 02:54.050
That's dark.

02:57.230 --> 02:59.440
You're starting at a new school today.

03:00.310 --> 03:01.700
I'm not going.

03:05.030 --> 03:07.570
I don't want to hurt anyone anymore,

03:08.110 --> 03:11.080
so I'm not going outside anymore.

03:12.210 --> 03:13.160
But...

03:14.080 --> 03:15.790
living by yourself gets lonely.

03:19.250 --> 03:21.470
The curse placed upon you

03:21.880 --> 03:23.550
is one that can save people, too,
depending on how it's used.

03:23.550 --> 03:26.220
<b>Tokyo
Jujutsu High School
is one that can save people, too,
depending on how it's used.</b>

03:27.340 --> 03:29.590
Learn how to use that power.

03:30.220 --> 03:31.930
It's not like it'll be too late

03:32.390 --> 03:34.390
to cast everything away after that.

06:29.850 --> 06:32.700
Did you hear about the
transfer student coming today?

06:32.990 --> 06:36.530
They say he "stuffed" four of
his classmates into a locker.

06:36.530 --> 06:37.570
He killed them?

06:37.570 --> 06:38.700
Tuna mayo?

06:39.070 --> 06:41.120
No, but gravely injured, apparently.

06:41.120 --> 06:45.330
Hmm... Well, if he's cocky, I'll wring him out.

06:45.620 --> 06:46.750
Bonito flakes.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.220
I'll now... be introducing...
the transfer student!

06:52.220 --> 06:55.220
Everyone, get excited!

06:57.880 --> 06:59.220
Get excited.

07:00.340 --> 07:02.730
I heard he's an awfully sour one.

07:03.270 --> 07:06.810
I'm not going to create the mood
for someone like that.

07:07.190 --> 07:08.140
Salmon.

07:12.320 --> 07:13.610
Oh, well.

07:15.150 --> 07:16.740
Come on in!

07:17.240 --> 07:20.360
I sense a really damp mood in there.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.500
I'll ignore him.

07:41.480 --> 07:42.890
Wha?!

07:45.270 --> 07:46.560
I'm Okkotsu Yutâ€”

07:48.350 --> 07:50.310
Is this some kind of test?

07:52.400 --> 07:53.570
Hey.

07:55.020 --> 07:57.820
You're cursed.

07:58.240 --> 08:00.660
This is a place to learn curses.

08:00.950 --> 08:03.750
It's not a place for the cursed to be.

08:03.750 --> 08:04.450
Huh?

08:06.620 --> 08:10.370
The number of people that die
mysterious deaths or go missing

08:10.370 --> 08:12.920
in Japan is over 10,000 a year on average.

08:13.420 --> 08:17.000
Most of those are casualties of curses

08:17.000 --> 08:19.880
born from the negative emotions of people.

08:20.300 --> 08:23.680
Among them are also malicious
cases caused by curse users.

08:24.060 --> 08:27.850
Only curses can affect other curses.

08:28.520 --> 08:31.320
This where we learn curses
to exorcise curses:

08:31.940 --> 08:34.820
Tokyo Jujutsu High School.

08:37.150 --> 08:39.310
Tell me that ahead of time!

08:41.580 --> 08:43.450
He just now told him that?!

08:44.060 --> 08:45.450
Sorry.

08:45.450 --> 08:48.200
Oh, you all should back away quickly.

08:54.550 --> 08:57.420
Do not...

08:57.420 --> 08:59.420
Wait! Rika-chan!

09:00.050 --> 09:03.850
...bully Yuta!

09:13.860 --> 09:15.230
Over there, over there!

09:15.230 --> 09:16.400
What is it?

09:18.270 --> 09:21.240
Happy birthday, Yuta.

09:25.330 --> 09:28.120
Yay! Can I open it?

09:28.320 --> 09:29.330
Go ahead.

09:29.330 --> 09:31.250
Huh? I can open it?!

09:31.250 --> 09:32.420
I said go ahead.

09:32.420 --> 09:33.790
Wow!

09:38.500 --> 09:40.170
Huh? A ring?

09:40.800 --> 09:42.470
An engagement ring.

09:42.470 --> 09:43.680
Engagement?

09:55.940 --> 09:57.310
It's a promise.

09:58.480 --> 10:02.770
That when we both grow up,
we'll get married.

10:07.700 --> 10:08.820
Is this real?!

10:09.450 --> 10:10.200
Hey!

10:10.670 --> 10:12.290
Hey! Call an ambulance!

10:12.290 --> 10:12.710
Idiot! Look at her!

10:12.710 --> 10:14.290
Are they okay?
Idiot! Look at her!

10:14.790 --> 10:15.000
There's no saving her!

10:15.000 --> 10:16.170
What happened?
There's no saving her!

10:16.170 --> 10:16.540
Her head's crushed in!
What happened?

10:16.540 --> 10:17.960
Her head's crushed in!

10:17.960 --> 10:19.290
But still...

10:19.880 --> 10:21.340
A child got run over by a car! Yes! Hurry!

10:21.340 --> 10:22.720
Help them!
A child got run over by a car! Yes! Hurry!

10:22.720 --> 10:23.550
A child got run over by a car! Yes! Hurry!

10:25.800 --> 10:28.510
I can't go near that!

10:28.920 --> 10:30.300
Rika-chan?

10:31.900 --> 10:34.770
Yuta...

10:43.070 --> 10:45.570
Yuta.

10:46.410 --> 10:49.950
When we grow up,

10:49.950 --> 10:54.750
we'll get married!

10:57.960 --> 10:59.270
It's a promise.

11:00.420 --> 11:01.930
So as you can see,

11:01.930 --> 11:05.590
this is the boy cursed by Rika-chan,
who just <i>loves</i> him...

11:05.880 --> 11:08.680
Okkotsu Yuta-kun!

11:08.680 --> 11:11.350
Be nice to him, everyone!

11:12.890 --> 11:17.560
If you attack Yuta, Rika-chan's
curse will activate... or not.

11:17.560 --> 11:20.530
Either way, be careful, everyone.

11:21.320 --> 11:23.150
Say that sooner.

11:23.860 --> 11:25.900
These guys are being all rebellious,

11:25.900 --> 11:27.900
so I'll introduce them quick-like.

11:28.490 --> 11:31.290
I have a feeling this teacher is the problem.

11:31.620 --> 11:34.330
This is the cursed tool user, Zen'in Maki.

11:34.330 --> 11:37.160
She uses special tools to exorcise curses.

11:38.290 --> 11:40.970
This is the cursed
speech user, Inumaki Toge.

11:40.970 --> 11:44.050
He can only speak in rice ball ingredients,
so good luck conversing.

11:44.550 --> 11:45.420
Kelp.

11:45.420 --> 11:46.630
This is Panda.

11:46.630 --> 11:48.920
I'm Panda. Nice to meet you.

11:49.670 --> 11:51.810
Well, there you have it.

11:52.060 --> 11:54.890
He didn't give me the
explanation I wanted most!

11:55.680 --> 11:59.020
Okay, now there are four first-years!

12:00.060 --> 12:02.820
Three and one animal.

12:03.240 --> 12:05.280
For your afternoon jujutsu practice,

12:05.610 --> 12:07.900
you'll be in pairs of two on two.

12:08.190 --> 12:09.940
Toge, Panda, pair up.

12:09.940 --> 12:10.910
Let's do our best.

12:11.540 --> 12:13.540
Maki, Yuta, pair up.

12:13.540 --> 12:14.250
Geh!

12:15.040 --> 12:16.370
She just voiced disgust?!

12:22.420 --> 12:26.380
U-Um, I-I hope we can work together.

12:29.010 --> 12:31.640
You were bullied, weren't you?

12:37.520 --> 12:38.930
Bull's-eye, huh?

12:38.930 --> 12:41.570
I totally get it. Even I'd bully you.

12:42.440 --> 12:43.940
Maybe it's because of your curse?

12:44.440 --> 12:47.780
It's written on your face that you're
branding yourself as a good person.

12:47.780 --> 12:48.690
It's sickening.

12:49.820 --> 12:52.990
Why are you acting like the victim
when you're being protected?

12:53.660 --> 12:55.950
You've been passive your
whole life, haven't you?

12:57.200 --> 12:59.950
Jujutsu High isn't so easy that

13:00.750 --> 13:03.090
you can get by without any goal.

13:05.090 --> 13:05.840
Maki!

13:05.840 --> 13:07.380
That's enough!

13:07.380 --> 13:08.750
Bonito flakes.

13:09.590 --> 13:12.680
Okay, fine. Get off my case.

13:13.430 --> 13:14.850
Sorry about her.

13:14.850 --> 13:18.560
She has a habit of acting
like she understands others.

13:19.100 --> 13:20.100
No...

13:21.110 --> 13:23.150
She's right.

13:29.150 --> 13:30.020
Where are we?

13:30.020 --> 13:31.950
It's just an elementary school.

13:31.950 --> 13:32.620
Huh?

13:32.620 --> 13:36.660
Just an elementary school where
some children have gone missing.

13:37.080 --> 13:38.700
Missing?!

13:38.700 --> 13:40.880
It happens in places like this.

13:41.500 --> 13:44.590
It's probably the work of
a naturally-occurring curse.

13:45.710 --> 13:49.000
You're saying the kids
were kidnapped by a curse?

13:49.000 --> 13:50.040
Yup.

13:50.040 --> 13:51.850
Two so far.

13:51.850 --> 13:54.930
Curses tend to settle in spots

13:54.930 --> 13:56.940
that many people have memories of.

13:58.430 --> 14:01.150
Schools, hospitals...

14:01.150 --> 14:05.520
Places often remembered with negative
emotions are a receptacle for them.

14:06.270 --> 14:08.110
As those emotions build up,

14:08.110 --> 14:10.660
they cause a curse to be born,
like it was here.

14:11.320 --> 14:14.370
We're here to exorcise the curse
and save the children,

14:14.370 --> 14:16.030
or if they're dead, retrieve them.

14:16.280 --> 14:18.490
Huh? Dead?

14:20.490 --> 14:23.540
Emerge from darkness, blacker than darkness.

14:23.540 --> 14:25.790
Purify that which is impure.

14:30.930 --> 14:32.640
It's turning into night?

14:33.970 --> 14:35.640
It's a veil.

14:35.640 --> 14:38.510
It's a barrier that will smoke out the curse

14:38.510 --> 14:40.970
and keep you all from
being seen by those outside.

14:42.770 --> 14:44.810
It's easy to undo from inside.

14:47.690 --> 14:49.900
Now, do be careful...

14:50.310 --> 14:52.160
not to die.

14:52.160 --> 14:54.820
D-Die? Sensei?!

14:54.820 --> 14:56.360
Transfer student.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.410
Don't get distracted.

15:04.940 --> 15:09.850
Put... me... on?

15:13.470 --> 15:16.380
Put me on?

15:17.130 --> 15:18.380
I-It's coming this way!

15:18.760 --> 15:20.300
Wh-Wh-What do we do?!

15:20.300 --> 15:21.640
Don't scream.

15:25.980 --> 15:26.980
Remember this.

15:27.310 --> 15:29.060
The weaker curses are,

15:29.060 --> 15:31.360
the more they group together.

15:36.700 --> 15:39.490
Of course, the same could be said for humans.

15:39.950 --> 15:41.330
Incredible...

15:42.710 --> 15:44.000
Just one blow...

15:45.710 --> 15:47.660
Come on, let's move it.

15:47.660 --> 15:49.370
Huh? Where to?

15:49.870 --> 15:51.670
Inside, obviously.

16:02.980 --> 16:05.980
Zen'in-san, aren't you scared?

16:05.980 --> 16:07.480
Don't use my last name.

16:07.480 --> 16:09.520
S-Sorry...

16:09.520 --> 16:12.170
But it really seems like
ghosts would be here.

16:13.650 --> 16:15.440
Though we've already seen some.

16:15.690 --> 16:19.440
There aren't many curses here,
even though the veil's been drawn.

16:20.320 --> 16:23.120
No, they're here, just not attacking.

16:25.790 --> 16:28.370
Is it because he's here?

16:28.370 --> 16:30.370
Something just moved!

16:30.840 --> 16:31.760
Hey!

16:31.760 --> 16:32.670
Yes?!

16:33.210 --> 16:35.260
What grade are you?

16:35.540 --> 16:37.260
Huh? In English proficiency?

16:37.630 --> 16:40.850
Jujutsu sorcerers are ranked
in grades from 4 to 1.

16:40.850 --> 16:44.520
But I only just came to Jujutsu High.

16:45.220 --> 16:46.640
I don't think I have that.

16:47.020 --> 16:49.560
Ugh, forget it.

16:49.560 --> 16:51.410
Show me your student ID.

16:51.410 --> 16:53.530
You got one from that
dumb blindfolded guy, right?

16:54.650 --> 16:56.530
Dumb blindfolded guy?

16:57.940 --> 16:59.280
Yes, here you go.

16:59.780 --> 17:03.290
Well, if you joined with no prior history,
you're probably grade 4...

17:03.910 --> 17:05.160
Special-grade?!

17:05.870 --> 17:09.620
Special-grade is above
even grade 1, isn't it?

17:09.620 --> 17:11.880
This sounds like it has to be a joke!

17:11.880 --> 17:12.960
Zen'in-san!
This sounds like it has to be a joke!

17:13.300 --> 17:14.880
Zen'in-san! Zen'in-san!

17:15.210 --> 17:16.500
Behind you.

17:30.310 --> 17:31.480
Shit!

17:32.320 --> 17:34.190
You're way too damn big!

17:34.650 --> 17:36.770
You bastard!

17:44.370 --> 17:50.750
Thank, thank, thank you for the meal!

17:52.750 --> 17:54.590
Shit! Shit!

17:54.590 --> 17:56.250
I dropped my cursed tool!

17:56.250 --> 17:58.340
Let us out, damn it!

18:01.260 --> 18:02.680
Where are we?

18:02.680 --> 18:05.470
We're in that curse's stomach!

18:05.470 --> 18:07.410
You shouldn't be passing out over this.

18:07.890 --> 18:09.720
You mean it ate us?!

18:10.140 --> 18:11.150
That's right!

18:11.150 --> 18:14.060
I thought you were being
protected by your curse?!

18:14.060 --> 18:17.980
Even I don't know what
makes Rika-chan come out!

18:17.980 --> 18:20.060
More importantly, what do we do now?!

18:20.060 --> 18:23.320
After time passes and the veil
goes away, help will come for us.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.700
This is embarrassing! Shit!

18:27.200 --> 18:28.320
Help!

18:29.070 --> 18:29.950
Huh?

18:30.410 --> 18:33.140
Please! He's about to die!

18:36.670 --> 18:40.040
You're saying the kids
were kidnapped by a curse?

18:40.040 --> 18:41.050
Yup.

18:41.050 --> 18:42.890
Two so far.

18:42.890 --> 18:45.760
We're here to exorcise the curse
and save the children,

18:45.760 --> 18:47.430
or if they're dead, retrieve them.

18:47.970 --> 18:50.650
Thank goodness they're alive.

18:50.650 --> 18:52.020
No, it's not good.

18:52.730 --> 18:53.900
Look closer.

18:55.310 --> 18:58.440
The big one's obviously been
affected by the curse, too.

18:58.440 --> 19:00.740
Both of them could die at any minute.

19:01.990 --> 19:03.450
Oh, no...

19:04.030 --> 19:05.110
What do we do?!

19:05.110 --> 19:06.740
There's nothing we can do!

19:06.740 --> 19:08.860
We can only wait for help!

19:09.160 --> 19:13.580
Not everyone has a resistance
to curses like you do!

19:15.290 --> 19:16.420
Zen'in-san?

19:18.620 --> 19:20.210
Zen'in-san?!

19:23.880 --> 19:25.510
What's this wound?

19:26.840 --> 19:28.800
Are you cursed?

19:29.840 --> 19:32.730
Is she going to die?

19:34.480 --> 19:37.600
Please, save us, mister!

19:39.270 --> 19:40.570
Please!

19:41.780 --> 19:45.450
You keep asking, but I can'tâ€”

19:45.450 --> 19:46.700
Okkotsu!

19:47.320 --> 19:50.620
Seriously, why did you come

19:51.290 --> 19:53.040
to Jujutsu High?!

19:54.960 --> 19:56.250
What do you want to do?!

19:56.250 --> 19:58.710
What do you want to have?!
What do you want to achieve?!

20:00.040 --> 20:04.300
I... don't want anyone to get hurt anymore.

20:05.380 --> 20:07.660
I tried to lock myself away and disappear.

20:08.760 --> 20:11.980
But I was told it's
lonely being all by myself,

20:12.770 --> 20:14.020
and I couldn't argue.

20:16.980 --> 20:18.810
I want to interact with someone!

20:20.180 --> 20:22.320
I want to be needed by someone!

20:22.320 --> 20:26.360
I want the confidence to
say it's okay that I'm alive!

20:28.440 --> 20:30.190
Then exorcise them.

20:32.040 --> 20:34.790
Exorcise curses, exorcise them,
exorcise them over and over!

20:36.160 --> 20:39.790
Confidence and friends will
all come to you after that!

20:41.170 --> 20:46.260
That's the kind of place Jujutsu High is!

20:58.100 --> 20:59.060
Rika-chan.

21:00.820 --> 21:01.730
What?

21:04.320 --> 21:05.690
Lend me your strength.

21:17.540 --> 21:21.550
Who are you?

21:29.750 --> 21:32.760
Be quiet!

21:36.010 --> 21:37.890
Now that's terrifying.

21:38.470 --> 21:40.940
So this is the full picture of Orimoto Rika,

21:40.940 --> 21:43.070
the special-grade cursed apparition?

21:45.650 --> 21:46.900
So scary.

21:47.820 --> 21:49.020
Wow!

21:49.520 --> 21:50.950
So pretty!

21:51.990 --> 21:54.990
I'm so pretty!

21:54.990 --> 21:57.620
I love it!

22:05.710 --> 22:06.880
Everyone...

22:08.340 --> 22:10.000
It's just a little further!

22:11.180 --> 22:13.430
I need to get Sensei to check them all soon,

22:14.220 --> 22:17.220
while Rika-chan's distracting the curses!

22:27.190 --> 22:29.230
I can't collapse yet!

22:30.440 --> 22:31.490
Not yet!

22:36.570 --> 22:41.880
I just decided I was going
to change, here and now!

22:44.210 --> 22:45.330
You can do it,

22:47.250 --> 22:48.360
Yuta.

22:53.340 --> 22:54.480
Yeah, I will!

22:59.970 --> 23:01.350
Welcome back.

23:02.400 --> 23:03.600
You did well.

23:10.950 --> 23:14.110
They say both Maki and the kids will be fine.

23:14.820 --> 23:16.200
Thank goodness.

23:17.240 --> 23:19.620
You don't look very satisfied.

23:21.250 --> 23:25.250
I managed to call Rika-chan
out myself for the first time.

23:25.580 --> 23:28.250
Really? That's a step forward.

24:13.630 --> 24:15.300
One, two...

24:17.470 --> 24:19.510
Stop, Yuta!

24:21.060 --> 24:23.180
I said stop!

24:26.890 --> 24:29.480
Stop, Rika-chan!

24:29.480 --> 24:30.900
There! Take that!

24:39.690 --> 24:40.910
It's a promise.

24:41.200 --> 24:44.910
When we both grow up, we'll get married.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
Sure!

24:51.920 --> 24:57.710
Then we'll be together forever and ever!

25:00.810 --> 25:01.970
What's wrong?

25:02.970 --> 25:04.100
Nothing...

25:04.770 --> 25:07.350
Just remembering something.

25:08.470 --> 25:11.320
I don't think Rika-chan cursed me.

25:12.320 --> 25:15.360
I think I might have cursed Rika-chan.

25:17.900 --> 25:20.030
This is my personal theory,

25:20.030 --> 25:22.350
but there's no curse more twisted than love.

25:29.580 --> 25:30.590
Sensei.

25:31.590 --> 25:35.250
While I'm at Jujutsu High,

25:36.300 --> 25:38.500
I'll break Rika-chan's curse.

25:59.110 --> 26:02.490
The special-grade cursed
apparition, Orimoto Rika,

26:02.490 --> 26:05.580
was fully manifested for 422 seconds.

26:05.910 --> 26:10.750
We entrusted you with Okkotsu
precisely to prevent this sort of thing.

26:10.750 --> 26:13.090
There's no room for excuses,

26:13.090 --> 26:14.290
Gojo Satoru.

26:14.840 --> 26:18.500
Well, I never planned on making any excuses.

26:18.500 --> 26:20.380
How can you joke about this?!

26:20.380 --> 26:23.010
If Orimoto Rika had remained out of control,

26:23.010 --> 26:25.600
she could have wiped out an entire town!

26:26.010 --> 26:28.600
I would have risked my life to stop her.

26:29.140 --> 26:33.610
Listen, there's only one thing
we can say about that curse:

26:34.310 --> 26:35.610
"I don't understand."

26:36.270 --> 26:39.440
Why did a little girl who wasn't
from any line of jujutsu sorcerers

26:39.440 --> 26:42.910
become such an immense curse?

26:43.620 --> 26:47.320
We can't control something
we don't understand.

26:48.200 --> 26:50.920
So it'll take trial and error.

26:50.920 --> 26:52.920
Just leave it alone for a while.

26:53.880 --> 26:58.500
Do not forget that Okkotsu's
secret execution was only suspended.

26:59.040 --> 27:00.510
And don't you forget

27:01.470 --> 27:05.840
that if it comes to that,
I'll side with Okkotsu.

27:10.010 --> 27:13.020
Christ, damn rude geezers.

27:14.020 --> 27:16.230
I don't ever want to become like them.

27:16.230 --> 27:18.730
I'll have to be careful.

27:18.980 --> 27:20.700
Besides,

27:20.700 --> 27:25.410
no one's allowed to take
youth away from young people.

27:32.040 --> 27:34.750
Maki, Toge, last lap.

27:37.870 --> 27:39.580
No one is.

27:49.880 --> 27:51.520
Well, go ahead.

27:51.520 --> 27:53.190
S-Sure...

28:06.070 --> 28:10.750
It's nearly impossible to exorcise
a curse as big as Orimoto Rika.

28:10.750 --> 28:13.460
However, breaking it is a different story.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.960
You have to read the thousands, maybe
tens of thousands, of knots of cursed energy,

28:16.960 --> 28:19.330
and unravel them one by one.

28:20.330 --> 28:24.090
It's a method that can only be pursued
by you, the one she's cursed.

28:24.670 --> 28:26.550
What exactly do I do?

28:26.550 --> 28:28.340
Use this.

28:31.640 --> 28:33.100
A katana?

28:33.100 --> 28:36.770
Curses are most stable when
they're possessing an object.

28:37.180 --> 28:41.240
Back then, you used that ring
to connect to Orimoto Rika.

28:41.900 --> 28:43.770
The pipeline's already there.

28:44.320 --> 28:46.320
So now you need to borrow part of Rika's curse,

28:46.320 --> 28:48.610
imbue it into the katana, and control it.

28:49.280 --> 28:51.080
Increase the amount as you repeat it,

28:51.080 --> 28:53.830
and eventually you'll have
all of it under your control.

28:54.660 --> 28:56.750
Then you're free.

28:58.330 --> 29:00.710
Both you and her.

29:02.010 --> 29:04.800
Imbue the curse into the katana...

29:04.800 --> 29:06.630
And at the same time...

29:06.630 --> 29:08.920
You need to learn how to wield a blade!

29:09.880 --> 29:13.060
You're super weak, after all.

29:13.520 --> 29:16.220
First, we'll have to train you thoroughly.

29:48.260 --> 29:49.340
Tuna.

30:07.400 --> 30:09.070
Hey, hey, everyone!

30:09.070 --> 30:10.660
How's it going?

30:10.660 --> 30:12.580
Oh, uh...

30:13.450 --> 30:15.280
Don't get distracted.

30:16.160 --> 30:17.160
Right.

30:17.160 --> 30:18.910
Take your stance already, idiot!

30:18.910 --> 30:20.120
She's ruthless!

30:20.790 --> 30:21.590
Right!

30:22.420 --> 30:25.090
You're going to land a
blow on me, aren't you?

30:27.750 --> 30:28.590
Yes!

30:44.190 --> 30:45.310
She dodged that?!

30:46.150 --> 30:47.360
But she's off-balance!

30:47.360 --> 30:49.400
I'll get her on the landing!

30:52.120 --> 30:53.030
No way!

30:57.160 --> 30:58.660
There, you're dead.

30:59.030 --> 31:01.170
I win again.

31:01.500 --> 31:03.670
Was that last part necessary?

31:03.670 --> 31:05.380
Don't be soft.

31:05.380 --> 31:07.540
You should always treat
it like it's a real battle.

31:08.290 --> 31:12.680
Pain or the lack thereof makes a
huge difference in how fast you grow.

31:14.300 --> 31:16.680
That's right. I'm...

31:17.640 --> 31:21.350
One more, please!

31:22.730 --> 31:26.190
I'm going to break Rika-chan's curse!

31:29.480 --> 31:32.660
It's been three months since
Yuta came to Jujutsu High.

31:32.910 --> 31:35.110
His movements have gotten a lot better.

31:35.110 --> 31:35.950
Salmon.

31:35.950 --> 31:38.700
His personality is more positive now, too.

31:38.700 --> 31:39.660
Salmon roe.

31:39.990 --> 31:42.870
Maki looks like she's having fun, too.

31:42.870 --> 31:46.000
Before now, she didn't get to spar
much with a fellow weaponâ€”

31:48.210 --> 31:49.670
Revelation!

31:49.920 --> 31:52.930
Yuta! Hey, come here!

31:52.930 --> 31:54.510
Come on!

31:54.510 --> 31:55.180
Huh?

31:55.510 --> 31:57.430
What's up, Panda-kun?

31:57.430 --> 32:00.690
A super important discussion! Listen closely!

32:01.100 --> 32:04.100
Do you prefer big boobs or small boobs?

32:04.440 --> 32:05.690
Right now?!

32:05.890 --> 32:08.690
I've never really given it much thought...

32:10.060 --> 32:12.820
But I suppose I prefer them somewhat big?

32:12.820 --> 32:14.700
Oh-ho?

32:15.320 --> 32:16.450
Maki!

32:16.450 --> 32:17.450
Huh?

32:17.950 --> 32:20.280
You've got a chance!

32:20.280 --> 32:23.710
Chance! Chance! Chance!

32:23.710 --> 32:25.960
What crazy ideas are you getting?
I'll kill you!

32:25.960 --> 32:27.620
Don't be so shy!
Are you an elementary schooler?

32:27.620 --> 32:29.210
All right, I'll kill you!

32:29.210 --> 32:30.920
I don't give a damn about CITES!

32:30.920 --> 32:32.220
What's this about?
I don't give a damn about CITES!

32:33.010 --> 32:34.050
Kelp.

32:38.800 --> 32:42.230
I still don't really understand Inumaki-kun,

32:42.520 --> 32:44.520
so he's a little scary...

32:46.020 --> 32:49.020
Okay, gather round!

32:49.600 --> 32:52.610
You two, continue your training.

32:53.650 --> 32:55.030
Toge, you've been requested.

32:55.280 --> 32:57.240
It's a curse you're perfect for.

32:57.240 --> 32:58.990
Go exorcise it quickly.

32:58.990 --> 33:00.030
Salmon.

33:00.030 --> 33:01.250
Requested?

33:01.620 --> 33:04.200
Toge's the only grade 2
sorcerer among us first-years.

33:04.200 --> 33:06.790
He's allowed to take missions on his own.

33:06.790 --> 33:08.700
Wow, that's impressive.

33:08.700 --> 33:10.300
You're a special-grade.

33:10.650 --> 33:12.550
You go with him, Yuta.

33:12.550 --> 33:14.050
You'll be Toge's support.

33:14.300 --> 33:16.420
Huh? Support?

33:16.420 --> 33:18.590
Well, more like an observer, really.

33:19.920 --> 33:21.850
There's a wide variety of jujutsu,

33:21.850 --> 33:25.270
so you can assume there are as many ways
to exorcise a curse as there are sorcerers.

33:26.220 --> 33:29.060
Toge's cursed speech is one good example.

33:29.060 --> 33:31.070
Make sure to learn from him.

33:31.070 --> 33:32.360
Cursed speech?

33:32.360 --> 33:35.320
As the term suggests,
it's imbuing speech with curses.

33:35.320 --> 33:37.820
Well, it'll make sense once you see it.

33:38.110 --> 33:41.660
To break a curse,
you must first understand curses.

33:43.200 --> 33:45.160
My first real mission...

33:45.160 --> 33:46.620
No, my second.

33:46.620 --> 33:48.990
I'm so nervous!

33:50.840 --> 33:51.960
Salmon.

33:51.960 --> 33:52.840
Huh?!

33:53.300 --> 33:56.050
Oh, I-I'm sorry...

33:57.420 --> 33:59.090
Yuta, one second.

33:59.850 --> 34:00.710
Yes?

34:01.220 --> 34:04.470
Sorry, I won't be able to
supervise this time.

34:04.470 --> 34:07.760
But the job is one Toge could
typically handle on his own,

34:07.760 --> 34:08.930
so you can take it easy.

34:09.400 --> 34:11.900
There's only one thing
you need to be careful of.

34:13.110 --> 34:14.730
Don't let Rika out.

34:16.240 --> 34:19.540
There's no guarantee she'll go back
in like she luckily did last time.

34:20.020 --> 34:23.940
Only use what power of Rika's
that you can imbue in your sword.

34:25.200 --> 34:27.830
If you let her out fully again...

34:27.830 --> 34:29.330
If I let her out?

34:30.420 --> 34:33.340
You and I will both be killed!

34:33.590 --> 34:34.750
Counting on you.

34:35.040 --> 34:35.880
Wha...

34:36.850 --> 34:40.890
Why does he have to rub salt
in that wound right now?!

34:58.150 --> 34:59.360
We've arrived.

35:01.320 --> 35:03.110
Hapina Shopping District.

35:03.110 --> 35:06.370
At this time, most of the
shutters here are closed.

35:06.860 --> 35:12.250
"There's a project to demolish the entire
area and attract a shopping mall."

35:14.710 --> 35:19.040
"During an inspection of the area,
we confirmed a pack of low-level curses."

35:19.400 --> 35:23.530
"We'd like to request that the grade 2
sorcerer, Inumaki, exorcise them."

35:23.530 --> 35:26.050
Huh? Wait, where's sorcerer Inumaki?

35:26.810 --> 35:27.760
Not here?

35:27.760 --> 35:28.970
Thank you.

35:28.970 --> 35:31.310
Oh, Ijichi-san, over there.

35:33.710 --> 35:35.060
He was shopping?

35:35.690 --> 35:36.980
What did you buy?

35:39.930 --> 35:41.570
Throat medicine?

35:42.660 --> 35:45.220
In short, it would cause all
kinds of issues down the road

35:45.220 --> 35:47.880
if the building they're spending so
much money on developed a bad history,

35:47.880 --> 35:50.490
so they want us to exorcise it now.

35:50.490 --> 35:51.580
Salmon.

35:52.220 --> 35:54.540
Now, I'll draw the veil.

35:55.420 --> 35:56.420
Good luck.

36:08.010 --> 36:11.270
He said it was a pack of low-level curses.

36:11.270 --> 36:12.350
Pollack roe.

36:29.630 --> 36:31.770
That's not fair, Mama.

36:32.060 --> 36:34.250
Onii-chan got more.

36:34.870 --> 36:35.870
So what? Let's trade doubles.

36:35.870 --> 36:37.250
I smell olives.
So what? Let's trade doubles.

36:38.080 --> 36:39.960
I want to eat sushi!

36:39.960 --> 36:41.720
Reporting a lost child.

36:43.720 --> 36:46.260
Cheap stuff! Cheap stuff!

36:46.260 --> 36:48.260
It's not scary if you cross with everyone.

36:49.010 --> 36:51.850
The weaker curses are,
the more they group together.

36:52.350 --> 36:56.020
Even so, there's just too many of them!

37:02.360 --> 37:03.490
Inumaki-kun?!

37:05.240 --> 37:07.150
It's dangerous if you get that cloâ€”

37:07.150 --> 37:08.150
Explode.

37:15.410 --> 37:17.910
This is cursed speech?

37:19.290 --> 37:21.800
Huh? Oh... It's over already?

37:23.010 --> 37:24.380
Tuna mayo.

37:24.380 --> 37:26.300
His voice is really worn out!

37:26.590 --> 37:29.460
Oh, that explains the throat medicine.

37:31.680 --> 37:34.060
That's an incredible power,

37:34.060 --> 37:36.270
but it comes with a good deal of risk, too.

37:40.530 --> 37:42.110
Bonito flakes...

37:42.110 --> 37:43.030
What's wrong?

37:43.610 --> 37:45.230
Huh? You're right.

37:45.230 --> 37:46.700
The veil isn't lifting.

37:48.570 --> 37:49.730
Huh?

37:50.300 --> 37:52.000
We won't be able to get out.

38:00.170 --> 38:03.980
What is this curse? Its presence is
nothing like the ones from before...

38:04.590 --> 38:05.460
Zomba.

38:09.050 --> 38:10.130
Inumaki-kun!

38:11.430 --> 38:12.600
Twist!

38:24.860 --> 38:27.070
What, what, what?! What is that?!

38:33.410 --> 38:34.160
That curse...

38:34.160 --> 38:35.830
He said they'd be low-level!

38:35.830 --> 38:37.370
This isn't what we were told!

38:38.030 --> 38:39.700
There's that thing's size, too.

38:41.000 --> 38:46.050
It's way scarier than the big guys
from the elementary school.

38:47.090 --> 38:48.090
That's right!

38:48.090 --> 38:49.750
Inumaki-kun, you're hurt.

38:49.750 --> 38:51.220
Is your finger all right?

38:51.760 --> 38:53.720
Wow, that looks painful.

38:53.720 --> 38:54.970
Salmon.

38:55.720 --> 38:57.720
You shouldn't mess with it!

38:59.640 --> 39:00.730
Sorry.

39:01.560 --> 39:02.900
It's my fault.

39:11.660 --> 39:14.410
It doesn't seem to be pursuing
us or searching for us.

39:15.570 --> 39:17.280
I'll contact Ijichi-san.

39:18.280 --> 39:18.700
Enter Your Passcode
No Service

39:18.700 --> 39:20.300
Out of service?
Enter Your Passcode
No Service

39:20.300 --> 39:21.750
But why?

39:21.750 --> 39:23.040
Bonito flakes.

39:23.040 --> 39:23.630
Huh?

39:24.790 --> 39:26.420
Because of the veil?

39:28.630 --> 39:30.080
If the veil won't lift,

39:30.080 --> 39:32.430
then we have to exorcise it, right?

39:37.340 --> 39:38.380
Inumaki-kun?

39:39.210 --> 39:41.360
Should you be moving around already?

39:42.790 --> 39:44.140
Kelp.

39:48.300 --> 39:50.220
You're going to go alone?

40:15.370 --> 40:17.600
Thank you, Inumaki-kun.

40:21.020 --> 40:23.000
But I'm all right.

40:29.400 --> 40:31.030
Let's both do our best together!

40:40.650 --> 40:41.830
Oh?

40:44.370 --> 40:47.370
Get him, Yuta!

40:52.690 --> 40:54.510
It's mad?! Why?!

40:54.510 --> 40:56.340
It was already scary enough!

41:03.000 --> 41:04.480
Don't take your eyes off him.

41:04.480 --> 41:05.810
Don't stop moving.

41:07.120 --> 41:08.980
Imbue the curse into the katana.

41:26.460 --> 41:28.640
Inumaki-kun is kind.

41:29.250 --> 41:31.670
He doesn't want to
accidentally curse others,

41:31.670 --> 41:35.130
so he speaks in rice ball componentsâ€”
words that can't carry curses.

41:35.130 --> 41:36.760
Even today, he helped me out.

41:37.090 --> 41:39.300
He tried to keep me away from danger.

41:40.720 --> 41:42.060
Even back then,

41:42.430 --> 41:46.560
he was showing consideration
for my anxiety, wasn't he?

41:53.190 --> 41:53.940
Zora.

41:57.690 --> 41:58.610
That was shallow!

41:58.610 --> 42:00.110
And he's tough!

42:03.330 --> 42:07.540
I still can't compete with this curse, but...

42:11.380 --> 42:12.300
Inumaki-kun!

42:14.590 --> 42:20.130
I'll make sure to respond
to Inumaki-kun's kindness!

42:36.480 --> 42:38.150
Get crushed!

42:45.200 --> 42:46.830
Wow!

42:46.830 --> 42:47.950
Mustard leaf!

42:50.120 --> 42:52.250
Oh, I'm fine.

42:52.250 --> 42:53.540
It's only a scratch.

42:56.210 --> 42:57.160
Salmon.

42:59.880 --> 43:02.190
Yeah, good work!

43:05.540 --> 43:07.550
Once I break Rika-chan's curse,

43:07.930 --> 43:10.170
I'll be a normal person.

43:11.690 --> 43:14.190
I won't be able to stay
at Jujutsu High anymore,

43:14.700 --> 43:16.630
but until then,

43:17.150 --> 43:19.160
I want to be useful to everyone.

43:20.060 --> 43:22.950
Oh, what do we do about the veil?

43:24.660 --> 43:25.950
What a shame.

43:26.580 --> 43:29.450
I came here to see this rumored Rika-chan.

43:29.850 --> 43:33.670
As a fellow special-grade,
I was hoping to meet her soon.

43:35.960 --> 43:38.410
I needed to deliver
something he dropped, too.

43:48.390 --> 43:50.470
Toge's cursed speech

43:50.770 --> 43:53.310
is something he's been able
to use since he was born,

43:53.310 --> 43:55.850
so back in the day, he struggled quite a bit.

43:56.350 --> 43:59.850
Sometimes he cursed people
he never intended to curse.

43:59.850 --> 44:02.900
His situation was rather similar to yours.

44:03.570 --> 44:07.610
That's why he's been worried about you
since the day you transferred in.

44:08.950 --> 44:10.670
It's easy to misunderstand him,

44:10.670 --> 44:12.490
but he's a good guy.

44:13.330 --> 44:15.590
I hope you'll be kind to him.

44:16.160 --> 44:17.480
Yeah, I'llâ€”

44:17.480 --> 44:19.540
Come on, let's start morning training!

44:19.540 --> 44:21.220
Oh, right.

44:21.220 --> 44:23.010
Panda! What are you laughing about?!

44:23.010 --> 44:24.090
I'll kill you!

44:24.090 --> 44:25.630
Huh? It's nothing, though.

44:25.630 --> 44:26.260
Maki-san, hey...
Huh? It's nothing, though.

44:26.260 --> 44:27.340
Maki-san, hey...

44:28.590 --> 44:31.060
I'd like to imbue my curse

44:31.060 --> 44:34.100
into my katana more smoothly.
Do you know any tricks?

44:34.100 --> 44:34.940
Nope.

44:35.480 --> 44:37.560
Don't ask me about cursed energy.

44:44.990 --> 44:47.780
I scoured every inch
of the shopping district,

44:47.780 --> 44:50.870
and I found three different
types of residuals.

44:50.870 --> 44:55.370
Even Ijichi-san said we weren't likely
to find any more than that.

44:55.370 --> 44:57.660
Okay, got it. Thanks.

44:57.660 --> 44:58.660
You bet!

45:31.060 --> 45:32.200
My apologies.

45:33.180 --> 45:40.510
Our inspection showed that someone
lowered a second veil on top of my own.

45:40.510 --> 45:41.710
In addition,

45:41.710 --> 45:45.540
a semi-first-grade curse made
an unexpected appearance.

45:46.250 --> 45:48.900
It's my fault for not being more thorough.

45:49.440 --> 45:50.890
I'll accept any punishment.

45:50.890 --> 45:53.910
No, you're fine. You were just outclassed.

45:53.910 --> 45:55.470
Meaning?

45:56.310 --> 45:58.470
Do you have an idea who did it?

46:14.200 --> 46:15.990
Geto Suguru.

46:17.540 --> 46:19.990
One of the four special-grade jujutsu sorcerers,

46:20.590 --> 46:23.500
who was banished from Jujutsu High

46:24.090 --> 46:27.000
after cursing over a hundred
normal people to death.

46:27.250 --> 46:29.170
He's the worst curse user.

46:42.770 --> 46:45.320
Really, I'll be fine. Let's go home now.

46:45.320 --> 46:48.860
It's all right. Just wait a little longer.

46:48.860 --> 46:49.940
But...

47:05.790 --> 47:10.890
So, you said your daughter
was being haunted by a ghost.

47:11.470 --> 47:13.850
Isn't that right, Sato-san?

47:13.850 --> 47:17.930
Ah, yes... um... it's Saito, though...

47:17.930 --> 47:20.430
No, you are Sato-san.

47:20.430 --> 47:23.480
That's what I've decided,
so Sato is better.

47:24.310 --> 47:25.400
Uh-huh...

47:26.480 --> 47:28.520
Mom, let's go home.

47:28.520 --> 47:32.280
But you haven't been able
to sleep lately, right?

47:32.280 --> 47:33.990
This is so shady, though.

47:33.990 --> 47:36.860
You constantly feel
a piercing gaze upon you.

47:38.200 --> 47:41.950
Sometimes your shoulders feel heavy,
and it gets hard to breathe, doesn't it?

47:42.500 --> 47:45.390
Almost as if you've forgotten how to breathe.

47:46.290 --> 47:47.540
And you often

47:48.130 --> 47:50.420
dream of being raped.

47:51.190 --> 47:52.680
How did you know that?

47:54.970 --> 47:56.140
Don't move.

48:07.270 --> 48:10.530
Huh? No way... I feel much better!

48:13.530 --> 48:17.530
Honestly, I don't know how
we could ever repay you.

48:17.860 --> 48:21.540
Oh, no, we should all help
each other in times of need.

48:21.540 --> 48:23.540
Please rely on me anytime you need to.

48:25.290 --> 48:29.250
See, I told you he was simply godly!

48:29.250 --> 48:30.040
Yeah.

48:30.840 --> 48:32.430
Godly, huh?

48:32.950 --> 48:34.760
You're a smart one, aren't you?

48:36.720 --> 48:39.470
Filthy monkey who can't even use jujutsu.

48:39.470 --> 48:41.980
Your true feelings are showing, Geto-sama.

48:41.980 --> 48:45.350
The leaders have all gathered
in the meeting room.

48:46.890 --> 48:49.060
What are you doing?

48:49.060 --> 48:51.030
It's disinfecting deodorant.

48:51.030 --> 48:53.550
I don't want everyone to
catch the monkey smell.

48:55.030 --> 48:56.530
I'm so happy.

48:56.900 --> 48:59.910
How long has it been since we all gathered?

49:00.350 --> 49:03.660
I know. Let's take a photo together
since we're all here.

49:03.660 --> 49:04.660
Where'd I put my single-lens?

49:04.660 --> 49:05.660
Right here.

49:08.410 --> 49:11.340
Geto! Give me Geto!

49:12.800 --> 49:14.420
Geto! Damn you!

49:15.050 --> 49:17.130
Well, if it isn't Kanemori-san.

49:17.130 --> 49:19.420
What brings you here in such a panic?

49:19.420 --> 49:20.470
Don't play dumb!

49:20.470 --> 49:22.430
Hurry up and exorcise my curse!

49:22.770 --> 49:25.460
Do you know how much I've paid you?!

49:25.830 --> 49:26.810
How much?

49:26.810 --> 49:29.520
Roughly one hundred and five million yen.

49:29.520 --> 49:32.440
But there have been no donations
for the past six months.

49:32.440 --> 49:32.780
Wellâ€”

49:32.780 --> 49:34.690
Ah... I guess that's it for you.

49:34.690 --> 49:36.440
What are you sayiâ€”

49:39.900 --> 49:43.200
All monkeys have their own role.

49:44.010 --> 49:46.040
There are money-collecting monkeys

49:46.040 --> 49:48.230
and curse-collecting monkeys.

49:48.230 --> 49:49.840
You're the former.

49:50.200 --> 49:52.800
If you're out of money,
I have no further use for you.

49:56.380 --> 49:57.920
Screw you!

49:58.510 --> 50:01.430
Suck, suck... Suck, suck...

50:01.430 --> 50:08.560
Suck, suck, suck, suck...

50:13.070 --> 50:14.690
Disgusting.

50:14.690 --> 50:16.820
Are they really the same species?

50:17.330 --> 50:19.070
That's why I'm always saying

50:19.070 --> 50:20.720
they're monkeys.

50:22.080 --> 50:24.910
The time is right, my family.

50:24.910 --> 50:27.660
Let's lower the curtain
on the age of monkeys

50:27.660 --> 50:29.950
and build a paradise for jujutsu sorcerers.

50:30.630 --> 50:37.050
First, we must fell the
cornerstone of the jujutsu world,

50:37.050 --> 50:38.460
Jujutsu High.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.510
What's the matter, Yuta?

50:41.510 --> 50:44.880
Uh, well... I just had a bad premonition.

50:45.350 --> 50:46.430
You're imagining things.

50:46.430 --> 50:47.600
Yep, imagining things.

50:47.600 --> 50:48.560
Bonito flakes.

50:48.560 --> 50:49.510
Huh?

50:49.810 --> 50:51.440
Guys, wait...

50:51.900 --> 50:54.400
Well, your ability to sense
cursed energy sucks, you know.

50:54.400 --> 50:57.820
Figures it'd be dulled, with something
like Rika constantly with you.

50:57.820 --> 50:58.650
Tuna.

51:00.990 --> 51:04.030
We still aren't picking up on
any actions from Geto.

51:04.030 --> 51:06.700
Are you sure you're not worried over nothing?

51:06.700 --> 51:10.120
Principal, I'm sad to say that's not possible.

51:10.120 --> 51:12.500
I confirmed it myself on the scene.

51:12.880 --> 51:16.970
There's no way I would mistake
the residuals of Suguru's cursed energy.

51:18.970 --> 51:20.220
Suguru...

51:21.430 --> 51:22.720
God damn it!

51:23.020 --> 51:24.490
Speak of the devil!

51:24.720 --> 51:29.010
Gather all sorcerers on campus, semi-first-grade
and above, in the circle out front!

51:30.940 --> 51:32.730
That's unusual.

51:32.730 --> 51:34.770
Yuta's intuition was correct.

51:34.770 --> 51:35.820
Salmon.

51:44.950 --> 51:48.120
You're... not staff.

51:48.120 --> 51:49.820
I haven't seen that curse before.

51:49.820 --> 51:51.170
Salmon roe.

51:51.170 --> 51:53.330
Wow, big bird!

51:53.750 --> 51:56.290
This place never changes.

51:56.290 --> 52:00.890
Yuck! Geto-sama, is this really Tokyo?

52:00.890 --> 52:02.430
Feels like the sticks.

52:02.430 --> 52:04.300
Nanako, that's rude.

52:04.300 --> 52:07.140
What? But don't you think so, too, Mimiko?

52:07.140 --> 52:09.470
Come on! Get off already!

52:09.470 --> 52:10.900
Aren't you cold?

52:10.900 --> 52:12.090
Who are they?

52:12.090 --> 52:13.940
Whoa, it's a panda!

52:13.940 --> 52:15.730
How cute!

52:15.730 --> 52:17.310
And who are all of you?

52:17.310 --> 52:19.810
Intruders aren't allowed in, by Yuta-san here.

52:19.810 --> 52:20.660
Kelp!

52:20.660 --> 52:21.570
Huh?

52:21.570 --> 52:23.610
Go home before you get beaten!

52:23.610 --> 52:24.530
By Yuta-san!

52:24.530 --> 52:25.410
Huh?!

52:26.780 --> 52:28.700
Nice to meet you, Okkotsu-kun.

52:29.200 --> 52:31.040
I'm Geto Suguru.

52:31.040 --> 52:31.790
He's fast!

52:32.170 --> 52:35.670
Huh? Oh... Nice to meet you...

52:35.670 --> 52:38.920
You possess a truly wonderful power, I see.

52:39.710 --> 52:41.090
I believe that

52:41.090 --> 52:45.880
great power ought to be used toward great ends.

52:45.880 --> 52:48.210
Have you ever questioned
the current state of the world?

52:48.630 --> 52:51.060
This world where jujutsu
sorcerers act in secret

52:51.060 --> 52:53.400
in order to protect the order
of commonplace society.

52:54.080 --> 52:58.390
You see, there's this established paradox

52:58.390 --> 53:01.180
saying the strong must accommodate the weak.

53:02.340 --> 53:04.380
It's so deplorable!

53:04.760 --> 53:05.900
Uh-huh...

53:06.240 --> 53:10.830
The apex of all creation has
halted its own path of evolution!

53:10.830 --> 53:12.080
It's nonsense!

53:12.080 --> 53:15.910
It's high time mankind reconsidered
its strategy for survival!

53:16.500 --> 53:20.080
Which is why we'd like you to help us.

53:20.760 --> 53:22.380
Help with what?

53:22.720 --> 53:25.050
We're going to kill all non-sorcerers

53:25.050 --> 53:27.590
and create a world
with only jujutsu sorcerers.

53:28.800 --> 53:30.050
What...

53:30.050 --> 53:31.730
...is he saying?

53:33.770 --> 53:38.560
Could you stop preaching your
crazy beliefs to my students?

53:41.570 --> 53:44.070
Satoru! Long time no see!

53:44.070 --> 53:47.320
First of all, get away from those kids, Suguru.

53:49.610 --> 53:52.660
I had heard this year's first-years
were all outstanding students.

53:52.660 --> 53:53.830
Now I understand.

53:53.830 --> 53:55.830
It was all your doing.

53:56.170 --> 53:57.910
A special-grade cursed human,

53:57.910 --> 54:00.040
a cursed corpse mutation,

54:00.040 --> 54:01.800
the descendant of the cursed speech users,

54:01.800 --> 54:03.380
and...

54:03.710 --> 54:06.050
the Zen'in clan's failure.

54:06.610 --> 54:07.590
You piece of...

54:08.000 --> 54:09.590
Watch what you say.

54:09.970 --> 54:13.850
Because I don't need any
monkeys like you in my world.

54:17.610 --> 54:18.770
I'm sorry.

54:19.790 --> 54:22.500
I don't really understand
what you're talking about,

54:23.710 --> 54:24.560
but...

54:25.910 --> 54:29.530
I can't help anyone who insults my friends!

54:31.790 --> 54:35.410
My apologies. It wasn't
my intention to upset you.

54:35.410 --> 54:38.870
Then what exactly did you come for?

54:40.410 --> 54:42.170
To declare war.

54:43.400 --> 54:45.370
Everyone gathered here,

54:46.040 --> 54:49.210
open your ears and listen closely!

54:49.800 --> 54:53.760
On the coming December 24th,
when the sun sets,

54:53.760 --> 54:56.190
we shall conduct the Night
Parade of a Hundred Demons.

54:57.320 --> 54:59.310
It will take place in the crucible of curses,

54:59.720 --> 55:01.730
Shinjuku, Tokyo...

55:02.690 --> 55:04.980
and the holy land of jujutsu,

55:04.980 --> 55:06.070
Kyoto.

55:06.520 --> 55:09.200
We will unleash a thousand
curses upon each place.

55:09.200 --> 55:12.030
And of course, their command will be "massacre."

55:12.780 --> 55:15.160
If you wish to avoid a scene straight out of hell,

55:15.160 --> 55:17.160
come and stop it with all your might.

55:18.450 --> 55:20.240
Let us freely

55:20.240 --> 55:22.540
curse each other!

55:29.060 --> 55:30.420
Geto-sama!

55:30.420 --> 55:32.140
The store's gonna close!

55:32.140 --> 55:33.890
It's already that late?

55:34.240 --> 55:35.870
I'm sorry, Satoru.

55:36.380 --> 55:40.220
These girls just insist on getting
crÃªpes from Takeshita Street.

55:40.220 --> 55:42.190
Hurry!

55:42.190 --> 55:43.900
So I'll be taking my leave.

55:44.540 --> 55:47.770
Good grief. I don't see what's so good
about a place with so many monkeys.

55:47.770 --> 55:49.980
Did you think we'd just let you leave?

55:51.640 --> 55:52.990
You don't want to do that.

56:00.920 --> 56:03.500
Your precious students are within my range.

56:06.040 --> 56:08.580
Well, everyone, see you on the battlefield.

56:22.400 --> 56:23.810
Survival of the weakest.

56:24.830 --> 56:27.260
That's the proper form society should take.

56:28.190 --> 56:31.160
It should help the weak
and discourage the strong.

56:31.160 --> 56:32.910
Listen, Satoru.

56:32.910 --> 56:35.910
Sorcerers exist to protect non-sorcerers.

56:35.910 --> 56:38.160
That's your argument?

56:38.160 --> 56:40.670
I hate righteousness.

56:43.540 --> 56:47.250
Are you the strongest
because you're Gojo Satoru?

56:47.250 --> 56:50.210
Or are you Gojo Satoru
because you're the strongest?

56:50.210 --> 56:52.010
What are you trying to say?

56:52.420 --> 56:54.680
If I could become you,

56:54.680 --> 56:58.360
then wouldn't my foolish ideals
become reasonable possibilities?

57:02.020 --> 57:03.850
I've decided how to live my life.

57:03.850 --> 57:07.490
All that's left is to do what I can
to the best of my ability.

57:46.730 --> 57:48.100
Geto Suguru.

57:48.680 --> 57:52.070
A special-grade curse user who
uses cursed spirit manipulation.

57:52.070 --> 57:57.110
He's able to draw in and manipulate
naturally occurring, unbound curses.

57:58.010 --> 58:03.580
It seems he's established a religious group
to collect curses from its followers.

58:04.350 --> 58:07.410
He should still have the curses
he previously possessed,

58:07.410 --> 58:12.570
and considering the declining trend in the
number of curses reported in recent years...

58:13.590 --> 58:17.090
His claim to possess
2,000 may not be a bluff.

58:17.090 --> 58:21.560
Even so, statistically, most of them
have to be weaklings at grade 2 or below.

58:21.560 --> 58:25.770
Even with a generous estimate,
there can't be much more than 50 curse users.

58:25.770 --> 58:29.100
That's actually the scary part.

58:29.100 --> 58:32.360
I find it hard to believe he'd
start a war he couldn't win.

58:32.540 --> 58:34.280
God damn!

58:34.280 --> 58:39.900
Put out a call for aid to all alumni,
the three major clans, and even the Ainu Jujutsu Society.

58:39.900 --> 58:41.410
It's all-out war!

58:42.080 --> 58:45.910
This time, that curse, Geto, will be completely

58:45.910 --> 58:47.410
exorcised!

58:47.410 --> 58:51.170
That's what that muscle-brained principal
is probably spouting right now.

59:01.630 --> 59:04.390
If we seriously tried to kill each other,

59:04.390 --> 59:07.810
our chance of success would be about 30%.

59:12.900 --> 59:15.020
If the Jujutsu Society joins in as well,

59:15.020 --> 59:17.320
we'll barely have a 20% chance.

59:18.180 --> 59:19.180
However,

59:19.180 --> 59:23.540
there's just one move that makes
that slim chance of victory

59:24.330 --> 59:26.410
jump straight to 99%.

59:27.120 --> 59:33.420
I kill Okkotsu Yuta and obtain the special-grade
cursed apparition, Orimoto Rika.

59:34.380 --> 59:39.420
They still naÃ¯vely believe
my bluff from my time in school.

59:39.710 --> 59:42.510
It doesn't matter if
the cursed spirit is bound.

59:42.510 --> 59:44.640
So long as I kill its master,

59:44.640 --> 59:47.430
I can absorb any curse I want.

59:48.930 --> 59:51.190
With such high odds of victory,

59:51.190 --> 59:54.270
the school won't use Okkotsu
as one of their cards.

59:54.270 --> 59:58.190
After all, there's a chance he could
wipe out both enemies and allies.

59:58.860 --> 1:00:01.070
The true purpose of the
Night Parade of a Hundred Demons

1:00:01.070 --> 1:00:03.740
is to get Okkotsu isolated and unprotected.

1:00:05.780 --> 1:00:09.700
Now, let's raise the curtain on a new age.

1:00:12.670 --> 1:00:14.250
It sounds like...

1:00:15.930 --> 1:00:18.420
something crazy is going down.

1:00:20.640 --> 1:00:22.050
Maki-san!

1:00:22.050 --> 1:00:23.510
What are you doing here?

1:00:23.510 --> 1:00:25.090
Classes are canceled for the week.

1:00:25.090 --> 1:00:27.660
Well, I just felt kinda restless.

1:00:28.700 --> 1:00:31.270
No one in the dorms is around, either.

1:00:31.270 --> 1:00:34.940
That's because the second-years
were dispatched to Kyoto earlier.

1:00:34.940 --> 1:00:38.270
Toge and the third- and fourth-years
are in Shinjuku as backup.

1:00:38.270 --> 1:00:40.860
The principal really likes Panda, too,

1:00:40.860 --> 1:00:42.660
so he's probably with Toge.

1:00:42.660 --> 1:00:43.740
I see.

1:00:48.990 --> 1:00:49.860
Ask.

1:00:49.860 --> 1:00:50.790
Huh?

1:00:50.790 --> 1:00:52.330
You've been curious, right?

1:00:52.330 --> 1:00:54.500
About why I'm a "failure."

1:00:55.210 --> 1:00:59.000
Well, um... yes.

1:01:02.550 --> 1:01:04.760
My family, the Zen'in clan,

1:01:04.760 --> 1:01:08.190
is one of the elite families of jujutsu
sorcerers known as the three major clans.

1:01:08.660 --> 1:01:12.980
Do you know what the minimum requirement
to be a jujutsu sorcerer is?

1:01:12.980 --> 1:01:14.890
Huh? What is it?

1:01:17.330 --> 1:01:19.140
It's being able to see curses.

1:01:19.140 --> 1:01:20.390
Oh, right.

1:01:21.080 --> 1:01:25.600
Ordinary people can sometimes see them
in special circumstances, like at death's door,

1:01:26.440 --> 1:01:29.900
but I can't see curses
without these lame glasses.

1:01:30.280 --> 1:01:33.620
The cursed tools I use are already
imbued with cursed energy.

1:01:33.620 --> 1:01:35.710
It doesn't come from me.

1:01:37.540 --> 1:01:39.870
Though, thanks to that,
I got out of that family.

1:01:40.410 --> 1:01:43.040
The food was awful, the rooms were small,

1:01:43.040 --> 1:01:45.390
and it was crawling with old men I didn't know.

1:01:45.390 --> 1:01:47.510
It seriously sucked!

1:01:49.590 --> 1:01:51.100
Don't use my last name.

1:01:51.470 --> 1:01:55.810
Not everyone has a resistance
to curses like you do!

1:01:56.090 --> 1:01:58.140
Don't ask me about cursed energy.

1:02:02.030 --> 1:02:05.190
Why are you still a jujutsu sorcerer, then?

1:02:05.190 --> 1:02:07.570
Because I'm spiteful.

1:02:08.480 --> 1:02:12.170
I'm going to make that family cry
when I return to them

1:02:12.650 --> 1:02:15.410
as a grade 1 sorcerer who can't see curses!

1:02:15.870 --> 1:02:19.290
Then I'll crush the Zen'in clan from within!

1:02:23.320 --> 1:02:24.590
What?

1:02:24.590 --> 1:02:28.050
Oh, I was just thinking that's so like you.

1:02:29.020 --> 1:02:30.040
I wish...

1:02:31.520 --> 1:02:33.310
I could be like you.

1:02:33.920 --> 1:02:36.160
I wish I could be so strong and unyielding.

1:02:44.330 --> 1:02:47.650
I wish I had never given birth to you.

1:02:48.090 --> 1:02:50.580
You're the shame of the Zen'in clan!

1:02:51.320 --> 1:02:52.370
Everyone,

1:02:53.490 --> 1:02:57.330
you don't want to turn out like Maki.

1:03:04.250 --> 1:03:07.250
If there's ever anything
I can help with, just ask.

1:03:07.250 --> 1:03:10.760
Let's crush the Zen'in clan! Or something.

1:03:14.110 --> 1:03:17.360
Moron. There's no point
if I don't do it by myself.

1:03:18.630 --> 1:03:19.900
I'm going back to my room.

1:03:19.900 --> 1:03:21.400
Okay. Later.

1:03:26.530 --> 1:03:28.020
Am I an idiot?

1:03:29.300 --> 1:03:31.780
Don't start thinking this
means you've been accepted!

1:03:33.660 --> 1:03:36.140
Emerge from darkness, blacker than darkness.

1:03:36.580 --> 1:03:39.240
Purify that which is impure.

1:03:46.670 --> 1:03:49.130
A veil was drawn over the school?

1:03:49.130 --> 1:03:50.760
But who... and why?

1:03:57.360 --> 1:04:00.650
Keep the destruction of buildings
and infrastructure to a minimum.

1:04:01.020 --> 1:04:03.730
There's a chance some civilians
still haven't evacuated.

1:04:03.730 --> 1:04:05.830
If you find any, evacuate them.

1:04:06.250 --> 1:04:08.020
Are you listening, Satoru?

1:04:08.480 --> 1:04:12.160
There's one guy who looks like trouble.

1:04:13.230 --> 1:04:16.280
I see. That bandaged guy.

1:04:16.280 --> 1:04:19.700
Yes. We'll take on the rest.

1:04:19.700 --> 1:04:21.250
I've said this many times, but...

1:04:21.250 --> 1:04:22.540
I know.

1:04:22.540 --> 1:04:24.790
We're only stalling them, right?

1:04:24.790 --> 1:04:28.900
Let's just take it easy and have
some fun until Geto finishes his job.

1:04:29.880 --> 1:04:31.680
You're here?

1:04:31.680 --> 1:04:33.390
Is it a problem if I am?

1:04:33.650 --> 1:04:36.390
What the hell are <i>you</i> doing here?

1:04:38.090 --> 1:04:41.730
Sorry, but I don't have time
to chat with monkeys.

1:04:42.190 --> 1:04:43.350
Gojo-san!

1:04:43.650 --> 1:04:44.770
I have a report!

1:04:46.350 --> 1:04:47.980
What's the matter?

1:04:47.980 --> 1:04:48.810
Well...

1:04:49.560 --> 1:04:53.070
That guy loves to show off,
and he's not on the front lines?

1:04:53.070 --> 1:04:54.820
Is he in Kyoto?

1:04:54.820 --> 1:04:57.310
We should have received
some kind of word if he was.

1:04:58.800 --> 1:05:00.740
It's nothing. What's up?

1:05:01.290 --> 1:05:05.080
I know this isn't the best time,
but I thought it wise to speak up sooner.

1:05:05.080 --> 1:05:08.520
It's about the investigation into Okkotsu-kun
that you previously requested.

1:05:12.720 --> 1:05:14.180
Panda! Toge!

1:05:14.970 --> 1:05:16.180
What isâ€”

1:05:16.180 --> 1:05:18.130
No questions!

1:05:18.130 --> 1:05:20.470
I'm sending you two to
Jujutsu High right now!

1:05:20.470 --> 1:05:21.480
Huh?!

1:05:22.340 --> 1:05:25.020
Geto is there now.

1:05:25.020 --> 1:05:27.230
I'm absolutely, probably, certain!

1:05:27.230 --> 1:05:28.270
Which is it?!

1:05:28.730 --> 1:05:30.190
If my intuition is right,

1:05:30.190 --> 1:05:32.380
in the worst case,
Yuta and Maki could both die!

1:05:33.450 --> 1:05:36.320
I'll head there right after
I take care of that foreigner.

1:05:36.320 --> 1:05:37.700
Protect those two.

1:05:38.200 --> 1:05:39.660
Sorry, but defend them with your lives!

1:05:41.540 --> 1:05:42.870
Salmon!
Right!

1:05:46.540 --> 1:05:48.620
No way... They figured it out?

1:05:48.620 --> 1:05:52.300
This is why I said you should
at least prepare a stand-in.

1:05:52.300 --> 1:05:54.550
A bad dummy would only make things worse.

1:05:54.550 --> 1:05:56.590
That's what Geto-sama said.

1:05:56.590 --> 1:05:58.050
Mimiko, Nanako!

1:05:58.340 --> 1:05:59.800
What?

1:05:59.800 --> 1:06:02.230
We're stepping up the plan. Engage.

1:06:06.020 --> 1:06:07.730
I've been waiting for this!

1:06:09.980 --> 1:06:13.740
I'm your opponent,

1:06:13.740 --> 1:06:15.150
special-grade.

1:06:15.610 --> 1:06:17.070
Sorry,

1:06:17.940 --> 1:06:19.860
but I'm in a hurry right now.

1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:25.450
A veil's been drawn!

1:06:25.450 --> 1:06:27.410
Does that mean Satoru's intuition was right?

1:06:27.410 --> 1:06:28.830
I'll break the veil!

1:06:28.830 --> 1:06:31.630
Then we'll take the shortest route!

1:06:31.960 --> 1:06:32.990
Pollack roe!

1:06:32.990 --> 1:06:34.540
Oh?

1:06:35.920 --> 1:06:38.880
Someone made a hole in the veil.

1:06:39.650 --> 1:06:43.180
Nothing ever goes quite as planned.

1:06:43.640 --> 1:06:46.680
Should take them five minutes
from the point of entry to here.

1:06:47.140 --> 1:06:50.780
Should I ignore them,
or should I take care of them?

1:06:52.690 --> 1:06:54.610
It's so hard to decide.

1:06:59.690 --> 1:07:03.200
They broke through all the walls
to take the shortest route?

1:07:03.990 --> 1:07:05.200
Not bad.

1:07:08.870 --> 1:07:09.700
Maki!

1:07:11.210 --> 1:07:12.300
Focus.

1:07:14.500 --> 1:07:17.130
This guy can handle close combat, too?

1:07:29.810 --> 1:07:30.650
Oh?

1:07:43.030 --> 1:07:44.780
Predictable.

1:07:45.490 --> 1:07:47.030
Because it was a feint.

1:07:48.120 --> 1:07:51.170
Drumming Beat!

1:08:10.610 --> 1:08:11.860
That was close.

1:08:12.530 --> 1:08:14.360
Same to you.

1:08:16.610 --> 1:08:18.400
Plummet!

1:08:25.530 --> 1:08:27.660
Toge! You okay?

1:08:28.160 --> 1:08:29.370
Caviar.

1:08:29.370 --> 1:08:32.170
Yeah, Maki comes first.

1:08:34.630 --> 1:08:36.710
Maki, are you okay?

1:08:36.710 --> 1:08:37.710
Maki?

1:08:37.710 --> 1:08:38.880
Mustard leaf.

1:08:39.960 --> 1:08:42.590
N-Not yet...

1:08:42.590 --> 1:08:43.340
Huh?

1:08:54.110 --> 1:08:55.270
Another quake?

1:08:55.810 --> 1:08:57.770
I wonder what's going on.

1:08:59.950 --> 1:09:00.910
Wonderful.

1:09:01.800 --> 1:09:02.990
Wonderful!

1:09:03.660 --> 1:09:06.530
I am incredibly touched right now!

1:09:07.070 --> 1:09:09.360
You all raced here to save Okkotsu, right?

1:09:09.740 --> 1:09:13.210
Jujutsu sorcerers are sacrificing
themselves for a fellow sorcerer!

1:09:13.570 --> 1:09:15.710
Affection! Admiration!

1:09:16.040 --> 1:09:17.960
The world I long for

1:09:18.270 --> 1:09:20.370
is here before my eyes!

1:09:27.720 --> 1:09:29.090
Maki-san?

1:09:29.970 --> 1:09:31.730
To be honest,

1:09:31.730 --> 1:09:34.810
I wanted you to live, too, Okkotsu.

1:09:35.350 --> 1:09:38.380
But this is all for the
future of the jujutsu world.

1:09:39.150 --> 1:09:40.820
Panda-kun...

1:09:41.200 --> 1:09:42.990
Yuta...

1:09:45.080 --> 1:09:46.990
Inumaki-kun...

1:09:47.400 --> 1:09:51.040
Run... away...

1:09:56.790 --> 1:09:58.750
Come out, Rika!

1:10:03.840 --> 1:10:05.670
I will kill you.

1:10:05.670 --> 1:10:07.970
I'll murder you!

1:10:21.690 --> 1:10:23.690
Quantity before quality.

1:10:24.120 --> 1:10:26.690
What's your move, Queen of Curses?

1:10:43.550 --> 1:10:44.420
Rika.

1:10:48.790 --> 1:10:51.850
These three are horribly wounded,
especially Maki-san.

1:10:53.810 --> 1:10:55.100
I won't let you die!

1:11:03.360 --> 1:11:05.360
Not fair, not fair!

1:11:05.620 --> 1:11:08.880
It's always you, always you!

1:11:08.880 --> 1:11:10.230
What are you doing, Rika?

1:11:10.230 --> 1:11:10.870
Huh?

1:11:11.310 --> 1:11:13.370
That woman saved me.

1:11:13.640 --> 1:11:17.150
Handle her with more care
than a butterfly or a flower!

1:11:20.230 --> 1:11:22.500
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

1:11:23.270 --> 1:11:24.840
Don't be mad.

1:11:24.840 --> 1:11:26.000
I'm not mad.

1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:28.210
Don't hate me.

1:11:28.210 --> 1:11:30.000
I don't hate you.

1:11:31.760 --> 1:11:34.010
Our enemy is that man there.

1:11:34.010 --> 1:11:36.760
Yuta, do you hate him?

1:11:36.760 --> 1:11:38.510
Yeah, I loathe him.

1:11:39.510 --> 1:11:42.480
Then I hate him, too!

1:11:42.480 --> 1:11:43.520
Welcome back.

1:11:45.440 --> 1:11:47.570
Why did you stop attacking?

1:11:47.570 --> 1:11:51.790
Healing with cursed energy requires
an advanced reverse cursed technique.

1:11:52.550 --> 1:11:57.490
It was more advantageous to let you
divide your attention over there.

1:11:58.740 --> 1:12:01.170
Now, shall we start where we left off?

1:12:02.460 --> 1:12:04.380
Rika, we're doing that.

1:12:07.670 --> 1:12:09.420
Snake Eyes and Fangs?

1:12:09.420 --> 1:12:10.340
Those are...

1:12:10.720 --> 1:12:12.850
The cursed seals of the Inumaki clan!

1:12:22.440 --> 1:12:23.400
Die.

1:12:31.300 --> 1:12:32.530
Wonderful!

1:12:33.290 --> 1:12:36.240
Cursed speech is a powerful technique
passed down in the Inumaki clan,

1:12:36.520 --> 1:12:41.130
yet this young man pulled it off with
less than a year of studying jujutsu!

1:12:41.130 --> 1:12:43.380
That really is hard to use.

1:12:43.380 --> 1:12:46.380
The cursed energy scatters,
and it's hard to aim.

1:12:46.380 --> 1:12:48.630
Inumaki-kun is incredible.

1:12:49.210 --> 1:12:53.220
So Orimoto Rika's true form
is ever-changing.

1:12:53.220 --> 1:12:55.640
She's an endless bundle of cursed energy.

1:12:55.640 --> 1:12:56.590
Yes.

1:12:57.050 --> 1:12:58.970
My friends are amazing.

1:12:59.340 --> 1:13:03.020
And you! You!

1:13:03.020 --> 1:13:05.270
I want her even more.

1:13:06.940 --> 1:13:09.020
I'll beat you to a pulp!

1:13:39.340 --> 1:13:42.350
Why is Nanami-san in Kyoto?

1:13:42.350 --> 1:13:43.980
I wanted him to see me shine!

1:13:43.980 --> 1:13:45.060
Shut up!

1:13:45.640 --> 1:13:47.890
Quit griping and fight!

1:13:48.270 --> 1:13:49.690
There are still more coming!

1:13:52.150 --> 1:13:54.320
Man, what a pain.

1:14:15.340 --> 1:14:17.090
That makes fifty.

1:14:17.090 --> 1:14:19.630
I've cleared the numbers
required for the incentive,

1:14:19.630 --> 1:14:24.350
so now to work a little bit more
and aim for that full bonus.

1:14:28.780 --> 1:14:30.570
How old are you two?

1:14:31.100 --> 1:14:32.650
Fifteen.

1:14:32.650 --> 1:14:34.490
You're still just children.

1:14:34.990 --> 1:14:36.840
It's not too late for you to turn back.

1:14:37.570 --> 1:14:40.320
You don't know right from wrong, do you?

1:14:40.930 --> 1:14:42.330
Annoying!

1:14:42.330 --> 1:14:44.790
Mimiko, doesn't he totally piss you off?

1:14:44.790 --> 1:14:46.830
Shall we hang him, Nanako?

1:14:47.220 --> 1:14:49.830
None of you know, do you?

1:14:50.360 --> 1:14:56.840
Just how jujutsu sorcerers are treated out
in the damn sticks that aren't even on maps.

1:14:57.550 --> 1:14:59.010
Right or wrong?

1:14:59.010 --> 1:15:02.140
You all can enjoy that by yourselves.

1:15:03.640 --> 1:15:05.850
The way Geto-sama puts it,

1:15:05.850 --> 1:15:09.350
black is white, and white is black, too.

1:15:12.430 --> 1:15:17.190
We both believe in the world he's envisioned.

1:15:18.650 --> 1:15:20.440
Anyone who gets in his way...

1:15:20.440 --> 1:15:21.790
...we'll hang!

1:15:22.620 --> 1:15:23.450
Huh?!

1:15:26.370 --> 1:15:27.370
Miguel?

1:15:27.370 --> 1:15:28.830
What are you doing?!

1:15:28.830 --> 1:15:30.710
Look, and figure it out!

1:15:30.710 --> 1:15:32.340
You're tenacious.

1:15:36.800 --> 1:15:38.170
That rope...

1:15:38.170 --> 1:15:40.510
It has an unusual curse woven into it.

1:15:41.100 --> 1:15:43.540
It's disrupting my techniques.

1:15:43.810 --> 1:15:46.560
I barely have half left.

1:15:46.560 --> 1:15:48.580
How many decades do you think it took

1:15:48.580 --> 1:15:53.270
the sorcerers in my country
to weave this one rope?!

1:15:53.270 --> 1:15:54.650
Like I care.

1:15:54.650 --> 1:15:56.770
One second of my time will outmatch it.

1:15:56.770 --> 1:15:58.400
Dummy!
That's all there is to it.

1:15:59.270 --> 1:16:00.480
You're in my way.

1:16:07.030 --> 1:16:09.310
Not good! Gojo-san's snapped!

1:16:09.310 --> 1:16:13.340
So this is the Limitless
technique Geto mentioned.

1:16:13.340 --> 1:16:15.590
It interferes on the atomic level,

1:16:15.590 --> 1:16:20.340
controlling space-time with precise
manipulation of cursed energy.

1:16:20.800 --> 1:16:24.300
And what makes that all possible
is the power of those eyes.

1:16:24.760 --> 1:16:27.100
Just over twelve more
minutes until my quota.

1:16:27.100 --> 1:16:29.300
I'll keep running for my life!

1:17:03.930 --> 1:17:04.890
Wow!

1:17:13.600 --> 1:17:14.270
Ouch!

1:17:37.290 --> 1:17:39.290
That last round was dangerous.

1:17:39.290 --> 1:17:41.300
I'll focus on hit-and-run.

1:17:41.300 --> 1:17:44.510
I'll give everything I've got
to endure these last ten minutes.

1:17:44.510 --> 1:17:47.300
If I die, I'm cursing you, Geto!

1:17:51.940 --> 1:17:53.940
Ieri-san, please look at this one, too.

1:17:53.940 --> 1:17:56.100
I will. Set him down over there.

1:17:56.100 --> 1:17:56.890
Right!

1:17:56.890 --> 1:17:59.140
What were you all doing?

1:17:59.140 --> 1:18:00.530
It's all right.

1:18:00.530 --> 1:18:02.800
Ieri-san will fix you up.

1:18:04.960 --> 1:18:06.450
We're counting on you!

1:18:07.620 --> 1:18:08.900
Sheesh.

1:18:09.240 --> 1:18:13.410
You really forced a heap
of trouble on us, Geto.

1:18:15.460 --> 1:18:17.890
It's your first time experiencing
such violent emotion,

1:18:17.890 --> 1:18:20.340
and cursed energy is
filling your body, isn't it?

1:18:20.970 --> 1:18:24.310
That heightening of physical prowess,
that sense of omnipotence...

1:18:24.310 --> 1:18:26.670
Your senses must be sharpened, too.

1:18:26.920 --> 1:18:30.260
The riff-raff are no match for you now.

1:18:30.260 --> 1:18:32.140
I'll have to crush you myself.

1:18:33.930 --> 1:18:35.890
Follow my lead, Rika.

1:18:36.270 --> 1:18:39.390
Mankind stands at the top of the food chain,

1:18:39.810 --> 1:18:43.900
yet they imagined the existence
of higher beings and called them gods.

1:18:44.190 --> 1:18:46.400
Don't you find that strange?

1:18:46.400 --> 1:18:50.790
Especially when we jujutsu
sorcerers exist without belief.

1:19:42.680 --> 1:19:44.410
In the end, those monkeys

1:19:44.410 --> 1:19:48.300
just want to avert their eyes from the
existence of those better than them.

1:19:48.710 --> 1:19:52.680
Don't go saying childish crap
like you want to be a god!

1:19:52.970 --> 1:19:54.760
You're missing the point,

1:19:54.760 --> 1:19:56.220
Okkotsu.

1:20:11.860 --> 1:20:15.920
What I long for isn't enlightenment.
It's a chosen people.

1:20:16.390 --> 1:20:21.960
There are times when the strong are buried and
oppressed by the weak due to sheer numbers.

1:20:21.960 --> 1:20:26.500
And I'm telling you that the audacity
of the monkeys who do that

1:20:26.500 --> 1:20:28.630
makes me so sick I could vomit.

1:20:29.790 --> 1:20:31.600
Yuta, Yuta...

1:20:32.010 --> 1:20:34.600
It's all right. I'm used to it now.

1:20:34.600 --> 1:20:36.720
Are we done debating?

1:20:49.020 --> 1:20:50.270
He's even faster!

1:20:59.380 --> 1:21:00.880
You shouldn't have done that.

1:21:00.880 --> 1:21:04.630
When you imbue a curse like that
too abruptly, the vessel won't last.

1:21:04.630 --> 1:21:07.040
Didn't Satoru teach you that?

1:21:07.040 --> 1:21:08.710
You imbue curses bit byâ€”

1:21:20.850 --> 1:21:22.440
You're not bad.

1:21:23.270 --> 1:21:24.560
I don't understand!

1:21:25.310 --> 1:21:28.060
I don't know about any
sorcerers outside of this school,

1:21:28.440 --> 1:21:30.570
so I don't know

1:21:30.860 --> 1:21:32.320
if you're right or not!

1:21:33.070 --> 1:21:37.030
But in order to remain with all my friends...

1:21:37.950 --> 1:21:41.830
In order for me to believe
it's okay that I'm alive...

1:21:43.250 --> 1:21:46.540
I have to kill you!

1:21:47.070 --> 1:21:49.170
You're egotistical.

1:21:49.170 --> 1:21:51.880
Still, self-affirmation, huh?

1:21:51.880 --> 1:21:56.550
There's probably nothing more
important than that in life.

1:21:57.210 --> 1:22:00.720
In which case, I'll also use
my full force to kill you.

1:22:01.150 --> 1:22:03.430
I won't compromise on quality
or quantity anymore.

1:22:04.060 --> 1:22:05.600
Did you know

1:22:05.600 --> 1:22:08.270
there are only four people
crowned special-grade?

1:22:08.600 --> 1:22:10.950
Among curses, there are sixteen.

1:22:11.490 --> 1:22:13.780
This is one of them.

1:22:14.070 --> 1:22:16.400
Special-grade potential apparition,

1:22:17.150 --> 1:22:19.780
Tamamo-no-mae incarnate!

1:22:20.200 --> 1:22:21.080
On top of that,

1:22:21.080 --> 1:22:26.290
I'll combine the 4,461
curses I possess into one,

1:22:26.580 --> 1:22:28.290
and strike you with it.

1:22:30.670 --> 1:22:33.630
Cursed Spirit Manipulation, Supreme Art:

1:22:38.840 --> 1:22:40.520
Maelstrom.

1:23:10.710 --> 1:23:11.960
Nanami-san.

1:23:13.960 --> 1:23:15.590
I'll take care of it.

1:24:07.560 --> 1:24:09.860
New Shadow Style, Simple Domain!

1:24:09.860 --> 1:24:10.820
Quick Draw!

1:24:19.330 --> 1:24:21.330
Don't let your guard down, Miwa!

1:24:22.450 --> 1:24:23.660
Mechamaru, above!

1:24:28.410 --> 1:24:29.910
You, too.

1:24:30.780 --> 1:24:32.940
Everyone, stay alert.

1:24:34.290 --> 1:24:35.420
Kamo-kun.

1:24:35.670 --> 1:24:38.000
Seven cursed spirits at two o'clock.

1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:40.380
Roger that. Where did Todo go?

1:24:41.800 --> 1:24:44.390
Oh, I think you'll see him soon.

1:24:52.360 --> 1:24:54.690
Where have you been all this time, Todoâ€”

1:24:57.690 --> 1:25:00.190
Wh-What is that cursed energy?

1:25:02.240 --> 1:25:03.910
That one's dangerous, Todo!

1:25:03.910 --> 1:25:05.120
Don't rush in on your own!

1:25:05.120 --> 1:25:06.160
Starting at eight, the talk show's
Wait for backâ€”

1:25:06.160 --> 1:25:07.490
Starting at eight, the talk show's

1:25:07.490 --> 1:25:09.950
Christmas live special will be

1:25:09.950 --> 1:25:12.170
hosting Takada-chan!

1:25:13.460 --> 1:25:16.830
I can't keep wasting any time here!

1:25:16.830 --> 1:25:17.630
Todo!

1:25:17.630 --> 1:25:18.920
Kamo-kun.

1:25:19.170 --> 1:25:22.930
Another ten or more cursed spirits
are approaching from six o'clock.

1:25:23.930 --> 1:25:25.800
Everyone, prepare to intercept them!

1:25:27.140 --> 1:25:29.340
Jeez, there's no end to them.

1:25:29.340 --> 1:25:31.150
When is this going to be over?

1:25:34.770 --> 1:25:36.060
Okkotsu.

1:25:36.470 --> 1:25:43.780
I'm truly glad I came to kill you
before you could fully wield Orimoto Rika.

1:25:51.170 --> 1:25:52.500
It's a promise.

1:25:52.920 --> 1:25:56.460
When we both grow up, we'll get married.

1:25:56.830 --> 1:25:57.670
Sure.

1:25:58.580 --> 1:26:04.010
Then we'll be together forever and ever!

1:26:11.060 --> 1:26:12.060
Rika.

1:26:12.060 --> 1:26:13.440
Yes?

1:26:13.770 --> 1:26:15.890
Thank you for always protecting me.

1:26:16.620 --> 1:26:18.940
Thank you for falling in love with me.

1:26:19.850 --> 1:26:23.240
Could you lend me your power one last time?

1:26:25.200 --> 1:26:26.900
I want to stop him.

1:26:27.610 --> 1:26:30.580
I don't need anything else after that.

1:26:31.500 --> 1:26:36.910
I'll give you my future,
my heart, my body, everything.

1:26:38.120 --> 1:26:41.590
From now on, we'll truly be together forever.

1:26:44.470 --> 1:26:47.220
I love you, Rika.

1:26:48.720 --> 1:26:50.160
Shall we die together?

1:26:58.730 --> 1:27:01.740
Yuta! Yuta!

1:27:01.740 --> 1:27:05.240
I love, love, love you!

1:27:05.760 --> 1:27:09.600
He's offering himself as a sacrifice to
release the limit on her cursed energy?!

1:27:11.250 --> 1:27:14.250
So that's how you want it, womanizer?!

1:27:14.700 --> 1:27:16.330
That's rude.

1:27:17.480 --> 1:27:18.710
It's pure love.

1:27:19.790 --> 1:27:22.510
Then I fight for justice!

1:28:09.340 --> 1:28:10.720
Wonderful!

1:28:12.100 --> 1:28:15.010
Absolutely wonderful!

1:28:15.010 --> 1:28:18.100
Truly the power to change the world!

1:28:18.640 --> 1:28:23.610
If I had Rika, there would be no need
to sneak around gathering curses.

1:28:24.240 --> 1:28:25.430
Next time.

1:28:26.290 --> 1:28:28.390
Next time, I'll obtain her!

1:28:34.290 --> 1:28:35.970
You're late,

1:28:36.890 --> 1:28:37.960
Satoru.

1:28:39.530 --> 1:28:41.460
To think you'd be the one here at my end.

1:28:42.340 --> 1:28:44.630
Is my family safe?

1:28:44.900 --> 1:28:47.540
Every last one of them managed to escape.

1:28:48.090 --> 1:28:50.640
The ones in Kyoto were
under your orders, too, right?

1:28:51.430 --> 1:28:52.760
Yeah.

1:28:53.430 --> 1:28:56.640
Unlike you, I'm a kind man.

1:28:57.140 --> 1:29:01.400
You sent those two assuming
that I'd defeat them, didn't you?

1:29:01.400 --> 1:29:03.650
To set Okkotsu off.

1:29:03.650 --> 1:29:05.940
I trusted you.

1:29:05.940 --> 1:29:11.450
Trusted that a man as principled as you wouldn't
kill off young sorcerers without a reason.

1:29:12.280 --> 1:29:14.240
Trust, huh?

1:29:18.430 --> 1:29:23.540
I didn't think I still had any of that left.

1:29:26.080 --> 1:29:28.250
Return this for me, will you?

1:29:30.430 --> 1:29:33.300
Was the elementary school your doing, too?

1:29:33.640 --> 1:29:34.610
Yeah.

1:29:35.090 --> 1:29:36.800
I can't believe you.

1:29:38.300 --> 1:29:41.060
Do you have any last words?

1:29:41.810 --> 1:29:44.160
No matter what anyone says,

1:29:44.830 --> 1:29:47.060
I hate those monkeys.

1:29:48.520 --> 1:29:53.070
But I never held any hatred
for those in Jujutsu High.

1:29:53.490 --> 1:29:59.030
I just couldn't wear a
heartfelt smile in this world.

1:30:01.620 --> 1:30:02.600
Suguru.

1:30:22.440 --> 1:30:26.100
At least hit me with some curses at my end.

1:30:43.750 --> 1:30:45.880
Yuta! Yuta!
Hey! Hey!

1:30:45.880 --> 1:30:46.910
Yuta! Yuta!

1:30:46.910 --> 1:30:47.910
Hey!

1:30:48.620 --> 1:30:50.880
Hey, Yuta! Are you okay?!

1:30:50.880 --> 1:30:51.760
Mustard leaf.

1:30:51.760 --> 1:30:54.630
Wake up, Yuta!

1:30:56.130 --> 1:30:58.090
Oh, he's awake.

1:31:00.210 --> 1:31:01.020
Everyone...

1:31:01.020 --> 1:31:02.020
Your injuries...

1:31:02.020 --> 1:31:04.180
Maki-san. Inumaki-kun.

1:31:04.640 --> 1:31:06.770
Wait! Panda-kun, your arm isn't healed!

1:31:07.180 --> 1:31:10.900
Chill out. We're all doing better
than you right now.

1:31:11.190 --> 1:31:15.150
Unlike these other two,
my arm can be fixed later.

1:31:15.600 --> 1:31:17.650
Thanks for saving us.

1:31:17.940 --> 1:31:19.150
Salmon.

1:31:20.540 --> 1:31:22.160
Yuta...

1:31:30.080 --> 1:31:31.670
Sorry, Rika-chan.

1:31:32.010 --> 1:31:33.460
I've kept you waiting.

1:31:33.460 --> 1:31:35.810
What's the matter, Yuta?

1:31:37.090 --> 1:31:38.510
Well, uh...

1:31:39.100 --> 1:31:41.850
In exchange for borrowing her power,

1:31:41.850 --> 1:31:44.680
um, I promised to go with Rika-chan.

1:31:44.680 --> 1:31:45.430
What?!

1:31:45.430 --> 1:31:48.020
Don't you know that means dying?!

1:31:48.020 --> 1:31:49.640
What were you thinking, you idiot?!

1:31:49.640 --> 1:31:51.710
Uh, well, I...

1:31:54.820 --> 1:31:55.690
Huh?

1:31:56.230 --> 1:31:57.460
Rika-chan?

1:31:59.610 --> 1:32:00.950
Congratulations.

1:32:01.250 --> 1:32:02.950
You managed to break the curse.

1:32:02.950 --> 1:32:04.040
Who are you?

1:32:04.040 --> 1:32:07.290
Your good-looking guy, Gojo Satoru-sensei!

1:32:08.360 --> 1:32:11.840
I thought the theory Yuta came
up with sounded interesting,

1:32:12.500 --> 1:32:14.710
so I requested an investigation
into their families.

1:32:15.250 --> 1:32:19.000
The investigation of Rika's was
finished quite a long time ago,

1:32:19.000 --> 1:32:21.890
but Yuta's was full of holes at best.

1:32:22.590 --> 1:32:24.350
So then it came to light.

1:32:25.390 --> 1:32:28.140
You're the descendant of Sugawara Michizane!

1:32:28.140 --> 1:32:30.470
That makes us super distant relatives!

1:32:30.470 --> 1:32:31.270
Yay! Yay! Yay! Yuta, yay!
Suga?!

1:32:31.270 --> 1:32:32.610
Huh? Who?
Yay! Yay! Yay! Yuta, yay!

1:32:32.610 --> 1:32:34.690
One of Japan's three great apparitions!
Yay! Yay! Yay! Yuta, yay!

1:32:34.690 --> 1:32:35.480
He's a super bigshot sorcerer.
Yay! Yay! Yay! Yuta, yay!

1:32:35.480 --> 1:32:36.570
He's a super bigshot sorcerer.

1:32:36.570 --> 1:32:37.400
Tuna.

1:32:37.720 --> 1:32:39.400
You were right, Yuta.

1:32:39.980 --> 1:32:42.240
Rika didn't place a curse on you.

1:32:43.180 --> 1:32:45.890
You placed a curse on Rika.

1:32:49.410 --> 1:32:50.510
Rika-chan...

1:32:50.920 --> 1:32:53.290
What do I do?! Is she going to die?!
I have to save her!

1:32:53.290 --> 1:32:57.590
Don't die! Don't die!
Don't die! Don't die! Don't die!

1:32:59.840 --> 1:33:01.010
That's right.

1:33:01.620 --> 1:33:05.510
Back then, I rejected Rika-chan's death.

1:33:06.280 --> 1:33:09.750
Now the one who placed
the curse has canceled the bond.

1:33:10.900 --> 1:33:14.900
So long as the one who was cursed
doesn't seek any penalty,

1:33:14.900 --> 1:33:16.440
it's fully broken now.

1:33:16.770 --> 1:33:20.400
Of course, that much was obvious
after seeing her in that form.

1:33:22.700 --> 1:33:25.450
It was all my fault, wasn't it?

1:33:26.450 --> 1:33:28.700
I turned you into that form,

1:33:28.700 --> 1:33:31.330
I hurt all those people,

1:33:31.330 --> 1:33:35.290
and I nearly caused everyone to die
when Geto came after me!

1:33:35.710 --> 1:33:36.750
It's all...

1:33:37.710 --> 1:33:39.890
It's all my...

1:33:43.050 --> 1:33:45.590
Yuta, thank you...

1:33:46.340 --> 1:33:47.930
for giving me more time,

1:33:47.930 --> 1:33:50.340
and letting me stay by your side.

1:33:50.810 --> 1:33:52.810
These past six years,

1:33:52.810 --> 1:33:55.310
I've been happier than I ever was while alive.

1:34:08.990 --> 1:34:11.370
Bye-bye. Take care.

1:34:14.210 --> 1:34:16.750
And don't come over here too soon, okay?

1:34:17.960 --> 1:34:18.750
Okay.

1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:20.070
See you later.

1:34:57.090 --> 1:34:58.210
It's a bit late now,

1:34:58.610 --> 1:35:01.220
but you weren't at fault
for the incident with Geto.

1:35:01.220 --> 1:35:04.800
He would've come to Jujutsu High
whether you were there or not.

1:35:04.800 --> 1:35:06.220
You think so?

1:35:06.220 --> 1:35:07.760
Also, here.

1:35:07.760 --> 1:35:09.300
Oh, my student ID.

1:35:09.300 --> 1:35:11.100
You found it for me, Sensei?

1:35:12.520 --> 1:35:15.600
No, not me.

1:35:16.140 --> 1:35:17.600
My best friend.

1:35:18.640 --> 1:35:20.610
The only one I had.

1:35:22.070 --> 1:35:25.610
Come on, Yuta! How long are
you gonna keep us waiting?

1:35:26.280 --> 1:35:27.610
Let's go!

1:35:34.450 --> 1:35:35.200
Yeah.

1:44:03.420 --> 1:44:04.920
This is good.

1:44:04.920 --> 1:44:06.670
Isn't it?

1:44:07.030 --> 1:44:09.460
I used a spice called Royco.

1:44:09.460 --> 1:44:12.520
That gives it a good flavor.

1:44:14.300 --> 1:44:19.430
Royco is a magic powder that makes
everything taste Kenyan when you add it.

1:44:19.430 --> 1:44:22.530
More importantly,
they really went home, right?

1:44:23.510 --> 1:44:24.440
Yeah.

1:44:24.830 --> 1:44:26.530
Good, then.

1:44:26.940 --> 1:44:30.150
This really is good. It's like nikujaga.

1:44:30.150 --> 1:44:31.200
Nikujaga?

1:44:31.560 --> 1:44:35.080
Call it beef stew. Beef stew!

1:44:37.780 --> 1:44:39.200
What's wrong?

1:44:39.750 --> 1:44:42.710
What are you doing here?

1:44:43.590 --> 1:44:44.710
Huh?

1:44:45.250 --> 1:44:46.880
Sensei?

1:44:46.880 --> 1:44:49.710
Hey. Long time no see.
