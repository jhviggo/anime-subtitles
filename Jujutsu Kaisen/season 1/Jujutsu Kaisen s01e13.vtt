WEBVTT

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.020
Itadori-kun, why is his nose bleeding?

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.760
Huh? I punched him.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.760
When?

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.210
At the start of our fight.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.000
Did his hand touch you?

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.900
Yeah.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.210
My attacks won't work on him.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.690
Huh?!

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.740
What?! Why?!

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.630
I'll explain while I'm lecturing you.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.640
One, his technique doesn't
work on Itadori-kun,

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.170
or two, there's some reason
he won't kill Itadori-kun.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.110
Either way, that's good for us.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.630
However, I can halt his movements.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.480
Once we've both created an opening,
we'll shower him with blows.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.990
We'll make sure to exorcise him here.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.060
Yeah!

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.460
I'll keep an eye on Itadori Yuuji...

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.400
while I start by taking
care of the 7:3 sorcerer.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.160
I thought this would be a good one.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.830
But they just dodged it.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.170
And after dodging it, they started
shaving away the weaker ends.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.810
It's only good for small fry.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.330
Time to stop.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.130
Right before he changes shape...

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.010
...he stores up cursed energy.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.550
Good.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.380
Even though I've made myself smaller,

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.750
there's still the risk of Itadori
Yuuji killing me in one blow.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.390
He really is my natural enemy.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.510
I'll need to make him behave for a bit.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.000
Transfigured humans!

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.350
He still had a stockpile of them?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.970
Kill the short-haired brat.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.920
I knew it.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.660
He can't kill humans!

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.440
Let's play!

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.070
Please...

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.170
kill me...

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.660
Next, I'll have him attack you, too.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.480
I wonder if he'll cry then.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.420
He's a foolish brat who can't
reconcile reality and his ideals.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.170
You're wrong.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.170
He's right in the middle of
making that reconciliation.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.950
If it were up to me,

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.680
I'd say you're the fool.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.930
Did you kill them?!

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.830
They know my tricks now.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.780
I'm changing shape right
before the moment of impact.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.770
I don't have time to create a substitute.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.360
Ah, what...

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.880
what fresh inspiration this is!

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.110
Is this...

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.990
<b>Death</b>

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.190
death?
<b>Death</b>

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.840
<b>Death</b>

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.800
I bet I could do it now.

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:20.610
Domain Expansion:

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.530
Self-Embodiment of Perfection!

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.260
Shit.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.190
Right now, I'm just...

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.750
grateful to you.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:07.030
JUJUTSU KAISEN

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.540
Episode 13:  Tomorrow

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:26.690
Quit screwing around!
Episode 13:  Tomorrow

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.870
Why did he only seal Nanamin inside?!

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:32.940
At this rate...

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:34.620
At this rate...

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.320
Domain Expansion.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.500
Within an innate domain
constructed from cursed energy,

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.420
their ultimate technique
becomes one guaranteed to hit.

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.080
It's the height of jujutsu
sorcery I could never obtain.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.290
Most likely, his cursed technique
requires touching the target

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:00.830
with his palm in its base state in
order to interfere with their soul.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.180
However, in a domain that guarantees a hit,

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.400
that would mean I'm...

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.170
literally in the palm of his hand now.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.650
Shit.

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:13.930
Jujutsu sorcerers are shit.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.210
They have to be prepared to
cast away their lives for others,

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.160
and to occasionally force
their comrades to do so.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:21.870
That's why I quit.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.610
Or more like I ran away.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.690
Do you like casse-croute?

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:29.580
Huh?

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.040
Huh?

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.350
You always buy this one, don't you?

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.040
Oh, uh, yes.

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:39.380
They stopped selling it at
my local convenience store.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.820
It's much better than a
convenience store's, isn't it?

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.310
Well, you are a bakery.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.360
Wow, harsh.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.700
Please come back again.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.070
Fly head...

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.930
Leaving it alone won't hurt anything.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:02.740
It'd be a bigger pain to deal with it and
have her think I'm some weird medium.

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.320
Hello, everybody!

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.360
You making those sales?!

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.720
When people trust us with their money,
they're trusting us with their lives.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:19.260
So it goes without saying that we have to
balance the pursuit of profit against the risks.

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:23.050
There's no need to do
anything special at the start.

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:25.780
Just be sincere with the clients.

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:27.660
Never forget that.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:28.620
Right!

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.010
Nanami...

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.590
Don't be so prudish all the time.

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:35.150
You're scaring the virgin.

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:39.730
So, new boy, what you need to think about,
first and foremost, are the company's profits.

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:42.170
They're directly connected
to our clients' profits, too!

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:46.130
Even when we con the client into buying
shitty stocks with no growth potential?

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:47.400
Of course!

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:52.180
It's suitable payment for us staring
at the markets around the clock.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.150
Nanami, this is your second year, right?

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.730
You're clever. Let yourself run a bit more wild.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.440
I have high expectations for you.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:04.740
I'm someone with no concept of a "reason
for living" or "something worth doing."

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.650
I'll just earn a reasonable amount
of money by the time I'm 30 or 40,

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:12.780
and enjoy the rest of my aimless life
in a country with a low cost of living.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:15.600
It's been four years since I left the school.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.030
Whether I'm awake or asleep,
all I think about is money.

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:23.630
Curses and other people have nothing
to do with me as long I have money.

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:25.260
Money.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.270
Money.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:28.780
Money.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.920
Money, money...

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.980
As long as I have money...

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:36.860
Are you all right?

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:38.980
Are you getting enough sleep?

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:41.110
What about you?

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:43.810
You look like your
fatigue's been building up.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.280
Oh, you can tell?

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.730
Lately, it feels like there's
a weight on my shoulder.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.940
I haven't been sleeping well, either.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:58.450
My job is to take money from the wealthy

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:01.550
and make those people even more wealthy.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:03.180
That's pretty much all it is.

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:06.980
Frankly, no one would mind if I was gone.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:10.570
People who wanted to eat bread
would mind if their bakery was gone.

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:19.040
Yet for some reason, my job, which exists
outside that natural human cycle, pays better.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.900
When you think about it
logically, it makes no sense.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.080
A-Are you bragging?

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:25.960
No, I'm not.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.490
Sorry, that was a bit complicated for me.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.160
Could you take a step forward, please?

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:40.140
Huh?

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.680
How's your shoulder now?

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.530
Huh? Well...

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.810
Huh?! It's lighter!

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:48.580
If anything still feels off,
please go to the hospital.

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:49.620
Please excuse me.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:53.960
Hey, wait!

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.720
Hold on!

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:56.830
Um...

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.830
Thank you!

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.850
Please come back again!

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.220
"Thank you."

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:08.550
Huh? Didn't you hear me? Thank you!

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:11.120
Please! Come back! Again!

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:11.360
Gojou Satoru

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:15.660
I always thought I was a person with
no concept of a "reason for living."
Gojou Satoru

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:16.730
Gojou Satoru

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.850
Hello, it's Nanami. I need to talk to you.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.040
Yes, I'll be stopping by Jujutsu Tech tomorrow...

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.240
Why are you laughing?

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.960
Idle Transfiguration.

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:35.420
I'm grateful to you.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.560
I don't need your gratitude.

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:50.590
I've already received it from lots of others.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:53.040
I have no regrets.

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:09.520
How was he able to get in?

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:14.680
That's right... The more resistant
the inside of the barrier is,

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.140
the weaker it is to attacks from outside.

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:20.730
Domains are barriers specialized
in trapping something inside,

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:23.550
so they're actually easy to invade...

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:28.030
because there's no merit in doing so.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:33.190
With Domains like Infinite Void and
Self-Embodiment of Perfection,

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:38.210
which guarantee victory, once they've ensnared
their target, that's even more true.

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:41.190
However,

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.690
inside Itadori-kun,

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.890
there lies something that must not be touched.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.770
I warned you...

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:58.640
that there wouldn't be a second time.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.030
There is no one in this world
more proud and conceited.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:11.650
He lives guided by only his
pleasure and displeasure.

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:14.140
Whether you die...

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.670
or you die...

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.610
doesn't matter.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.730
Aside from him,

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.810
I truly don't care.

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.010
JUJUTSU KAISEN

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.020
JUJUTSU KAISEN

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.150
What just happened?

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:12.780
I'll kill you!

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.330
Domain Expansion...

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.120
That really burns cursed energy.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.890
It truly is a trump card. A final technique.

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:21.380
And that damn Sukuna just...

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:24.040
But this is the critical moment!

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.850
Squeeze it out!

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:27.960
The last of my cursed energy!

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:32.890
The target's huge.

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.110
The flow of cursed energy is calm.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.550
There are no counters.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.250
I can land my attack for certain.

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:41.750
This is my last chance.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.490
I don't need any more tactics.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.780
Divergent Fist!

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:07.240
Wh-What is this lack of feedback?

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.430
Bye-bye!

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:12.390
Hold up!

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:14.430
This was fun.

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:25.280
Ino-kun, the core has
escaped into the sewers.

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:26.980
Yes.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.390
Please scour everything from my
current location to the southeast.

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:33.740
Even you could exorcise him right now.

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:35.880
Let's pursue him, too!

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:39.130
Itadori-kun!

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:40.940
Come on, body! Move!

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.390
You're going to kill that thing, aren't you?!

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:46.370
You're going to crush him... into a pulp...

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:47.520
Itadori-kun!
You're going to crush him... into a pulp...

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.430
You're going to crush him... into a pulp...

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:48.750
Itadori-kun!
You're going to crush him... into a pulp...

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:49.410
Itadori-kun!

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.560
So that was the King of Curses,
Ryoumen Sukuna.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:21.810
He should have less total cursed energy
than Jougo at this point in time, and yet...

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:23.290
That presence...

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.060
His soul's on a different level.

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:28.450
I'm certain of it.

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:30.890
Even if we're all wiped out,

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:34.470
so long as Sukuna is resurrected,
the age of curses will come.

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:37.470
Still, damn, this sucks.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:43.870
Right now, I want nothing
more than to kill Itadori Yuuji!

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:50.490
It's so frustrating!

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:52.870
But whatever.

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:54.390
Unlike his body,

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:56.990
I can kill his soul over and over again.

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:02.090
How should I kill it next time?

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:08.540
You were told to rest, weren't you?

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:10.810
Is this my lecture?

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:16.000
I have no lecture to give to
the person who saved my life.

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:17.780
I saved you?

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:21.930
That patchwork's cursed technique
was interfering with the soul.

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:27.520
Since you invaded his domain,
he wound up touching Sukuna's soul.

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:29.840
I was saved because of that.

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:34.320
But I didn't swap with him.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:39.590
Sukuna never came out. Our opponent went in.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.600
Then it wasn't me who saved you.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.170
It was just his whim.

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:49.600
Nanamin, I killed a person today.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:53.370
People die. There's no stopping that.

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:55.630
So I wanted them to at
least have proper deaths.

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:57.760
That's what I thought.

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.760
So I was always thinking about how I could
keep that trigger from being pulled.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:03.290
But...

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:06.600
after pulling that trigger myself,
I don't understand anymore.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.220
What is a proper death?

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.810
I don't know what that is, either.

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:13.930
Even if good people dying in peace

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:17.540
and evil people being punished
with death is the proper way,

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:21.260
most of the people in this world
are neither good nor evil.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:25.320
Death is the final destination for all of us,
but no one dies the same death.

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:29.070
Trying to guide all of them to their
proper end would surely be arduous.

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:30.990
I personally wouldn't recommend it.

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:36.120
But you'll still do it anyway, won't you?

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.400
Just don't end up dying
yourself in the process.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:43.060
Just as I would've died today
if you hadn't been there,

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:46.790
you'll see there are plenty of people
yet to come that need you, too.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:51.120
Because you're a jujutsu
sorcerer now, Itadori-kun.

00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:59.710
Put it in this box once you've filled it out.

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:01.580
And you don't need to write your name.

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:27.690
You're the one who gave Yoshino
those scars, aren't you, Itou?

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:34.400
I don't want hear any bitching from the guy
who was too scared to do anything at the time.

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:37.910
He quit school and moved away, didn't he?

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:39.150
So who cares?

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.430
What about me?

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:44.680
I've barely been able to move
my left arm since that day.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.460
We're talking about your crimes right now.

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:50.670
Reflect on the punishment
you earned by yourself.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.420
And where's your punishment?

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.230
Mine is yet to come.

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:57.620
First, I need to take a proper
look at the things I couldn't see.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.190
Both you...

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:01.420
and I...

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:06.000
will have to bear the crime of killing
Yoshino's heart for the rest of our lives.

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:09.050
I'll be watching you, Itou.

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:17.850
I don't understand what a proper death is.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.530
So at least...

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:22.370
until I do understand,

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.090
until I kill him,

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:40.260
I won't...

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.210
lose again.

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:16.780
Juju Stroll

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:17.520
Tuna.
Juju Stroll

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.890
Is it ready yet?

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:24.030
Salmon, salmon.

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:32.820
These meatballs are great.

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:33.930
Who made them?

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:35.260
Oh, I did.

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:36.910
They're easy to make.

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:40.790
<b>1) Put all the ingredients in. Use twice as much ginger.</b>

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:44.300
<b>2) Mix together well and knead it.</b>

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:48.130
<b>3) Shape with spoons and toss into the pot.</b>

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:49.510
<b>Salt and pepper
Egg yolks (you can use the whites, too, if it's too much hassle)
Ginger paste
Finely chopped green onions
Ground chicken
Ingredients

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:54.060
<b>Ingredients
Ground chicken
Finely chopped green onions
Ginger paste
Egg yolks (you can use the whites, too, if it's too much hassle)

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:55.570
Bonito flakes.

00:22:56.810 --> 00:23:00.520
You can cook for yourself?
Not really surprising, actually.

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:04.060
No, Itadori taught me how to make these.

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:15.650
I see.

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:19.820
Itadori's legacy.

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:21.230
I don't think that's right.

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:26.770
These meatballs are great.

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:29.470
Oh, those are super easy to make.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.360
Even Fushiguro can make them.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.480
I taught him how.

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.360
I can't wait to see those two again.

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:54.990
