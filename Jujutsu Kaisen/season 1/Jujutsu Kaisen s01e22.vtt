00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.000
Hey, are you listening?!

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.440
I told you! The auto-locking
door was left wide open!

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.680
Don't make me repeat myself!

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.470
I told you this last week, too!

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.070
Why am I paying such
high management fees?!

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.000
Huh?!

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.380
Screw you!

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.450
Do it today!

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.640
Come inspect it right now!

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.290
Are you even listening to me?!

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.440
I'll kill you!

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.860
JUJUTSU KAISEN

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.470
Kanada Taichi in Morioka, in June.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.640
Shimada Osamu in Yokohama, in August.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.650
Yamato Hiroshi in Nagoya, in September.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.800
These three died in similar circumstances.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.990
They were stabbed to death by a cursed spirit
at the entrances to their apartments,

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.330
and all of them had filed the same complaint

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.130
with the property managers
several weeks before dying.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.350
They claimed their auto-locking
doors were left wide open.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.010
None of the other residents have
any idea what could have happened.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.960
None of the dates or locations match, though.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.450
Could the same cursed
spirit have killed them all?

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.010
Hey, could the cursed spirit
be responsible for the doors?

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.680
Do sensors like those pick up cursed spirits?

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.980
They don't show up on
cameras and stuff, right?

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.510
Apparently, the cursed spirit made the
door operators go crazy, not the sensors.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.370
Oh...

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.110
Operators?

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.080
And as for whether or not the same
cursed spirit was behind this...

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.390
Well, we couldn't be certain
from just the residuals.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.110
After all, a lot of time had already passed.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.820
So we tried to track down any
connections between the three.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.130
We found that all three attended
the same middle school for two years.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.280
Meaning all three received the same curse,

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.800
and it activated after time had passed?

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.600
Precisely. That's highly likely.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.160
So we're going to that middle school now

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.000
to question someone
the three victims all knew,

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.560
and I want you three to see
what you can find as sorcerers.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.510
Way to go, Kugisaki!

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.240
Heh. What'd you expect?

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.270
<b>Spirit
Lantern</b>

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.840
Morishita Family
Funeral 11:00~

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.730
A funeral?
Morishita Family
Funeral 11:00~

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.730
Is this the home of that acquaintance?

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.240
Yes, it is...

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.960
Well, this sucks.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.670
He died the same way the other three did.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.930
He lived with his family,
so there was no auto-locking door,

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.670
but he was killed in front of the entrance.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.130
Previously, upon returning home alone,

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.930
he reported, "The door was unlocked,
but it wouldn't open,"

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.140
to his other family members.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.620
I asked his parents, too,

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.160
but they said they didn't know what
relationship he had with the other three.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.960
Man, there goes our only lead!

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:35.900
Don't worry!

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.400
There has to be something
at this middle school!

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.780
I sure hope so.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.340
For now, I've secured an appointment
with a teacher, so I'm counting on you.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:45.570
Roger.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.790
There's some obvious punks.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.360
Let's beat 'em up and set 'em straight!

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.040
Why?

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.410
Huh?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.050
I-It's good to see you!

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.120
Heh, look at that. You actually get it.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.030
An aura just pours out,
even if you try to hide it.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.350
We haven't seen you since
graduation, Fushiguro-san!

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.770
I... went here... for middle school.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.530
That's a surprise, too, but that's not the point!

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:24.600
Look at me!

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.500
What'd you do?!

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.400
What did you do in middle school?!

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.950
No, it would be quicker to ask them!

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.790
Hey, Idiot A and Idiot B!
What did this guy do to you?

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.290
We...

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.140
Or rather, every delinquent,
gang member, and so on in this area

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.520
got beaten up by Fushiguro-san.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.530
I beat them up.

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.550
Why do you keep talking so stiffly?!
I beat them up.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.800
Why do you keep talking so stiffly?!

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.960
Look at me!

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.950
What are you doing?!

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.600
Hey! What are you doing?!

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.620
Hey!

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.040
Who are you? Students from other
schools aren't allowed in here!

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.810
And who the hell are you?!

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.360
He's clearly a staff member.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.880
Why are you so combative?

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.820
We have permission to be here.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.220
Oh, you're the ones?

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.350
You're all young.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.630
You need to hang your pass around your neck.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.330
Fushiguro-kun?

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.560
Hello.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.840
He remembers you!

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.470
So this man's been here a long time?

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:27.650
Probably.

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.100
Takeda-san's a permanent employee.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.890
Then I leave the rest to you!

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.440
Abandoning her duty...

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.600
Kanada, Shimada, Yamato...

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.230
and Morishita, huh?

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.420
I was shocked by their passing,

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.330
but I guess it's been nearly
twenty years since they graduated.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.990
I remember it like it was yesterday.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:55.990
They were problem children in their
own right, though not as bad as you.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.350
What did you want to know?

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.050
Strange rumors, dark rumors,
connections to bad adults...

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.690
Hey, problem child!

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.340
...and anything of ill omen.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.740
Dark rumors?

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.280
They may have been problem children,

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.970
but they never went beyond
average middle school stuff.

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.020
But wait... ill omen?

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.810
Do you mean that tale?

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.500
About the Yasohachi Bridge bungee jumping?

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.770
You're still here, A and B?

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.920
Yasohachi Bridge?

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.680
A notorious suicide spot.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.260
It's well-known in this
area as a haunted location.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.070
Oh, that's right! Back then, it was
all the rage among delinquents

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:36.240
to bungee jump off
Yasohachi Bridge late at night.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.450
It was one of those tests of courage.

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:40.100
What a weird tribe.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.640
I'm surprised there are people dumber than me!

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.320
What do you use for a cord?

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.540
We don't do it.

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:50.440
I just heard some students from our
parents' generation talking about it.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:56.040
One day, Kanada and the other three
were absent without permission.

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:01.970
That wasn't all that unusual by itself,
but when we contacted their families,

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:05.140
we learned that those four hadn't
come home the day before.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.170
It caused a pretty big stir.

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:12.480
Then they were found
unconscious under the bridge.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.480
They got chewed out good,

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.470
but all four swore up and down
they didn't remember a thing.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.830
I think that's it.

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:25.810
I've been to Yasohachi Bridge, too.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:26.960
To bungee jump?

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.260
Ow!

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:32.840
It's easy for curses to take root in
haunted locations, just like in schools,

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.450
so people from Jujutsu High
regularly patrol it.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.490
There wasn't anything unusual
at the time, though.

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:41.490
It might be a bit famous,

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:43.560
but it's still used as a normal bridge.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.230
We still have to go check it out, though.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.900
Yeah.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.440
Fushiguro-kun?

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.200
Sorry, I was curious about something.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.380
What is it?

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:58.320
Tsukimi-kun took awfully good care
of you when you were in school.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.330
Is she doing well?

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:03.810
Yes.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.840
Who's Tsumiki?

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.670
My older sister.

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:08.580
What?!

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.210
You tell us too little about yourself!

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:12.840
Yeah, that's right!

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.570
When they have cursed objects like these,

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.560
why don't they destroy them?

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.350
They can't destroy them.

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.650
Not when it comes to special-grades.

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:27.800
So they use a pact to put their life
on pause and prevent harm to others,

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.590
preserving their existence.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.470
Sukuna's fingers cause harm, though.

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:34.500
That's an exception.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.880
It's a monster that still
attracts curses over time,

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.100
even after becoming a cursed object
and divided into twenty pieces.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.100
And because of that, it can choose its vessel.

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:51.110
Hmm... Then anyone works for these?

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:54.770
Hey, you.

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:56.210
Money?

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:57.490
Money, right?

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:00.010
I don't have that much!

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:02.640
But there are loan sharks and stuff, right?!

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.110
Will he work okay?

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:07.910
He still can't see me, even at this point.

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:09.650
He's seriously lacking in ability.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.660
Here, say "ahh."

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:24.040
JUJUTSU KAISEN

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.020
JUJUTSU KAISEN

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:42.500
We're here.

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:46.000
Koi no Kuchi Canyon, Yasohachi Bridge.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.740
Once you confirm a cursed
spirit's here, I'll lower a veil.

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:51.710
Roger!

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:54.530
Hey.

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.710
Sorry to ask this right after you woke up,

00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:00.390
but could you go run a little errand for me?

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:14.030
Hey, we didn't find hide
nor hair of any cursed spirit.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:15.570
<b>Spicy Cod Roe</b>

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:19.220
We didn't sense any presences or residuals.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:20.940
I see.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.860
Which means this isn't it.
Guess it's back to square one.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:26.440
But isn't it bad if we take too long?

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.590
Why?

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:30.870
Well, it's a famous haunted location, right?

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:34.140
There might still be plenty
of others who got cursed.

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:37.370
And right now, the death rate's at 100%.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:40.190
We don't want to see any others die, right?

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:41.880
True.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:43.210
Ding-ding!

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:45.400
Bungee jumping was all the rage then, right?

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.880
So maybe the act of jumping off is the key?

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.650
Did she say "ding-ding"?
Did she really say that?

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:52.350
She did! She did!

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:54.900
Itadori already tried that.

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:55.890
Huh?

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:01.730
What?! You mean you jumped
with that vinyl cord?!

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:08.450
Hey, there you are!

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:09.760
Thank goodness!

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:11.680
Fushiguro-san!

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:13.930
Who's that again?

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:15.800
Fushiguro's underclassman.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.080
Remember how much you picked on him?

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:20.790
You were talking about Yasohachi Bridge, so...

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:22.580
I'm really glad I found you here!

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.590
Fujinuma?

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:27.330
A classmate.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:28.640
My older sister.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:33.120
I'm glad you remember me.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:37.610
I was talking to my sister
about you yesterday, and...

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:41.870
Um, Morishita-san had a
funeral in the neighborhood...

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:48.620
Then I heard from my brother that you were
looking into that man and Yasohachi Bridge,

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:52.120
so I started wondering
if they were related...

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.200
If what's related?

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.960
Morishita-san's death and the bridge...

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.110
They're not related.

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:02.090
We're just—

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:02.890
I...

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.900
I went there.

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.170
In eighth grade... I went to
Yasohachi Bridge at night.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.130
Geh.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.100
Has anything odd happened at home recently?

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.810
Any strange feelings that only
affect you and no one else?

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:24.940
My family runs a local branch shop...

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:30.920
and the shop's automatic door is
wide open only when I come home.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:36.050
Mom and Dad both say it's just a coincidence,

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:39.730
but there's definitely something there.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.840
It scared me.

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:46.430
That's when I heard about you,

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:49.380
and remembered the Yasohachi Bridge.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:52.690
When did the issue with
your automatic door start?

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:56.290
It's happened about every other
day for exactly one week now.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:03.140
There's at least two weeks between when the
four victims noticed something and their deaths.

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.160
We still have some time.

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:09.240
You didn't go to Yasohachi Bridge
by yourself at the time, did you?

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.910
Do you remember who you went with?

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:13.910
Um, so this really does
have something to do with...

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:15.700
Just with your automatic door.

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.940
But it has nothing to do
with Morishita-san's death.

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:23.480
Fushiguro-kun and the others are
helping me with my college report.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:27.600
"Electromagnetic Waves from Haunted
Locations and their Effects on Electronics."

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.530
It's a huge pain in my gut!

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:32.330
But I want to hear from all kinds of people,

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.850
so I'd love to hear who you went with.

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:38.340
We'd better save her,
after lying to her like this.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.770
I went on a test of courage
with two others from my club.

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:46.930
That's right. Fushiguro-kun,

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:49.360
Tsumiki-san was with us then, too.

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:51.940
Tsumiki?

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:53.380
That's Fushiguro's sister!

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:56.040
I see.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.620
Then I'll try asking Tsumiki, too.

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:02.600
Okay, then I'll escort these two home.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.210
Please keep working on the report.

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:07.430
Something's up, isn't it?

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:10.220
I can't let you both go home on one bike!

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:19.640
Fushiguro.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.390
Fushiguro!

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:26.560
Fushiguro, snap out of it.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.360
Make sure she's safe first!

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:33.660
I'm fine.

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:35.960
Sorry, I'm stepping away for a sec.

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.450
I understand the situation.

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:47.340
A guard for Tsumiki-san, right?

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:52.090
But the only ones we have available
right now are second-grade sorcerers.

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:53.760
Second-grade...

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:57.960
Since the number of victims
far exceeds our estimates,

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:01.100
we'll have to re-evaluate
the curse's grade, as well.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:07.380
You were probably assigned to this mission
with Itadori-kun's growth taken into account,

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.540
so if it's even more dangerous than that,

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:13.060
it might be too much for
a second-grade sorcerer.

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:15.670
It's just as dangerous
for all of you, as well.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:18.400
Personally, I recommend you withdraw.

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.360
What do I do?

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:24.250
Do I go back by myself right now?

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:28.540
No, the mission was already
dangerous for all three of us.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:30.560
I can't leave it to just the two of them.

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:34.010
Gojo-sensei will return next week.

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:35.960
I could ask him then...

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:39.490
No, I can't! The time limit
is the big problem!

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:42.250
This isn't the type of cursed spirit
that attacks someone.

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:45.990
It's the type that activates a cursed
technique from within a marked person.

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:48.880
So there's no point staying
nearby and protecting them!

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.810
I have to exorcise it right away!

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.890
Why were you talking to Ijichi-san?

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:55.990
Is your sister Tsumiki okay?

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:58.490
She's fine.

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:01.380
More importantly, this mission's
danger level just shot up.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:04.000
Other sorcerers will be taking over this case.

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:06.000
You two can go home now.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.920
Huh? Why?

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.850
Us two? What about you?

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:14.990
I'll go back after I say farewell to Takeda-san.

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:15.840
Now go!

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.320
Thanks for your help.

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:28.690
Is this Nitta-san?

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:30.610
There's something I want to ask you.

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:32.770
The procedure, right?

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:37.320
Fujinuma-san didn't go
over Yasohachi Bridge.

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.930
They held their test of
courage under the bridge.

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.020
Itadori went under it, too.

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.850
Most likely, you can't get
below it from up above.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:50.260
The cursed spirit is within its barrier,
so the procedure's important.

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:52.780
You go at night, from underneath.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.450
And one more thing...

00:17:55.290 --> 00:18:00.790
It's impossible to constantly keep a domain
imbued with a technique deployed forever.

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:05.410
Which means it's like that barrier
at the juvenile detention center...

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:07.230
an incomplete domain.

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:10.130
I'm actually lucky this time around,

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:14.030
since I won't need a veil.

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:20.160
You tell us too little about yourself.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.030
Yeah.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:27.430
You're seriously at your wits' end
if you didn't notice us until now.

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:30.340
We're not saying you have
to tell us everything,

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:31.800
but at least rely on us.

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:33.980
We're friends, aren't we?

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.520
Tsumiki's...

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:48.450
still bedridden.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:55.790
The curse of Yasohachi Bridge
only appears before its victims.

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:00.660
Since she can't communicate herself,

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.340
I have no idea when she'll
be killed by the curse.

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:08.960
So I want to exorcise it right away.

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:12.590
But it's true that our mission's
danger level has increased.

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:15.230
Okay, okay, we get it now.

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:17.690
You should have told us that from the start.

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.940
The cursed spirit is within its barrier,
so the procedure's important.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:29.650
You go at night, from underneath.

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:31.690
And one more thing...

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:33.690
At the bottom of the canyon,

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:36.500
there might be a river.

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.610
Crossing a river or other border—
acts that symbolize crossing to the afterlife—

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:50.010
carry important meaning in sorcery.

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.110
There it is.

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:08.230
This one will be rewarding to exorcise.

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:25.740
What's this? Someone beat me here?

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:26.750
Huh?!

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:29.250
Fushiguro, this one's
a different case, right?

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:30.750
Yeah.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.980
Then you two focus on that other one.

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:38.760
I'll exorcise this one.

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:40.450
What?

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:43.270
You're going to play with me?

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.610
Juju Stroll

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:20.320
Help! It's a purse snatcher!

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:28.590
I run a Chinese restaurant.

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:30.520
Allow me to treat you as thanks.

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.870
We couldn't!

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:32.710
Are you sure?!

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:35.330
Thank you so much! I'll gladly eat!

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:36.400
<b>Chinese Restaurant Manpuku</b>

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.780
This restaurant has lasted four generations.
<b>Chinese Restaurant Manpuku</b>

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.920
That was supposed to end with my father,
<b>Chinese Restaurant Manpuku</b>

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:43.490
That was supposed to end with my father,

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:47.190
but I insisted and kept it running.

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:53.400
I wanted to keep this restaurant,
this flavor, around.

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:56.440
What a nice story.

00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.430
Sorry for the wait. Here's our pride and joy,

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:01.700
the gyoza meal passed
down for generations!

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.410
Time to dig in!

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:06.280
Thank you for the meal!

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:13.440
You two...

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.310
What do you think of gyoza
with no meat flavor,

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:17.630
that's basically just
cabbage and thickener?

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:19.570
I'm glad you said something, Fushiguro!

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:21.290
She was a nice woman, too!

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:23.420
She was a nice woman, but still!

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:28.680
But apparently, gyoza is meant to
be a vegetable dish, not a meat dish.

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:29.610
Seriously?

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:40.060
Episode 23:
The Origin of Blind Obedience - 2 -
