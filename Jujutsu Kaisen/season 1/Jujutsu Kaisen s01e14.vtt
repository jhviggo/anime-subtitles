00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.930
No!

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.150
Oh, there you are!

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.380
Jougo!

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.040
Looks like most of your body's back.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.610
Yeah, this place is relaxing.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.880
Humans don't come anywhere near it.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.930
Lacking a body really is a problem.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.790
It makes self-preservation so inefficient.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.330
Mahito, you're awfully worn down yourself.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.150
Oh, you could tell?

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.960
Sukuna and his vessel
are my natural enemies.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.970
I started this game because
I happened to acquire a new toy,

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.890
but it just didn't go so well.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.460
It was great at first, though.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.470
Are you sure I shouldn't have just
used a hostage to force him into a pact?

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.100
Like, "Hand your body over to Sukuna
if you don't want to see him killed."

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.280
No, pacts are only placed
by oneself on oneself.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.500
It's not easy to forge pacts with others,
or due to intervention from others.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.770
Maybe I should have just given that thing
a lethal wound instead of transfiguring it.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.650
Then Sukuna might have been able to heal
it with his reverse cursed technique.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.000
Know your place, fool.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.540
No, not with that personality.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.810
I think he would have refused either way.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.380
Jougo...

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.200
Touching Sukuna made me realize that

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.380
we should probably proceed
with Getou's plan for now.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.460
Sukuna is that valuable.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.820
Gather all the fingers and
offer them to Sukuna, huh?

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.980
Even if we're all wiped out in the process, eh?

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.480
Very well.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.660
I don't need to be the one laughing
in the wasteland a century from now.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.960
As long as curses stand there as
people, that's all that matters.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.460
Oh, you get it!

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.000
Then first, let's go retrieve the
six fingers Jujutsu Tech has.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.420
Is that necessary?

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.640
The sorcerers are only
keeping Itadori Yuuji around

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.590
so he can take in Sukuna's fingers, right?

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.720
He'll still eat them, even if we leave them be.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.610
The higher-ups at Jujutsu Tech

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.300
are struggling to measure
Itadori Yuuji's strength as a vessel,

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.710
to see how many he can take
before he goes berserk.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.480
They won't let him take them in
until they've gathered all the fingers...

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.230
With just one exception.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.500
<b>Exception
With just one exception.</b>

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.030
<b>Exception</b>

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.740
I want to feed them to him right away!
<b>Exception</b>

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.960
And we can't wait that long, right?

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.390
Worst case, there's also a chance
they'll eliminate Itadori Yuuji.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.500
Into the tiger's den, huh?

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.180
Well, what should we do, then?

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.000
I've already taken steps.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.890
That's why I allowed Jujutsu Tech
to retrieve the fingers we had.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.800

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.760
while discussing the separation of church and state!

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.010
Let's post a video of it and troll people.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.030
Enjoy that on your own.

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.890
What kind of idea is that?

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.840
Drinking game time! Name things
you love about Gojou Satoru!

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:29.840
Everything!

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.310
Please keep that attitude going.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.960
Itadori-kun needs that
kind of idiocy right now.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.650
You'll take on and complete
several harder missions.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.900
That wasn't what I meant by "harder," though.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.210
Nanami, does Yuuji know about
that finger in Yoshino's—

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.380
I haven't told him.

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.220
Knowing him, he'd just feel
unnecessarily responsible.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.920
I'm glad I left you in charge.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.540
And the finger?

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.450
I submitted it to the higher-ups, of course.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.990
If I gave it to you, you'd just
feed it to Itadori-kun, right?

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.750
Tsk.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.530
But is it really okay to bring him back?

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.930
If the fact that he's alive becomes
known at the exchange event,

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.440
won't the higher-ups just target him again?

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.300
Even if they do, Yuuji will be just fine now.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.950
You know that better than anyone, don't you?

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.000
Sensei!

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.660
Oh, Nanamin's here, too.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.540
Well, c'mon!

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.190
You don't have to do anything!

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.520
Just do exactly as I say,
and go with the flow!

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.620
So what should I do?!

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:33.630
Just go with the flow!

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.480
It'll be enough of a surprise
just to see he's alive.
Just go with the flow!

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:37.970
What?!

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:40.980
Why are you all empty-handed?!

What are <i>you</i> doing with all that luggage?

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.690

We're going to Kyoto, right?

For the exchange event
with our sister school <i>in</i> Kyoto?

It's an exchange event <i>with</i>
our sister school in Kyoto.

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:55.730
Held in Tokyo.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.950
No way!

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:02.220
No wonder our conversations
have been a bit off lately.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.020

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:06.780
It's held at the school that
won in the previous year.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:08.970
Then don't go winning, you idiots!

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:11.320
We weren't in it last year!

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.440
Only Yuuta participated to
make the numbers match up!

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.480
That was prior to freeing Rika.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.650
Apparently, it was an overwhelming win.

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:20.760
I didn't see it, though,
since it was held in Kyoto.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.660
Not that I've ever even met you!

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.030

And for everyone from Tokyo, we have this!

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.820
Overly excited adults are creepy.

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:33.080
Hey! OPP!

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.070
It's your departed friend,
Itadori Yuuji-kun!

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.080
Huh?!

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.580
Huh? Huh?!

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.540
They don't seem happy at all!

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:48.480
N-No way.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.720
Okay, everyone from Kyoto!

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.690
This is Sukuna's vessel, Itadori Yuuji-kun!

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:55.550
Wh-What about the ones from Kyoto?

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.550
They're too absorbed in their souvenirs!

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.560
Sukuna's vessel?!

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.560
What's the meaning of this?

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.560
Jujutsu Tech, Kyoto School Principal
Gakuganji Yoshinobu

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.560
Principal Gakuganji!

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:13.560
Oh, thank goodness.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:18.870
I was worried you might
just die from the shock.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.080
You damn brat!

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:28.480
Hey.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.120
Uh, yes?

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.160
You got something to say?

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:32.960
Huh?

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:41.950
I'm sorry for keeping quiet
about being alive.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.010
<b>Itadori Rejoins</b>

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:50.010
JUJUTSU KAISEN

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.020
JUJUTSU KAISEN

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:04.480
The Tokyo-Kyoto Sister School
Exchange Event will be held over two days.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.300
The first day is a group battle...

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:13.650
The Wacky Cursed Spirit Exorcism Race!

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:16.920
The rules are simple.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:17.330
Second-Grade
The rules are simple.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:17.610
Second-Grade

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:21.170
The first team to exorcise
the second-grade cursed spirit
Second-Grade

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:21.550
released in the designated area wins.
Second-Grade

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.050
released in the designated area wins.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:28.320
Several third-grade and lower cursed spirits
will be released into the designated area, as well.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.120
If a winner is not decided by sundown,

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.060
the team that exorcises the most wins.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.020
There are absolutely no other rules.

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:40.480
Of course, you're welcome
to sabotage the others,

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.330
but remember, you're all on the same
side in the fight against the curses.

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:47.800
This exchange event will allow
you to learn about yourselves

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.030
and your comrades through competition.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:56.630
Be certain not to kill other competitors
or injure them beyond recovery.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.420
That's it.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.910
You're all dismissed until the
event commences at noon!

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.130
Excuse me...

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.060
Depending on how you look at it,

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.990
this could be considered
very extreme bullying.

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:17.380
Shut up and stay that way for a while.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:18.440
Now, now...

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.620
You heard his explanation.

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:22.170
Cut him some slack.

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:23.900
The panda talked!

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.280
Salmon, salmon.

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:26.860
What?

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:29.640
Inumaki-senpai is a cursed speech user.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.330
Cursed speech is a technique that amplifies
the power and compulsion of words.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.290
He limits his vocabulary to keep others safe.

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:39.220
So if he told someone to
go die, they'd actually die?

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.580
That's really powerful.

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.720
It's nothing that convenient.

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:46.120
It's all case by case, depending
on their difference in strength.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:49.530
If he uses powerful words,
he's hit with massive feedback.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:51.840
Worst case, it could affect him.

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:56.280
Limiting his vocabulary is a way
for Toge to protect himself, as well.

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:00.230
So how are you able to speak, Senpai?

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:01.700
Are you some new breed of panda?

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.240
Blabbing on about people's techniques...

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.270
It's fine.

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:07.510
Toge's isn't that kind of technique, anyway.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.830
More importantly, Yuuji...

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.660
Give me back Slaughter Demon.

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:15.020
You borrowed it from Satoru, right?

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:22.380
Gimme!

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.150
Here you go!

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.590
I broke it.

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:29.060
It's not coming back!

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.880
Gojou-sensei... has it...

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.330
Tsk, that blindfolded dumbass!

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:43.320
Gross.

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:45.620
So, what's the plan?

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:48.810
The group battle format
is what we expected,

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:50.690
but we have another member now.

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:53.090
Do we change strategies?
There's not much time.

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:54.110
Bonito flakes.

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:55.620
Well, that depends on Yuuji.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.230
What can you do?

00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:59.100
Punch, kick...

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.980
We have enough of that.

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.070
Huh?

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:07.590
I don't know what he's been
doing since he's been dead,

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:12.360
but if everyone from Tokyo and Kyoto
fought him at once without cursed energy,

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.890
Itadori would win.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:16.920
Oh?

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:20.630
Megumi's saying that after fighting Toudou?

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.230
That makes it convincing.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.280
Interesting.

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:35.920
Kill Sukuna's vessel, Itadori Yuuji.

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.920
He is not a person.

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:40.230
So it will go unquestioned.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:42.250
It'll be treated as an accident.

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:44.920
There's no need to hold back or hesitate.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.130
I don't want to...

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:48.960
You say to kill him,

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.920
but he's here because he didn't die, right?

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:55.930
I've heard that Itadori's
previous death was suicide.

00:15:56.130 --> 00:16:00.840
What is the one thing you must be cautious
about when ending a hostile sorcerer?

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.840
Kamo.

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:02.940
Yes.

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:06.240
You must kill them with cursed
energy to prevent them from

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.950
coming back as a curse after death.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:09.450
Exactly.

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:14.020
If another delivers the finishing blow
with cursed energy, then all is well.

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:17.950
At present, Itadori Yuuji
has control of the body.

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:21.420
Unless Sukuna comes out,
he's just a first-year.

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:22.750
Killing him will be—

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:26.620
This is stupid. Do what you want.

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.090
Come back, Toudou.

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.090
The principal isn't finished yet.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:36.010
Takada-chan's making a guest
appearance on a walking show at 11.

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:38.100
Do I need to explain any more?

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.600
You can record it. Come back here.

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:44.200
I'm going to watch the recording
<i>and</i> watch it in real time!

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.360
Who do you take me for?

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:49.980
<i>That's</i> your problem here?!

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.600
Listen, all of you.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.650
You listen, too, old man.

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:58.660
I've long been disappointed in you all
and your bad taste in women.

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.340
Plot and scheme all you want on your own.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.660
But if you try to order me around again,

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:06.680
I'll kill you.

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:12.380
What do we do now?

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:16.380
I don't think we'll be able to carry
out the plan with him like that.

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:18.810
The principal's gone off somewhere, too.

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:21.860
I don't want to be killed by that guy.

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:23.890
Does it even matter?

00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:27.790
He's going to go straight
for the Tokyo team, anyway.

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:29.920
If he's just going to go berserk,

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.810
we can focus on the game.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:36.790
But we have to kill Itadori Yuuji, right?

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.480
We're seriously doing this?

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:42.460
I don't think he'll go as far as killing him.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.250
Though he probably could.

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.050
Then we'll need someone to
keep an eye on Toudou

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:50.480
and deliver the final blow to Itadori Yuuji.

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.410
I don't like this.

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:56.380
We'll have cursed spirits to deal with, too,
so we'll be in two-man cells anyway.

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.000
That works out for us.

00:17:58.450 --> 00:17:59.230
No.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.740
Allowing a half-wit like Itadori Yuuji

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:06.370
to be a sorcerer at Jujutsu Tech
is a serious problem.

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:08.770
One that goes beyond this exchange event.

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:11.820
I cannot overlook this as the
eldest son of the Kamo clan.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:16.820
We're all attacking Itadori Yuuji together.

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:18.660
Hold on.

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:22.620
What happens if Inumaki-kun
is with Itadori-kun?

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:27.510
Having all of us in one place is a risky
move with that cursed speech user.

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:30.600
Worst case, he could
wipe us all out at once.

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:33.100
That's true.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:38.140
No, if you know he's coming,
he's not that scary to face.

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:40.560
Let me have Maki.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.640
That brown-haired first-year, too, if possible.

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:46.080
You're sounding just like Toudou.

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.520
So what did you want?

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.950
Huh? Why are you mad?

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.440
I'm not mad, actually.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.630
Right? I haven't done anything, after all.

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:06.320
There's someone working with either
a curse user or curses at Jujutsu Tech.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.910
Impossible!

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:11.310
A curse user might be one thing,
but working with curses?

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:14.880
A lot of them on that level
have been popping up lately.

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:19.380
They understand human speech, and they've
formed a faction that's operating with purpose.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:22.890
They might think they're just
working with a curse user, but...

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:27.340
I'd like to ask you to handle
investigating those at Kyoto, Utahime.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.360
What would you do if I was the traitor?

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:32.920
No way.

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:35.480
You're weak, and you don't have the guts—

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.630
Scary! Hysterics won't win men, you know.

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:43.450
I! Am! The senior here!

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:49.020
Itadori.

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:51.480
You okay?

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:55.260
Yeah, sounds like I've got
a big role, but I'll manage.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.380
I'm not talking about that.

00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:58.300
Something happened, right?

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.300
Huh? Nothing happened.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.800
Okay, it did.

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.320
But it's true that I'm fine.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:14.350
In fact, because of what happened,
I don't want to lose to anyone.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.780
Okay, then.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.200
I don't really want to lose, either.

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:21.980
What do you mean, "really"?

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:24.190
You already got sent rolling around once!

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:26.870
Overwhelm them!
Let's thoroughly trounce them!

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:28.170
For Maki-san's sake, too!

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:29.860
Don't say stuff like that.

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:30.980
Pollack roe.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.130
Yeah! For Maki-san's sake, too!

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:35.130
Don't say stuff like that.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.790
Well, in that case,

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:40.690
let's win!

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:43.990
What are you doing taking the lead?

00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:45.010
Ow!

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.560
Juju Stroll

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:21.060
<b>Sushi Eishuu</b>

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:26.510
Hello! Today we're here at the
long-standing sushi shop, Eishuu!

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:29.330
You should do that kind of thing, too.

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:32.080
You'd be mad at me if I did.

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:35.080
Welcome.

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.380
What do you like, Takada-chan?

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:53.640
Goatfish! And room temperature sake!

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:55.310
They're great together!

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:56.750
How old are you again?

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:57.600
Huh?

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.480
How long have you been making sushi, boss?

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:06.780
I've been doing it since I was 20.

00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:11.260
Which means... about 300 years?

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:12.870
Are you drunk?

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.870
Here's the goatfish you ordered.

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:21.900
Mm, it's so good!

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.970
Can I have yours, too?

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:25.380
Of course not.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.920
Sorry!

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.570
Honestly, what are you thinking?

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:31.480
Well, it just looked so delicious!

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:32.770
She's drunk.
Well, it just looked so delicious!

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:33.270
She's drunk.

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:35.390
That's my Takada-chan.
Tan, Taka-tan!

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:38.640
Sensei, did you know "OPP"
actually stands for something?

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.540
Huh? It does?

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:43.240
Ocean Pacific Peace.

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:44.350
Seriously?

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:55.030
