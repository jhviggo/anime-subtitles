00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.150
Our window verified the
curse womb three hours ago.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.390
Once 90 percent were successfully evacuated,

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.140
they made the call to seal off the center.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:15.950
Road Closed

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.030
Citizens within a 500-meter radius
have been evacuated, as well.
Road Closed

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.890
Citizens within a 500-meter radius
have been evacuated, as well.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.810
Ijichi-san, question.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.680
What's a "window" here?

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.720
A window is a member of
Jujutsu Tech who can see curses.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.740
They aren't sorcerers, though.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.620
Oh, okay.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.840
Let's continue.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.700
Detainee Block 2.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.310
At present, five detainees
remain there with the curse womb.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.300
If this curse womb is the
type that metamorphoses,

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.480
we predict it will become
a special-grade cursed spirit.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.990
Special-grade...

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.900
Hey, so... I still don't really understand
what "special-grade" means.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.420
Then allow me to explain it so
even idiots can understand.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.490
First, there's grade 4.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.390
A wooden bat is enough for them.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.290
Grade 3.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.180
If you have a handgun, you can rest easy.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.510
Grade 2.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.040
It'll be a close call with a shotgun.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.840
Grade 1.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.730
Even a tank may be insufficient.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:14.980
Then there's special-grade.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.100
Let's say you <i>might</i> be on even footing if
you carpet bomb it with cluster bombs.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.630
That's real bad!

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.880
Normally a jujutsu sorcerer on par with
the cursed spirit would take on the mission.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.020
On a day like today,
that would be Gojou-sensei.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.230
I-I see.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.930
So where is Gojou-sensei?

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.610
Away on business.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.460
Huh?

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.800
He's not someone who should be loafing
around at the school in the first place.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.030
Don't expect any souvenirs.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.110
Unfortunately, we're constantly
short-handed in this business.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.990
You'll often have to undertake
missions beyond your power.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.480
The current case, however,
is an abnormal one, and most urgent.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.550
Do not fight under any circumstances.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.020
If you encounter a special-grade,

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.100
your options are to either run or die.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.100
Please just listen to your fears.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.640
Do not forget that your mission here

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.900
is strictly the verification
and rescue of survivors.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.690
Excuse me!

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.220
Excuse me, where's Tadashi?!

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.540
Stop! Stay back!

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.840
Please stay back!

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.590
Is Tadashi... Is my son Tadashi all right?!

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.470
Please calm down!

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.350
Hey, stop it!
Please calm down!

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.820
Hey, stop it!

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:23.640
Please stay back! It's dangerous!
Let go of me!

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.810
Let me through!
Please stay back! It's dangerous!

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:25.010
She's a guardian who was here for a visit.
Please stay back! It's dangerous!

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.710
She's a guardian who was here for a visit.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.860
Please step away.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.910
There's a possibility that someone has
spread poisonous gas throughout the center.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.670
We cannot share any more details at this time.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:37.740
No...

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.400
Why?

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.050
Why is this happening?!

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.270
Fushiguro, Kugisaki.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.120
We're gonna save them!

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.710
Of course we are.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:11.950

Episode 4: Curse Womb Must Die

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.360
I'll put up my Veil.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.260
Emerge from darkness, blacker than darkness.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.470
Purify that which is impure.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.040
It's becoming night!

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.120
It's Veil.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.410
There's a residential area nearby,

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.780
so this barrier conceals us
from the outside world.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.070
That's incredible!

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.290
Ignorant.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:59.190
Demon Dogs!

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.370
He'll let us know if the curse gets close.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.270
Oh, I see!

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.620
Good boy, good boy! We're counting on you, okay?

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.780
Let's go.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.470
Wait!

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.180
What is this?

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.240
Wh-What's going on in here?

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.660
This is a two-story dorm, isn't it?

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.020
C-C-Calm down! It's a maisonette.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.280
No, it's not.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.670
It's the deployment of an
Innate Domain due to cursed energy.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.420
It's my first time seeing one this big.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.290
Where's the door?!

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.200
Huh?

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.240
Th-The door's gone!

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.400
How?! We just came in
through here, didn't we?!

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.560
What do we do?
Ah, what do we do about this?

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.290
It'll be fine.
What do we do?
Ah, what do we do about this?

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.500
The dog remembers the scent of the entrance.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.430
Oh, my!

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.660
Good boy! Have some jerky!

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.880
Have all the jerky you want!

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.340
You are <i>way</i> too calm!

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.670
You really are dependable, Fushiguro.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.520
Thanks to you, we'll be able to
rescue people and save ourselves, too.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:16.940
Let's keep moving.

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:49.690
Atrocious.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.820
That's... three people, right?

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.640
Okazaki Tadashi

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.350
Is Tadashi... Is my son Tadashi all right?!

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.810
Let's take this body back.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.200
Huh?

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.880
It's that woman's son.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:08.880
But...

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.620
His face isn't too badly mangled.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:15.270
His mother won't accept it if we tell
her he's dead, but we don't have a body.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.480
We have to find and verify two more.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.080
Leave that body behind.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.560
Quit joking around!

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.940
We turned around, and the way
we got in here was gone!

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.820
We won't be able to come back for it later!

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.850
I didn't say to come back for it!
I said to leave it behind!

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:34.190
I have no intention of risking my own life

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.460
to save someone I had no intention
of saving in the first place!

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.500
No intention of saving him?
What do you mean?!

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.860
This is a juvenile detention center.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:47.600
Jujutsu sorcerers are granted access to
all information about the scene beforehand.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.610
This Okazaki Tadashi

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.150
hit a little girl on her way home from
school while driving without a license.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.620
It was his second offense
of driving without a license.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:04.410
I know you're stuck on saving lots of people
and guiding them to proper deaths.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:09.820
But what are you going to do when someone
you saved kills someone else in the future?

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.600
Then why did you bother saving me?!

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.480
Cut it out!

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.800
Christ, what are you two doing?!

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.250
You're both idiots!

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:24.950
Think about the time and place if you—

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:28.700
Kugisaki?

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:31.580
No way! Demon Dogs should
have sensed the curse!

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.370
Itadori!

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.460
We're running!

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.100
We'll search for Kugisaki la—

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.900
There's no mistake.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:49.690
It's a special-grade.

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:50.810
I can't move.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.390
Move.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.590
Move! Move! Move! Move!

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.400
Help others.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.160
Itadori?

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:14.200
Huh?

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.900
Damn it, where am I?

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.910
It's so dark, I can't see a thing.

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:27.710
The curse's presence!

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:31.270
How can there be so many?!

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.120
Nue!

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.470
Don't die on me, Itadori and Kugisaki!

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:54.960
I can't escape after it's gotten this close!

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.600
Hey, Sukuna!

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.560
If I die, you die too, right?

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:02.000
If you don't want that, then help me out!

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.450
Nope!

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.960
Even if the parts of me inside you die,

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.480
there are eighteen other fragments of my soul.

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:15.350
Still, irritatingly enough,
I don't have control of this body.

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.650
If you want to switch, go ahead and switch.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:19.470
But once you do,

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:23.410
I'll kill that brat before the cursed spirit can!

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.630
Then I'll go for that woman!

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:28.800
She's a lively one. I'll have fun with her.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.480
I'm not going to let you do that.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.800
I bet.

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:37.610
But if you're too focused on me,
your friends are gonna die.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.320
It's not jujutsu.

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:50.010
He just unleashed pure cursed energy.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:54.620
Fushiguro!

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:56.150
Fushiguro!

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.130
Fushiguro!

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:01.480
Take Kugisaki and get out of here!

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:05.060
I'll keep this one busy
until you two are out.

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:08.320
As soon as you're out,
give me some kind of signal.

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:12.690
Once you do... I'll switch with Sukuna.

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:14.550
You know you can't do that!

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:16.610
Not with only one arm against a special-grade!

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:17.920
Look closer.

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:20.290
It's having fun.

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:22.950
It's obviously toying with us.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.430
I can at least buy us some time.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:26.880
No!

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.080
Fushiguro!

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:31.010
Please.

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:35.180
Demon Dogs!

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.300
Find Kugisaki!

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:46.230
This is my last one.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.460
I should've brought a lot more with me.

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:03.910
Trying to say it's easier to move
around in your underwear?

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:05.790
What do I do, though?

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:08.550
I have no clue how to use cursed energy.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.510
But for now, that's fine.

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:11.800
I just have to buy ti—

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.080
What was that? A cursed energy barrier?

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.930
Ow, ow, ow...

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:06.420
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts! Why am I...

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:10.830
If only I hadn't picked up
that finger back then...

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:13.200
If I hadn't eaten it...

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:14.800
If only...

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:16.360
If only...

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:18.130
Stop!

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.380
Don't think!

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:22.220
No! No!

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.470
I want to run! I want to run! I want to run!

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.740
I don't want to die!

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.870
If I died here...

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:31.370
If I actually died...

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.440
Would that be a proper death?!

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:41.790
Don't think!

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.280
Help others.

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:48.210
Have I...

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:50.790
gotten so weak?

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.960
I know your face now.

00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:59.150
I swear I'll curse you!

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.180
We're escaping, Kugisaki!

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.880
I hate frogs, you know.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.170
Yeah, well, sorry!

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:28.220
I was so full of myself.

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:31.440
I thought I was strong.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:36.180
I thought I was at least strong
enough to choose when I died.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.330
But I was wrong.

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:42.480
I'm weak!

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:46.490
I'm far too weak!

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:50.500
Augh, I don't want to die!

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.280
No! No way!

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:57.220
But... I <i>am</i> going to die!

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.620
A proper death?

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:02.830
Yeah, right! Don't be naïve!

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:06.630
Jujutsu sorcerers never die without regret.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:12.860
Still, I want to be able to say
my death was a proper one.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.770
The negative emotions of mankind
become the source of curses.

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:25.030
So all the hate, fear, regret...

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.320
Let it all out...

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.040
And put it in your fist!

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.110
Damn it!

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:51.380
That howl...

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:58.580
It's Fushiguro's signal.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:09.690
What a thoroughly annoying brat.

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:15.950
Jujutsu Kaisen

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:21.000
Jujutsu Kaisen

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.260
What a thoroughly annoying brat.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.570
He's obviously screwing with me.

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:34.950
Hold on a moment. I'm thinking right now.

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:38.850
What can I do to make that brat regret this?

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:45.660
If I went after him, the brat would
just switch back right beforehand.

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:49.250
So the thing that would cause
him the most trouble...

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.670
is probably this.

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:53.650
I'll put things back the way they were.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.770
Hey, let's go kill some kids.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:58.870
Follow me.

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:07.580
Idiot.

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:18.110
Ah, shit. I healed this one, too.

00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:21.710
You don't like walks?

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:26.510
Well, cursed spirits are usually
supposed to stay where they're born.

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:28.830
Fine, fine. In that case...

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.270
you die here!

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:36.700
Hey, what's the matter?

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.360
You're not finished already, are you?

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.860
That's it. Come on, try harder.

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:55.930
Even a cursed spirit

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:58.920
would miss their arm, right?

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.820
Please expand the evacuation
area to ten kilometers.

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:20.080
What about you?

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.490
I'm waiting here for Itadori to return.

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:24.590
I see.

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:29.950
After I take Kugisaki-san to the hospital,
I'll return as quickly as possible.

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:33.840
No, there wouldn't be much
point in you staying here.

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:35.980
If you want to do something,

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.460
please ask them to send over
a sorcerer grade 1 or higher.

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:41.800
Not that I imagine any are around.

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:44.820
I'll do what I can. Later.

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:56.030
If the worst case happens...

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.800
I don't want to let him die.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.130
They are.

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:01.530
Please do something about this.

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:06.090
...then it's my responsibility to end him.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.210
Hey, did you know?

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:16.210
We're both classified as
special-grade, apparently.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.220
Both you and me, man.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.920
Good job, special-grade.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.410
Keep trying.

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:41.880
You look happy.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.390
Want me to praise you?

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:50.790
But healing with cursed energy isn't that hard
for cursed spirits, unlike for humans.

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:55.390
Neither you nor this brat

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:58.720
really understand

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:01.510
what curses truly are.

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:04.720
This is a good opportunity,
so I'll show you...

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.980
what real jujutsu is.

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:11.910
Domain Expansion.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.300
Malevolent Shrine!

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:31.940
I was planning to cut you in three slices,

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:34.000
but you're really weak.

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:37.960
Oh, yeah, and then there's this.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.440
I'll be taking this.

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:52.000
It's over.

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:57.150
This sucks!

00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:59.210
If you're gonna switch, just do it already!

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:05.100
What's the matter, brat?

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.510
Juju Stroll

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.840
Yes, yes, understood.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.740
Thank you very much.

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:52.520
Yes.

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:54.720
Stare...

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:56.470
What's the matter?

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:59.030
You bow while on the phone.

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:07.030
I just get so wrapped up in creating the feeling
of "I'm on the phone!" while on a call...

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:08.240
I know what you mean.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:13.230
I've hurt my neck several times dealing
with ingrown hairs while depilating.

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:15.290
Of course, I've hurt my pores, too.

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:17.040
Is that really the same?

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:20.570
You're often irritated when
you're on the phone, Fushiguro.

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:23.700
That's because of Gojou-sensei,
not the phone.

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:27.320
You often wander around when
you're on the phone, Itadori.

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:28.690
Speaking of phones,

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:32.800
can you all stay on a call while holding
the phone against your shoulder?

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:54.990
Episode 5:
Curse Womb Must Die -II-
