00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.810
JUJUTSU KAISEN

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.480
Maki?

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.000
Episode 17: Kyoto Sister School Exchange Event - Group Battle 3 -
Maki?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.570
She's just a weakling.
Episode 17: Kyoto Sister School Exchange Event - Group Battle 3 -

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.360
She can't even see curses.
Episode 17: Kyoto Sister School Exchange Event - Group Battle 3 -

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.490
She's just a normal person
swinging around cursed tools.
Episode 17: Kyoto Sister School Exchange Event - Group Battle 3 -

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.910
She's just a normal person
swinging around cursed tools.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.040
She's forever a fourth-grade.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.710
Why is she even a jujutsu sorcerer at all?

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.980
Break's over.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.590
Okay.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.710
I see.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.180
That's a relief.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.260
Stupid Mai!

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.800
This woman is incredibly strong!

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.420
She's using a longer weapon,
so I'd like to close the distance,

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.460
but it's all I can do
to dodge and parry her!

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.360
If she were using the blade,

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.690
I would've died twice!

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.410
She's only fourth-grade?!

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.460
She could easily defeat
second-grade cursed spirits!

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.210
And how is she able to swing such a long sword
in this forest with so much stuff in the way?!

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.170
New Shadow Style: Simple Domain!

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.390
This allows me to attack anything that
enters the 2.21-meter radius of my domain

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.340
on full-auto reflex.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.660
It's released if my feet move from
the point they're at when it's activated.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.400
On top of that,

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.020
my Quick Draw is specialized
against enemies attacking head-on.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.430
It's the fastest technique of the
New Shadow School, wrapping my blade

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.300
in cursed energy while it's in
the sheath to accelerate it.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.560
But don't think this will settle the match.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.960
Focus my full strength
on creating an opening first.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.420
Iaijutsu, huh?

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.680
Looks like she has some trick, too.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.870
But there's a difference in our reach.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.130
Rather than hit me, she likely wants to knock
away my cursed tool and create an opening.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.760
In which case...

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.300
She broke it?!

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.440
She's throwing away her
reach advantage now?!

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.900
She threw it?!

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:34.480
A hidden weapon?!

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.360
Her intuition's sharp!

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.370
She's trying to close the gap with a decoy!

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.790
My legs moved!

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.830
But that's fine. I'll pull back and
draw her in just close enough, thenâ€”

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.440
Aikidou?! What a clever woman!

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:54.840
Huh?

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.920
Nice sword you've got here.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.250
Sword-stealing?

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.930
Give it back?

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.520
What an interesting girl.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.970
You should promote her
to second-grade already.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.400
I feel the same way,

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.820
but the Zenin clan keeps getting in the way.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.020
They should just change their
position and accept her already.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.100
I just can't understand such
restraints, aside from money.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.200
I see you're just as miserly as ever.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.540
More importantly, the footage showing
the area around Yuuji keeps cutting out a lot.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.860
Animals are fickle.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.290
Sharing my senses with them is tiring, too.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.590
Huh? Is that true?

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.170
Let's be blunt. Which side
are you on, Mei-san?

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.480
Which side?

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.630
I'm on money's side.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.440
There's no value to anything
that can't be traded for money.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.530
You can't make money out of it, after all.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.010
Just how much have you saved up?

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.190
I don't know what he's planning,

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.280
but it won't be that easy to
deal with Yuuji anymore.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.570
Oh, they're moving.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.030
All the cursed spirits released
into the area have charms on them,

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.370
and when the cursed spirit disappears,

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.290
<b>Curse
and when the cursed spirit disappears,</b>

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300
and when the cursed spirit disappears,

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.380
the corresponding charm here, in the viewing
area, is extinguished simultaneously.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.720
Each charm is extinguished
differently according to

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.130
the cursed energy registered beforehand.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.730
When the Tokyo school
exorcises one, they burn red.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.430
When the Kyoto school
exorcises one, they burn blue.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.400
Since Maki-san is in the match, any extinguished
by unregistered responses burn red, as well.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.870
One to one, huh?

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.590
No one's paying enough attention to the game.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.520
Why can't they just get along?

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.400
They must take after you, Utahime.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.990
You're the only one I have an issue with!

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.840
By the way, Panda-kun's
the one who exorcised it.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.750
Lucky!

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.580
Get down here, you damn witch!

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.000
I've come down a few times already.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.970
Hurry up and try to catch me, first-year!

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.540
Her cursed energy wind
is strong enough to lift me!

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.920
It hurts like hell when pebbles
and branches get caught in it, too!

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.340
If I drop my guard, it'll gouge my flesh!

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.030
How dare you hurt my precious face?

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.270
A scar on the face is a
badge of honor for a man.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.160
Though it's only a flaw on a woman.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.400
Huh?

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.990
You think being a jujutsu sorcerer
is all about strength, don't you?

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.750
And it actually is.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.200
That's only for men.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.040
Huh?

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:47.140
Even if they are strong, women have to
be cute, or they'll be undervalued.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:51.640
Of course, even if they're cute, they'll still
be undervalued if they're not also strong.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.390
Do you get it?

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.890
They don't demand strength
from female jujutsu sorcerers.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:59.440
They demand perfection!

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:01.840
And on top of that,

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.270
Mai-chan is also fighting against
even more outrageous demands.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:10.460
I get that you're a pain in the ass!

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.880
She's only a first-year, and she's
already used to fighting?

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.800
She's still going strong,
no matter how often I blast her.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:30.590
I'm used to getting knocked around.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.210
If I up my output any further,
I might kill her.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.130
No, that's just an excuse.

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.610
The main reason I can't attack her

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:41.000
is Inumaki-kun.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.160
Cursed speech uses the power of words.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.240
It imbues cursed energy into sound,

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.110
so you just have to protect your brain
and your ears with cursed energy.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:54.110
Cursed speech is a technique specialized
for use against cursed spirits.

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:59.750
Like I said before, it's nothing for a sorcerer
to be afraid of if you know it's coming.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:05.250
Conversely, if you don't know whether or not
it's coming, you're constantly distracted.

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:09.680
I'm not used to protecting the inside
of my head in the first place...

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.970
He's such a nuisance whether he's here or not!

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.560
All done with your lecture?!

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:22.010
Perfection is easy compared
to what's demanded of Mai-chan!

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:27.840
She's from the Zenin clan, one of the three major clans of elite jujutsu sorcerers.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.700
Perfection is expected
as a matter of course there.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.330
"Inherit the Zenin clan's
hereditary technique."

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:38.650
Any who don't meet that demand start their sorcerer lives as failures.

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:43.920
Among those, women aren't even
allowed to stand at the starting line.

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:47.820
Without the Zenin clan lineage,
they're not considered jujutsu sorcerers.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:51.140
And if they're not jujutsu sorcerers,
they're not considered people.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:56.510
She's lived her entire life with such scorn
in a family without a shred of affection.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:02.140
Can you imagine how much
Mai-chan and others suffered

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.270
just to obtain what we
enjoy as a matter of course?

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:10.820
Why don't you try thinking that
over with that brain of yours

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.480
that confuses curses for friends?

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:17.430
Shut up.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.520
You think misfortune is
a free pass to do anything?

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:22.860
What, then?

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.460
You're satisfied with those who are blessed
getting trash-talked behind their backs?

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.080
That's how Saori-chan...

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.640
I can't stand her,
regardless of her upbringing,

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:39.340
and I love Maki-san, who
endured the same upbringing.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:44.560
Have you all even bothered to
think about what kind of person

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:47.430
the idiot you're trying to curse is?

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:51.530
What makes us obligated to meet such
perfection or such absurd demands?

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:55.820
Is your entire life just a job?!

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:59.080
Straw Doll Technique: Hairpin!

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:08.420
This is why she kept shooting those
nails that didn't land any hits?!

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.050
Tsk!

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:28.520
You might have brought me down,
but you still won't reach me!

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.360
No, I reached you.

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.150
This is plenty!

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:37.900
My broom's bristle?

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:39.400
She grazed it just now?

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.370
I don't give a damn about
"men" this and "women" that!

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:46.380
You can keep that shit to yourselves!

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:49.840
I love myself when I'm pretty
and all dressed up!

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.920
And I love myself when I'm being strong!

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:54.640
I am...

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.480
Kugisaki Nobara!

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:03.350
I can't control my broom!

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:06.470
If I hit her with my hammer,
I might kill her.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:09.150
So...

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.110
A squeaky hammer?!

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.200
One more time!

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.590
Just barely within effective range.

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:38.010
I'm so glad it hit.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:43.010
JUJUTSU KAISEN

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.010
JUJUTSU KAISEN

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:50.970
Hello? Momo?

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:54.200
Don't worry, it was a rubber bullet.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.410
More importantly, that light
was Ultimate Cannon, right?

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:01.280
But I can't get in touch with Mechamaru.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.250
If he was cornered enough to use such
a powerful technique, and now this,

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:05.910
he most likely lost.

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:08.320
Panda will likely be returning.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.950
You should leave that spot and
support everyone from the air.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.690
We're all in trouble without you.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.070
Yeah.

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.510
Mai-chan, I...

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:21.850
It's all right, Momo. I know.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.920
Yeah.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:28.020
What, not going to call your friends?

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:31.810
I don't mind going two-on-one.

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:35.740
There are many ways to enjoy this, right?

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.530
I could have everyone beat you together,

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:40.710
but I'd like to enjoy you...

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:42.780
by myself.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.740
Call me "Onee-chan," little sister.

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:50.630
What do you think of Maki-san?

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:53.710
She'll be mad no matter how I answer!

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:57.250
I-I think she's a wonderful woman.

00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:00.270
Huh? I'm talking about as a sorcerer.

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:02.880
Oh, that? Good...

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:08.600
Honestly, I still don't know
that much about jujutsu,

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:11.400
but she's really strong in a fight.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.760
Maybe it's her balance? The way
she walks is scary on its own.

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:17.160
Maki-san's a fourth-grade.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.060
Huh? Seriously?

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:22.420
Her family's an annoying clan of sorcerers,

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:25.670
so after she kind of
emancipated herself and left,

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.000
they've been interfering with her promotion.

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:32.960
I thought families of jujutsu sorcerers
welcomed powerful sorcerers.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.030
They won't acknowledge what
they've already rejected,

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:37.500
because they're idiots.

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:40.620
But if she performs well
at the exchange event

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.440
and her name gets spread around,

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.380
it'll be harder for them to harass her like that.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:50.010
So let's start by winning the group battle!

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:52.970
Fight like you're going to die again!

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:54.100
Sure.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.810
I can hear you.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.340
Jeez.

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:03.070
I shouldn't let myself get distracted.

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:06.380
What are you smiling about?!

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.450
So what if she hides out of sight?

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:21.040
Is she an idiot, trying
to gain distance from me?

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:22.630
Tsk!

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.000
From below?!

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:29.260
I already knew.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:33.770
Maki has a talent I don't.

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:37.970
Have you heard about Ougi's daughters?

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:41.490
One can't even see curses,
let alone use techniques.

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:43.770
Twins are a sign of ill fortune.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.870
This might actually be a good thing.

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:49.930
I couldn't bear to see
an eldest son as a servant.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:55.880
Mai.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.370
What's the matter? Hurry up.

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.670
No.

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:04.190
What is it?

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:06.770
We'll get in trouble if we're late again.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.380
They're there.

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:13.400
Again?

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.270
All right, fine.

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:20.080
Are you ho... ho...

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:20.770
Come on.
Are you ho... ho...

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:21.200
Are you ho... ho...

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.780
Close your eyes.
Are you ho... ho...

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:23.280
Huh?
Are you ho... ho...

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.320
If you can't see them,
it's the same as if they're not there.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:36.280
You've always acted like you had no fear

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:40.060
and plowed forward toward your future.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:42.530
I hated you.

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:47.130
You're leaving the clan, Maki?

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.920
You have plenty of servants, right?

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:54.600
Don't worry, though. I'll come
back someday, Clan Leader.

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:57.940
Why would you return?

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.980
Because I'm going to be
the head of the Zenin clan!

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:09.400
Then I'll put you through
ordeals befitting that!

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:12.700
Do as you please.

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:15.290
And Mai, as well.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.360
She has nothing to do with this.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:30.960
Liar.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.520
I hate you!

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.070
You fired six shots!

00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:25.270
I won't let you reload!

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:30.240
I hate you!

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:32.730
Which is why

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:38.670
I never told you about my first love

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:43.100
or my technique!

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:50.090
"Construction" uses one's cursed energy
to create matter from nothing.

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:52.380
It differs from the manifestation

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:56.000
of an innate domain within the
barrier of a domain expansion.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.080
The matter produced by Construction doesn't
disappear when the cursed technique ends.

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:05.980
Because of that, it consumes
a lot of cursed energy

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:07.970
and puts a heavy strain on the body.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:12.140
Creating one bullet a day is Mai's maximum.

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:18.130
That's why she uses a revolver to create
an obvious bluff of her bullet count.

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:22.160
I win.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.310
She caught the bullet?

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:33.550
Ow...

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.600
I shouldn't touch that with my bare hands.

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:45.310
Maki has a talent I don't.

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:48.210
She's similar to Mechamaru,

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.510
with a Heavenly Pact that's
somewhat the opposite.

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.440
Normally, she would have been
born with a cursed technique.

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.600
But in exchange for that,

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.880
she was granted superhuman
physical abilities.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.080
The Zenin clan wouldn't acknowledge it.

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:08.780
That talent I lacked.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:13.050
I think we can call this settled?

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:18.300
Why did you leave the clan?

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:21.160
Huh? Do I have to spell it out?

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.050
You joined Jujutsu Tech
yourself, didn't you?

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:24.060
I...

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:27.340
never wanted to be a jujutsu sorcerer!

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:30.170
It's your fault!

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:31.930
Because you tried so hard to be one,

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:34.190
I was forced to put forth effort, too!

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:39.110
I'm so sick of trying so hard,
facing pain and scary things!

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.920
What was so bad about being
ordered around back home?!

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:46.940
We could have just done a few
chores and lived a normal life!

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:54.480
Why wouldn't you stay at
the bottom with me?

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:06.280
Because I would have
hated myself if I did that.

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:08.240
That's the only reason.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:11.170
Sorry.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.520
Onee-chan, don't let go!

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.140
I won't let go.

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:21.400
Never?

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.730
Jeez, give it a rest.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:26.900
Never leave me behind.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.480
Of course I won't.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.540
We're sisters.

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:37.630
You liar.

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:40.640
I hate you.

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:17.520
Juju Stroll

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:27.020
I'm hungry.

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:32.790
If I recall, the edamame I had left over
from lunch was in the fridge...

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.430
Sorry.

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:49.920
Please look at least a little guilty!

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.810
Here, have this and forgive me.

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:56.680
No, I'm not interested
in late-night cup ramen.

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:00.690
How about this?!

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.690
Nishimiya-style Seafood Cup Ramen arrangement!

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:07.150
One: use scissors to chop up hot chili peppers

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:08.840
into the seafood cup ramen!

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:13.230
Two: fill the container halfway with milk.

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:16.410
Three: add hot water up to the line inside!

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:19.640
Since we're using milk,
make sure the water's boiling hot!

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:25.960
I-It's good!

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.650
This is really good!

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:29.820
Right?

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.960
Maybe I'll try it next time, too.

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:35.930
You could've just eaten
this if it's so good.

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:42.300
Well, you still pay for late-night
cup ramen the next day.

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:44.390
Uh-huh.

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:54.990
Episode 18:
Sage
