WEBVTT

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.610
We're starting in one minute.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.910
Now, let's hear a few words of well-appreciated
encouragement from Iori Utahime-sensei.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:17.740
Huh?!

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.620
U-Uh...

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.460
Um, some degree of injury will be unavoidable,

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.130
but, um... now and then, help
each other out... or something...

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.630
Time's up.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.630
Hey! Gojou, you little...

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.300
Now, let the sister school exchange event...

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.600
begin!

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.560
Respect your seniors!

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.230
Ichiro?!

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.900
So stupid.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.980
Where's Toudou?

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.940
What makes you think I would know?

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.530
Can't we all get along?

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.500
Where do you think
the cursed spirit boss is?

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.590
It was probably unleashed
halfway between both schools,

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.960
but it's not just going to sit still.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.880
At the time we agreed upon,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.590
we'll split up into the Megumi squad
and the Panda squad for scouting.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.970
We'll be counting on you after that, Yuuji.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:20.800
Yeah!

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.900
Where are you going?

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.520
That's small fry.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.700
Senpai, stop!

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.120
Great! You're all here!

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.380
Come at me all together!

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.260
Scatter!

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.600
Toudou was alone.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.890
We were right to swap Yuuji into that role.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.520
I already knew it, but he's a monster.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.400
Yup.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.150
So just ignore him.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.400
Tuna.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.830
JUJUTSU KAISEN

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.920
Before the Exchange Event Started

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.050
Toudou will absolutely be
out to crush us straight away.
Before the Exchange Event Started

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.310
Mai might follow behind him
to come after me, too.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.230
Toudou's a monster.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.150
The worst possible outcome would be
that we all face him and get wiped out.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.570
So our plan was to leave just one person,

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.530
either Panda or Megumi,
behind to occupy him, but...

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.450
Itadori, we'll leave that role to you.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.290
We'd rather not lose anyone
who can scout out our enemies.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.540
You don't have to beat him.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.380
Just hold out as long as
possible and buy us time.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.420
But you can be daring against him!

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.300
To be blunt, we weren't counting
on your abilities anyway,

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.470
so it won't affect us too
much if you have to quit.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.720
That's mean!

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.180
Sorry, Megumi.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.600
You wanted to face Toudou, didn't you?

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.390
No, I'm good either way.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.980
You're super dry.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.440
But Senpai, if I'm gonna do this,

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.490
then I'm gonna win.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.200
Nice speed.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.080
Seriously?

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.160
I thought I landed a good one.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.170
I'll return the favor, first-year.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.960
Guard like your life depends on it!

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.760
Where?

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.570
My arm's... still here?

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.740
I thought it got blown off.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.820
If that cursed spirit
hadn't gotten in the way,

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.490
that would have been real bad.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.610
Done already?

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.910
Now, which should I pursue?

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.670
Are you for real?

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.890
You think you can just pound
away at my head like that?!

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.720
What if you made me even
dumber than I already am?!

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.520
Don't worry.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.440
Takada-chan said, "Men are perfect
when they're a little dumb."

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.150
Who's that?

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.400
I'm not interested in any idols.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.160
Then how did you know she's an idol?

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.070
You know who she is, don't you?

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.200
What's your name, first-year?

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.700
Itadori Yuuji.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.290
I see. Itadori Yuuji.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.710
I have one question for you.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.710
What kind of woman is your type?

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:28.460
Huh?

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.380
What's my type?

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.390
Why are you asking me that right now?

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.220
Don't worry about that.
I'm just appraising you.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.730
I don't really get it, but if I had to say...

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.820
A tall woman with a big ass, I guess?

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.070
Like Jennifer Lawrence.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.170
The new series is pretty good.

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:12.900
Oh?

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:31.610
I'm going to confess to Takada-chan.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.900
Huh?! Don't do that!

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.990
I don't wanna have to comfort you later!

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:37.490
That's such a pain!

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.040
Why are you assuming she'll reject me?

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:46.040
I could ask you why you
think she'll say yes.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.090
Anne Sullivan once said to Helen Keller,

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:54.260
"What fool thinks of defeat
before even trying?"

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.050
Inoki was the one who said that.

00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:59.300
I'm sorry.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.560
I'm already in love with someone.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:22.080
Any chance that someone is me?

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.500
No way, man.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.040
Come on, let's go.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.960
I'll treat you to some ramen.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:53.230
You never lost to anyone
in your hometown, huh?

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:59.870
Seems like we're best friends!

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.910
When you just learned my name?!

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.750
Yeah, continue straight that way.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.330
Toudou-kun's there, though.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.960
Not a problem.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.290
He's the one who told us to do as we pleased.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.010
New Shadow Style, Simple Domain:

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:25.560
Quick Draw!

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:32.770
What reflexes!

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:36.570
I know I hesitated, but still,
my counter didn't even scratch him!

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.870
I'm surrounded?

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:45.340
Wait...

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.370
Are these guys...

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.840
trying to kill me?

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:01.390
This is...

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.260
Itadori and I switched places?!

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:07.930
Hey.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.520
I told you I'd kill you if
you interfered, didn't I?

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:15.570
No, you didn't.

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:18.530
You said you'd kill us if
we ordered you around.

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:20.570
Was that Itadori's...

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:23.280
No, it was Toudou's technique?

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:26.330
Same thing. Piss off!

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:35.170
Looks like he's retreating.

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:36.590
Lame.

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:38.080
Thank goodness!

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.590
Make sure you kill him.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.590
That depends on Itadori.

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:45.470
Don't order me around.

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:47.260
What's with these people,

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.980
trying to kill me and then
arguing with each other?

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:57.110
After all, I'm not an inconsiderate man
who'd hold back against his best friend!

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:08.080
This is why I said to leave him be.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.290
We're off to a rocky start.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:15.210
We can't start hunting down cursed spirits
without me scouting from the air, either.

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.760
They're all such a hassle.

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:21.720
Hang in there, me.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.130
You're as cute as ever today.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.430
Take her down.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.260
Oh, no.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.560
Mai, Mechamaru, cover Nishimiya.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.390
At once.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:36.280
Well, we <i>are</i> in trouble without her.

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:50.950
Kamo-san, are you guys

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.580
planning to kill Itadori?

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:02.970
JUJUTSU KAISEN

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:07.970
JUJUTSU KAISEN

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:12.620
That's strange.

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:13.600
It is strange.

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:16.900
All the Kyoto students are moving together.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.110
Toward the area we left Yuuji in.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.690
I think that puts everyone from Kyoto there?

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:26.320
You mean that's where the target is?

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.910
No, unless the second-grade
is especially cunning,

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.450
my Demon Dog would have noticed it.

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:37.000
They're trying to kill Itadori, aren't they?

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:39.880
What the hell?! I don't see why!

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:45.590
It's possible.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.380
Kelp.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.390
I didn't sense that much hostility from them,

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.810
but that was prior to Yuuji's surprise survival.

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:01.420
It's entirely possible that
Principal Gakuganji would order that.

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:07.400
Are the Kyoto students a bunch of cowards
who'd kill a person on someone else's orders?

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.780
They don't see him the same way.

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:13.410
You two have spent day after day with Yuuji.

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:17.210
We only recently learned that
he's a good person ourselves.

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:20.040
He's a naturally happy sort you
don't often see among sorcerers.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.420
But the thing is...

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.920
To those who don't know
anything about Yuuji,

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:29.430
the vessel of Sukuna
is just an object of fear.

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:33.430
It wouldn't feel any different
from exorcising a curse to them.

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:39.440
Even normal jujutsu sorcerers
can easily blur that line.

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:44.690
We're turning back, Megumi.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.780
Sorry.

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.860
What are you apologizing for, dummy?

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:53.700
There's no point in winning or losing
the exchange event if your friend dies.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:59.620
Nobara and I will go back
to confirm that Yuuji's safe.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.830
He's not answering his phone, either.

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:05.340
Toge, you keep hunting down
the cursed spirit, please.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.170
Bonito flakes.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:09.970
I know you're worried about Yuuji, too.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:13.100
But if my prediction is correct,

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:15.600
the Kyoto students are trying

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:19.480
to use the chaos of the group
battle to assassinate Yuuji.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.130
Once the group battle's over,
there won't be any assassination.

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:24.320
Makes sense.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.480
Salmon.

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:27.570
I'm worried about Maki, too.

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:29.320
We won't let them kill Yuuji,

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.110
and we'll win this group battle.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:32.910
Of course.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.120
Answer on the first ring, Fushiguro!

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:45.840
Also, why didn't they provide us with
wireless radios or Bluetooth earbuds?!

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.130
I wouldn't want them.

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:51.010
They're distracting, and they startle
you when you get a call.

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:53.470
You can take them off during combat!

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.140
Ow...

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.520
So that's Fushiguro-kun's Nue, huh?

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:06.900
Electrified wings.

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.570
Looks like they'll affect
my movement for a while.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:17.080
Nishimiya-chan!

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:20.580
Come and play!

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:22.460
So crass!

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:23.830
Not cute at all.

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:28.300
Kamo-san, are you guys
planning to kill Itadori?

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:32.300
And if I said we were?

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.280
You failed, then.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.810
Itadori wouldn't go down in such a short time.

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:43.730
We have no reason to kill him.

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:45.900
Yes, you do.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:48.520
The higher-ups and the three
major clans have plenty.

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:22.520
What splendid toughness!

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.560
He's actively using the landscape
to his advantage, too!

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:28.110
He's gone?

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:33.650
He's also quick to set up his next move!

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.670
And to top it off...

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:48.130
He has such tremendous power!

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:51.590
His raw strength is greater than mine,
despite his small body!

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:54.630
Which is why his blows are effective
with so little cursed energy!

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:59.640
And that makes it hard to read his movements
from the flow of cursed energy!

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:03.220
But the way this cursed
energy hits after a time lag...

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:06.060
That's just... That's just...

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:10.860
...wrong!

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.520
...wrong!

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.070
...wrong!
...wrong!

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.150
...wrong!

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:15.650
...wrong!
...wrong!

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:15.860
...wrong!

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.320
...wrong!
...wrong!

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:17.570
...wrong!

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:18.990
...wrong!
...wrong!

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:20.700
...wrong!

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.160
Was that Toudou?

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:27.160
It was.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:32.340
I think I understand why you
failed to finish off Yuuji.

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:36.720
So why did you distance
yourself from Noritoshi?

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:39.760
Are you keeping your technique
a secret from your allies, too?

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:47.390
I'm sorry about Itadori-kun.

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:51.270
I know this is an excuse,
but I'm not like the others.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:56.400
Still, that doesn't mean I plan to hand
over victory in this exchange event.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:01.780
You know that sorcerers advance in rank
through a recommendation system, right?

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:07.120
The exchange event is often discussed among
sorcerers without connections up the chain.

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:09.920
Students who perform well here

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:13.790
are granted many chances to
advance while they're studying.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:19.050
Coincidentally, the person in charge
of a student can't recommend them.

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:24.300
For example, Gojou-san couldn't
recommend Itadori-kun to be a first-grade.

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:29.310
I want to become independent as
quickly as possible so I can earn money.

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:34.770
Why?

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.190
I'm poor!

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:40.820
And I have two little brothers!

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.700
Are you okay?

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.910
Are you getting along well enough with Mai?

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:46.540
Aren't you too nice a person?

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:49.290
Huh? Probably...

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.670
I won't hold back, you know.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.460
Not a problem!

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.170
That's not what I said all that for, anyway!

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:02.010
My friend!

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:04.510
That cursed energy you
blast with a time lag...

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:06.890
That's a bad habit of yours!

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:08.680
You mean Divergent Fist?

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.850
What's he on about all of a sudden?

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:17.440
So long as you're satisfied with that,
you'll never beat me!

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.900
If you're satisfied with
staying on that level,

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:24.070
you and I won't stay best friends.

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:26.330
Are you okay with that?!

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:29.450
I don't know. I don't care about that.

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:31.790
Are you okay with staying weak?

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.500
No, I'm not!

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:40.880
That's right!

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:44.550
My best friend!

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:17.480
Juju Stroll

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:21.730
<b>Q: What kind of person is your type?</b>

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.990
Someone who's stronger
than me, at the very least.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:30.240
Huh? What makes you think I'll answer?

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:33.750
I totally can't stand a UBSSD.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.780
Do you know who Sebastian Stan is?

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:41.170
He has a great body.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:47.570
Well, you know, I like
hot guys, like most girls,

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:50.840
but I want someone fun to be around, too,

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:57.560
and it's important whether or not he can
make you feel like he's the only one for you.

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:02.720
Oh, gosh, how embarrassing!

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:07.020
Uh, you know, uh, um...

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:08.860
Wh-What was it?

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:10.690
Um...

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:11.860
Um, um, um...

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:13.380
You know, that girl who seemed nice.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:14.540
The one who seemed nice.

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.340
With the notable bangs.

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:18.580
Come on, come on, you know! That one girl!

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:23.470
Nice girl, nice girl, nice girl...

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:42.240
Oh, Miwa?

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.700
Yeah! Her, her, her, her, her!

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:56.340
