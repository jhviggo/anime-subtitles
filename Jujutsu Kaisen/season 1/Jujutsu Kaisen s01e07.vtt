WEBVTT

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.050
We have a bit of time before your
appointment with the principal.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.650
Did you want to stop anywhere?

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:09.680
It's fine.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.900
I'll show up early for a change.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.930
Stop the car.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.660
Huh? Right here?

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.730
Go on ahead.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.840
Huh? A-Are you testing me?

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.280
You're not going to hit me if
I actually go on ahead, are you?

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.150
Just what do you think I am?

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.680
In that case...

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.540
Now...

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.040
Who are you?

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.570
That was easier than I expected.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.220
Who are you...

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.140
calling easy?

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.700
Brat.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.000
He's a cursed spirit, but he
can communicate clearly.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.880
And the sheer amount of cursed energy...

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.770
An unregistered special-grade?

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.950
He's likely stronger than Sukuna currently is.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.190
Special-grades are classified
as such because they're special.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.810
Having them pop up this frequently
throws everything off.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.720
Did I wound your pride?

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.490
Nope.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.700
I'm starting to find this fun.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.990
Jujutsu Kaisen

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.730
Episode 7:  Assault

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.760
Finding this fun, you say?
Episode 7:  Assault

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.020
Episode 7:  Assault

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.640
No sense of danger at all.
Episode 7:  Assault

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.260
No sense of danger at all.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.720
He chose a place devoid of people?

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.090
No, he was avoiding other
sorcerers coming to back me up.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.010
Ember Insects!

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.440
Well, if you're coming
after me, you're right...

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.350
about having no sense of danger.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.060
What happens if this hits me?

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.860
Sound?

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.930
A two-stage attack of sound and explosions?

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.990
That's clever.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.190
There's more!

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.120
That's all it took?

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.840
I took a look for myself, and it was
just an overestimation by the weak.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.070
That human was just as fragile as the rest.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.530
He wasn't living a life of truth.
It's all so nauseatingly repulsive.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.420
I'm going to go spread real strength,
the truth, through death.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.180
We just went over this a moment ago.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.960
Can't you even learn? Ugh, this smoke...

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.920
What's the meaning of this?

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.900
To put it simply, you didn't hit me.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.820
Impossible. That wasn't like before.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.350
I know I touched you and killed you.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.350
You touched the "Infinity" that
exists between you and me.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.850
I'll show you.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:36.870
Put your hand out.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.360
Come on, come on.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.850
Come on, come on, come on.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.480
No hostility? I guess I'll see what it's about.

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:56.640
See?

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.400
I can't touch him?

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.970
It stops just before him.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.930
This is Infinity?

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.920
You're not exactly stopped,
but the closer you get, the slower you go.

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.400
So, what now?

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.360
We could just shake
hands like this, you know.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.860
I refuse.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.860
Don't be shy, now.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.540
You're making me embarrassed, too.

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:26.780
Damn you!

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.890
He's fast!

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.810
It's not just a blow
strengthened by cursed energy!

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.620
What is this?!

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.730
I don't get it!

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:40.050
I have to know!

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.450
There's still more!

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.460
Infinity exists everywhere.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.960
My jujutsu just brings it forward in reality.

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:57.840
Convergence, divergence...

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.980
What do you think happens
when one touchs this void?

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.900
Cursed Technique Reversal: Red.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.420
Oh, this is perfect.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:56.660
You can try,

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.180
but you'll die, Jougo.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.390
It wasn't just talk.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:17.480
No matter. If I can't hit him,
I'll just drag him into my Domain.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.980
Where did he go?

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:23.600
Sorry about that.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.880
Where the heck?! Hey, where are we?!

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:28.640
Were you waiting?

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.990
That's...

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:32.700
Sukuna's vessel?!

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.900
This is Itadori Yuuji-kun,
and he's here to watch.

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.160
Mt. Fuji! His head's Mt. Fuji!

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:48.470
I'll protect you.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.430
I'll never leave you.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.620
Sam...

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:02.320
Wow, he learns surprisingly quick.

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:03.900
Come on.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:04.610
Yuuji.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.230
Gojou-sensei?

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:11.240
Talking to him doesn't
cause a problem, either.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:12.800
You need something?

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.700
Looks like we'll be able to increase his output
quickly and move on to the next stage soon.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.630
We're heading out, Yuuji.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:19.460
Huh?

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.090
It's an extracurricular lesson.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:27.190
I'm going to teach you about the pinnacle
of jujutsu battles, Domain Expansion.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.880
Why aren't we sinking?!

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:39.660
Sensei, I was at the school
just ten seconds ago, right?

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:40.810
What's going on here?

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:42.160
Oh, we warped here.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.370
He has no intention of explaining.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:44.320
Sukuna's vessel...
He has no intention of explaining.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.060
Sukuna's vessel...

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.140
So he really is alive.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.830
You have to render Gojou
Satoru incapable of fighting.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:55.970
The second is to get Ryoumen Sukuna
and Itadori Yuuji on your side.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.390
I can't kill Itadori due to our future plans...

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:04.550
Has he caught on to our goals?

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.440
What's the brat for? He a shield?

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.610
A shield? No, no.

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:11.920
I told you, he's here to watch.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.460
I'm in the middle of teaching
this boy lots of things.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.550
Don't worry about him. Just keep fighting.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.920
Bringing in someone who will slow
you down just makes you a fool.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.360
It'll be fine. After all...

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.150
you're weak.

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.870
Don't underestimate me, brat!

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:41.610
I'm going to enjoy swallowing
up that smug face of yours!

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.200
This guy...

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:51.310
is weak?

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:58.910
He's way more monstrous than any of
the monsters I've encountered so far!

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.290
You'll be fine.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.730
Just stay close to me.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.970
Domain Expansion!

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:41.740
Wh-What is this?!

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:45.200
Coffin of the Iron Mountain!

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.930
Jujutsu Kaisen

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.940
Jujutsu Kaisen

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.670
Wh-What is this?!

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:07.260
This is Domain Expansion.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:10.130
You use cursed energy to
construct an Innate Domain

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:11.060
Ow, hot!
You use cursed energy to
construct an Innate Domain

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:11.730
Hot, hot, hot!
You use cursed energy to
construct an Innate Domain

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:11.830
imbued with a cursed technique
in your surroundings.
Hot, hot, hot!

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:13.980
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!
imbued with a cursed technique
in your surroundings.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:14.030
imbued with a cursed technique
in your surroundings.

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:18.960
What you all experienced at
the juvenile detention center

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.430
was an incomplete Domain that hadn't
been imbued with any cursed techniques.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.280
If that had been a proper Domain,
all of you first-years would have died.

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:28.560
I think Megumi understood that.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:34.250
Spreading out a Domain
consumes a ton of energy,

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:36.410
but its merits are worth the cost.

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:40.080
One such benefit is the boost to
stats due to environmental factors.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:40.810
Oh!

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:43.730
Like buffs in video games!

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:46.240
Another is...

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:54.750
Most sorcerers would have burned to ash
the moment they entered my Domain!

00:12:55.400 --> 00:13:00.800
...that the techniques imbued in the Domain
are guaranteed to hit within that Domain.

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:02.390
Guaranteed?!

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:03.760
Guaranteed.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.440
But don't worry. There are
several ways to deal with it.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.770
You can take the hit using a
cursed technique, like just now, or...

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.840
I don't really recommend this one,

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.910
but you can go outside the Domain.
That's usually impossible.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.180
You can also...

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:25.550
If I neutralize that Infinity
of yours with a dense Domain,

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:27.610
then my techniques will reach you.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.370
Yeah, they'll hit.

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:30.370
Huh? Infinity?

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.420
Give me the Prison Realm!

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.190
I'll add it to my collection.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.750
I came here half in jest.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:45.130
I thought I wouldn't care if I couldn't kill him.

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:48.680
But having this difference
between us thrust in my face...

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.760
On my pride as a cursed spirit,

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:56.070
as the new humanity,
this is completely unacceptable!

00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:59.990
The most effective way to deal with a Domain

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:02.830
is to lay out your own Domain.

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:05.580
When two Domains are
laid out at the same time,

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:09.590
the more refined one
will dominate that space.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:13.580
Though, sometimes, compatibility and
the amount of cursed energy are factors.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:19.040
There won't even be ashes
left of you, Gojou Satoru!

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.140
Domain Expansion:

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:32.100
Infinite Void.

00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:58.310
What just happened?

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:02.470
Was my Domain overwhelmed?

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:04.790
I can't see anything.

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:06.230
I can't feel anything.

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:09.240
No...

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.570
I can see everything!

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:12.880
I can feel everything!

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.910
But the information is never complete...

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:20.650
So I can't do anything!

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:25.070
This is the inner world of Limitless.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.150
Perception, communication...

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:33.460
Every action involved in living is forcibly
carried out an infinite number of times.

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:36.730
It's ironic, isn't it?

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:40.480
When granted everything,
you can't do anything...

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:42.960
but just die peacefully.

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.430
But I have questions I want to ask you,

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:49.860
so I'm letting you off the hook with this.

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:09.730
Now, who told you to come after me?

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:12.960
He really is the strongest jujutsu sorcerer!

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:14.740
As a living organism,

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.090
he's on another level!

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:21.710
Oh, dear.

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.000
What now?

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:25.650
Will you rescue him?

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:33.370
I can't let people from the school see
my face, so I'll be going home now.

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:38.410
If you want to save him,
go ahead and save him.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.670
Though I don't know if your
kind have such emotions.

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:47.520
We do. We're the true humans, after all.

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:53.210
Quite the statement for
a cursed spirit to make.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.390
You don't seem like the type to act on orders.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:02.850
Was something good supposed
to happen if you killed me?

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:06.080
Regardless, I want to know. Who was it?

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:09.190
Come on, just tell me already.

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:13.050
Like I'd ever tell you, brat!

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.760
You sure you should be saying that?

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:19.050
Damn you!

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:22.480
Hurry up and tell me, or I'll exorcise you.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.080
Of course, I'll do that either way.

00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:27.530
Wait, curses are capable
of holding conversations?

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:29.680
It seemed so normal, I overlooked it.

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:38.470
Wow!

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:39.230
Flowers!

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:40.160
Pretty!

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.800
That is<i> a curse, right?
It's stripping away my will to fight.</i>

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.780
Sensei, I'll be fine!

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:57.910
Go after him!

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:01.230
Sorry, I lied! Help!

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.030
Wow.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:09.790
He got away.

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:12.030
He's good at hiding his presence.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:16.250
He's way creepier than Volcano Head.

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:21.120
I'm sorry about that.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:21.450
So cursed spirits of that level
are forming a faction now?
I'm sorry about that.

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:23.950
They managed to escape because of me.
So cursed spirits of that level
are forming a faction now?

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:24.420
Though you're the one
who brought me here, right?
So cursed spirits of that level

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.250
This is getting interesting.

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:26.260

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:27.780
Yuuji.

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:32.620
I want you—or rather, everyone—
to become strong enough to beat that.

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:35.180
Huh? Beat <i>that</i>?

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.020
It's better to have a concrete goal, right?

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:41.010
Man, I'm glad brought you here.

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:43.960
I had no idea what was going on, though.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.200
Are you serious?

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:49.500
Now that we've set your goal,
all that's left is to pursue it.

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.610
We'll speed up the schedule a bit.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:56.200
For the next month, you'll be
watching movies and fighting me.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.630
Fighting you?!

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.720
Will I still be alive a month from now?

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.810
After that, it's practical combat.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:06.580
You'll take on and complete
several harder missions.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.070
You'll learn the basics
and how to apply them,

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:12.690
and then you'll show them off
at the exchange event.

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:14.000
Hey, Sensei!

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.630
Yes, Yuuji-kun?

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.630
What's the exchange event?

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:21.770
I didn't tell you?

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:31.320
He's late!

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.800
Sure is peaceful here.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.250
How's Jougo doing, Getou?

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.500
On death's door.

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:13.040
Hanami stepped in to save him,

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.720
so he'll probably be fine.

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:16.740
How irresponsible.

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.450
You're the one who egged him on.

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:20.390
Heavens, no.

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:22.080
I tried to stop him.

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:27.660
Speak of the devil.

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:29.890
Jougo, Hanami.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.910
Glad to see you're safe.

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:35.930
How can you say that when you see me like this?!

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.180
You're lucky you got off with just that.

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:43.440
Why, you...

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.890
I think you understand now...

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:49.270
So we'll go about sealing Gojou Satoru
at the appropriate time,

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:53.380
in the appropriate place, once we've secured our advantage over him.

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:57.010
We'll carry it out on October 31st in Shibuya.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.410
I'll contact you with more details later.

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:02.320
Good enough, Mahito?

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.530
<b>Cloud Giant</b>

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.160
No objections here.

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:08.250
Let's be cunning about this.

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:10.240
Like curses should.

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:12.320
Like humans should.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:47.470
Juju Stroll

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:51.080
One, two, three, four...

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:52.450
What are you doing?

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:53.610
Brazilian calisthenics.

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:54.480
Three, four...

00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:56.900
I think we're nice and warmed up now.

00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:57.890
Yeah.

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:02.280
What are you two planning to do?

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:13.750
Getou-kun!

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:15.570
Shoot!

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:22.400
Mahito-kun!

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.540
Overhead!

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:31.610
Shoot!

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:44.710
I'm gonna kill these two later!
