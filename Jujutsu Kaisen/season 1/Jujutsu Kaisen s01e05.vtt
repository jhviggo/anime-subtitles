00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.320
This sucks!

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.410
If you're gonna switch, just do it already!

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.130
What's the matter, brat?

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.430
The Innate Domain's closed off!

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.880
The special-grade is dead!

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.330
Now we just need Itadori to return safely...

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.640
Sorry, but he's not coming back.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.860
Don't be so frightened.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.050
I'm in a great mood right now.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.360
Let's chat for a bit.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.600
This is what he gets for trying to
use me without any kind of pact.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.560
Feels like he's having some
trouble switching back.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.720
Still, though...

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.570
It's only a matter of time.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.350
So...

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.670
I thought about what I can do right now.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.810
Wh-What are you...

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.350
I'm taking this brat hostage.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.580
Hostage?!

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.320
Yeah.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.040
I can live without this,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.800
but that ain't true for the brat.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.980
Switching out with me means he dies.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.240
Also...

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.080
For good measure.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.670
Sukuna's finger!

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.090
That special-grade cursed spirit
in there must have consumed it!

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.330
With that, I'm free as a bird.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.060
You can be frightened now.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.270
I'll kill you!

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.720
For no particular reason.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.340
Our positions are reversed now.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.000
Jujutsu Kaisen

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.840
Episode 5:  Curse Womb Must Die -II-

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.550
The only thing granted equally
to all is an unfair reality.
Episode 5:  Curse Womb Must Die -II-

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:01.520
The only thing granted equally
to all is an unfair reality.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.090
You just don't get it.

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.490
He's...

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.810
Itadori's coming back.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.480
Even if that means he'll die.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.440
That's just who he is.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.450
You give him too much credit.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.550
This guy's just a little tougher
and denser than other humans.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.170
Just a moment ago, he was scared out
of his mind, on the verge of death,

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.840
and prattling on about his
regrets and all that nonsense.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:44.590
I know for a fact he doesn't
have the guts to kill himself.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.510
His arm is restored!

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.770
Healing...

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.950
He can use Reverse Cursed Techniques.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.910
Sukuna's incarnated.

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.410
Even if he can live without a heart,
it should still be damaging to him.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.730
I'll make him heal his heart
before Itadori returns.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.270
I just have to make him believe he can't
beat me without a heart in his body!

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.920
Can I do that...

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.670
when I couldn't even move with
that special-grade in front of me?

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.850
It's not about whether I can.

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:28.760
I have to do it!

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.410
I'm finally outside, after all.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.060
Let's use the open space.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.720
Interesting.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.550
You use Shikigami,

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.120
but you'll still come at me yourself?

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.470
More.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:02.720
More.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.340
More!

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.030
Put more curse behind it

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.180
when you strike me!

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:19.060
Orochi!

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:26.200
Gang up on him!

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.840
Hey, what did I just say?

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.650
Let's use the open space!

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.330
It's not even a matter of jujutsu.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:11.840
His power

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.330
and his agility

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:14.550
are on a different scale.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.210
Nice technique there.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.360
What do I do?

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.990
I used up one of my shikigami
to escape that Innate Domain.

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:38.320
Demon Dog White and
Orochi are both destroyed...

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.880
And Nue's at his limit, too.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.030
I should release him
before he gets destroyed.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.120
I get it now.

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:55.180
So your shikigami are created from shadows.

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:58.370
It makes no difference if he knows that now.

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:00.190
So what?

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:01.680
Hmm...

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.040
It's not the generic technique
that uses charms.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.840
It's adaptable, too.

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:08.980
I don't get it, though.

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:12.970
Why did you run back then?

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:18.230
What a waste of talent.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.690
Whatever.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.830
Either way, that won't be enough to fix this.

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.390
He's figured it out, huh?

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:29.390
You're risking your life over stupid shit.

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:32.530
This brat isn't even worth that much.

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.990
<i>Then why did you bother saving me?!</i>

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:46.480
The only thing granted equally
to all is an unfair reality.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.920
If I have the time to curse someone,

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.420
I'd rather spend it thinking
about those precious to me.

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.640
There was no room to doubt
what a good person she was.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.740
She deserved happiness
more than anyone else.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.910
But Tsumiki was still cursed.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:14.680
The father who named me "Megumi"
with no regard for my gender

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:17.840
is still off living as he pleases somewhere.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.160
Karma isn't fully automatic.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:30.130
Evil people can only be judged under the law.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.670
Jujutsu sorcerers are just another
cog in that machine of retribution.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:46.420
I want more good people to
enjoy fairness, even if only a few,

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:51.650
so I...

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:55.530
save people unequally!

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:00.910
Nice.

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:02.700
That's it.

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:07.430
So this is when you start
burning through your life!

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.100
Now I see.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.040
Well, in that case...

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.770
Show me, Fushiguro Megumi!

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:23.430
Sacred treasure swing
and ring, ring -Eight Grip-!

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:31.390
Just so you know, I...

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:37.490
don't have any logical reason
for saving you back then.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:42.390
Even if it was dangerous, I couldn't bear
to see a good person like you die.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.700
I did have my reservations,

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.580
but ultimately, it was for
selfish, emotional reasons.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.030
That's fine, though.

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:54.720
I'm not a hero.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.560
I'm a jujutsu sorcerer.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:04.720
So I've never once regretted saving you.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.690
I see.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:14.930
You really are smart, Fushiguro.

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:17.200
You've put more thought into this than I have.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.990
I think your conviction's a proper one,

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:22.660
but I don't think mine is wrong, either.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.840
Oh, sorry, I'm almost done for.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:35.470
Guess I won't have to worry about you,
Kugisaki, or Gojou-sensei.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.760
Live a long life.

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:06.950
Jujutsu Kaisen

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.960
Jujutsu Kaisen

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:30.330
Well, tell me.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:35.980
Was there any real reason
to use a precious finger

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:37.790
to test Sukuna's strength?

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.280
Well, there wasn't much point to it
with a half-baked test case.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.130
But we did learn a few things.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:47.940
Hmph. I'll be praying that's not just an excuse.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:54.630
Stop talking! No one
understands what you're saying!

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:01.750
We don't understand, yet the meaning
flows right into our minds. It's creepy!

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:06.380
<b>Caf√© Restaurant
Rice</b>

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:08.720
Welcome!

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:11.540
Would you like a seat for one?

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.970
Yes, one, please.

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:30.610
If you encounter it, your choices
are to either run or die.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:35.600
I warned them that fighting
was absolutely not an option.

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:38.770
It was intentional.

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:41.110
Huh? What do you mean?

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:43.260
There was a special-grade.

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:46.310
Sending first-years to rescue
five who may or may not be alive

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:48.310
should be out of the question.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.000
Besides, with Yuuji,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.540
I was the one who forced the issue and
got his execution indefinitely suspended.

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.440
Some higher-ups who didn't like that

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.840
took advantage of my absence
and the special-grade

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:03.530
to tactfully dispose of him.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:08.210
If the other two had also died,
it'd be more harassment for me

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:10.650
and two birds with one stone for them.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:12.550
No, but...

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:17.030
No one expected it to become a special-grade
by the time the dispatch was issued.

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:19.670
Searching for someone to blame is just a pain.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.280
Maybe I should just...

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.800
kill all of the higher-ups.

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:32.520
You're not usually this emotional.

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:35.280
It's good to see you, Ieiri-san!

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:37.450
Looks to me...

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:39.910
like you've taken quite a liking to him.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.350
I've always been a nice guy
who cares for my students.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.360
Don't torment Ijichi too much.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.730
He's got it rough, stuck
between us and the higher-ups.

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:51.330
Keep going! Keep going! Keep going!

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:54.210
I don't care about a man's hardships.
Keep going! Keep going! Keep going!

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:54.760
That so?
Keep going! Keep going! Keep going!

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:55.120
That so?

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:57.970
So this is...

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.210
Sukuna's vessel, huh?

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:05.890
I can take him apart as I please, right?

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.640
Make sure to get good use out of him.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:09.980
Oh, I will.

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:12.370
Who do you think I am?

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.510
"Live a long life"?

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:23.300
Doesn't mean much when
you go and die yourself.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.970
Is this your first time having a partner die?

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:29.430
First time for one my age.

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:33.990
You seem to be taking it well, considering.

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:35.520
Same to you.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:36.820
Of course.

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:39.270
I only knew him for about two weeks.

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:45.350
I'm not some simple woman who breaks down
bawling when a guy I barely know dies.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:48.890
Jeez.

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:01.450
It's hot, huh?

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.340
Yeah. Wonder if it's time for summer uniforms.

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:17.400
What's this?

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:22.040
You're looking more glum than usual, Megumi.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.480
This a wake or something?

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:26.270
Zenin-senpai.

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:28.300
Don't call me by my last name!

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.500
Maki! Maki!

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:30.900
I'm talking here.

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:33.900
Y-You actually don't know why they're so down?

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.270
What are you talking about?

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.500
Someone really did die yesterday!

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.860
One of the first-year boys!

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:40.770
Bonito flakes.

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:43.790
You should've told me sooner!

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:47.040
Now I look like some heartless,
cold-blooded demon!

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.510
That's exactly how you came off.

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:49.560
Tuna and mayo.

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.230
You're supposed to try
to make me feel better!

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:52.210
Who are those guys?
You're supposed to try
to make me feel better!

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:52.910
Who are those guys?

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:54.800
Our second-year upperclassmen.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.530
You have to be kinder to your underclassmen.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.420
There's more to kindness
than being soft on them.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:05.420
Zenin-senpai is the best of all the
students at wielding cursed tools.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.640
Salmon roe.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.150
That's the Cursed Speech
user, Inumaki-senpai.

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:11.440
He can only speak in
ingredients of rice balls.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:15.390
He's a bit softer when Yuuta's around, though.

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:16.430
Panda-senpai.

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:23.230
There's one more, Okkotsu-senpai,
who's the only one I can openly respect,

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:26.220
but he's overseas right now.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:28.940
You're not adding more
about the panda named Panda?

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:32.230
Man, sorry about this.

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:34.200
And when you're in mourning...

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.210
Please forgive us for that.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:41.770
The truth is, we'd like you to participate
in the Kyoto Sister School Exchange Event.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:45.120
Kyoto Sister School Exchange Event?

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:47.350
What's that?

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:50.680
It's a get-together with the
other Tech school in Kyoto.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:54.580
Though isn't that event
mainly second- and third-years?

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:58.400
And those stupid third-years
are suspended right now.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.960
So you need to participate.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.140
What do you do at this event?

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:04.350
<i>Smash Bros.</i>?

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.120
I won't lose if it's the Wii version.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.330
I'll Meteor Smash so you can't come back.

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.330
Then let's make a 3-man team.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:15.060
The exchange event has the principals
of the Tokyo and Kyoto schools

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:21.590
each propose a form of competition to be held
for an entire day over the course of two days.

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:24.080
Though that's just how it is on paper.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:28.960
Every year, the first day is team battles,
and the second day is individual battles.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:29.880
Salmon.

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.120
Individual and team battles?

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:36.800
We fight?! Against other jujutsu sorcerers?!

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:41.590
Yeah, it's a jujutsu battle
where anything but killing goes.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:46.030
We'll train you up well
so you won't get killed.

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:47.950
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:51.470
Wait, do you have time for that?

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:53.930
I thought we were short
on jujutsu sorcerers.

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:57.450
That's a good question. For now, we are.

00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:58.420
May Blues
Change in Environment
Disrupt Autonomic Nerves
Winter Blues

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:01.410
The glum emotions people harbor
from late winter through spring
May Blues
Change in Environment
Disrupt Autonomic Nerves
Winter Blues

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:05.700
cause an outburst of curses in the
early summer, so that's our busy season.
May Blues
Change in Environment
Disrupt Autonomic Nerves
Winter Blues

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:06.160
May Blues
Change in Environment
Disrupt Autonomic Nerves
Winter Blues

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.690
Sometimes we're busy all year long,

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:10.960
but things should be settling down soon.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.000
Huh...

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:13.920
So, you'll do it, right?

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:16.130
You just had a partner
die on you, after all.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.310
We're in!

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:18.590
I...

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:19.790
I...

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.320
...have to get stronger.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.310
I'll do anything to achieve that!

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:29.660
But if I decide this training and exchange
event is pointless, I'm quitting instantly.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:30.900
Same here.

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:35.760
Well, people this cocky are
all the more worthwhile to train.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:36.840
Bonito flakes.

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:39.350
<b>Caf√© Restaurant
Rice</b>

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:41.610
So you're saying your boss
<b>Caf√© Restaurant
Rice</b>

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:45.610
wants to reverse the current
positions of humans and curses.

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:47.670
Is that it?

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.960
Well, roughly.

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:52.220
It's slightly different, though.

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.390
Humans are made up of lies.

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:59.870
For every positive action and emotion
they show, there's always a flip-side.

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:07.530
Yet negative emotions like hatred and
hostility are truths without falsehood.

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:11.570
Since we curses are born
from those emotions,

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:14.770
that makes us true, pure beings!

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:17.190
Imitations should be eliminated!

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:21.330
Yet, at present, you're
the ones being eliminated.

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:24.100
That's why we've come to ask you.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:27.000
What can we do to defeat
the jujutsu sorcerers?

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.020
If you fulfill two conditions

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:32.160
before going to war, then you can win.

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.670
And what are these two conditions?

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.180
The first involves the man known
as the strongest jujutsu sorcerer.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.630
You have to render
Gojou Satoru incapable of fighting.

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:49.180
The second is to get Ryoumen Sukuna
and Itadori Yuuji on your side.

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.730
Hold on. He died, didn't he?

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:56.200
That Itadori Yuuji brat, I mean.

00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:59.900
Did he, though? I'm not so sure.

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:09.210
Don't look inside me without
permission. I hate it...

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:11.050
Brat.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.800
Juju Stroll

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:47.490
Salmon.
Juju Stroll

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:49.220
You stink.

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:51.380
I don't stink.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.230
You stink.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.940
I don't stink!

00:22:55.940 --> 00:23:00.200
Why are you treating me like an animal?

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.480
Because you're a panda.

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:02.710
Mustard leaf.

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:04.560
You smell like an animal.

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.260
I keep telling you to take
a bath, and you never do.

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.810
I don't like getting wet.

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:12.920
But unlike you guys, I don't sweat,

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.260
and I Febreze every day.

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:18.300
So I don't stink.

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:25.110
So that's what happened.

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:26.740
You guys try taking a whiff.

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:37.940
Doesn't really stink.

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:40.220
Sort of smells like the sun.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.080
Sunshine!

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:54.950
Episode 6:
After Rain
