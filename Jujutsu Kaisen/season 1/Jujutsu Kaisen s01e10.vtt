00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.600
What? The <i>Super Scary Movie</i> series went up to 5?

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.360
Up to 7, actually.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.160
For real?

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.890
The seventh one must be really out there.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.800
It became a completely different thing by 7.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.950
It's not even a parody movie anymore.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.270
Then what kind of movie is it?

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.530
Convoluted sitcom plus
lineage horror, I suppose?

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.670
What the heck?

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.940
By a total fluke, and the grandchild of
the main character from 1 ends up living

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.570
in a shared house with the
grandchild of the culprit from 2

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.350
and the grandchild of the
first person who died in 3,

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.960
but it turns out it's a haunted house,
so they call in a spirit medium.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.770
That's the story.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.980
Sounds boring.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.050
It bored me to death.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.900
Who'd watch something like that?

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.560
What's interesting, though,
is that the guy from 5 and 6—

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.430
Huh?

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.160
What are you doing here?

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.660
Didn't I tell you not to use this room
because we're making it our club room now?

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.370
B-But you haven't been using it lately,
so I thought it was fine now.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.110
So?

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.850
So, well, um...

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.920
Just get out of here already,
you cockroaches!

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.750
L-Let's go, Yoshino.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.400
Next time you use it, we'll send you flying!

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.310
Oh, score!

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.430
Hey, what are you doing?!

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:40.970
What?

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.530
I'm taking it home.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.770
Huh?

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.600
Move your foot.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.820
Hey, stop it...

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.230
I'm taking this home.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.860
So could you move your foot?

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.000
Shit!

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.690
Close the door.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.400
Roger.

Episode 10: Idle Transfiguration

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.380
I wonder if the first person to say
"the opposite of fondness is indifference"

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.520
went to hell like they should have.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.880
It's just not possible that interacting
maliciously with others

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.980
could be more proper than leaving them alone.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.570
"The opposite of fondness is hate."

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.290
Japanese people love that.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.520
They like to gloat over
complicating a simple answer.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.110
The man who coined that
phrase wasn't Japanese.

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.420
I'm talking about the mistaken translation.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.800
The original phrase,
spoken by some foreigner,

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.520
was "the opposite of love
is indifference," right?

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:20.990
There are various definitions of "love,"
so "indifference" works as an antonym there.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.790
That's true.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.110
But we generally don't use
"love" very much, right?

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.410
That's why, in this country,

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.610
it got changed to "fondness" at some point.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:37.100
That version spread without any thought
as to whether the opposing definitions

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.440
of "love" and "indifference" still held true.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.240
Everyone likes a little wordplay.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.500
After all, humans can't live
without making up excuses.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:56.210
What's this?

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.090
An experiment to see just how
large I can make a single human.

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:09.130
On that one, I tried to see
how small I could make one.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.780
This is...

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.580
a human?

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.010
Are you used to corpses, Junpei?

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.600
I don't know.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.750
If this was my mother, I might lose control

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.680
and end up hating you.

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.580
But I already know how
repulsive humans can be.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.480
That's why I don't expect
anything from other people,

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.960
nor do I think much of it when
someone I don't know dies.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.820
Indifference is the virtue
people ought to strive for.

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.480
And despite that, you want revenge.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.650
Are you trying to say that's contradictory?

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.520
Do you believe people have hearts?

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.730
Huh? Do they not?

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.410
They don't.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.730
They have souls,

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:13.800
but souls aren't hearts.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.900
Then what about my—

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:21.160
I'm the only person in this world who
understands the composition of souls.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:26.890
After all, I change the shape of other
creatures by making contact with them.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.780
All emotions are the result
of the soul's metabolism.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.310
They're far too mechanical to call hearts.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.240
People place too much value
on things they can't see.

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.380
I can see them,

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:46.290
and souls are no more special
than physical bodies.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.750
They're just there.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.460
Do you get it?

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.060
There's no value or importance to life.

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.970
Life just continues its cycle,

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.750
same as the waters of the world.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.160
That's true for both you and me.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.200
Our lives are meaningless and have no value.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.020
Li...

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.560
And that's why we can do anything we want.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.730
We're free to live our
lives however we please.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.500
You can't let yourself get trapped
in an ideal of indifference.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.400
There's no need for consistency
in how you live your life.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:27.090
Just as you eat when you get hungry,
you can kill someone if you hate them.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.780
I'll sanction you fully.

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:54.690
There he is.

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:57.140
Huh? Casual clothes?

00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:00.590
It looks like he hasn't
attended school for some time.

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.920
The same could be said for me, though.

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:07.180
So are the others doing well?

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.200
Tuna, tuna!

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.680
I hear they're doing quite well.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.130
So what do we do?

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.510
We use that.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:22.500
Huh? Is that a cursed spirit?

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.040
It's a fly head,

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.700
a low-level curse that doesn't
even qualify as grade 4.

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:33.180
Once we reach a place with no people,
we'll have it attack him.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.080
Huh?!

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.010
One: if he's a normal person
who can't perceive curses,

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.840
please save him.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.690
Two: if he can perceive it,
but has no means to deal with it,

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:50.390
likewise, please save him.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:52.860
Then we'll question him
about the day of the incident.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.620
Three: If he exorcises
the fly head with jujutsu...

00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:59.880
we immediately restrain him.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.480
By force?

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.990
By force.

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:06.630
If it's a misunderstanding, that's fine.
We'll apologize after the fact.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.230
However...

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:13.760
Four: if Yoshino Junpei possesses potential
equal to or greater than a grade 2 sorcerer,

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:17.310
we retreat and meet back up with Nanami-san.

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:21.760
I think I can just barely handle a grade 2.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.280
If this were a cursed spirit, yes.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.070
Huh?

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.240
Fushiguro-kun mentioned
it before, remember?

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.450
Typically, cursed spirits are assigned
to sorcerers of equal grade.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:33.740

something that important?

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.060
Because Gojou-san's so irresponsible...

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.600
We'll get out of the car here.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:02.880
This feels like I'm doing all the work,
and I'm really not into it.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.800
If you plan to come out,
please hurry up and do so.

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.660
They may be disfigured and beyond saving,

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:22.440
but murdering people makes me sick.

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:28.490
Ah, what a relief.

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:32.080
I'd be in trouble if Gojou Satoru were here,

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:36.190
but it's not much of an
experiment if you're too weak.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.100
I hate overtime, so let's just...

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.120
finish this quickly.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:49.010
JUJUTSU KAISEN

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.020
JUJUTSU KAISEN

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.460
I'll murder you!

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.010
They're similar.

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:05.300
That picture-perfect frivolity,

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:07.910
and the sinister strength behind it.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.670
I did block it, didn't I?
With cursed energy.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.800
Is it that kind of technique?

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:39.000
What do you mean, "that kind"?

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:43.000
I hate abstract questions that
leave interpretation up to others.

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:44.660
That's good.

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.520
So you don't hate chatting, then.

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.620
It depends on the person.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:53.070
This cursed spirit is capable
of conversing quite well,

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:58.480
just like the two unregistered
special-grades in Gojou-san's report.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:01.250
I suppose it would be unnatural
for them to be unrelated.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.830
Hey, tell me.

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:09.160
Which do you think came first,
the soul or the body?

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:11.710
Come on, you know.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:16.950
It's like the question of whether
the chicken or the egg came first.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.400
Do you think the soul resides in the body?

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:25.450
Or do you think the body
forms around the soul?

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:29.450
I have to listen, I guess...

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.890
The former.

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:34.880
Bzzt! The answer is the latter.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.840
The soul always exists before the body.

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:44.550
The shape of the body is pulled
along by the shape of the soul.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.340
I'm not healing.

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:50.840
I'm just strongly maintaining
the shape of my own soul.

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:55.240
You understand now, don't you?

00:13:55.240 --> 00:14:00.130
My technique is to make contact
with the soul and alter its shape.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.970
Idle Transfiguration.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.650
I keep a stockpile of humans.

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:11.640
It's rather difficult, though.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.790
Normal people eventually die
when their shape is transfigured.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.570
But what about jujutsu sorcerers?

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.260
It's 5:30 PM.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.040
I started work at 10 AM today,

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:31.650
so I'm getting off at 6 PM,
no matter what it takes.

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:40.290
Yoshino.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:42.050
Where were you?

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:46.860
You know you shouldn't be skipping school.

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:49.870
Sotomura-sensei.

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:52.170
Did you hear?

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:55.540
Apparently Sayama, Nishimura,
and Honda are dead.

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:58.870
You were friends with them, weren't you?

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:06.010
They spent a lot of time with you
when you had no other friends, right?

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.120
Yet you didn't even attend their funerals...

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:10.520
Honestly, what's wrong with you?

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.940
Friends?
Honestly, what's wrong with you?

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:12.290
You should go light some incense
for them. I'll even go with you.

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.820
Me... and them?
You should go light some incense
for them. I'll even go with you.

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:15.440
You should go light some incense
for them. I'll even go with you.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:16.290
He's insane.
You should go light some incense
for them. I'll even go with you.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:16.690
He's insane.

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:17.280
Come on.
He's insane.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.330
You teachers...

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.710
You graduate from school
and then go work in schools,

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:28.920
so you don't actually experience
the real world, do you?

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:34.970
That's how we end up with
overgrown children like you, isn't it?

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:37.860
Here, say "ahh."

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.000
Every last one of them!

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:41.480
Look over here!
Every last one of them!

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:42.320
Look over here!

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:47.880
I'll sanction you fully.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:53.430
What are you mumbling about?

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:56.630
Did you lose your mind from
self-isolation? Just kidding.

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:05.550
Stop!

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:09.870
Oh, this guy...

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:12.080
can see it.

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:15.790
Ow!

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:20.050
Damn, that hurt!

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:21.830
Glance.

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:24.480
Here we go, Itadori-kun!

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.430
Time out! There's someone there!

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:27.250
Huh?

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:28.300
Oh, no!

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:31.550
Thank goodness.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.520
What? You a gymnast or something?

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.170
Hey, I have some things
I want to ask you about.

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:39.310
Would you come with me?

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:42.900
Come on.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:43.860
That button...

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:44.320
Hold on.

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:46.290
He and I were just talking.

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:47.430
You're rude!

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:51.800
Uh, well, it's a rather important matter.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.060
An important matter?

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:54.820
You're just a kid! What's so important?

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:56.260
And what uniform is tha—

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:57.190
Plop!

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:03.210
What are you doing, you brat?!

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:05.390
Stop! Stop this!

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:08.340
Don't run off with them!

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.350
W-Wait!

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.820
What was that about?

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.530
Okay, now, let's go!

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:25.200
Huh?! That was fast!
You already ran that entire lap?!

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.020
Yeah.

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.960
You didn't have to go through all that.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.680
You could've just dragged me away.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.450
Well, sure.

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:35.360
But you hate that guy, don't you?

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:37.490
How do you...

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:40.140
Just a hunch.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.310
Oh, was I wrong?

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:43.920
You're not wrong.

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:48.010
You don't want someone you hate loitering
in front of your home forever, right?

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.510
Let's head over there for now.

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:55.870
Sure.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.960
Your mobility is impressive.

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:25.090
This is so fun!

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:30.200
So the person's original mass is irrelevant
when it comes to changing their shape?

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:36.660
Either way, it's a bad
match-up for my technique.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:38.170
...elp me!

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:41.750
Help... me!

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.140
You can't save anyone
once they've been reshaped.

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:50.790
If they attack, kill them without hesitation.

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:52.820
That's better for the victims, too.

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:57.830
Oh, sorry.

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:01.000
I've practiced a lot,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.980
so they don't die right away
when I change their size,

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.140
but their... brains? Awareness?

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.650
I still lack precision with that,

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:11.980
so sometimes their souls sweat like that.

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:14.080
Don't worry about it. Let's continue.

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:17.500
I'm not worried about it.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:23.880
It's my policy not to bring
personal feelings into work.

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:27.070
You suck at lying!

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:29.470
Your soul is trembling.

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.780
So you're... what grade?

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:34.060
Grade 1.

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:35.840
No wonder you're strong.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:39.040
You'll make the best test subject.

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:41.420
Luck's really on my side.

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:44.260
I'm grateful.

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:53.210
Surprised my speed suddenly increased?

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:56.770
I can alter the shape of my own soul, too.

00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:01.260
Jujutsu sorcerers can protect
their bodies with cursed energy,

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.750
but they aren't protecting their souls.

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:07.330
For starters, you have to
be aware of your own soul.

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.480
It's not possible to protect
it if you can't do that.

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:14.180
But it looks like you subconsciously covered
your soul somewhat with cursed energy.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.920
If you hadn't, you'd already
be under my control.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:23.460
Although, once I touch you two or three
more times, you'll cease to be human.

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.100
I'm not letting you go!

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:51.500
Was that it, grade 1 sorcerer?

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:55.050
You did well running around,
but you're at your limit, aren't you?

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:03.990
Unfortunately...

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:06.670
What?

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:10.190
His cursed energy's increasing?

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:14.410
I'm going into overtime now.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.550
Juju Stroll

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:49.560
Fushiguro!

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.780
Have you seen my uniform jacket?

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:52.930
No, I haven't.

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:54.680
That's weird.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:56.820
I left it right here...

00:22:57.290 --> 00:23:00.590
Oh, Panda-senpai. Have you seen my uniform?

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:05.010
I haven't seen it.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:07.100
Really?

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.360
I wonder where it could have gone.

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.500
Hey, my skirt's not here, either.

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:19.060
That's a line that can't be crossed.

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:22.590
Mustard leaf!

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:24.340
Bonito flakes!

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.790
Jeez, you're both trash.

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:31.190
This image is crazy.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:33.490
Huh?

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.100
This is Maki-san's.

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:39.230
Heya!

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:41.740
I'm Kugisaki Nobara!

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:55.030
Episode 11:
Narrow-minded
