WEBVTT

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.240
I'm going, Nanamin.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:13.750
You can't.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.860
I already explained why this morning.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.450
If a veil has been cast,

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.200
there's a strong likelihood he's both
alive and at Satozakura High School.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.230
I'll be back soon.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.980
Please wait there, Itadori-kun.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.930
It's probably pointless to ask him that.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.470
You heard why, so I'll leave
the rest of this to you, Ino-kun.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.430
Huh?!

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.150
Is there a problem with that?

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.780
Well, the number of them...

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.910
There's a lot.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.490
And they're all humans, right?

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.550
I wouldn't mind taking on the recommendation
to make you a grade 1 jujutsu sorcerer.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.410
Let's get this done, baby! Yeah!

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.550
Please step aside, Ijichi-san.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.560
Our job is to help others.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.680
That includes those who are
still students, like yourself.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.110
I won't make any more mistakes.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.320
You must not go, Itadori-kun.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.720
Sorry, Ijichi-san.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.560
What are you doing, Junpei?!

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.580
Stay out of this, jujutsu sorcerer.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.980
JUJUTSU KAISEN

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:34.480
Episode 12:  To You, Someday

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.860
Moon Dregs!

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.270
A jellyfish shikigami?

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.710
Blunt attacks won't work
when he's inside it?

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.650
I'll say it one more time.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.640
Stay out of this, jujutsu sorcerer!

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.180
It's none of your business!

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.190
That's not something you get to decide!

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.820
What's the point of indiscriminate salvation?

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.180
Don't mistake the value of a life!

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.130
People pretend their
emotions are everything,

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.850
but the heart is just the
metabolism of the soul.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.070
It's all a delusion!

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.800
Don't restrict me with rules
that are based on a delusion.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.930
No one has the right to stop anyone
from taking what lives they can.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.640
Just sleep over there.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.420
There's something I have to go back and do.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.140
Your cursed technique is poison.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.980
You produce poison from cursed energy

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.630
and make your shikigami
secrete it from its tentacles.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.020
You'll learn to control

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.180
the size and strength of your shikigami,
as well as the potency of your poison.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.590
A normal jujutsu sorcerer would
need some time to grasp it,

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.350
but I'll teach you the sensation,

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.240
so you'll be able to fight right away.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.160
Junpei, you have talent.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.950
Who are you making excuses for?

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.740
Why?

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.120
Why won't Moon Dregs' poison work on him?

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.180
Why are you getting in my way?

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.160
Why?!

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.950
Why?!

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.700
Why?!

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.350
He's in the air! He can't move!

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.010
No... if there's a chance to crush him,
it's right before he lands!

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.530
Junpei, I don't understand...

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.220
a damn thing you're saying!

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.410
You can string together
whatever logic you want.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.660
When facing shikigami users,
strike the sorcerer directly.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.660
You're just trying...

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.830
to convince yourself you're in the right!

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.900
I don't know what your motive is.
I'm sure you have a reason for doing this.

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.010
But is it really worth

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.470
throwing away that life you have?

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.420
The human heart is a delusion?

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.280
Can you say that in front of her?!

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:09.220
People don't have hearts.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.040
You're still—

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.020
They don't!

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:13.770
Otherwise...

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.610
Otherwise...

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:22.270
That would mean people cursed me
and my mom with those hearts!

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.170
That would just be too much...

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.220
I wouldn't know what is right

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.310
or what is wrong anymore...

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.050
Why didn't you dodge it?

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:52.450
Sorry.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.240
I said a lot of self-important stuff
without understanding anything.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:03.840
Tell me what happened.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:09.340
I swear I won't curse you anymore.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:11.590
So please.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.780
No way... Your mom...

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.670
Junpei, come to Jujutsu Tech.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.720
There are lots of crazy strong teachers
and reliable friends there.

00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:39.940
If we all work together,

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:44.050
I'm sure we can find
whoever cursed your mom.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.940
Then you can make sure they get their due!

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:49.380
Let's fight together!

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:56.260
Who are you?

00:08:57.950 --> 00:08:59.110
Who is that?

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:01.990
A person?

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.610
Nice to meet you...

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.480
No, this feels like...

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.570
...vessel of Sukuna.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.240
Mahito-san, wait!

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.260
Am I an idiot?!

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.430
A human-shaped cursed spirit
with a patchwork face!

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:24.160
This is exactly what
Nanamin said would happen!

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.310
Junpei, run!

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.670
I don't know what
relationship you have with him,

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.050
but right now, just run!

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:33.460
Please!

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.730
Itadori-kun, please calm down!

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:38.020
Mahito-san's not a bad person...

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.600
Bad... person...

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:54.950
You know, Junpei, you've got
a good head on your shoulders.

00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:01.380
But sometimes deliberation can lead
to worse foolishness than imprudence.

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:03.970
You're a stereotypical case of that!

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:08.760
You're almost as foolish as

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:11.670
those people you call fools yourself.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.130
That's why you'll die.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:19.600
Idle Transfiguration.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.500
Now, time for round two.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:34.370
Junpei...

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:37.820
Junpei!

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.680
Get a hold of yourself!

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.350
I'll heal you right now!

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:49.330
Sukuna!

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:52.780
Sukuna!

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:55.340
What?

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.640
I'll do anything!

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.440
You can do anything you want with me!

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:05.790
So heal Junpei like you did
when you restored my heart!

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.270
I refuse!

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:14.410
Damn you...

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:18.780
Good.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:21.830
He's completely forgotten about that pact.

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.580
How very amusing!

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.220
You'd offer up your pride,

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:31.600
your future, your everything,
to try to rely on me...

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.680
And you can't save anything!

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.820
He refused the pact?

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:43.200
The shape of one's soul isn't something that
reverse cursed techniques could deal with...

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.060
Maybe healing others is beyond him?

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:49.610
Pathetic!

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:52.770
You couldn't be more pathetic, brat!

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:58.210
Though, what I'm after is what comes next,

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.070
so I guess this is fine.

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:19.550
Oh, that's right.

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:21.340
At the end of the day,

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:23.470
these two are both

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.810
curses.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.140
Yuuji...

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.990
Why?

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:12.880
Oh, dead already?

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.420
I suppose I was kind of rough
when I changed his shape.

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:20.820
Guess that's how it goes.

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:26.420
That was an unusual blow.

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:27.760
Interesting!

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.290
Too bad, though.

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:32.760
That won't work. So long
as I maintain the shape of my—

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:38.130
What's going on?!

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.960
He struck the shape of my soul, as well?

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.940
That's right!

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.270
Itadori Yuuji's a vessel.

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:54.130
His body constantly houses another
soul in addition to his own.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.580
So naturally...

00:13:57.850 --> 00:13:59.550
You're aware...

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:02.430
of the outline of your soul?

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:12.930
The next words that spilled from my lips

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:16.500
came from so deep within
my gut that it nearly made

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.730
all the things I've ever said feel like a lie.

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.280
I will kill you!

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:27.960
JUJUTSU KAISEN

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:32.970
JUJUTSU KAISEN

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:46.790
Don't you mean you'll
"exorcise" me, jujutsu sorcerer?

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:53.460
Itadori Yuuji isn't concerned
with his own life.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:58.260
Getou forbade me from forcing him
into an external pact using hostages.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.570
So if he can't kill a foe he hates
so much that he longs to kill them,

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:06.790
he'll probably turn to Sukuna.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.780
If Junpei isn't enough,

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:13.100
I'd just need to transform every
student, one by one, before his eyes.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:18.650
That would lead Itadori Yuuji to negotiate
and forge a pact with Sukuna

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:21.180
while he's full of hatred for self-interest.

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:26.190
If that also improved the chances of
Sukuna joining our side, all the better.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:34.870
Though, all of that presumes
that I'm stronger than him.

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:37.080
So why did he have to be

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.850
my natural enemy?

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:00.950
He keeps changing his damn shape so much!

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:04.380
Would it be better to stop thinking of
combos that start with holds and throws?

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:07.670
Now that I know his attacks work on me,

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:11.320
changing my shape and making
his target bigger is a bad idea.

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:14.090
In that case...
In that case...

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.370
Even if it takes a hundred or a thousand times,

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:20.830
I'll keep pounding him

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:23.470
into a pulp!

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:28.560
I'll use a shape more honed toward murder,

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.800
with more inspiration for murder,

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:33.930
and manifest it!

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:03.040
You can't keep stretching forever!

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:23.100
Most people would let go, you know.

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:28.880
Spreading my shape too much causes it
to lose strength and maneuverability.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:55.970
You can't beat me.

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:58.570
Swap out already...

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:01.590
with Sukuna.

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.190
Idle Transfiguration.

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:16.220
You dare touch my soul?

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:20.010
Since we both heartily ridiculed
that brat together,

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:21.680
I'll allow it once.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:24.210
There won't be a second time.

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:29.770
Know your place,

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:33.100
fool.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:40.970
I'm not swapping out.

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:42.540
I already told you...

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.340
I will kill you.

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:23.360
Huh?

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:35.890
Nanamin!

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:42.860
I'll lecture you later.

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:45.140
Tell me the situation.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.480
I couldn't save two people.

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:53.040
It's always others first?

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:56.370
Explain your physical state first.

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:58.550
I'm fine.

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:00.870
Though I'm full of holes.

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:03.130
That's not fine.

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:07.600
Also, everyone from this school
is unconscious in the gym.

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:12.750
Hey, you're alive and well, 7:3 sorcerer!

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:16.290
Glad to see we both survived.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:18.280
Shall we share a hug,

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:21.160
in celebration of our reunion?

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:29.590
Itadori-kun, why is his nose bleeding?

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:32.680
Huh? I punched him.

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:34.100
When?

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.550
At the start of our fight.

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:37.370
Did his hand touch you?

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:38.360
Yeah.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:42.250
My attacks won't work on him.

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:42.790
Huh?!

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:44.800
What?! Why?!

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.900
I'll explain while I'm lecturing you.

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:51.260
One, his technique doesn't
work on Itadori-kun,

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:54.790
or two, there's some reason
he won't kill Itadori-kun.

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:56.720
Either way, that's good for us.

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:00.460
However, I can halt his movements.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:05.650
Once we've both created an opening,
we'll shower him with blows.

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:09.530
We'll make sure to exorcise him here.

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:12.800
Yeah!

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.550
Juju Stroll

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:55.030
