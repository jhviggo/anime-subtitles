WEBVTT

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.060
Kugisaki! Don't let that blood touch you!

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.980
You think I don't know that?!

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.490
Run away,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.750
with your backs to me.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.810
Kugisaki, can you go any faster?

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.960
No way!

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.520
I've got your back.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.310
Thanks.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.150
Huh?

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.390
Huh?!

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.720
What speed...

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.400
While carrying someone, too.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.170
Tsk... They'll get away.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.400
Well, no matter.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.090
Okay, we're out of range now.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.940
Well done. You have my compliments.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.090
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.090
I'm kidding. Thank you.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.940
It took the shortest route
and got ahead of us?

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.170
Itado—

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.440
Kugisaki!

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.460
You don't need to worry.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.400
My younger brother's blood doesn't
have the same quality as mine.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.840
And even mine won't kill you
unless your entire body's bathed in it.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.590
Though it will hurt like hell.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.390
This is where our technique starts.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.100
Rot Technique: Decay.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.420
Huh?

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.830
JUJUTSU KAISEN

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.950
My blood, and my brothers' blood,

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.260
is absorbed through wounds and membranes,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.950
and then, once any of us
brothers activates the technique,

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.000
it begins to rot you away
from the point of incursion.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.260
I'd give that young man
about fifteen minutes.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.510
Ten minutes max for you, young lady.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.300
By morning, nothing but bones will remain.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.020
If it's a technique,

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.180
we just need to make them release it!

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.180
So it<i> is</i> poisonous.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.140
The result is essentially a poison,

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.190
but our technique is purely "decomposition."

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.150
I've finished revealing our technique.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.700
Now they'll actually die even faster.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.200
So, what will you do now?

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.430
Elder Brother, these sorcerers
didn't amount to much.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.180
At the beginning of the Meiji Era,

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.630
there was a girl with a unique trait that
allowed her to bear a cursed spirit's child.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.950
She conceived a child
with no recollection of how,

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.900
and the criticism she endured from
her parents and relatives was extreme.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.220
She fled with the corpse
of her baby in her arms,

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.610
ending up at a temple run
by a certain jujutsu sorcerer.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.730
However, that was where her luck ran out.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.010
Kamo Noritoshi.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.930
Among all of jujutsu
sorcery's cultural legacy,

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.520
he's remembered as
the most vile of sorcerers

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.330
and a disgrace to the three major clans.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.240
His intellectual curiosity

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.580
was captivated by the possibility of a
child born of a human and a cursed spirit.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.630
Nine times, he impregnated her.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.030
Nine times, he aborted her.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.110
All records of how he did it

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.860
and what happened to her
afterward were destroyed.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.830
The Cursed Wombs:
Death Paintings One through Three

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.520
became cursed objects powerful enough
to be classified as special-grade.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.380
Perhaps the origin of that power
was the mother's resentment,

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.260
or perhaps...

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.760
I have no memories of a mother.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.770
Humans and sorcerers...

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.390
It's not that I hold any
special grudge against them.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.450
For 150 years,

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.160
we remained sealed away with nothing
but each others' existence to rely on.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.400
We'll side with the cursed spirits.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.440
Are you sure?

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.920
They seemed shady, Elder Brother.

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.420
The future those cursed spirits painted
is more convenient for us.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.100
That's all there is to it.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.080
Forget about owing them
for our manifestation.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.420
Now listen, brothers.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.920
Eso, you live for Kechizu.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.430
Kechizu, you live for me.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.930
And I'll live for you, Eso.

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.440
We three are one.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.430
I live for my brothers.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.540
If it is what my brothers desire,

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.190
I will give my life to grant it for them.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.270
If the suffering is too great,

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.400
would you like me to end you right away?

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.630
A technique that guarantees
victory once it hits...

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.200
You two are strong.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.960
Too bad for you, though.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.560
That makes me the worst match for you!

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.460
Straw Doll Technique: Resonance!

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.430
Let's play a game of chicken!

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.920
You don't like pain, do you?

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.930
Then start crying and
release your technique.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.310
A technique to turn the curse on the user?

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.440
A game of chicken...

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:09.440
So unless I release our technique,
this will continue?

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.240
Straw Doll Technique: Resonance.

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:17.680
It's a technique that deals damage
to the target's main body

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.330
by driving cursed energy through an effigy
and a lost portion of the target.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.320
The technique's range is broad,

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.090
and the effect varies

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.050
with the difference in strength between
us and the value of the lost portion.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.050
As far as Straw Doll Technique is concerned,

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.000
blood isn't very valuable.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.360
But Resonance uses the link to its target.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:43.110
And their blood that's inside me now

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.060
is strongly linking us and
their rot technique together!

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.910
It's a nice surprise that it worked
on the younger brother, too.

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.030
If I'm going to die here anyway,

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:57.000
then I'll keep hammering
Resonance into them!

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.650
That's quite intense,

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:03.250
but no matter how many times she
does it, it won't end our lives.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:07.010
As long as we hold out,
you'll be the ones to die!

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:08.510
Not to mention,

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:12.460
while Decay is active, the pain
and poison will keep you from mov—

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.650
How are you able to move that well?

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.890
Resonance!

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:30.930
Itadori is the vessel

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:33.770
for Ryomen Sukuna,
the King of Curses and Deadly Poisons.

00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:37.330
So he has resistance to all forms of poison.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.400
The result is essentially a poison,

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.760
but our technique is purely "decomposition."

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.250
He's probably feeling pain
from the decomposition,

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:49.880
but the resulting poison doesn't affect him.

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:52.330
And if it's just pain...

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.090
Itadori Yuji...

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:02.150
won't stop!

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.730
Kechizu!

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:11.730
Shut up already!

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:12.980
Resonance!

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.320
That's nothing!

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.760
He switched!

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.350
With the woman close to death,

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:22.410
putting her against my brother,
who's closer to death!

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:25.370
Does she think she can stop
my movement forever?!

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:29.180
Woman!

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.440
Do I release the technique or not?

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.860
I can't go and save my brother like this!

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.970
I can't unleash Wing King
while Decay is active.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:41.820
But does that woman have enough
strength left to kill my brother?

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:44.830
Even with her interference,

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:49.410
this man won't be able
to kill me before she dies,

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:52.980
so I cannot release the technique!

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.900
B-Brother!

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.400
We three are one.

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:14.290
I was already releasing it before I even knew it.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.550
Wing King!

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:04.180
What was that black light just now?

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:10.480
I know I reinforced my arm with
cursed energy before taking his punch!

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.770
But the next thing I knew, my whole arm
and shoulder had been blown away.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.030
Ahh, younger brother!

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.530
Don't die, my brother!

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.950
Elder Brother!

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:30.960
I haven't shown you this one yet, have I?

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.370
Hairpin.

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:44.220
Don't worry.

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:48.120
I'll be sending your older
brother to join you soon.

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.230
Kechizu...

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:56.270
We three are one.

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:59.310
I'm sorry, Elder Brother.

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:01.360
Even though I was with him...

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:04.960
Why isn't this thing vanishing?

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.030
Is it still alive?

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:07.530
No!

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:09.180
It's not a cursed spirit!

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:10.540
It has a physical body!

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.330
Watch it!

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.090
Christ.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.360
S-Sawamura-san?!

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.800
Speed up.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:26.830
Hit the brakes and you're dead.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.190
Both you and him.

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:30.260
Got it?

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:41.280
Don't follow me, jujutsu sorcerer.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:42.990
Once I heal my wounds,

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:46.740
I'll make sure to kill these two,
especially that woman.

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:48.690
I'm sorry, Kechizu...

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:50.240
I wasn't able to mourn you.

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:53.420
But I will get revenge for—

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.080
What is that woman doing?

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:58.660
Kugisaki!

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:04.430
Don't rush me!

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:06.010
Straw Doll Technique:

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.790
Resonance!

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:21.560
Once they land a Black Flash,

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:26.570
sorcerers temporarily enter
a state athletes call "the zone."

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:30.010
Damn it!

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:35.080
It wasn't a technique to
turn the curse on the user?!

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:39.760
Sorry.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:01.600
That hurt.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.070
Geto, the stock certificate.

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:09.610
What's the matter, Choso?

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:10.320
Hurry up.
What's the matter, Choso?

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:10.330
What's the matter, Choso?

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.840
Hey! Don't break the pieces!

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.060
My younger brothers died.

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:19.210
You can tell?

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:21.300
What's going on?

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.250
It's one thing if he was fully manifested,

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:27.170
Jeez, do we have any more?
but I find it hard to believe those two were
killed by a single finger of a cursed spirit.

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:28.040
Why aren't there spares?
Hold on.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.730
Why aren't there spares?

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:32.140
And why did you break it?

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:34.960
We just received a report.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.670
Eso and Kechizu were killed

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:37.410
Jeez.
Eso and Kechizu were killed

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:37.860
by the first-years of Jujutsu High...
Jeez.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.310
by the first-years of Jujutsu High...

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.560
Itadori Yuji and his group.

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:56.340
The number you have dialed is—

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:57.530
I knew it! They're not answering!
The number you have dialed is—

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.490
Where did those brats go?!

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.500
Kugisaki, you okay?

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.860
Oh, yeah.

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.290
Though it might leave scars.

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:13.410
I wonder if those old guys are all right.
Their truck's gone, too.

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:15.140
The poison's...

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:18.680
Well, if we head home now,
I wonder if Shoko-san'll be awake.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.210
And I wonder if she'll be sober...

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:23.520
What are you fidgeting for? It's creepy.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.370
I was wondering if this was your first time

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:29.250
killing instead of exorcising.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.030
What about you?

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:32.860
I did it once before...

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:36.000
No, I guess it isn't fair to call it once.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.360
It was three people.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.460
I think you're doing worse than me here.

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.110
To be blunt, this was nothing to me.

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:46.570
These things happen when you're a sorcerer.

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:49.650
I'm no Fushiguro,

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:52.880
but ultimately, there are only
so many people we can save.

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:57.060
There are only so many seats open in my life,

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:02.060
and I don't want to let my heart be swayed
by anyone who's not sitting in one of them.

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:03.880
Is that mean?

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:09.490
Of course, there are also people like you
who bring their own seat and sit down.

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.060
It might not mean much,

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:16.640
but we didn't have room to worry about
whether they were cursed spirits or curse users.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.270
Even if they were human,

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:21.500
we don't have a technique to keep anyone
that strong restrained long-term.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.360
You know that, right?

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:28.080
But he cried when he saw
his brother die before him.

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:31.350
I see.

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:35.780
I'm happy that you and I
were spared and are still alive.

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:36.890
It's a big relief.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:42.790
But tears were shed over
the lives I ended tonight.

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:45.870
That's all.

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:48.020
I see.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.800
In that case, we're accomplices.

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:56.360
F-Fushiguro?!

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:00.250
Oh, you're back.

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:01.370
I'm glad you're safe.

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:03.490
I-I was so scared!

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:04.990
I thought you were dead!

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:06.880
Thank goodness!

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.640
Could you lower your voices?

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.880
My head hurts.

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:14.890
Don't go to sleep with Sukuna's finger
in your hand. That's dangerous.

00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:17.730
How do you know about the finger?

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:19.910
You have the energy to ask about that?

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:21.050
Nope.

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:23.150
Just contact Nitta-san for now.

00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:25.670
We need to get it sealed at once.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:26.890
Cursed spirits are approaching.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:28.940
Should I eat it?

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:30.800
It's not leftovers.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.740
We don't have a clear idea of
how many fingers you can handle.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:35.400
So don't eat it.

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.410
But I will hand it over to you,
since you have the most energy.

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:40.910
I'll say this again, though. Don't eat it.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.410
He thinks I have the intelligence of a dog.

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:54.480
We just said not to eat it!

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.840
Huh? Me?!

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:57.840
This guy seriously...

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.840
He hardly did any work this time, either!

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:06.470
The Sukuna within you will tell us where
the fingers are to try to regain his power.

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:09.840
Is Gojo-sensei just winging it?

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.160
You just now realized?

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.980
Hey! You three!

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.940
Oh, Nitta-san.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.800
She's lost it.

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:23.010
Well, shall we go home?

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:25.650
I'm hungry.

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:27.960
I wonder if there's a
Splendid Sushi around here.

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.330
Splendid Sushi's bullet train
was awesome, wasn't it?

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:31.250
Shut up.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.980
Man, it wasn't just a cursed spirit with a finger.

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:37.920
When we analyzed the
corpses, what a surprise!

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:41.260
It was the manifestation of the other goods.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:45.090
They each took out one special-grade!

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:47.290
This year's first-years
are the cream of the crop!

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:50.270
It must be my skill as an instructor.

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:54.620
I don't want any long chats
with you on my day off.

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.650
You're calling about arrangements
for the drinking party, right?

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:58.270
Well, find any candidates?

00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:59.820
None.

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.030
Everyone's busy, even myself.

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:04.650
What now? Should I try
asking the students, too?

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:08.290
I'm a lightweight, so I don't mind
if the party's alcohol-free.

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:11.140
I'm counting on you to
keep reaching out to people.

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:12.750
Iori Utahime

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:19.700
We never know what might be
listening around Utahime, after all.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:24.320
I don't want to think about one
of the students being the traitor.

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.220
This is such a pain.

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.850
Well, I'll leave the rest to you, Mei-san.

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:30.220
The payment has been sent.
Payment Complete
Well, I'll leave the rest to you, Mei-san.

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:30.230
Payment Complete
The payment has been sent.

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:37.190
Gojo Satoru

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:42.190
Don't talk about them
resonating with Itadori.

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:44.900
Are you certain about that?

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:47.210
Nearly positive. The case is over, though.

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:50.200
The only ones likely to notice

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:52.730
are us and Nitta-san.

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:55.110
Itadori...

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:57.700
and Sukuna's manifestation
was only the trigger.

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:01.050
The curse of Yasohachi Bridge could
have started killing at any moment.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:06.220
Besides, he swallowed that
first finger to save me.

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.720
But there's no way he'd be
satisfied with just that.

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:11.720
So don't tell him.

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:13.830
I won't say anything.

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:15.720
Don't underestimate a lady's consideration.

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:17.730
It's your fault!

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:20.130
You took me in.

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:23.920
And now the severed parts
of my soul have awakened.

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:27.760
To save lots of people, was it?

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.100
Brat!

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.900
People are going to die because you live!

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.490
Hey... Don't say that to Fushiguro.

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:39.290
But what are you going to do when someone
you saved kills someone else in the future?

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:42.800
Don't you dare say it.

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:55.890
Mustard leaf.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.150
What's wrong? Your movements
aren't as sharp today.

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:00.150
Did you get weaker?

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:01.810
Shut up!

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:04.160
I lost my edge after all that bed rest!

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:08.430
Anyway, did you hear about the first-years?

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:09.150
Yeah.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.670
They took out three special-grades, right?

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:13.910
Salmon.

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.870
Then...

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.540
We can't fall behind, either.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:21.550
Roe.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.120
Yeah!

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.730
Hey! You were serious that time!

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:31.230
It wouldn't be good training
if I wasn't serious.

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:31.980
Kelp.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.790
Even among sorcerers,

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:38.490
the rank of special-grade is a
position beyond the normal scope.

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:41.760
It's my belief that first-grades

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:47.510
are the ones who ought to lead other
sorcerers and the jujutsu world.

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:50.850
The danger, confidential information, and pay

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:53.490
that they deal with is nothing like
what those semi-first-grade and below do.

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:56.510
So with that in mind,
what did you just say?

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.180
Zen'in Maki,

00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:59.010
Panda...

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.610
Fushiguro Megumi,

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:01.990
Kugisaki Nobara,

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:06.160
and my brother, Itadori Yuji.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.510
These are the five that I,
by my name as Todo Aoi...

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.020
...and I, by my name as Mei Mei...

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.930
...recommend for first grade.

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:24.090
I think you're just buying way too much.

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:25.980
Half of that is yours, right?

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:28.070
Only this one is mine!

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:36.540
Drop even one... and you're dead!

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:38.290
R-Right...

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:49.350
I just said you're dead
if you drop even one!

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:51.770
I'm sorry! It wasn't on purpose!

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:54.910
You just have too many!

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:57.220
This is Fushiguro.

00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:58.240
Yes.

00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.360
Yeah.

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.980
All right. See you.

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:04.320
What?

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:07.280
Gojo-sensei said to come.

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:09.090
Huh? Why?

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:10.970
A mission.

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:12.500
A top secret one.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:13.610
What?

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:16.030
Didn't we just finish taking care of one?

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:17.080
Why not?

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:20.000
Gojo-sensei's saying it's top secret.

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:21.950
So it must be big.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.960
He says that pretty often.

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:25.960
He says it all the time.

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:28.860
Yeah, but so what?

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:31.920
Let's go.

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:38.930
JUJUTSU KAISEN

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:39.930
<b>To Be Continued</b>
