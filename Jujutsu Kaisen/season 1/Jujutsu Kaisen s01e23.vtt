WEBVTT

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.310
Got you!

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.110
What was that blood he spat out?

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.110
Poison?

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.000
What's this?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.570
You're strong.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.470
That's no fun.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.530
Straw Doll Technique:

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.080
Resonance!

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.760
How many of them are there?

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.400
We should just keep going
like it's whack-a-mole, huh?

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.270
Yeah.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.690
Keep going.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.850
Keep exorcising them for me.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.780
We'll crush every last one of them.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.000
It likely won't retaliate.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.890
You mean its main body
doesn't have much offense

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.680
since its technique covers a
wide area, even limited as it is?

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.980
I'm only saying it's likely.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.550
All the things we were worried about—
its technique's range,

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.530
the number of victims, the barrier—

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.870
All of those are subtracting
from its main body.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.500
We're lucky.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.890
We'll be able to exorcise it quickly, then.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.680
Which means... the real
problem comes afterward.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.400
Kugisaki!

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.360
I'll be fine.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.610
You just whack the mole.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.220
Damn it!

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.780
She gets sucked away so often!

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.960
But what was that just now?

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.130
The mole?

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.440
That earlier one?

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.060
It's neither!

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.310
Kugisaki?

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.470
Oh, hey, it's my older brother!

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.900
Me, too!

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:51.770
It fled?!

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.350
Should I let it go?

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.770
Chase after it!

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.780
Kugisaki and that thing both
went outside the barrier!

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.790
She might be battling against something
more troublesome than we expected!

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.250
In contrast, things are far
easier here than anticipated!

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.770
I can handle this by myself!

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.290
Prioritize Kugisaki! Go after it!

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.690
If things get bad in here,

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.640
then you come out, too.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.390
Why, you...

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.680
Don't touch me!

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.320
You're a woman?

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.650
Well, pardon me.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.440
We brothers were tasked with an errand.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.200
But killing jujutsu sorcerers
isn't part of that.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.660
If you withdraw, we'll let you escape,

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.670
young lady.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.170
An errand?

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.160
Hm? I presumed you were
on the same errand.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.570
A cursed spirit? A curse user?

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.170
Which is he?

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.170
And what is that smell?

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:22.490
Last one!

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.490
Your sneak attack's too simple.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.230
I told you, it's too simple.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.670
Did I exorcise them all?

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.700
That takes care of Tsumiki for now.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.220
Now to...

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.010
One survived?

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.670
That wasn't its main body just now?

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.010
The barrier hasn't collapsed, either.

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.010
What?

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.860
I shouldn't try too hard to find logic
in a cursed spirit's behavioral patterns,

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.660
but that fact had been
nagging me this whole time.

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:27.020
Why did it just start killing
humans it had marked now?

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.760
The first one was killed in June.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.560
And in June...

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.010
Our objective here...

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.490
is to retrieve Sukuna's finger.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.810
JUJUTSU KAISEN

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.480
Some have a presence
that's too overwhelming.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.030
Some keep very quiet.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.330
Some have already been
absorbed by a cursed spirit.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.290
This is resonance.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.440
Sukuna's finger kept its power repressed

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.210
within the cursed spirit
that had absorbed it,

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:37.780
but back in June,

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:41.720
when Sukuna manifested in Itadori,
it released its cursed energy.

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:45.110
It looks the same

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.820
as the one from the juvenile detention center,
but it's probably several degrees...

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:57.400
stronger!

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:08.630
Nue!

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:17.200
Okay, I win again.

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:20.410
This is unusual.

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:22.850
You rarely ask me to train you, Megumi.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.650
Are you in a rush after Yuji surpassed you?

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.760
Well, beggars can't be choosers.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:33.280
It bothers you that much to rely on me?

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.730
Megumi, listen.

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:40.290
I think you have just as much ability
and potential as Yuji does.

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:43.670
The problem is just your mindset.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.290
Megumi,

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:48.090
you don't know how to
bring out your best, do you?

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.290
Huh?

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:53.410
Are you saying I haven't
been giving it my best?

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:56.380
I'm not saying you haven't.
I'm saying you can't.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:59.100
For example, in the baseball game the other day...

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.760
Why did you go for a sacrifice bunt?

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:07.940
Did you want Nobara to advance the bases,

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:09.930
even if it meant you'd be out?

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.810
That's a splendid attitude,

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:16.060
but Yuji and I would
always go for a home run.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.610
I'm not saying a bunt is bad.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.620
Baseball is a team sport,

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.910
and everyone has their role to play.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:28.660
But jujutsu sorcery is an individual sport.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.710
Coordinating with other sorcerers
is important, isn't it?

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.630
Sure.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:37.030
But no matter how many
allies you have around you,

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:40.050
when you die, you'll be alone.

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:45.270
You can only piece together
undervalued data on yourself and others.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:50.430
You can't imagine a stronger
future version of yourself.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:52.880
Maybe that's because of your trump card?

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:55.430
You believe that in the worst case,

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:57.590
you can resolve everything
at the cost of your life.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.120
But at that point, forget about me.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.750
You'll never even measure up to Nanami.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:07.060
Dying to win and risking death to win...

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:14.060
are completely different, Megumi.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:16.870
Give it your best.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.000
Be greedier.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:30.880
How many seconds was I unconscious?

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:33.790
My Demon Dog's destroyed...

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:36.480
no, the technique was released.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:43.960
This is it for me.

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:50.080
Sacred treasure, swing...

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.170
What a waste of talent.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.400
Screw it!

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:07.160
A jujutsu sorcerer's growth curve

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.300
isn't necessarily a gentle slope.

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:15.260
Back then, why did you run?

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.370
Spit out the entire depths of my shadow...

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:23.050
Worry about a specific structure later,

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.380
and just push it out as soon
as I collect the cursed energy.

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:33.250
Imagine a future version of myself
who's freely surpassed my limits!

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:35.450
I'll do it!

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:37.410
With a strong foundation,

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:40.330
and a little bit of sense and imagination,

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:44.260
it just takes the slightest trigger
to change a person.

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:47.800
Domain Expansion:

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:55.350
Chimera Shadow Garden!

00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.720
It's incomplete!

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.210
It's ugly work at best.

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:05.030
But for now, that's fine!

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:22.720
Broaden it...

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:26.760
more freely!

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:31.010
The interpretation

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.560
of the technique!

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:04.960
Demon Dog Totality's claws
were able to injure that thing.

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:11.430
They'd have no trouble piercing through
you when you're caught off-guard.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:24.980
I'm tired.

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:31.600
Now, where are those guys?

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:35.870
Good!

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.760
That's good!

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.930
JUJUTSU KAISEN

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.940
JUJUTSU KAISEN

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:07.680
There's one fundamental rule
for interacting with others.

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:10.140
Do you know what that is?

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.820
I don't.

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:15.420
It's "I won't kill you,

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.780
so please don't kill me, either."

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:21.340
You can substitute "kill"
for anything you please.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:25.510
The point is drawing a line where you agree
not to infringe on the other person.

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:28.040
In order for both people to exist together,

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.400
they need that rule.

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:31.830
Breaking that rule, swaggering about,

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.970
and having others trying not to anger you

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.220
must have felt real pleasant.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.940
Next time you do it in
front of me, I'll kill you.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.100
What did we ever do to you?

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.220
Figure it out yourself,

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.610
or go die.

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:49.600
Hey!

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:54.120
T-T-T-T-Today's the day I tell
off Ikezawa and his buddies!

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:57.240
I'm not their gofer anymore!

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.940
You can do it, Aida-shi!

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.000
But I might become their next target,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.120
so don't try too hard, Aida-shi!

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.080
Hey, come on, fatty!

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.510
I'm changing the line!

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:10.840
I'll tell them this fatty is my
replacement starting today!

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.750
You'd sell your friend out, Aida-shi?!

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:14.080
Shut up!

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:15.990
Megumi.

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:20.280
Huh?

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:23.010
Isn't that Ikezawa and his
buddies piled up over there?

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:26.090
You said you wouldn't fight anymore.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.020
Don't act like you're my guardian.

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.520
I hate bad people.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.780
They act so damn superior when
their empathy and imagination

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:41.140
are as empty as a vacant lot.

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:43.760
I can't deal with good people.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:46.970
They forgive those bad people.

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:51.020
Then they view the act of
forgiveness as a noble thing.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.810
Makes me want to vomit.

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:58.360
Tsumiki's a model example of a good person.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.510
You disgust me.

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.460
Oh, sorry.

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.190
I didn't think it'd spill out.

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:12.270
When I was in first grade,

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.040
my father and Tsumiki's mother,

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.490
one parent each, hooked up...

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:21.190
and then vanished without a trace.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.630
A suspicious white-haired man told us...

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:27.460
You know, your dad...

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:31.120
He's from the Zen'in Clan,
a big clan among jujutsu sorcerers,

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:33.980
but they're such good-for-nothings,
it freaks even me out.

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:36.580
Your father left the clan to have you.

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:39.140
Megumi-kun,

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:44.550
your father was saving you as the ultimate
card to use against the Zen'in clan.

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:46.740
Pisses you off, doesn't it?

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:50.650
That solved the mystery of how
they got the funds to disappear.

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.650
Apparently, I had been sold
to that Zen'in clan.

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:56.330
Yeah, it pisses me off.

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:58.860
Especially your lack of tact about it.

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:04.160
Plus, that irritating man stopped
my sale to the Zen'in clan,

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:08.420
and used the promise that I would work
as a jujutsu sorcerer as collateral

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:12.710
to get financial aid from
Jujutsu High to support us both.

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:17.120
What's this jujutsu sorcerer crap, anyway?

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.280
It's bullshit.

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.410
Who the hell would I ever save?

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:22.680
Hey, Tsumiki!

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.480
What are you doing?

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.110
Megumi-kun, ciao!

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.640
Nothing.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.770
Hey, hold on.

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:32.150
So did you give any thought
to the test of courage?

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:35.040
I don't want to go, but I'll go
because I'm worried about you.

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:37.870
Shortly after I started ninth grade,

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:39.960
Tsumiki was cursed.

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:42.980
The identity was unknown.
The origin was unknown.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:46.170
But apparently there were several
victims of the same curse nationwide.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:50.330
All I found out was that
nobody knew anything,

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:52.520
and Tsumiki was left bedridden.

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:56.080
If I have the time to curse someone,

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.630
I'd rather spend it thinking
about those precious to me.

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:01.530
She always smiled and spouted pretty ideals.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:05.360
Not forgiving people isn't a bad thing.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.560
That's just part of your kindness, isn't it?

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.900
She even accepted my disposition.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:17.050
Yet Tsumiki would get genuinely
angry whenever I hurt someone, too.

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:19.970
That irritated me because

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.570
I thought it was hypocritical in light
of her leave-others-be policy,

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:28.900
but now I realize I had the wrong idea.

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.660
Just as I choose who I save,

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:35.200
she was choosing me to worry about.

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:37.290
I'm sorry.

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:39.020
I was just a kid.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.920
I'll apologize.

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:45.360
So wake up already, stupid sister.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.990
Damn, my head hurts...

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:54.520
This Yasohachi Bridge curse
was just overlapping the other one.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:59.150
I doubt the curse that put Tsumiki
into a coma was undone.

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:05.960
Now, how do I break the news
about the finger... to... Itadori...

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:11.950
Fushiguro
Fell
Asleep

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.890
A huge presence suddenly appeared.

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:19.460
Did Sukuna's finger leave the barrier?

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:24.300
If a sorcerer exorcised the finger's host,

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:26.960
they're quite good.

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:29.400
But even if the finger's...

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.540
Even if the special-grade
cursed spirit was defeated,

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.410
they wouldn't come out unscathed.

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:37.460
I hope they're okay.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.190
I misspoke.

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:44.560
Please forget what I just said.

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:46.050
Hold on!

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:49.160
He's going after the finger!

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:51.960
You think you can mock me
by running like that

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.640
and still get away from me?

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.470
I'm a bit insecure about my back, you see.

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:00.000
This is your warning.

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:02.010
If you see my back, I'll kill—

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:03.010
Oh, Kugisaki!
If you see my back, I'll kill—

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:04.130
Oh, Kugisaki!

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:06.010
Oh, brother!

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:13.380
Y-Y-Y-You saw, didn't you?!

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.930
Huh?! Who?!
Sorry, brother!

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:15.920
Sorry, I guess?

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:17.190
It wasn't on purpose!

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:20.680
I'll kill you!

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.020
Then why are you dressed like that?

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.860
Is that the source of this weird smell?

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.540
Because it gets musty!

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:36.290
Rot Technique, Supreme Art: Wing King!

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.050
Death...

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:44.590
by Wasp!

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:17.440
Juju Stroll

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:20.750
Sensei!

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:22.830
Kugisaki!

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:23.770
Huh?
Kugisaki!

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.140
So annoying.

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.750
It's too hot for your craziness.

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:31.030
Fushiguro's getting hit on!

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:34.100
Formation B!

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:35.330
Roger!

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:39.530
Fushiguro-kyun!

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:41.110
Who is that woman?!

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:43.660
Have you forgotten the night
you toasted to my eyes?

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:45.920
Was it all a lie when you said your time
with me was the most enjoyable of all?!

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.910
That night! That night!
Was it all a lie when you said your time
with me was the most enjoyable of all?!

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:48.350
That night! That night!

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:49.210
What?
That night! That night!

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:49.550
What?

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:50.820
Seriously, what?

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:54.730
Could you not touch him so casually, please,

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:56.310
you homewreckers?!

00:22:56.690 --> 00:23:02.260
Megumi-chan has violin practice with me now.

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:05.330
Let's go home, Megumi-chan.

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:08.990
Today I'll have you master
"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star."

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:10.470
It's okay.

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:12.100
Don't mind them. Just go ahead.

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:13.760
The station's straight ahead.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.450
Thank you so much.

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:16.310
Huh?

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:19.010
Okay, seriously, what is this?

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.130
Could you stop? You're embarrassing me.

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:26.880
Explain!

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:29.880
Ow!

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:39.890
Episode 24:
The Origin of Blind Obedience - 3 -
