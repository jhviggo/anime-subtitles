00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.090
Aren't you...

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.600
Gojou Satoru.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.090
I'm in charge of the

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.020
What is this?

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.740
I'm not sure you should
be worrying about others,

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.520

Huh? I thought they already told you.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.540
Oh, please hold on.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.490
I'll go ask myself.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.040
Itadori-san never uses his call button.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.980
It's actually scary that he doesn't.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.980
Itadori-san, you have a phone call.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.950
Yuuji-kun's asking if you
want him to bring any—

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.200
Leave me alone!

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.700
Tell him not to come!

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.950
He should go to his club! His club!

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.550
What? What's going on?

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:09.980
You heard him.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.420

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.890
I heard.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.210
I'll come by tomorrow evening.

object in a place like this?

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.020
Could they be any dumber?

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.120
There's nothing here.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.030
Huh?

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.100
The Stevenson screen's empty.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.270
For real? That's hilarious!

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.770
Maybe it took a nighttime stroll.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.040
I'll punch you.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.370
Well, no going home
until it's recovered, okay?

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.010
I'm seriously going to punch him next time.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.440
You know about our rugby field
being closed off, right?

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:58.720
Yes.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.570
Some of the students who fell
ill were actually hospitalized.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.490
Don't you think that's strange?

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.700
We're talking about tough rugby players here.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.290
Truth is, the players said
they started hearing

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.790
mysterious sounds and voices
right before they fell ill.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.250
That's when we found this newspaper
article from thirty years ago.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.790
It talks about the disappearance of Yoshida-san,
who worked with the construction company,

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:25.800
and it mentions he was last sighted here at
Sugisawa Third High School during construction.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.320
Yoshida-san was struggling to make ends meet,

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.760
so he turned to loan sharks

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.810
and those organizations were after him.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.320
Which means!

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.480
The whole disaster at the
rugby field was caused by

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.210
the vengeful spirit of Yoshida-san,
who's buried there!

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.810
<b>Vengeful Spirit

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:46.330
Hard ticks.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.200
A large, blood-sucking bug.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.140
If one bites you and infects you with SFTS,

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.570
it can be fatal, so be very careful.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:53.920
So what?!

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.330
The occult club is trying
to uncover occult activity,

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.080
so it's still a proper club activity report!

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.230
This isn't some kid's game!

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.760
Besides, the biggest problem is you,

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.180
Itadori Yuuji!

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.380
You're registered with track
and field, not the occult club,

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.490
so this club doesn't even have the
three members required for any club!

<b>Not Enough Members

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.560
No, I know I wrote down the occult club.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.560
I rewrote it!

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.990
The track and field coach, Takagi!

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.940
Itadori, we need you so we
can conquer the nationals!

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.610
A teacher more problematic than
the students just showed up...

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.170
Give it a rest! How many times
do I have to tell you I refuse?

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:29.770
You can't!

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:30.570
Why can't I?!

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.620
However, I'm not some demon!

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.990
If you can beat me, then I'll give up on you.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.500
Let's settle it fair and square on the track!

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.900
Now it's interesting!

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.650
You're on!

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:47.470
Is it "fair and square" to rewrite
a student's club application?

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.910
What's with this rugby field?

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.060
Is there a dead body
buried here or something?

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:01.980
Even if there is,

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.620
I'm surprised to see one this high-leveled.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.060
That's probably a grade 2 curse.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.530

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:26.610

Itadori! Itadori!

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:51.590
They're probably tall tales, but I heard
he beat all stages of <i>Ninja Warrior</i>,
Itadori! Itadori!

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:53.890
and that he's the reincarnation
of Mirko Cro Cop.

Itadori! Itadori!

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:56.830
But Mirko's not even dead yet.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.890
Still, he earned the nickname
"Tiger of West Middle."

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:01.080
Lame.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:06.520
Yep. I won't call any fouls,
so throw however you please.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.590
Sorry.

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:09.950
I wanted to demonstrate how
serious I am by intentionally

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:12.050
choosing something that isn't your forte—

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:16.570
Uh, roughly thirty meters.

He's more gorilla than tiger, isn't he?

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:25.520
That was a pitcher's throw.

Itadori, you'd do well on a sports team.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.260
I told you not to come.
Saitou
Itadori

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:51.270
I told you not to come.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:53.760
Stop buying flowers to bring
with you all the time.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.200
You always give me that.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.240
Besides, these aren't for you.
They're for the nurses.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.680
All the more reason not to, you fool!

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.490
And what about your club?

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:02.970
Go to your club! Your club!

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:04.870
Oh, chill out.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.800
It ends before 5 PM.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.930
I wouldn't be visiting you
if I didn't have the free time.

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.130
Good.

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:14.130
Then listen to me, since I've got free time, too.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:15.680
Not interested.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.180
Just listen well.

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.930
There's something I want
to tell you before the end.

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:21.420
It's about your parents.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.470
I said I'm not interested.
It's about your parents.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:24.140
I said I'm not interested.

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:28.100
Grandpa, could stop trying to
act all cool before you die?

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:31.600
Every man wants to go out in style, you know!

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.790
Get a clue, you useless grandson!

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.070
Quit snapping over everything.

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:38.640
You can just be yourself.

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:42.850
Tsk. Lax upbringing.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.540
Yuuji.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.540
Hmm?

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:54.790
You're a strong kid, so help others.

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:58.900
Even if it's only those closest to you,
just save the people you can.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.380
It's okay if you lose your way,

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.140
and don't worry about whether
they'll thank you or not.

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:06.520
Just save as many people as you can,
even if it's only one.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.530
When you die, you should
be surrounded by people.

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:13.570
Don't end up like me.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:25.520
Grandpa?

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:27.940
<b>Nurse Call</b>

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:30.520
Yes, what's the matter?

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:33.990
Hello?

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:35.170
Itadori-san?!

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.660
Hello?

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.140
My grandpa... is dead.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.570
Notification of Death

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.080
Okay.

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.270
That's all of the necessary paperwork.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:16.620
Okay. Thank you for everything.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.340
Are you sure you're okay?

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:22.330
Well, this is my first time dealing
with something like this,

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.800
so it doesn't feel real yet.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:29.510
Grandpa would snap if I kept
moping around forever, though,

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:31.890
so I'll just have to laugh as I roast him up.

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:33.250
Phrasing!

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:36.860
Itadori Yuuji, right?

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.930
I'm Fushiguro from Jujutsu Tech.

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:42.670
I'd like to have a word with you.

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:43.360
Now.

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:45.990
Um, I'm in mourning right now.

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:47.620
Sorry, but there isn't time.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:50.310
The cursed object you
possess is very dangerous.

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:51.980
Hand it over to me right now.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.370
Cursed object?

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:54.770
This.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.590
Oh, yeah, yeah. I found that.

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:02.510
I don't mind either way,
but my senpai took a liking to it.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:04.250
What do you mean, "dangerous"?

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:07.800
The number of unexplained
deaths and missing persons

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.010
within Japan exceeds
10,000 a year on average.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.540
Most of those are the result of curses.

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:16.530
Curses?

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.710
I don't care if you believe in them or not.

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:20.020
They're real.

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:21.530
I'll go on.

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:26.030
Large pools of negative energy form especially
easily in schools, hospitals, and so on.

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:29.070
Hardship, regret, shame...

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:32.060
The negative emotions of mankind
become the source of curses.

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:37.000
That's why most schools secretly keep a
cursed object such as a protective talisman.

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:39.500
The object you found is one of them.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.260
If it's protecting us, shouldn't
we be grateful for it?

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:43.630
Let me finish.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.820
Placing a cursed object of greater evil

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.140
is a deadly poison that
keeps other curses away.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:51.950
It's a bad practice that
only claims to protect.

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:55.570
Over the years, its seal weakens,

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:59.520
and then it becomes bait to lure
in and fatten up other curses.

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:02.440
The object you found

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:05.540
is a dangerous one,
classified as special-grade.

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:07.450
Hand it over before people start dying.

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.510
Hey, I already said I don't mind that.

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:12.000
So go tell it to my senpai.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.260
It's empty?

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.050
I was just following the
taint clinging to the box?!

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:20.420
Where are the contents?!

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:23.390
I already told you, my senpai... have it...

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:24.970
What?

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:29.050
Actually, they were talking about removing
the talisman from it tonight at the school.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:33.750
What? Is that bad?

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:37.390
It's worse than bad.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:40.530
They're going to die.

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:46.910
I can't get it off.

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:49.730
Did we really need to sneak in to do this?

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:51.030
I'm turning on the lights.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:53.360
No! The atmosphere's important!

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.280
Enjoying the thrill is in the
spirit of the occult club, isn't it?

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.650
It's not like anything's
going to happen, anyway.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:01.550
Oh, it came off!

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:17.350
A human finger?

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:19.350
Is it real?

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:24.540
Is this...

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.520
What is this?

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:35.450
Do talismans come off that easily?

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:38.540
No, it's impossible for people
who lack cursed energy.

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:40.440
Normally.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.900
Go right! It's a shortcut!

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.170
This time the object itself is too strong.

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:48.230
The seal is ancient.
It might as well be plain paper.

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:52.300
I still don't get all this stuff about curses.

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:53.530
Where are they?

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:54.760
Fourth floor!

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:00.800
What is this pressure?

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.440
You stay here.

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:05.150
I'm coming, too!

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:06.440
It's dangerous, right?

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.450
I've only known them a few months,

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.440
but they're my friends. I can't just stand by!

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.700
Stay here.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.070
Occult Phenomenon
Research Club

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:24.000
What time is it?

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:32.050
The hour hand is at eleven.

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:34.080
What is that monster?

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.810
S-Sasaki...

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:38.770
Iguchi? Thank goodness! Where have you—

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:41.920
Help me...

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:48.070
What time is it?

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:50.030
The curse has been unleashed!

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:52.610
Its presence is still all over the place!

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:55.410
Slurp, slurp.

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:56.780
Out of the way!

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.200
Demon Dogs!

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:05.620
Slurp.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:07.300
You can eat it.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:12.320
Am I just going to wait
here like he told me to?

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.630
What am I so afraid of?

00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.220
They're going to die.

00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:19.890
That's right.

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:21.980
I can sense death all the way out here.

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:24.010
I'm afraid of dying.

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:25.660
Was I afraid of it then?

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:28.230
It didn't feel like I was, though.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.510
I didn't cry because I was scared.

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:33.480
I was just a little sad.

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:37.990
But my grandpa's death
and the death I'm facing now...

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:40.490
How are they any different?

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:44.370
You're a strong kid, so help others.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.310
The curses are growing in number.

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:53.390
They're close.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.470
Found them.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.140
He was short-tempered and stubborn.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:09.150
No one but me ever paid him a visit.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.020
"Don't end up like me," huh?

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:14.650
That's true.

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:17.860
Damn it! Is it trying to swallow her
along with the cursed object?!

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:20.820
I'm not gonna make it!

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:31.540
Itadori!

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:35.170
I think you had a proper death, Grandpa.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.510
But...

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:41.080
This death...

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:44.970
is wrong!

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:51.370
So this is a curse?

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:53.070
Not what I was expecting.

00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:00.320
I want to ask you what you're doing here,

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.670
but good job.

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:03.250
Why so haughty?

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:07.450
By the way, what's that
munching on the curse?

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:08.990
My shikigami.

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:10.790
You can see them, then?

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:13.100
Normally a curse can't be seen.

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:16.190
Not unless you're on the verge of
death or in special places like this.

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:18.070
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:20.720
I've never seen a ghost or
anything before tonight.

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:23.720
You're not scared, are you?

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.710
Well, I was scared for a bit.

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:27.860
But did you know?

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:29.690
People really can die.

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:30.690
Huh?

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:36.040
So I at least want the people
I know to have proper deaths.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.540
Not that I really get it myself.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:39.390
Whoa.

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:40.390
This it?

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:41.400
Yeah.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.330
That's the special-grade cursed
object, Ryoumen Sukuna's finger.

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:46.630
It's a miracle it didn't get swallowed.

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:48.050
Why would anything eat it?

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:49.120
Does it taste good?

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:49.960
Don't be stupid.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.440
You'd do it to gain stronger cursed energy.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.460
It's dangerous, so hand it over already.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.110
Sure, sure.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:01.800
Run!

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.310
Fushiguro!

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:14.770
Nue!

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:39.440
Damn it, I can't think straight.

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:41.750
Itadori!

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:44.890
Why can't you understand
to take those two and run?!

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:47.980
You're in big trouble yourself!

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.420
Only curses can exorcise other curses!

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:55.690
You can't beat it!

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.820
Is this the time to be saying that?!

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.320
You're going to die at this rate!

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.990
If I went home now, I'd be having nightmares!

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:06.240
Besides,

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:11.000
I have my own...

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Help others.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.780
...troublesome curse already!

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:26.790
You idiot!

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:29.350
Hand it over to me or you'll be eaten, too!

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.990
Why would anything eat it?

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:36.030
Does it taste good?

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:37.310
Don't be stupid.

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:39.400
You'd do it to gain stronger cursed energy.

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:45.510
There is a way to save everyone!

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:47.950
I just need some cursed energy,
right, Fushiguro?!

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:49.950
Don't!

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:51.380
Don't do it!

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:54.730
Ryoumen Sukuna's finger!

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.380
That's a special-grade cursed object!

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.790
It's a deadly poison! He'll die for sure!

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:01.370
But there's a one in a million...

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:03.300
a one in a million chance...

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:45.550
Ah, I knew it!

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:48.630
The light feels best in the flesh!

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.680
This is the worst!

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.600
A one-in-a-million-chance,
worst-case outcome!

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:55.570
The special-grade cursed
object has incarnated!

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:57.990
A cursed spirit's flesh is so boring.

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:00.980
Where are the people? The women?!

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:04.580
What a wonderful era to be in.

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:08.550
Women and children are crawling
everywhere like maggots.

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:10.800
Marvelous!

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.560
It'll be a massacre!

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:20.390
What do you think you're doing with my body?

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:21.380
Give it back.

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:23.880
How are you able to move?

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.420
I mean, it's <i>my</i> body.

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.510
He's suppressing me?

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:30.880
Don't move.

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:33.600
You're no longer human.

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:39.180
Under Jujutsu regulations, Itadori Yuuji,

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:43.540
I will exorcise you as a curse!

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:55.650

For Myself
