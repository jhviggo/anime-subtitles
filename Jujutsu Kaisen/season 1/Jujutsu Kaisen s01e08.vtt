00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.980
<b>Tokyo Metropolitan
Jujutsu Technical High School</b>

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.440
Cold

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.400
Couldn't they put in a few
more vending machines?

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.460
They can't. There are only so many
workers who can come in here.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:20.670
Huh?

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:22.840
Where are the first-years?

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:24.550
On errands.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.920
Bonito flakes.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.610
Will they be okay?

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:28.290
Salmon.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.660
They're not three years old.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.310
They can handle an errand run.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.390
No, that's not what I mean.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.860
It's today, right?

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.810
The day Kyoto's principal comes.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.600
To go over the exchange event.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.480
Tuna.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.560
Satoru's fighting with the higher-ups
because they arranged for

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.030
the first-years to get dispatched
on that special-grade case, right?

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.550
And the principal of Kyoto is
one of those higher-ups, isn't he?

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.800
So if they run into each other...

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.880
The first-year they were
targeting, Itadori, is dead.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.460
I doubt he has any plans to do
anything about the other two.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.290
Besides, the old man from Kyoto
won't cause a scene in broad daylight.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.520
Salmon.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.850
An instructor might have
his position to worry about,

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.960
but that's not the case for the students.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.920
Are you saying Mai is coming?

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.900
It's just a guess.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.490
Students aren't necessary for a meeting.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.860
But still...

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.660
They love harassing us, right?

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.940
Both Toudou and Mai.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.710
What are you doing here, Zenin-senpai?

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:40.990
Oh, she's one, too?

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.160
They do seem similar. Are they sisters?

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.590
They're twins.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.000
Don't call me that, Fushiguro-kun.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.720
You make me sound the same as Maki.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.590
Call me Mai.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.220
So these are the pinch hitters
for Okkotsu and the third-years?

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.890
We came here with the principal
because we were worried about you.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.320
Your classmate died, right?

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.570
Was that rough?

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.720
Or did you think nothing of it?

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.620
What are you trying to say?

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.650
It's okay.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.810
Some things are hard to say out loud.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.790
So I'll say it for you.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.480
"Vessel" makes it sound nice,

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.200
but it just means he was a half-curse monster.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.240
Having such a tainted,
inhuman being beside you

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.000
brazenly calling himself a jujutsu
sorcerer must have been revolting, right?

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.190
Aren't you feeling better
now that he's dead?

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.630
Mai, don't bring up such pointless topics.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.600
I'm only here to see if these guys
are fit to take Okkotsu's place.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.620
That's all I want to know.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.490
Fushiguro, was it?

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.610
What kind of woman is your type?

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.960
Depending on your answer,

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.570
I'll beat you half to death right here

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:09.040
and drag Okkotsu, or at least the
third-years, out to the exchange event.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:17.680
By the way, my type is a
tall woman with a big ass!

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:35.980
JUJUTSU KAISEN

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.720
Episode 8:  Boredom

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.790
Why do I have to talk about
Episode 8:  Boredom

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.570
my taste in women with a guy I just met?
Episode 8:  Boredom

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:58.860
Episode 8:  Boredom

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.720
He's right. That's a tall hurdle
for an antisocial guy.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.610
You be quiet.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.980
This is confusing enough already.
You'll just make it more complicated.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.240
Kyoto, third-year, Toudou Aoi.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.260
Introduction over.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.560
Now we're friends.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.010
Hurry up and answer.
If you prefer men, that's fine, too.

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.810
A person's fetishes reflect
everything about them.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.820
People with boring taste in women
are boring people themselves.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.580
And I hate boring men.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.550
The exchange event is where my soul can
be free as blood boils and flesh clashes.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:43.380
Who knows what I might do if my
last exchange event ends up boring me?

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.490
Hey, aren't the Jujutsu Tech
schools four-year schools?

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.090
Only third-years and under
can join the exchange event.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.270
Huh...

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:54.880
As a show of kindness, I'll let you
off only half-dead right now.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.340
Answer me, Fushiguro.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.350
What kind of woman is your type?

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.120
Is this some kind of comedy routine?

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.740
Is that your summer uniform?

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.690
Ticks me off, but it's nice.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.690
Kugisaki's unarmed.
I'd rather avoid confrontation.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.530
Not forgiving people isn't a bad thing.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.200
That's just part of your kindness, isn't it?

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.530
I don't have a particular preference.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:28.060
As long as she has unshakable
character, I won't ask for more.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.480
Not a bad answer.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.410
If you had said something like
"big boobs," I'd have killed you.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.010
Shut up.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.420
I knew it.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.840
You're boring, Fushiguro.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.350
Fushiguro!

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.880
Poor Fushiguro-kun.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.960
Even a talented
second-grade jujutsu sorcerer

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.270
is nothing more than a first-year
against the top-grade Toudou-senpai.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.440
I'll have to comfort him later.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.040
I thought you two were similar,
but that's not the case at all.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.350
Maki-san's a hundred times prettier.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.300
Are you not sleeping enough?
You've got open pores.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.970
I'll teach you...

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.650
how to speak to others.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.100
I knew at first glance

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:38.970
that you were a boring guy.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:43.020
But you shouldn't judge a
person by their looks, right?

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:46.250
So I went out of my way to ask you,

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:51.090
but you just trampled on my kindness.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.950
Is your brain as pineapple as your head?

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:59.720
Toudou... That<i> Toudou?</i>

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:02.160
The one involved in last year's

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.420
unprecedented jujutsu terror attack
caused by the curse user, Getou—

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:05.200
<b>Kabuki-cho First Street
unprecedented jujutsu terror attack
caused by the curse user, Getou—</b>

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:05.960
The Night Parade of a Hundred Demons
from Kyoto to Shinjuku.
<b>Kabuki-cho First Street</b>

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.610
The Night Parade of a Hundred Demons
from Kyoto to Shinjuku.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.680
The one who exorcised a special-grade and five first-grade cursed spirits

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.770
by himself when the parade appeared in Kyoto?

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:16.960
That Toudou?

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:20.890
Still, there are several first-grade
sorcerers capable of beating a special-grade.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.810
What's shocking is...

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:26.120
I heard you don't use cursed techniques.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:29.730
Huh? Oh, that rumor's false.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.260
I used them against the special-grade.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.480
He doesn't use them against first-grades?!

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.550
Is he a monster?!

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.620
That's a relief to hear.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.750
Nue, plus Gama!

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.280
Bottomless Well.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.800
I'm up against a hardcore
close-range fighter.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.650
I'll keep my distance and restrain him.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:03.520
He's fast!

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.310
That wasn't his full speed earlier?!

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.810
Flimsy and shallow...

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:09.740
Both your body

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.590
and your taste in women!

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.470
Damn it!

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:29.290
His power is insane!

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.480
I'm not finished yet!

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.820
You're always

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.020
so boring!

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:09.750
I barely feel any intention to fight.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.190
I've been holding back, and you're so proud?

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:15.040
If you're going to insist like that...

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.730
then I'll show you.

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:24.000
Bring it!

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:26.480
Don't move.

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:32.880
What are you two doing?!

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:38.010
Whew, just barely safe.

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:39.760
Bonito flakes.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.910
Okay, I guess that might actually be an out.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.670
Long time no see, Panda.

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:51.990
Why can't you just wait
until the exchange event?

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:56.480
Go on home, or I'll start screaming, "No!"

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.670
You don't have to tell me to go home.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.950
Where'd I put my jacket?

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:06.890
Looks like I won't be bored the whole time.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:13.310
Give Okkotsu a message for me:
"You take part, too."

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.200
What a pain.

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:18.260
I panda. I no understand human speech.

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:19.560
Salmon.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:29.790
If you want to continue as a jujutsu sorcerer,
learn to choose who you pick a fight with.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.320
What are you doing to our errand runner, Mai?

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.920
Oh, my. You're such a loser,
I didn't even notice you, Maki.

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.720
We're both equally losers, you know.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.800
All you can do is imbue objects
with cursed energy,

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.950
and you've got shit for cursed techniques.

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:52.060
Better than having no cursed energy at all.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.760
My neck gets sore looking up
at others all the time,

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.020
so I need to look down on someone
like you every so often.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:01.240
Ah, forget it. We're both at
rock bottom, and it's pathetic.

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:03.620
Nobara, can you stand?

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:04.880
No way.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.770
She won't be getting up for a while.

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:08.530
I hurt her pretty good...

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:12.170
What? You want to fight?

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.020
Nice support, Maki-san!

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:22.420
You put a bunch of holes
in my brand new tracksuit.

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:26.420
Leave that uniform of yours behind.
I'll make it my own summer uniform!

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.990
I'll put holes in your body next time.

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:34.250
Also, you wouldn't be able to wear
this with those long legs of yours—

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.110
Leave it!

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.370
We're leaving, Mai.

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:44.460
What?! No way...

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:46.230
Oh, there's my jacket.

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:48.300
Where's Fushiguro?

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.130
Don't worry. The others are with him.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.420
Looks like you're having fun.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.640
Quit joking! I'm just getting started!

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.640
No, you're not.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:02.380
Unlike you, I still have
important business here in Tokyo.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.340
My personal handshake with Takada-chan!

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.510
Takada-chan
8th single "Youth Mineral" Release Celebration

<b>Tall Idol Takada-chan</b>

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:12.860
Uh-huh...

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:21.220
Who knows what I might do if I miss my
transfer and can't make it to the event hall?

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:24.260
Come with me, Mai.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.800
Ugh! You're so selfish!

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.970
Can't believe I lost the lottery
for the usual one in Kyoto.

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:34.960
Don't go thinking you'll get off
this easy at the exchange event.

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:37.350
Quit acting like you won!

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:39.560
Leave your uniform behind, damn it!

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.170
Cut it out, idiot.

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:43.920
Winning or losing here hardly matters.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.960
We'll beat them up at the exchange event.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:48.930
Hey, Maki-san...

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.320
Is what she said true?
That you don't have cursed energy?

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:54.160
It's true.

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:58.860
So I can't even see curses
without these glasses.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.730
That's why I use cursed tools.

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:03.940
They already have curses imbued in them.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.690
I can't pour my own cursed energy
into them to do things like you all do.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.690
Like that thing he gave Itadori?

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:17.690
Then why are you a jujutsu sorcerer?

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.560
To spite them.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:25.500
I can't wait to see the looks on my family's faces when I become a bigshot sorcerer,

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:29.430
after all the years they've
spent looking down on me.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:33.930
Come on, let's hurry over to see Shouko-san.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:40.240
I respect you, Maki-san.

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:41.690
That so?

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:48.980
JUJUTSU KAISEN

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:53.990
JUJUTSU KAISEN

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.170
Is Yaga here yet?

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:11.680
The time of an old man close
to death doesn't come cheap.

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:17.920
Principal Yaga won't be coming for a while.

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:20.580
Oh?

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.560
He was given a false schedule.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.630
After some threats to Ijichi.

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:32.940
Thank you for the other day,
Principal Gakuganji.

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:36.140
Oh? What other day would that be?

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.080
Don't play dumb with me, old man.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.240
I'm referring to the case with Itadori Yuuji.

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:43.450
As head of the conservatives,
you were involved too, correct?

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:49.520
My goodness, youth these days...

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.710
Don't you know how to be polite?

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.770
I never had any intention of respecting you.

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:58.430
Elders these days love to act important,
and it's so annoying, honestly.

00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:59.590
Hey.

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:02.600
Your conduct is problematic.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.870
I'll be reporting you to
the relevant authorities.

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:08.170
Oh, man!

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:11.120
It's Gojou Satoru in person!
Gojou Satoru in person!

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.500
Feel free.

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:15.010
I don't plan to chat for long.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.880
He spoke! He spoke to me!

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:26.240
Last night, I was attacked by two
unregistered special-grade cursed spirits.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.570
Oh? That is unfortunate.

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:31.770
Don't get me wrong here.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.780
To me, it was about like being coerced
into taking a survey in the city.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.030
So cool!

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:43.630
The two cursed spirits were
capable of communication,

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:46.280
and they probably have
allies who are just as strong.

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:50.810
It's not just our enemies, either.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:53.690
Hakari, Okkotsu, and your Toudou...

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.710
The level of our students has risen
drastically in recent years, as well.

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:02.610
Then there was last year's
incident with Getou Suguru...

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.600
And now, the appearance of Sukuna's vessel.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:12.440
What are you trying to say?

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.340
You don't know?

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.890
The wave of power you guys
have been trying to hold back

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:20.060
with your pointless status and traditions

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:23.360
has grown bigger than you can handle
and is now descending upon us.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.730
You won't be able to measure

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:28.320
the coming age with the
classification of "special-grade."

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.920
If you think I'm the only
one who'll be fighting back,

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.560
you're going to get hurt, old man.

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:39.830
I think you are getting a bit out of line.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.830
Oh, scary!

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:45.320
Well, that's all I wanted to say.
I'll be going now.

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:53.350
Oh, Principal Yaga will be
coming in about two hours.

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:54.710
Later!

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:56.330
Two hours?!

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:04.170
Miwa, would you go buy me some tea?

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:04.730
Yes, sir.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.840
Excuse me.

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:18.320
If I can catch up to him, I'll get
him to take a picture with me!

In the theater?

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:48.660
Wow. You can see me?

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:04.180
It's a gruesome sight.

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:07.780
Are you ready to witness it, Itadori-kun?

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.960
Thank you so much!

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.660
You're welcome.

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:58.420

It's just plain annoying.
