00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.920
Satoru.

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.490
Show him to the dorm.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.940
Explain the security and
everything else to him, too.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.910
Huh?

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.980
You pass.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.960
Welcome to Jujutsu Tech.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.820
Fushiguro!

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.720
You look like you're doing well now.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.200
There were plenty of other
empty rooms, weren't there?

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.700
But isn't livelier better?

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.390
I thought it'd be good for—

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.320
Classes and missions are enough.
I thought it'd be good for—

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.480
Classes and missions are enough.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.840
This was an unwelcome favor.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.400
Wow, it's so organized.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.740
I just said you're unwelcome!

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.270
Well, it's all good.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.510
More importantly, we're heading out tomorrow!

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.050
We're gonna go pick up the third first-year.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.660
The train bound for Shibuya and
Shinagawa is now arriving on track 1.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.360
For your safety, please
stand behind the yellow line.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.360
Saori-chan.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.360
I'm here.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.780
I'm in Tokyo!

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.900
How are there only three first-years?
Isn't that too few?

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.200
Well, have you ever met anyone
who can see curses before?

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.010
Nope.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.520
That just proves how small
a minority jujutsu sorcerers are.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.270
Also, didn't you say I was the third?

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.520
Their entry was decided a while ago.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.040
You know what our school's like.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.260
Everyone has unique circumstances.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.650
Sorry for the wait.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.270
Oh?

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.710
Your uniform made it in time, I see.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.640
Yeah, it's a perfect fit.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.110
Though it's slightly
different from Fushiguro's.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.700
It has a hood, for one.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.340
That's because the uniforms can
be customized upon request.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.020
Huh?

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.740
But I never put in any requests.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.800
I was the one who put in the custom order.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.170
Whatever, I guess.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.640
Be careful. Gojou-sensei has a
tendency to do things like that.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.060
More importantly, why are
we meeting up in Harajuku?

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.090
Because it's what she asked for.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.160
Hey, popcorn! I want some!

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.740
Oh, hello there. Are you
on the clock right now?

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.530
No, I'm not.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.140
You see, I'm looking for potential models.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.070
This is who I am.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.860
Would you be interested?

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.250
I'm in a hurry right now.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.560
Just hear me out!

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.630
Hey, you.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.130
What about me?

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.650
Her?!

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.570
For the modeling gig, duh.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.560
I'm asking what you think about me.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.430
Oh, um, I'm in a hurry at the moment...

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.640
What the hell?

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.780
Don't run from me! Come out and say it!

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.660
We're about to go talk to <i>her</i>?

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.580
I'm sorry! Please let me go!
We're about to go talk to <i>her</i>?

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.770
I'm sorry! Please let me go!

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.840
This is kinda embarrassing.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.610
So are you.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:55.750
Hey!

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.010
Over here!

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.980
Damn, what's up with that blindfold?

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.290
Okay, once again.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.790
Kugisaki Nobara.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.770
Be happy, boys.
I'm the one woman in your group.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.510
Stare...

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.040
Episode 3: Girl of Steel
Stare...

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.160
I'm Itadori Yuuji. I'm from Sendai.
Episode 3: Girl of Steel
Stare...

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.960
Episode 3: Girl of Steel
I'm Itadori Yuuji. I'm from Sendai.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.240
Episode 3: Girl of Steel

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.730
Fushiguro Megumi.
Episode 3: Girl of Steel

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740
Fushiguro Megumi.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.330
He looks like a potato.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.340
He's definitely the type that
ate his own boogers as a kid.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.420
And only a name here?

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.880
I can't stand high-and-mighty dudes.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.840
I bet he likes setting
oil-slicked gulls on fire.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.680
I always get stuck with
unfortunate circumstances.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.440
She took one look and sighed.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.170
Are we going somewhere from here?

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.130
We do have all three of you together.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.180
Not to mention, two of you
are from the countryside.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.590
So of course we're going

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:25.930
on a tour of Tokyo!

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.040
Tokyo! Tokyo! Tokyo!

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.110
We love Tokyo!

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.610
Huh?

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.350
TDL! I want to go to TDL!

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.570
Idiot! TDL's in Chiba!

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.270
Let's go to Chinatown, Sensei!

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.340
Chinatown's in Yokohama!

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.340
Yokohama's part of Tokyo!

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.040
Don't you know that? Look at a map!

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.450
I will now announce our destination.
The hell?! Quit spouting nonsense!

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.470
Roppongi!

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.600
Roppongi?!

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.120
There's a curse here.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.380
You liar!

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.800
This isn't even Roppongi!

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.600
You were toying with us country folk!

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.780
There's a big cemetery nearby.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.090
The double whammy of that and an
abandoned building brought out a curse.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.360
Who does he think is responsible
for the rice he gets to eat, huh?!

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.570
So they really do pop up
more often around graves?
Who does he think is responsible
for the rice he gets to eat, huh?!

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:11.610
Who does he think is responsible
for the rice he gets to eat, huh?!

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.640
The issue isn't the cemetery itself.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.040
It's the fact that people
associate cemeteries with fear.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.630
Oh, it was the same
for schools, too, wasn't it?

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.610
Hold up. He didn't even know that yet?

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.080
To be honest...

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.630
He swallowed a special-grade cursed object?!

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:32.910
Gross! Unbelievable!

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.360
That's so unsanitary and disgusting!

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.700
No way, no way, no way, no way!

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:36.850
What?!

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:37.880
I agree with her.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.560
I want to know what all of you are capable of.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.760
Just think of this as a field test.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.390
Nobara, Yuuji,

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.300
you two go exorcise the
curse inside that building.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.960
Geh.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.240
Huh? But I thought only curses
could exorcise curses, right?

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.640
I can't use any jujutsu yet.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.000
You're basically half a curse already.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.160
There's cursed energy
flowing throughout your body.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.150
Though controlling that energy isn't
something you can learn overnight,

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:05.320
so use this.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.470
It's the cursed tool, Slaughter Demon.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.470
It's a weapon imbued with cursed energy.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.140
It'll work on curses, too.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.530
Lame.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:19.940
Oh, one more thing.

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:22.860
Don't let Sukuna out.

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:27.520
If you use him, you'll get rid
of all the curses nearby in a flash,

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.290
but you'll also drag everyone around into it.

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.390
Got it. I won't let Sukuna out.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:35.870
Hurry it up.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:36.740
Yeah, yeah.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.100
Go on, now!

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:52.100
I think I'll go, too.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.250
Don't push yourself. You're still recovering.

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:57.780
But someone needs to keep
an eye on Itadori, right?

00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:59.210
True.

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:03.630
But the one we're testing
this time is Nobara.

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:05.190
What a pain.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:08.650
Why do I have to deal with curses
after coming all the way to Tokyo?

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.120
Huh? Didn't you come here to exorcise curses?

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.660
Let's save some time and split up.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:18.600
I'll start from the top and go floor by floor.
You start from the bottom.

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.660
Let's get this over with quick
and grab some sushi from Ginza.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:22.860
Hold on a minute.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.630
Let's take this a bit more seriously.

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:26.410
Curses are dangerous, you know.

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.950
I don't wanna hear it from someone
who was a normie until recently!

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.200
Now get moving!

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.370
Your emotions have been
all over the place today!

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.130
This is why girls don't like you!

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.700
How did you know they don't like me?!

00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:47.570
Are you even popular enough to talk? Bitch.

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:03.570
Do... you need... a receipt?

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:05.140
It's a curse!

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:30.170
Yeah, I can really move!

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:33.020
That Yuuji...

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:35.390
He's missing a few up here.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.290
He has no hesitation

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:42.050
when it comes to killing these things
that take the form of living creatures,

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:44.540
albeit bizarre-looking ones, to try to kill him.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:50.460
And it's not like he's been familiar
with curses for a long time, like you.

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:54.460
This is a boy who used to
live a normal high school life.

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:59.410
You've seen plenty of jujutsu sorcerers,
even those with talent,

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:02.300
give up in frustration because
they couldn't conquer

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.300
their fear or disgust, haven't you?

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.750
So today I want to confirm how crazy she is.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.770
Hey, you, curse.

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:23.690
I mean you, mannequin in the center.
You actually think you're hidden there?

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.400
If you won't come out,
I'll just exorcise you there.

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:32.610
But Kugisaki has experience, right?

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:34.250
Little late for that now, isn't it?

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:37.370
Curses are born from human minds.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:41.150
So their strength and numbers grow
in proportion to the population.

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:02.150
Do you think Nobara understands...

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:08.320
that curses in Tokyo are on a different
level than those in the countryside?

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:22.490
Kugisaki

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.860
Curses are born from human minds.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:34.000
So their strength and numbers grow
in proportion to the population.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:39.560
Curses in Tokyo are on a different
level than those in the countryside.

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.520
You might want to pull those out...

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:57.030
or my cursed energy will flow into you.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.560
Nailed it.

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:20.300
A child?

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:24.320
Must have snuck in for some fun
and encountered the curse.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.750
Hey, it's all right now. Come on out.

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:34.980
Huh?!

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:43.130
I guess it's true that kids don't
warm up to beautiful women.

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:44.320
Guess I'll call Itadori.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.070
Wait!

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.310
Don't leave me here!

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.070
It's taking him hostage?

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:13.290
This curse has intelligence?!

00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:17.520
When I say "level," I don't just mean
the amount of cursed energy they have.

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:19.690
It's their cunning.

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:23.570
Monsters that have gained wisdom will
often force cruel choices upon you...

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:28.290
with the weight of human lives in the balance.

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:30.260
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.240
Damn it!

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:35.490
This curse isn't even all that strong!

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:37.000
Grade 4...

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.450
Maybe even lower, like a low grade 3!

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.800
But it's aware of that!

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.970
That's why it chose to take a hostage!

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:49.470
Calm yourself down.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.920
If I die, the child dies, too.

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:57.510
But if the child dies, I won't die.

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:06.400
Logically speaking,
it's better if I survive, at least!

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.300
I'm unarmed.

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:15.490
Let the boy go.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.560
I'm such an idiot!

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:26.750
See? It's not letting him go at all!

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:34.720
I wish I could have seen
Saori-chan one last time.

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:40.870
Huh? I missed?

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:55.310
You okay?

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:56.200
Uh-huh.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:00.850
It's getting away!

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:01.920
I don't think so!

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:02.500
Itadori!

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.780
Give me that arm!

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:04.520
Huh?

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:08.480
I'll exorcise it.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.330
Hold on.

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:12.460
A straw doll?

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:13.520
Creepy.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.380
Straw Doll Technique:

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:21.580
Resonance!

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:31.920
Nice.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.460
She's crazy, all right.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:40.060
We won.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.010
This bridge is dangerous
due to deterioration from age
and can no longer be used.

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.010
When I was in first grade,

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:02.990
Saori-chan moved to our village from Tokyo.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.530
She was as cute as a doll,

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.550
and as kind as a nun.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
<b>Sticker Book</b>

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:35.870
Yet Saori-chan was
ostracized by the villagers.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.480
"She thinks country folk are dumb," they said,

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.480
letting themselves get paranoid,

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:46.380
<b>We Protest the Kitagawa Highway Extension!</b>

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:47.480
and in the end...
<b>We Protest the Kitagawa Highway Extension!</b>

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:52.820

they drove her out.

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:56.490
Home for Sale

00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:59.200
Calling it sickening wouldn't be enough.

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:06.760
She brought all these homemade
sweets I'd never heard of and said,

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:11.790
"The ones from the bakery are even better,"
with a smile as she treated me to them.

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:16.140
This bridge is dangerous
due to deterioration from age
and can no longer be used.

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.260
If I had stayed in that village...

If I had stayed in that village...

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:23.840
This is why I told you

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:26.500
it's dangerous to go alone and
you need to take it seriously!

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.330
You never said it was dangerous to go alone!

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:30.990
I... didn't?!

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:34.950
And what have you been eating that lets you
punch through a wall with your bare hand?!

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:36.960
It wasn't reinforced concrete!

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.900
Even if it was, that'd still be
impossible for most people!

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.790
Most people?

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:47.220
You know, you've asked me
plenty of questions already,

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:49.440
but why did you come to Jujutsu Tech?

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.720
Why?

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:53.760
Because I hate the countryside,

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.930
and I wanted to live in Tokyo!

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:03.870
This was the only way I could move to the city
without having to worry about money!

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:06.220
You can risk your life over that?

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:10.850
I can.

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.280
After all, it means being true to myself.

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:24.410
If I had stayed in that village,
I'd be as good as dead.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:38.220
Saori-chan, I made it to Tokyo.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:44.390
If we ever meet here,

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:48.980
take me to that bakery you mentioned.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:57.680
So as far as that goes, I'm grateful to you, too.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.010
There wouldn't have been

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:02.900
a bright future if I had died or
I had been the only one to survive.

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:04.930
Thanks.

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:10.040
Well, having a more serious reason
doesn't make anyone better than the rest.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.770
Okay, I've given you my
thanks, so that's all over!

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:14.720
We're even now!

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.150
What's wrong with her?

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:20.280
I live over there! Thanks again!

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:26.560
Did you know I get into a
foul mood when I'm hungry?

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.720
When are you not<i> in a foul mood?</i>

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:32.400
Good Joseph!

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:34.820
We made sure the kid got home.

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:38.450
Now shall we go grab some food?

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:40.690
Steak!

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:41.990
Sushi!

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:45.200
Leave it all to me!

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.050
And you, Megumi?

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.130
Okay, let's go.

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:58.030
Oh, I forgot about my
biggest haul of the day.

00:19:58.290 --> 00:19:59.340

I thought we were even.

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:07.350
We won thanks to my cursed energy.
Got a problem with that?

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:09.670
What about my raw strength?

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:11.950
Your monstrous power
from eating weird shit?

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:13.580
It's not just that!

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:14.790
Right, Fushiguro?

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.060
Huh? What's the matter, Fushiguro?

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:18.830
Nothing.

He's pouting because he
didn't get to join in.

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:23.090

Ugh! Fushiguro, say something to him!

Gojou-sensei's paying, anyway.

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:09.890
Revolving sushi is its own thing,

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:12.700
just like how yakisoba and instant
yakisoba are different things!

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.510
And I want to eat sushi.

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:17.440
Sushi's just a meal, but
revolving sushi's a leisure activity!

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:19.370
Like a theme park! Or TDL!

00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:21.680
Also, Kugisaki, you said you
were from the country too,

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:23.520

a revolving sushi place?!

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:25.630
My favorite is Sushi Go,

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:27.760

for someone's first time.
