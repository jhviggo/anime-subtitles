WEBVTT

00:00.984 --> 00:07.074
11:14 P.M., SHOTO BUNKAMURA STREET,
OUTSIDE THE CURTAIN

00:11.234 --> 00:13.039
No, Ms. Kugisaki.

00:13.981 --> 00:15.750
Mr. Nanami said so too.

00:16.161 --> 00:19.542
And the reason I didn't tell
you about Miss Ieiri was…

00:19.543 --> 00:23.008
To prevent me from
taking such reckless actions, right?

00:23.903 --> 00:27.678
That's also why they came so late.

00:29.888 --> 00:31.266
Even so…

00:31.267 --> 00:35.734
I can't leave while
they are still fighting.

00:35.735 --> 00:37.522
Wait!

00:37.523 --> 00:39.482
Ms. Kugisaki!

00:57.930 --> 01:00.923
(Episode 43: Right and Wrong Part 2)

01:11.600 --> 01:15.645
(JUJUTSU KAISEN Shibuya Incident)

02:39.292 --> 02:43.147
Maybe I should have asked
Dagon to leave more humans.

02:45.725 --> 02:47.360
Never mind, it's enough.

02:50.360 --> 02:51.572
Damn it.

02:59.226 --> 03:00.389
Are you okay?

03:04.652 --> 03:05.652
Hmm.

03:11.627 --> 03:12.966
Damn.

03:51.153 --> 03:52.153
Not bad.

04:05.513 --> 04:07.857
As she avoided my hands,

04:08.408 --> 04:11.611
she probably got the report
from 7:3 Hairstyle Sorcerer.

04:11.860 --> 04:13.529
You are so cold.

04:22.951 --> 04:25.295
But I'm a clone.

04:26.915 --> 04:29.336
I can change my own shape,

04:29.337 --> 04:31.423
but I can't control transfigured humans

04:31.729 --> 04:34.787
or interfere with others' souls.

04:38.126 --> 04:41.516
She actually helped me greatly
by wearing down her own spirit.

04:43.884 --> 04:47.271
Didn't I tell you? This won't work on me.

04:47.912 --> 04:49.357
You know it, right?

04:50.862 --> 04:54.403
Sometimes, even if you know it,
you still have to do it.

04:55.215 --> 04:56.440
STUPID

05:00.870 --> 05:02.176
Take this.

05:03.865 --> 05:05.206
Hairpin.

05:05.446 --> 05:06.738
She jumped down.

05:06.739 --> 05:08.293
What is she doing?

05:08.294 --> 05:09.836
Another one.

05:13.438 --> 05:14.840
Hairpin.

05:16.101 --> 05:17.935
The nails on the ground…

05:20.556 --> 05:22.640
I've been thinking

05:23.616 --> 05:26.502
ever since I heard about your technique.

05:26.503 --> 05:29.146
This should work on you.

05:30.805 --> 05:32.755
Resonance!

05:41.827 --> 05:43.286
Kugisaki…

05:46.677 --> 05:50.126
No way!

05:50.617 --> 05:52.733
My opponent

05:53.060 --> 05:56.298
turns out to be not just Yuji Itadori.

05:59.166 --> 06:00.511
Strange.

06:01.344 --> 06:05.684
Why do I feel my cursed energy
has erupted not far away?

06:06.062 --> 06:08.781
And your cursed energy
isn't strong enough.

06:08.782 --> 06:12.232
You could've touched me forcibly just now.

06:12.615 --> 06:13.706
Hey, you.

06:14.642 --> 06:17.779
A clone can't use any techniques.

06:19.418 --> 06:20.890
You are right.

06:33.596 --> 06:35.797
The impact of the technique lingers.

06:38.221 --> 06:41.010
I can't move freely yet.

06:46.892 --> 06:47.892
Kugisaki.

06:49.413 --> 06:50.413
Thank you.

06:54.245 --> 06:56.805
I couldn't save anyone,

06:56.806 --> 06:59.612
and everyone's effort is wasted.

07:00.264 --> 07:01.781
Even so…

07:04.529 --> 07:07.927
Thankfully you made me
realize I'm not alone.

07:08.488 --> 07:09.688
So…

07:10.874 --> 07:11.874
Right here.

07:14.999 --> 07:16.253
I want to

07:17.785 --> 07:19.285
kill you!

07:20.138 --> 07:21.876
Since "Resonance" can harm him,

07:21.877 --> 07:25.263
he won't launch continuous
attacks as he did just now.

07:26.103 --> 07:28.099
The real show is about to begin.

07:32.183 --> 07:33.309
No.

07:34.703 --> 07:36.341
I will leave!

07:37.948 --> 07:38.948
What?

07:39.230 --> 07:40.230
Stop!

07:41.334 --> 07:44.201
Although I could ignore him and head
straight to the fifth floor underground,

07:44.202 --> 07:48.411
if I let him be, there'll be more trouble.

07:56.154 --> 07:57.462
Going down?

07:57.671 --> 07:59.939
Good, I'll exorcise him first,

07:59.940 --> 08:02.216
then head directly to
the fifth floor underground.

08:08.435 --> 08:09.824
He split up.

08:10.365 --> 08:11.365
Which one?

08:12.369 --> 08:14.036
One of the clones

08:14.037 --> 08:17.773
must contain the critical
part of the soul.

08:21.443 --> 08:22.938
He took the bait.

08:23.385 --> 08:25.406
Damn, I was tricked by the cursed energy.

08:33.996 --> 08:35.541
There are two of Mahito?

08:36.462 --> 08:39.405
Did he create clones and act separately?

08:39.406 --> 08:41.923
Now he wants to unite to heal himself?

08:50.257 --> 08:51.457
What…

08:58.187 --> 08:59.398
Itadori?

09:01.923 --> 09:06.030
Run, Kugisaki!

09:13.635 --> 09:14.888
Nice shot.

09:17.201 --> 09:18.292
Don't get in the way!

09:19.294 --> 09:20.628
Kugisaki!

09:22.478 --> 09:23.903
So…

09:23.904 --> 09:28.511
I only touched 7:3 hairstyle sorcerer once
and couldn't completely get rid of him.

09:30.328 --> 09:31.832
What about her?

09:42.560 --> 09:46.041
2009

09:53.224 --> 09:55.746
Heck, take this!

09:57.503 --> 09:59.388
Nobara, that won't do.

09:59.389 --> 10:01.794
You need to stop your opponents
from returning to the field.

10:03.684 --> 10:05.297
At that time…

10:05.845 --> 10:07.342
Come on.

10:07.839 --> 10:11.220
I thought everyone in the village was mad,

10:11.943 --> 10:16.893
and I was the only normal person.

10:21.354 --> 10:23.013
(JUJUTSU KAISEN)

10:26.352 --> 10:28.008
(JUJUTSU KAISEN)

10:38.237 --> 10:40.631
You have to use the school bag
until sixth grade.

10:40.632 --> 10:42.192
Are you sure you want this one?

10:42.193 --> 10:43.193
Hmm.

10:43.944 --> 10:46.284
Although mother tried to persuade me,

10:46.285 --> 10:48.966
I still chose the water-blue school bag.

10:49.483 --> 10:53.429
When I was about to start primary school,
our whole family moved to this village.

10:54.583 --> 10:57.670
My parents were concerned about
the inconvenience of rural life,

10:57.671 --> 11:01.312
but I just didn't want to be
separated from my friends.

11:03.518 --> 11:05.649
There were only 19 students
in the entire school,

11:06.055 --> 11:07.818
not 19 ones in a class.

11:08.617 --> 11:11.155
Everyone carried a red
or black school bag.

11:11.954 --> 11:14.575
I also liked red or black one,

11:15.258 --> 11:18.621
but it seemed everyone
hated the water-blue one.

12:00.997 --> 12:03.291
Thank… Thank you.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.520
Fumi.

12:07.521 --> 12:10.423
Give me your school bag, let's swap.

12:13.341 --> 12:15.386
Swap with me.

12:17.634 --> 12:20.641
Watch this!

12:29.053 --> 12:31.568
Number one in Japan!

12:32.414 --> 12:34.446
Hello, Kugisaki.

12:34.723 --> 12:35.483
Oh no.

12:35.660 --> 12:38.696
Kugisaki, it's you again?

12:38.697 --> 12:43.122
So noisy, old man, don't come here!

12:45.033 --> 12:48.377
She returned my school bag
to me on the same day.

12:48.907 --> 12:51.446
I hate carrying a school bag.

12:53.460 --> 12:56.755
Since that day, Nobara has
often stayed in my house

12:56.756 --> 12:59.263
to play video games with my father.

13:00.130 --> 13:02.349
Your gliding skill has improved.

13:03.903 --> 13:07.188
Nobara didn't like
the people in the village.

13:08.137 --> 13:10.399
Because the village is too small,

13:11.012 --> 13:14.930
being strangers is even
harder than being friends.

13:17.202 --> 13:21.202
At that time, I thought it was great.

13:22.724 --> 13:24.042
A few years later,

13:24.043 --> 13:27.416
when an old lady nearby brought
me a bowl of red bean rice,

13:27.942 --> 13:32.796
I understood what Nobara said.
It does make people uncomfortable.

13:36.211 --> 13:37.319
Fumi.

13:38.503 --> 13:40.637
I found a secret base.

13:45.913 --> 13:49.273
Nobara would say things
that children don't usually say.

13:49.274 --> 13:51.482
But sometimes she said
something like this too.

13:52.304 --> 13:54.819
From today on, I'm going to live there.

13:55.207 --> 13:59.596
Looking back now, she must
have learned it from someone.

13:59.597 --> 14:01.492
Her mother, for example.

14:05.493 --> 14:06.493
Here.

14:08.521 --> 14:11.960
The secret base Nobara talked about
was actually someone else's house.

14:13.988 --> 14:15.964
You really came.

14:17.356 --> 14:19.968
Come in, it's cold outside.

14:22.222 --> 14:24.791
The girl's name is Saori.

14:24.792 --> 14:27.643
She moved to this village
later than I did.

14:34.440 --> 14:37.229
We would always drop by unexpectedly.

14:37.230 --> 14:40.364
But she always welcomed us graciously,
never showing any signs of annoyance.

14:41.220 --> 14:45.118
Come to think of it,
Saori always stayed at home.

14:46.059 --> 14:47.524
Ever since we met Saori,

14:47.525 --> 14:49.248
Nobara changed.

14:49.520 --> 14:52.614
Yes, that's right.

14:52.615 --> 14:54.503
Your talk like Matsuko.

14:55.241 --> 14:58.048
Fumi, let me practice braiding pigtails.

14:58.662 --> 14:59.925
Again?

15:01.405 --> 15:03.579
Her tone of speech became softer.

15:03.580 --> 15:05.071
How should I put it?

15:05.072 --> 15:08.092
It's as if she has become more elegant.

15:10.393 --> 15:12.274
Though we were both outsiders,

15:12.275 --> 15:15.857
I felt so much inferior
to Saori in every aspect.

15:19.865 --> 15:21.585
After a while,

15:21.586 --> 15:24.408
things at Saori's home started to be off.

15:26.450 --> 15:30.988
There was trash, graffiti,
and deliberately accumulated snow.

15:31.715 --> 15:35.280
That made the grand
house look frightening.

15:44.670 --> 15:47.364
And not long after that,

15:48.987 --> 15:50.946
Saori moved away.

15:52.502 --> 15:55.124
Nobara and I went to say goodbye to her.

15:55.125 --> 15:57.517
I can no longer remember

15:57.792 --> 16:01.696
what was said or how the weather was.

16:03.067 --> 16:04.107
All I remember is

16:05.006 --> 16:09.453
Nobara's face was covered in tears.

16:11.143 --> 16:13.161
I didn't know she could cry.

16:13.162 --> 16:18.170
Perhaps the shock of that is why
I can't remember anything else.

16:25.855 --> 16:27.535
This June,

16:29.030 --> 16:32.858
Nobara decided to go
to Tokyo for high school.

16:37.415 --> 16:41.902
It seemed that she chose to leave at this awkward
time because of a fight with her grandma.

16:42.818 --> 16:46.014
I'm leaving. I will never return here.

16:46.015 --> 16:49.076
Fumi, you should also leave this village.

16:51.126 --> 16:52.326
Mmm.

16:53.181 --> 16:55.632
You aren't crying when you leave me.

16:55.633 --> 16:58.472
Such a terrible idea
flashed through my mind.

16:58.473 --> 17:00.546
It left me speechless.

17:01.674 --> 17:05.676
After that day, we never
mentioned Saori again.

17:09.284 --> 17:10.484
Fumi.

17:11.567 --> 17:13.892
The next time we meet,
it'll be the three of us.

17:38.497 --> 17:39.617
Mmm.

17:56.513 --> 17:59.521
Saori, do you want to take a break?

18:02.945 --> 18:06.580
No, I need to finish
the proofreading today.

18:06.581 --> 18:08.613
No, I think it's yesterday.

18:09.483 --> 18:11.575
It's still today before sunrise.

18:25.065 --> 18:28.169
I have a pimple.

18:28.170 --> 18:31.053
Something is wrong in Shibuya.
Is it a terror attack?

18:33.060 --> 18:36.392
Senior, do you plan to get married?

18:38.501 --> 18:39.780
Why do you ask?

18:41.576 --> 18:44.274
I just think it shouldn't
have been like this.

18:45.525 --> 18:48.496
I moved to a super rural place
when I was in the eighth grade.

18:48.497 --> 18:49.649
A job transfer of your parents?

18:49.650 --> 18:54.453
No, because my mom is a crazy woman obsessed
with organic food and spiritual enlightenment.

18:54.454 --> 18:56.494
I see.

18:58.834 --> 19:03.352
I met two girls there who were
seven years younger than me.

19:03.353 --> 19:07.256
The girl named Nobara
was very clingy towards me.

19:09.677 --> 19:11.860
Because I'm an only child,

19:11.861 --> 19:15.222
I thought she was so cute.

19:15.223 --> 19:18.308
So I acted like a big sister,
hoping she would look up to me.

19:23.565 --> 19:26.024
I would serve them with black tea.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.611
They were only in the first grade then.

19:30.685 --> 19:31.905
That's cute.

19:35.767 --> 19:38.954
I didn't exchange contact
information with her,

19:39.867 --> 19:42.672
because I was afraid we
would gradually drift apart.

19:44.746 --> 19:48.672
She even cried when I left the village.

19:50.033 --> 19:51.233
But…

19:51.649 --> 19:56.138
If she sees how ordinary I am now,
she'll probably be very disappointed.

20:00.466 --> 20:02.852
I wonder how Nobara is doing.

20:03.673 --> 20:06.356
What is she doing now and where is she?

20:13.822 --> 20:17.784
Everyone in the village was mad.

20:18.520 --> 20:20.370
That's not really the case.

20:21.042 --> 20:23.666
It's just that those with issues
are particularly loud.

20:24.199 --> 20:27.065
It made me think that everyone but me

20:27.066 --> 20:31.047
would mindlessly trample
upon others' lives.

20:38.373 --> 20:41.433
But that's not necessarily true.

21:04.058 --> 21:05.540
Sorry, Fumi.

21:09.855 --> 21:12.715
I can't keep our promise.

21:19.285 --> 21:22.557
Itadori, tell everyone this for me.

21:25.014 --> 21:26.820
"I've had a pretty good life."

21:52.961 --> 21:53.961
Kugisaki.

23:25.750 --> 23:28.110
The first time I got off at Tokyo station,

23:28.111 --> 23:32.467
I was put off by the atmosphere where
I was forced to stand behind a truck.

23:32.468 --> 23:35.021
Now I don't mind at all.

23:35.022 --> 23:37.155
(Next Episode: Right and Wrong Part 3)

23:37.156 --> 23:39.613
Life is more interesting with some stains.
