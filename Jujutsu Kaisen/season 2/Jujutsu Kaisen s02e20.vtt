WEBVTT

00:11.950 --> 00:13.620
Oh, crap!

00:14.160 --> 00:17.000
Look what you've done, Kugisaki.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.290
This shirt belongs to Mr. Gojo, right?

00:25.420 --> 00:27.300
MR. IJICHI
Mr. Ijichi handed over

00:27.300 --> 00:30.440
MR. IJICHI
the freshly laundered shirt to us and left.

00:31.010 --> 00:32.760
ME
And I spilled the coffee.

00:33.300 --> 00:34.510
So who's to blame?

00:34.510 --> 00:35.560
You.

00:37.020 --> 00:40.270
- Do it gently.
- I am just doing it.

00:48.440 --> 00:51.280
It looks like the \"Marimekko\" style.

00:51.280 --> 00:52.950
Don't underestimate fashion.

00:52.950 --> 00:55.660
Well, it's probably cheap anyway.

00:55.660 --> 00:58.250
Fushiguro, check the brand on the label.

01:04.920 --> 01:07.420
250,000 YEN

01:07.420 --> 01:09.920
I-Is tax included?

01:09.920 --> 01:11.100
No.

01:11.100 --> 01:12.590
But is that the point?

01:14.330 --> 01:17.300
Fine, I'll give 90,000 yen.

01:17.740 --> 01:19.390
You guys each pay 80,000 yen.

01:20.390 --> 01:21.520
Good morning.

01:21.520 --> 01:24.050
Ijichi said you guys had my shirt...

01:25.610 --> 01:27.080
What's wrong, Megumi?

01:27.530 --> 01:28.820
Nothing.

01:57.260 --> 01:59.180
Kugisaki...

02:08.360 --> 02:11.010
No... No...

02:12.950 --> 02:14.570
Kugi...

02:26.000 --> 02:27.090
I found my ability...

02:27.630 --> 02:29.210
...is truly terrifying!

02:30.960 --> 02:32.170
I am...

02:32.630 --> 02:33.970
I am the real...

02:34.880 --> 02:36.890
\"Curse\"!

02:40.010 --> 02:41.560
Black Flash!

02:47.620 --> 02:49.270
I bet you thought...

02:49.730 --> 02:51.480
...you were going to kill demons...

02:51.800 --> 02:54.740
...like in fairy tales here, right?!

02:57.410 --> 03:00.540
You came with that mindset, right?

03:01.240 --> 03:03.620
Don't be naive, punk!

03:04.290 --> 03:07.080
This is war!

03:07.580 --> 03:10.590
It's not a war to correct mistakes!

03:10.590 --> 03:13.300
But a battle to impose our
self-proclaimed right ideas...

03:13.670 --> 03:17.550
...on each other!

03:22.310 --> 03:25.600
You are me, Yuji Itadori.

03:30.270 --> 03:33.700
I kill people without thinking,

03:34.690 --> 03:38.820
just like how you save people
without thinking!

03:38.820 --> 03:44.080
Our instincts are against the so-called
dignity obtained by human reason!

03:44.080 --> 03:50.210
This war is about to decide who will remain
a hundred years from now!

03:51.540 --> 03:57.590
How could you possibly defeat me
if you didn't even realize that?

04:03.310 --> 04:05.850
Hey, Yuji Itadori.

04:06.560 --> 04:09.600
Have you ever counted
the curses you've killed?

04:11.940 --> 04:14.730
No, right? Me neither.

04:15.400 --> 04:19.240
Because it doesn't matter
how many humans I've killed.

04:20.740 --> 04:24.870
And I'll forget about you in due time.

04:33.920 --> 04:37.630
The sound of the Gion Shoja bells...

04:38.420 --> 04:41.590
...echoes the impermanence of all things.

04:42.970 --> 04:46.020
The color of the sala flowers...

04:47.430 --> 04:51.230
...reveals the truth
the prosperous must decline.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.070
But,

04:58.190 --> 05:00.500
we are the exceptions.

05:02.950 --> 05:05.950
EPISODE 44: RIGHT AND WRONG PART 3

05:16.500 --> 05:20.590
JUJUTSU KAISEN SEASON 2:
SHIBUYA INCIDENT

06:35.960 --> 06:37.540
23:09 DOWNTOWN METRO SHIBUYA STATION,
FIFTH FLOOR UNDERGROUND

06:37.540 --> 06:39.170
SHINTOSHIN LINE PLATFORM
Are these people...

06:39.920 --> 06:41.670
KYOTO HIGH FIRST YEAR, ARATA NITTA
...still alive?

06:47.720 --> 06:52.390
It seems Suguru Geto has left
with Prison Realm.

06:52.390 --> 06:53.730
How come...

06:54.890 --> 06:56.230
Let's change our mindset.

06:56.940 --> 06:59.820
Instead of fighting to save Satoru Gojo,

06:59.820 --> 07:05.110
we fight to weaken the enemy
in order to save our companions.

07:05.110 --> 07:08.700
Our purpose has completely changed.

07:10.490 --> 07:11.700
Hurry up.

07:11.700 --> 07:14.140
My brother must be nearby.

07:15.710 --> 07:17.670
So he has a brother.

07:17.670 --> 07:19.920
I thought he was an only child.

07:24.130 --> 07:25.880
What happened here?

07:26.840 --> 07:28.260
That scar on his face...

07:28.640 --> 07:30.850
We just switched places!

07:30.850 --> 07:33.020
Is he the sorcerer
who cornered Hanami?

07:33.350 --> 07:34.280
Senior Todo.

07:34.280 --> 07:36.770
I've already provided first aid
to the girl over there.

07:36.770 --> 07:39.020
But she's probably dead.

07:39.020 --> 07:41.570
So please don't blame it
on me afterward, okay?

07:41.570 --> 07:44.530
Enough talking.
Help my brother too.

07:44.920 --> 07:46.570
Get up, brother!

07:46.570 --> 07:49.200
Our battle is just beginning!

07:49.200 --> 07:50.280
A jinx?

07:52.330 --> 07:55.120
To... do...

07:57.120 --> 08:00.540
I... can't...

08:02.960 --> 08:04.360
...fight anymore.

08:05.840 --> 08:09.590
It's not just Kugisaki...
Nanami died too.

08:11.390 --> 08:15.430
Sukuna killed so many people.

08:15.430 --> 08:16.350
So...

08:17.140 --> 08:22.230
I tried to help more people...

08:23.360 --> 08:25.650
But I just can't do it!

08:25.650 --> 08:28.610
I'm nothing but a murderer!

08:28.610 --> 08:34.330
What I thought to be my conviction,

08:34.330 --> 08:37.370
turned out to be only my excuses!

08:42.170 --> 08:46.130
I...

08:48.010 --> 08:49.430
I can't forgive myself.

08:50.380 --> 08:54.220
I can't hear you
because your voice is so low!

09:11.320 --> 09:12.530
Interesting!

09:12.530 --> 09:15.160
Even though I know his tricks,
he still got me!

09:16.080 --> 09:17.620
Brother.

09:17.620 --> 09:21.420
You should never belittle yourself.

09:21.960 --> 09:24.000
We are Jujutsu Sorcerers.

09:24.710 --> 09:25.670
Whether it's me,

09:25.670 --> 09:27.170
you,

09:27.170 --> 09:28.550
Kugisaki,

09:28.550 --> 09:30.000
Mr. Nanami,

09:30.840 --> 09:35.130
or any other companions,
we are all Jujutsu Sorcerers.

09:36.180 --> 09:38.520
As long as we're alive,

09:38.520 --> 09:43.690
our friends who died
haven't really been defeated!

09:44.480 --> 09:47.040
This isn't about sin or punishment.

09:47.650 --> 09:50.820
From the moment
we chose to become sorcerers,

09:50.820 --> 09:56.200
our lives are no longer subject to karma.

09:56.740 --> 10:00.910
Sometimes it's disrespectful to the dead

10:00.910 --> 10:04.120
to try to find meaning
or reason for each life lost.

10:04.710 --> 10:05.960
Even so!

10:08.130 --> 10:10.710
What have those people entrusted to you?

10:14.590 --> 10:17.600
There's no need to find
the answer immediately.

10:18.060 --> 10:22.480
But you must not stop
before you find the answer.

10:23.270 --> 10:26.560
For the Jujutsu Sorcerers who are alive,

10:26.560 --> 10:28.360
this is the punishment we must bear.

10:30.610 --> 10:34.860
I don't need to tell him that yet.

10:43.210 --> 10:45.170
I used my cursed technique on you.

10:45.670 --> 10:47.420
Listen carefully, Itadori.

10:48.040 --> 10:51.800
Your current injuries
won't continue to worsen.

10:52.420 --> 10:54.940
They haven't healed,
but the bleeding has stopped.

10:54.940 --> 10:56.680
The pain will also gradually lessen.

10:56.680 --> 10:59.000
But this applies only
to your current injuries.

10:59.810 --> 11:01.350
If you get attacked again,

11:01.350 --> 11:05.850
new wounds will still appear and they're
beyond the reach of my technique.

11:06.400 --> 11:09.060
Todo's brother doesn't
look like him at all.

11:09.940 --> 11:12.650
I treated that girl over there
in the same way.

11:14.490 --> 11:16.660
Although her breathing
and pulse have stopped,

11:16.660 --> 11:18.490
it hasn't been very long.

11:18.490 --> 11:20.430
She still has a chance to be saved.

11:21.410 --> 11:24.160
I'll take her away now.

11:24.830 --> 11:26.620
It's not a zero percent chance, okay?

11:26.620 --> 11:28.920
So don't get your hopes too high.

11:30.590 --> 11:31.590
Yes...

11:33.010 --> 11:33.830
Yes!

11:34.840 --> 11:37.930
Have you finished?

12:27.310 --> 12:31.060
What's wrong?
Aren't you going to touch me?

12:32.020 --> 12:33.900
He's really good.

12:33.900 --> 12:38.320
He keeps a distance from Itadori
while dealing with my attack.

12:38.860 --> 12:41.190
I've got some more for you.

12:43.830 --> 12:45.540
Just a dodge?

12:45.540 --> 12:47.330
Come on! Let's switch positions!

12:47.680 --> 12:51.210
I'll see through your trick and hit you!

12:51.520 --> 12:54.090
I really want to use that move again.

12:54.630 --> 12:57.340
I can feel that I am just one step away

12:57.840 --> 13:01.340
from the true essence of my soul!

13:05.220 --> 13:07.230
Sorry, Nanamin.

13:08.240 --> 13:10.020
I was about to take the easy way out.

13:10.890 --> 13:14.980
I was about to use my sins
as an excuse to escape.

13:18.150 --> 13:19.880
I will leave the rest to you.

13:20.990 --> 13:22.750
Black Flash!

13:32.710 --> 13:33.710
From now on,

13:34.420 --> 13:37.640
I will suffer in your
place as well, Nanamin.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.390
You are still alive?

13:55.730 --> 13:57.020
Welcome back.

13:57.520 --> 13:58.300
Yeah!

14:00.030 --> 14:04.030
SUBWAY INFO: SHIBUYA STATION
IS CURRENTLY CLOSED

14:07.700 --> 14:10.450
The battle will end soon.

14:10.450 --> 14:13.210
It's meaningless to rush to Shibuya now.

14:13.790 --> 14:14.790
Go back.

14:15.480 --> 14:16.420
Miwa.

14:30.810 --> 14:33.940
Why did you only ask for Todo and Nitta?

14:34.270 --> 14:38.270
Based on my judgment, Todo has a 99%
chance of survival if he goes to Shibuya.

14:39.070 --> 14:41.640
The same goes for Nitta.

14:42.110 --> 14:44.030
His technique will be useful.

14:44.030 --> 14:45.320
What about me?

14:50.080 --> 14:53.910
Am I not useful?

14:58.630 --> 15:01.670
It's not about that anymore.

15:02.260 --> 15:03.920
It's not just you.

15:03.920 --> 15:08.350
Mai, Kamo, Nishimiya, Utahime.

15:08.350 --> 15:13.230
I have arranged for them to go
to the south of Kyoto on the 31st.

15:14.100 --> 15:16.230
Why didn't you say anything?

15:16.940 --> 15:19.020
Why didn't you talk to me about it?

15:19.770 --> 15:21.860
Aren't we friends?

15:24.570 --> 15:27.530
Is it because I'm too weak?

15:27.530 --> 15:30.370
No, I'm the one who's weak.

15:31.740 --> 15:34.140
Because I'm weak, I used the wrong method.

15:34.620 --> 15:38.720
Because I'm weak, I couldn't
follow through with my mistake.

15:45.670 --> 15:47.980
There was someone I really liked.

15:48.510 --> 15:50.470
I thought no matter how the world changed,

15:50.970 --> 15:53.640
it'd be okay as long as I was
by her side and protected her.

15:59.190 --> 16:01.570
Even if the person
she hoped to protect her...

16:02.900 --> 16:05.110
...might not be me.

16:21.540 --> 16:22.170
Time's up.

16:22.670 --> 16:23.380
Miwa.

16:23.380 --> 16:24.380
No!

16:24.800 --> 16:27.050
Goodbye.
Thank you for—

16:27.050 --> 16:29.550
Don't say that!

16:30.550 --> 16:31.180
Miwa.

16:31.180 --> 16:32.300
Mechamaru!

16:32.720 --> 16:33.180
Miwa.

16:35.310 --> 16:36.980
You have to be happy.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.230
No matter how you do it,

16:41.230 --> 16:43.150
as long as you are happy,

16:43.150 --> 16:45.480
my wish will have come true.

16:51.490 --> 16:52.870
Mechamaru...

17:05.130 --> 17:08.470
Miss Utahime, the things Mechamaru did...

17:08.920 --> 17:11.730
Never mind.
The person is dead anyway.

17:12.590 --> 17:15.220
He really underestimated us.

17:16.180 --> 17:17.100
Yes.

17:17.100 --> 17:19.770
He also said Todo wouldn't die,

17:19.770 --> 17:22.600
and we're sure to die if we go.
That doesn't matter.

17:23.690 --> 17:27.520
Whoever makes my cute junior cry must die.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.790
Exchange places with an inanimate object?

18:07.610 --> 18:08.730
He split?!

18:23.830 --> 18:26.210
Soul Multiplicity, Body Repel!

18:44.940 --> 18:48.860
The spiritual residue
of this guy is very intact.

18:48.860 --> 18:51.530
But can I kill him
with one touch now?

18:52.360 --> 18:56.320
Itadori's soul only has about 10% left.

18:56.910 --> 19:00.570
And my soul still has about 40% left.

19:01.290 --> 19:03.660
My duplicate was crushed.

19:03.960 --> 19:07.580
Itadori's attacks and Black Flash
also wore down a lot of my soul.

19:08.420 --> 19:11.960
It's all that woman's fault.

19:11.960 --> 19:15.480
A piece of trash like her
managed to hurt me in the end.

19:16.640 --> 19:19.390
Exchanging places is a hassle.
I'll kill him first.

20:47.930 --> 20:49.190
Brother!

20:56.820 --> 20:59.280
If that is enough to satisfy you...

20:59.280 --> 21:02.820
...we will no longer be best friends.

21:03.740 --> 21:07.450
This cursed spirit successfully
used Black Flash.

21:08.290 --> 21:11.290
Now the person who's left behind is me.

21:11.670 --> 21:13.970
You have become stronger, brother.

21:14.420 --> 21:18.170
Are you willing to maintain
the status quo, Aoi Todo?

21:18.510 --> 21:21.640
Are you going to leave
Itadori alone again?

21:21.640 --> 21:23.300
Aoi Todo?

21:43.200 --> 21:45.700
Takada!

21:46.450 --> 21:48.500
Black Flash!

21:58.380 --> 22:00.800
No matter how powerful your attack is,

22:00.800 --> 22:02.800
and how many times
you use Black Flash,

22:02.800 --> 22:07.060
it's meaningless
if you can't hurt my soul.

22:16.190 --> 22:17.000
However,

22:17.980 --> 22:21.000
from now on, all three of them...

22:22.200 --> 22:22.950
KISS
Kiss.

22:22.950 --> 22:27.730
...have reached 120% of their potential.

22:34.540 --> 22:36.210
Soul Multiplicity!

22:36.210 --> 22:37.980
Body Repel!

22:40.670 --> 22:43.590
A full-range attack that makes
exchanging places meaningless.

22:43.590 --> 22:45.890
He is getting serious!

23:15.580 --> 23:18.130
Try harder, Itadori!

23:18.450 --> 23:20.000
This is our last chance...

23:20.000 --> 23:23.300
...to curse each other!

23:25.800 --> 23:28.720
Heroes always appear late.

23:28.720 --> 23:32.220
But don't forget, people who fight
till the moment the hero appears

23:32.220 --> 23:34.310
are also heroes.

23:34.690 --> 23:36.640
Next Episode: \"Transformation.\"

23:36.640 --> 23:39.250
Don't forget to get
a certificate of delay.
