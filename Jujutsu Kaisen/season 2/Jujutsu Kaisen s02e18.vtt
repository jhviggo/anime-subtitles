00:01.760 --> 00:04.492
Why should I be sentenced to death?

00:04.493 --> 00:06.636
It's all your fault.

00:06.637 --> 00:08.927
I don't want to regret the way I live.

00:08.928 --> 00:14.312
But what if the person you save
ends up taking someone else's life?

00:14.313 --> 00:17.531
You're going to die amidst a crowd.

00:17.532 --> 00:21.367
You've already been
sentenced to a secret execution.

00:21.368 --> 00:25.051
Anyway, I've already decided
how I'm going to die.

00:25.594 --> 00:31.309
Are my mother and I both cursed by people?

00:31.310 --> 00:33.101
What is the correct way to die?

00:34.164 --> 00:36.853
The value of life becomes vague.

00:36.868 --> 00:39.941
Even the worth of important
people can become unclear.

00:40.947 --> 00:42.444
I'm scared of that.

00:43.322 --> 00:45.483
It's all your fault.

00:45.484 --> 00:49.010
You're going to die amidst a crowd.

00:49.011 --> 00:50.914
Go help others.

00:50.915 --> 00:53.246
I can't die.

00:54.085 --> 00:59.118
So, I never regretted saving you.

00:59.119 --> 01:01.349
Then we are accomplices.

01:01.350 --> 01:05.092
I will never lose again.

01:05.093 --> 01:07.169
I will win.

01:07.170 --> 01:10.732
Go to the underworld and
apologize to my brothers.

01:10.733 --> 01:13.245
You're strong. Go help others.

01:13.246 --> 01:16.233
Are you ready, Itadori?

01:16.234 --> 01:18.803
People will die. It's inevitable.

01:18.804 --> 01:21.482
Then I hope at least
they can die properly.

01:21.483 --> 01:26.203
When you get killed by a curse, will you
also blame your grandfather for it?

01:26.204 --> 01:30.504
I hope when I die,
there will be many people sending me off.

01:30.505 --> 01:33.803
I noticed that among the lives I took,
some of them could also cry.

01:33.804 --> 01:37.452
Those people died because of you.

01:41.012 --> 01:44.005
(Episode 42: Right and Wrong)

01:54.598 --> 01:58.761
(JUJUTSU KAISEN Shibuya Incident)

04:54.261 --> 04:56.072
Malaysia.

04:57.756 --> 05:01.077
That's right. Malaysia.

05:01.798 --> 05:03.454
I should go to Kuantan.

05:04.077 --> 05:07.915
I'll build a house on an empty beach.

05:07.924 --> 05:12.205
The books that I bought but never read
have piled up like a mountain.

05:12.206 --> 05:18.655
I want to read them slowly,
as if I'm retrieving the time lost.

05:19.259 --> 05:24.642
No, I should go to save Fushiguro now.

05:25.351 --> 05:29.426
Where are Maki and Mr. Naobito?

05:29.427 --> 05:31.232
What happened to them?

05:35.013 --> 05:38.865
I'm tired. I'm really tired.

05:39.651 --> 05:41.850
Yes, I'm tired.

05:44.665 --> 05:47.957
I've done enough.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.998
Here you are.

08:14.332 --> 08:17.899
I'm here, as always.

08:26.686 --> 08:28.617
Here you are.

08:30.093 --> 08:33.236
I'm here, as always.

08:33.237 --> 08:35.458
Would you like to say a few words?

08:35.950 --> 08:39.295
After all, you've played
with me many times.

08:46.202 --> 08:48.225
Haibara,

08:48.226 --> 08:52.257
in the end, what do I want to do?

08:52.258 --> 08:55.901
I once ran away.

08:55.902 --> 08:59.732
But I came back for a vague reason
like sense of achievement.

09:07.889 --> 09:09.395
No,

09:10.402 --> 09:12.203
this isn't right.

09:18.378 --> 09:20.836
No, Haibara.

09:23.105 --> 09:25.010
I can't say such things.

09:25.011 --> 09:28.135
This could become a curse on him.

09:32.786 --> 09:34.350
Nanami...

09:46.600 --> 09:48.239
No.

09:52.330 --> 09:53.469
No...

10:01.511 --> 10:03.128
Itadori.

10:19.840 --> 10:22.022
I'll leave the rest to you.

10:51.870 --> 10:53.721
What is this?

10:55.983 --> 11:00.294
What is this, Mahito?

11:00.295 --> 11:03.536
You don't have to shout. I can hear you!

11:03.537 --> 11:05.900
Yuji Itadori!

11:20.618 --> 11:22.500
Save me.

11:31.688 --> 11:33.553
Save me.

11:38.307 --> 11:39.500
Soul Multiplicity.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.562
Body Repel.

12:15.452 --> 12:17.830
If you stood firmer,

12:17.831 --> 12:20.266
I might be able to punch
through your face.

12:23.885 --> 12:29.338
Why did you kill

12:29.339 --> 12:32.837
so many people?

12:37.924 --> 12:42.585
If I count and kill while looking
troubled, will you be satisfied?

12:42.586 --> 12:44.322
I'll do that next time.

12:45.522 --> 12:47.156
Regarding your endless prattle,

12:47.157 --> 12:50.045
I'll respond in the same way.

12:51.063 --> 12:52.889
Yuji Itadori.

12:55.431 --> 12:58.092
Save me.

13:00.754 --> 13:02.808
You are me.

13:05.272 --> 13:07.441
Don't get mad over everything.

13:07.442 --> 13:09.606
This is just the curse talking nonsense.

13:13.470 --> 13:14.804
But still,

13:15.831 --> 13:18.031
as long as you don't acknowledge this,

13:21.443 --> 13:23.495
you are destined to lose to me.

13:24.158 --> 13:28.006
You talk too much...

13:28.014 --> 13:29.544
Is this your last words?

13:30.530 --> 13:32.587
I'll leave the rest to you.

13:33.784 --> 13:35.205
If it were Nanami,

13:35.206 --> 13:38.261
he wouldn't lose his cool out of anger.

13:39.365 --> 13:41.512
I want to prove

13:41.513 --> 13:42.513
- you're a...
- I'm a...

13:46.314 --> 13:48.676
Jujutsu Sorcerer.

15:44.648 --> 15:47.013
Not bad, keep it up.

15:49.868 --> 15:51.977
The second round begins.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.993
(JUJUTSU KAISEN)

16:00.109 --> 16:02.070
(JUJUTSU KAISEN)

16:02.071 --> 16:03.503
11:19 P.M., SHIBUYA STATION,
DOGENZAKA TICKET GATE

18:12.564 --> 18:13.744
Oh no.

18:14.278 --> 18:17.339
If I take a risk and mess up,
I'm as good as dead.

18:17.340 --> 18:20.477
For now, I'll mainly attack
the transfigured humans.

18:20.478 --> 18:21.678
How terrifying.

18:22.228 --> 18:24.350
He has more moves than before.

18:33.479 --> 18:34.540
Brat.

18:34.541 --> 18:36.517
Hey, hurry over here.

18:36.518 --> 18:39.332
There are tons of monsters there.
It's too dangerous!

18:39.333 --> 18:41.272
That guy is

18:41.273 --> 18:42.710
up there?

18:44.228 --> 18:45.382
I'm sorry.

18:45.732 --> 18:48.499
No place in Shibuya is safe now.

18:48.500 --> 18:50.150
You should keep away...

18:51.888 --> 18:54.243
Damn it, he...

19:03.258 --> 19:05.212
Hey, you.

19:07.399 --> 19:10.312
Don't you think you lack some imagination?

19:10.313 --> 19:11.318
Stop.

19:11.319 --> 19:14.721
Are you an idiot? It's up to you.

19:15.171 --> 19:18.900
This trick is more effective
against Itadori's soul.

19:18.901 --> 19:22.479
Also, we'll have one more trump card

19:22.480 --> 19:25.518
that's enough to crush you.

19:25.519 --> 19:29.098
- What?
- Wait...

19:29.099 --> 19:35.158
Alright, swallow...

19:37.005 --> 19:38.386
Yeah.

19:38.387 --> 19:40.372
I have enough in storage.

19:40.373 --> 19:42.662
As for the humans except ones below,
deal with them as you please.

19:43.128 --> 19:46.217
Then let's continue with
the Killing Itadori Show.

19:47.745 --> 19:48.822
No!

19:48.823 --> 19:49.875
Jogo.

19:50.800 --> 19:52.620
Then come get me.

19:55.488 --> 19:59.279
I'll go underground,
and you stay up there.

19:59.280 --> 20:01.394
Wait for me to call you back.

20:01.395 --> 20:04.029
I know that already.

20:04.030 --> 20:05.294
That's true.

20:07.080 --> 20:07.804
RUNNING IN BOTH DIRECTIONS

20:08.464 --> 20:09.810
Bye-bye.

20:15.969 --> 20:17.197
He escaped.

20:21.863 --> 20:24.834
Mahito!

20:24.909 --> 20:26.367
11:16 P.M., DOGENZAKA ALLEY

20:26.367 --> 20:27.908
11:16 P.M., DOGENZAKA ALLEY
Did you see that?

20:27.909 --> 20:29.642
11:16 P.M., DOGENZAKA ALLEY
Ridiculous, right?

20:29.643 --> 20:32.841
I was wandering there not long ago.

20:33.399 --> 20:34.958
Patchface...

20:34.959 --> 20:36.297
Is it you?

20:36.298 --> 20:39.932
The special grade cursed spirit
that messed with our guy?

20:40.688 --> 20:42.409
How annoying.

20:42.410 --> 20:44.096
Am I a celebrity?

20:44.482 --> 20:47.856
Yeah, you're the famous one
who ran away cowardly.

20:49.605 --> 20:51.266
Not bad.

20:51.267 --> 20:52.986
You are worth my time to kill.

20:53.537 --> 20:56.490
I haven't shown anything
good today anyway.

20:58.105 --> 21:02.351
As I remember,
his technique is related to souls.

21:02.352 --> 21:04.706
And I can't touch his hands.

21:05.967 --> 21:08.917
At least, I have to
exorcise a worm that ran away.

21:09.670 --> 21:11.404
I have to recall

21:11.405 --> 21:13.379
the core of Cursed Energy

21:13.380 --> 21:15.425
that I grasped back then.

21:17.602 --> 21:18.807
Terrible aiming.

21:28.412 --> 21:29.412
Hairpin.

21:37.805 --> 21:38.805
Very impressive.

21:39.377 --> 21:42.327
But this is basically
ineffective against me.

21:42.969 --> 21:47.249
It seems
she's probably close with that guy.

21:48.011 --> 21:50.924
I might as well show
her corpse to Yuji Itadori

21:50.925 --> 21:54.131
to severely damage his soul.

23:25.843 --> 23:27.341
Psychological test.

23:27.342 --> 23:31.436
Who do you remember most vividly? The one
you like the most or the one you hate the most?

23:31.437 --> 23:33.329
The result will be announced
after the release of the title.

23:33.330 --> 23:35.394
(Next Episode: Right and Wrong Part 2)

23:35.395 --> 23:39.933
If your mind is filled with past thoughts,
it means you're a homebody.
