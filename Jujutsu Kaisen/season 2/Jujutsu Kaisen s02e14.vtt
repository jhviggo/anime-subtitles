WEBVTT

00:08.250 --> 00:09.450
Nee-sama!

00:26.060 --> 00:27.140
So cramped.

00:30.140 --> 00:31.530
I get it now.

00:40.280 --> 00:43.110
Step 1, restrain me in a coffin.

00:43.620 --> 00:46.030
Step 2, bury me under a gravestone.

00:46.860 --> 00:49.560
Step 3, start a three count.

00:50.140 --> 00:53.130
And that's as far as this domain's
guaranteed-hit effect applies.

00:53.130 --> 00:55.290
It is a special-grade disease curse.

00:55.880 --> 00:59.890
If I don't break out of the coffin
before the count is up,

00:59.890 --> 01:03.500
I'll contract that disease and die.

01:16.940 --> 01:19.140
The real issue is that gravestone.

01:19.700 --> 01:23.710
If I eat that attack twice more,
I'll no longer be able to move, as well.

01:23.710 --> 01:27.210
I wouldn't want to fight
Geto-kun in that state.

01:28.220 --> 01:29.830
Ui Ui, are you all right?

01:30.500 --> 01:32.250
Yes, Nee-sama.

01:35.520 --> 01:38.600
It's probably reflexively
targeting the person with

01:38.600 --> 01:40.920
the strongest cursed energy in its domain.

01:42.720 --> 01:46.370
Only two crows were sucked
into the domain with me.

02:03.120 --> 02:04.400
I was right.

02:06.090 --> 02:07.610
So in order to take it down,

02:07.850 --> 02:10.880
I'll have to shift its target to Ui Ui

02:10.880 --> 02:14.270
so he can buy me time to operate freely.

02:15.020 --> 02:19.770
But Ui Ui will die after taking
one hit from that gravestone.

02:22.450 --> 02:23.500
Ui Ui...

02:25.680 --> 02:27.900
Will you die for me?

02:31.740 --> 02:35.210
Are you sure that's all right? May I die for you?

02:54.660 --> 02:57.380
The moment I released my cursed energy,

02:57.380 --> 02:59.470
Nee-sama suppressed hers.

02:59.870 --> 03:02.090
I understand everything now,

03:02.090 --> 03:03.330
Nee-sama!

03:24.150 --> 03:28.120
Did you think I only brought
that boy to carry my things?

03:30.620 --> 03:32.870
Nee-sama's request that I risk my life

03:32.870 --> 03:35.670
is the signal permitting me
to use my cursed energy.

03:35.670 --> 03:36.150
New Shadow Style: Simple Domain
is the signal permitting me
to use my cursed energy.

03:36.150 --> 03:36.860
New Shadow Style: Simple Domain

03:37.150 --> 03:40.260
Ui Ui's role is dealing with domains.

03:40.770 --> 03:44.350
It goes against my principles
to owe anyone anything.

03:44.350 --> 03:47.130
So I leave that aspect up to him.

04:25.330 --> 04:32.700
What do you think is the greatest way
to instantly boost a sorcerer's base power?

04:33.400 --> 04:36.150
It's using a pact that
puts your life on the line!

04:36.150 --> 04:38.730
Right, Nee-sama?!

04:38.730 --> 04:39.650
Yes!

04:39.650 --> 04:43.900
The crowning attack of Nee-sama's cursed
technique, Black Bird Manipulation,

04:43.900 --> 04:45.520
is Kamikaze: Bird Strike!

04:46.540 --> 04:49.640
She forces her crow to commit
suicide, which in return

04:49.640 --> 04:52.240
removes the limit on a crow's
normally feeble cursed energy,

04:52.240 --> 04:54.040
as she makes them slam into her opponent.

04:54.520 --> 04:57.770
No human is able to stop her Bird Strike,

04:57.770 --> 05:00.740
with the sole exception of Satoru Gojo.

05:09.060 --> 05:11.890
Okay, everyone, it's the main event.

05:13.930 --> 05:17.130
Will you die for me?

05:18.010 --> 05:19.730
Not bad.

05:20.250 --> 05:22.980
For a modern sorcerer.

05:22.980 --> 05:25.990
Episode 38
Fluctuations

05:36.540 --> 05:41.060
JUJUTSU KAISEN
Shibuya Incident

06:56.380 --> 06:59.540
Satoru Gojo has been sealed, huh?

06:59.540 --> 07:01.750
I feel like I've been bushwhacked.

07:01.750 --> 07:03.460
Me, too.

07:03.460 --> 07:07.590
Geto-san is involved, though,
even if he is a fake.

07:07.590 --> 07:10.220
I imagine the trick lies there.

07:10.940 --> 07:16.760
I'd be happy to toast
the fall of the Gojo clan.

07:18.660 --> 07:21.130
Go home if you're not going to help!

07:21.430 --> 07:23.660
Go home, huh?

07:23.660 --> 07:26.820
That's what you should be doing, Maki.

07:27.370 --> 07:30.150
Right, grade 1 sorcerer, Nanami-dono?

07:30.150 --> 07:31.540
Maki-san,

07:32.260 --> 07:35.440
you should do what he says in this regard.

07:35.440 --> 07:37.910
I'll be far more useful than some drunkard.

07:37.910 --> 07:38.800
<b>22:20  Shibuya Station, Inokashira Line
Avenue Exit</b>

07:38.800 --> 07:40.330
Have you been drinking?
<b>22:20  Shibuya Station, Inokashira Line
Avenue Exit</b>

07:40.330 --> 07:40.780
<b>22:20  Shibuya Station, Inokashira Line
Avenue Exit</b>

07:40.780 --> 07:42.460
No, I hafn'h been dwinking.
<b>22:20  Shibuya Station, Inokashira Line
Avenue Exit</b>

07:42.460 --> 07:44.670
<b>22:20  Shibuya Station, Inokashira Line
Avenue Exit</b>

07:45.510 --> 07:49.020
I guess there's never been a case
where I was better off alone.

08:00.590 --> 08:01.570
Nanami-san.

08:02.050 --> 08:02.810
Yes.

08:10.500 --> 08:11.820
I'll take this one.

08:20.980 --> 08:27.130
You guys are a bit too slow.

08:36.130 --> 08:37.420
Did you see that?

08:37.830 --> 08:38.720
No.

08:39.300 --> 08:41.720
It must be his technique.

08:57.850 --> 09:02.870
How many people have you eaten?

09:08.430 --> 09:10.520
Jogo...

09:14.890 --> 09:17.080
Mahito...

09:18.290 --> 09:20.220
Hanami...

09:21.900 --> 09:26.990
Hanami!

09:28.910 --> 09:30.700
How dare...

09:30.700 --> 09:33.690
How dare you kill Hanami?!

09:33.690 --> 09:36.100
...kill Hanami?!

09:37.200 --> 09:40.780
I see. No wonder you were weak.

09:42.140 --> 09:45.870
You were still only a Curse Womb, then.

09:53.210 --> 09:54.460
Water?!

10:04.870 --> 10:06.860
And such a vast amount of it!

10:12.050 --> 10:13.780
Cursed spirit,

10:14.530 --> 10:20.200
do you know how many frames there
are in one second of animation?

10:20.200 --> 10:23.030
It's not "cursed spirit." I am Dagon.

10:23.030 --> 10:27.800
There's a modern tendency to
raise resolutions and frame rates.

10:27.800 --> 10:31.620
There's Hanami, Jogo, and Mahito, too.

10:31.620 --> 10:37.110
Upscaling to 4K, and 60fps
frame interpolation...

10:37.110 --> 10:38.630
We all...

10:38.630 --> 10:43.230
They don't cause anyone any trouble
when done for personal use, so that's fine.

10:43.230 --> 10:49.270
However, modern TVs have their damn
frame interpolation set to "on" by default!

10:49.270 --> 10:54.300
It's not like "unwanted favor"
has become a dead phrase already!

10:54.300 --> 10:56.920
Nothing is more lamentable than that!

10:56.920 --> 10:58.480
Creating that soap opera effect...

10:58.480 --> 11:01.030
We all have names!

11:01.030 --> 11:04.610
Don't you agree that's uncultured?!

11:19.840 --> 11:21.100
Whoa there.

11:40.580 --> 11:42.420
No damage.

11:42.420 --> 11:46.470
Or rather, it feels more
like he has endless HP.

11:58.880 --> 12:02.300
I can't believe two grade 1s like
us couldn't exorcise it together.

12:02.300 --> 12:04.890
What dire straits.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.010
Shit!

12:06.010 --> 12:08.530
If the old man hadn't used his technique,

12:08.530 --> 12:10.810
I would have died there.

12:11.810 --> 12:13.140
I'm ashamed.

12:13.140 --> 12:15.650
A defensive barrier of water, huh?

12:15.650 --> 12:18.660
Can you produce large-scale attacks
at the same time, too?

12:18.660 --> 12:20.140
You have too much cursed energy.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.900
You still have several
techniques left, right?

12:22.900 --> 12:24.920
So what should I do?

12:25.990 --> 12:27.740
That's easy.

12:27.740 --> 12:29.740
I'll kill you quickly,

12:32.010 --> 12:33.750
before you can use your technique!

12:37.520 --> 12:38.840
Impossible!

12:47.050 --> 12:49.970
Of course, you can hover, too, right?

12:49.970 --> 12:52.580
I'd escape upward, too.

12:56.560 --> 12:58.810
I can't activate my technique!

13:06.360 --> 13:08.200
It's this man!

13:08.880 --> 13:11.220
It's this man's fault!

13:20.480 --> 13:21.990
He's fast!

13:21.990 --> 13:24.410
Probably faster than Jogo!

13:31.510 --> 13:33.110
Projection Sorcery.

13:33.110 --> 13:35.880
The cursed technique of Naobito Zen'in.

13:35.880 --> 13:40.560
It splits one second into 24
frames from his field of view,

13:40.560 --> 13:45.270
and allows him to trace the actions
created in those frames at the start.

13:45.270 --> 13:46.940
While the technique is active,

13:46.940 --> 13:49.560
anyone Naobito touches
with his hand must also

13:49.570 --> 13:53.870
define their actions
within 1/24th of a second.

13:53.870 --> 13:56.530
If they fail to do so,
then their action hangs,

13:56.530 --> 13:59.190
and they remain frozen for one second.

14:01.990 --> 14:03.710
There are risks.

14:04.480 --> 14:08.160
The actions defined cannot
be edited halfway through.

14:08.160 --> 14:12.140
Creating actions that excessively
ignore physics and paths of motion

14:12.140 --> 14:15.270
will result in him freezing, as well.

14:25.940 --> 14:30.850
Still, with his innate sense
for frame beats and time,

14:30.850 --> 14:36.730
he's managed to become the fastest
sorcerer, aside from Satoru Gojo.

14:41.070 --> 14:42.660
I won't let you.

15:05.300 --> 15:07.960
JUJUTSU KAISEN

15:10.380 --> 15:12.970
JUJUTSU KAISEN

15:19.320 --> 15:21.330
Domain Expansion:

15:26.380 --> 15:28.630
Horizon of the Captivating Skandha.

15:32.500 --> 15:35.540
Shikigami?! So this is the domain's
guaranteed-hit attack?

15:35.540 --> 15:37.140
I didn't notice them until they struck.

15:37.580 --> 15:40.790
No, they didn't even exist until they hit.

15:42.670 --> 15:44.810
Secret Art: Falling Blossom Emotion.

15:45.230 --> 15:48.740
An anti-domain technique passed
down among the big three clans.

15:48.740 --> 15:52.820
Like Simple Domain, the user does
not activate their own domain,

15:52.820 --> 15:55.990
and instead, the moment the domain's
guaranteed-hit attack activates,

15:55.990 --> 15:59.740
it protects the user by countering
with their own cursed energy.

16:00.370 --> 16:02.800
I knew that man was
different from the others.

16:02.800 --> 16:04.660
I'm done testing their strength.

16:04.660 --> 16:09.560
I'll split my power, 70% to the mustached man,
and 30% to the man in a suit.

16:09.560 --> 16:13.880
Activate technique: Death Swarm!

16:18.620 --> 16:19.660
Maki-san!

16:19.660 --> 16:23.350
The shikigami aren't
heading straight for us!

16:23.350 --> 16:27.360
They'll be gouging out our
flesh in the next instant!

16:27.360 --> 16:28.790
Don't think about it!

16:28.790 --> 16:32.570
The moment you feel contact,
cut them down one after another!

16:32.570 --> 16:35.740
That's the best you can manage
with your scant cursed en—

16:38.990 --> 16:40.140
Nanami-san!

16:48.920 --> 16:52.180
The surge of shikigami isn't abating at all.

16:52.180 --> 16:55.590
Is it possible the technique
embedded into this domain is—

17:05.100 --> 17:05.690
Falling—

17:05.690 --> 17:10.940
The sea is the source of all life.

17:14.530 --> 17:15.740
Weak.

17:15.740 --> 17:17.740
You're first.

17:20.960 --> 17:26.160
Death Swarm is a swarm of
endlessly emerging shikigami.

17:34.620 --> 17:36.880
If you're gonna call me weak,

17:37.270 --> 17:39.310
then kill me in a single blow,

17:40.700 --> 17:42.020
Octobitch.

17:43.290 --> 17:46.390
Then I'll devour you...

17:46.930 --> 17:47.920
Shit!

17:49.050 --> 17:51.610
...just like the other two.

17:57.320 --> 17:58.480
Maki-san!

17:59.160 --> 18:00.290
Megumi!

18:05.420 --> 18:08.460
You really are...

18:10.640 --> 18:13.210
one hell of a cheeky underclassman!

18:14.080 --> 18:15.120
It's him!

18:15.810 --> 18:17.260
That octopus!

18:17.260 --> 18:19.130
He's the source of this domain!

18:19.720 --> 18:23.890
You dare infiltrate my domain on your own?

18:25.700 --> 18:27.140
How foolish.

18:28.980 --> 18:30.290
What?!

18:45.490 --> 18:49.860
The guaranteed-hit effect
of my domain is gone!

18:50.560 --> 18:54.460
That boy is deploying his domain.

18:54.460 --> 18:58.810
Right now, his domain and
mine are playing tug-of-war.

18:58.810 --> 19:01.410
In order to regain my guaranteed-hit effect,

19:01.410 --> 19:05.100
I'll have to crush his domain first.

19:05.410 --> 19:07.650
Easily done!

19:28.780 --> 19:29.820
The other two?

19:30.180 --> 19:31.800
Ino-san tapped out.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.500
Itadori's acting on his own.

19:33.740 --> 19:36.100
I'll protect you.

19:36.100 --> 19:38.630
Please focus on your domain.

19:41.630 --> 19:43.000
That man...

19:43.000 --> 19:47.080
He endured Death Swarm for roughly a minute?

19:48.140 --> 19:50.020
The mustachioed man, too!

20:03.620 --> 20:06.440
You only took one measly right arm.

20:07.760 --> 20:11.080
But it had 71 years in it.

20:11.080 --> 20:13.090
That's going to cost you!

20:20.940 --> 20:23.800
If this state keeps up, we have a chance.

20:24.900 --> 20:26.500
If<i> it keeps up.</i>

20:31.880 --> 20:33.330
Nanami-san!

20:35.100 --> 20:40.370
That octopus currently thinks our
domains are pushing for control.

20:40.370 --> 20:42.530
But my goal is different.

20:44.020 --> 20:47.060
I'll open a small hole

20:47.060 --> 20:49.220
in the barrier of this domain!

20:50.090 --> 20:52.900
The hole I entered through
is already sealed.

20:52.900 --> 20:54.940
It's harder to open one
from inside than outside,

20:54.940 --> 20:59.630
but I can open a hole large enough for
someone to pass through for a few seconds.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.780
That thing isn't Gojo-sensei.

21:01.780 --> 21:05.530
It shouldn't be able to use Domain
Expansion multiple times in one day.

21:05.530 --> 21:08.640
Once we're all out of
this domain, we can win.

21:08.640 --> 21:10.710
The edge of his domain is beneath my feet.

21:10.710 --> 21:13.040
I can tell, since I touched it when I entered.

21:13.040 --> 21:14.300
I'm ready to go at any time!

21:14.300 --> 21:16.540
If all three of you jump in once...

21:17.980 --> 21:21.000
None of this leaving yourself
behind alone, all right?

21:21.480 --> 21:23.310
I'm risking my life,

21:24.270 --> 21:26.300
but I don't intend to throw it away.

21:27.940 --> 21:30.340
You two!

21:30.340 --> 21:33.000
Gather 'round!

21:39.200 --> 21:42.260
They're bolstering their defense of the boy?

21:42.260 --> 21:44.210
That just groups them up for me to—
