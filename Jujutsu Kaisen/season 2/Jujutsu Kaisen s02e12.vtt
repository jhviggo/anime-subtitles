WEBVTT

00:03.850 --> 00:08.110
Getting irritated at my own failings

00:05.830 --> 00:08.590
21:44         Tokyo Metro, Shibuya Station
Exit 13 (outside the veil)

00:08.920 --> 00:10.070
never has been

00:10.360 --> 00:12.070
and never will be

00:12.950 --> 00:15.490
a part of my life.

00:22.080 --> 00:24.000
I will simply

00:25.330 --> 00:29.170
confront the evils that
force this reality upon us,

00:29.170 --> 00:30.840
and I will simply...

00:42.220 --> 00:44.020
Arrogant bastards.

00:44.020 --> 00:47.020
Episode 36
Dull Knife

00:57.570 --> 01:02.290
JUJUTSU KAISEN
Shibuya Incident

02:19.560 --> 02:23.160
You know my technique, right?

02:23.560 --> 02:25.290
Manipulating crows.

02:25.290 --> 02:26.620
That's it.

02:26.620 --> 02:35.880
22:02            Tokyo Metro
Between Meiji Shrine Station
and Shibuya Station

02:27.540 --> 02:29.620
Weak, right?

02:29.620 --> 02:32.950
That's why I trained myself so
desperately when I was young.

02:32.950 --> 02:35.880
That way, I could fight without my technique.

02:36.460 --> 02:38.610
It wasn't a waste, either.

02:38.610 --> 02:42.320
Being able to overwhelm you
like this proves that to me.

02:42.320 --> 02:43.320
Stop!

02:43.320 --> 02:45.520
I'll pull out of this incident now!

02:45.520 --> 02:47.100
So please, spare me!

02:46.390 --> 02:47.100
Quiet.

02:48.140 --> 02:51.690
Nee-sama is still in the middle of talking.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.860
So I used to convince myself

02:54.860 --> 02:58.040
that a sorcerer's true value
wasn't their technique.

02:58.040 --> 02:59.020
But you know,

02:59.040 --> 03:01.000
I hit my limit.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.180
I couldn't keep improving
my physical abilities

03:04.180 --> 03:06.530
and the ability to enhance them
with cursed energy forever.

03:06.540 --> 03:08.040
I was crushed.

03:08.700 --> 03:10.480
I had lost heart,

03:10.480 --> 03:13.780
so I decided to confront
my own technique once more,

03:13.780 --> 03:18.340
and that's when I came into full
bloom as a grade 1 sorcerer.

03:26.120 --> 03:27.240
Applause.

03:33.020 --> 03:34.720
Now I'll kill you.

03:34.720 --> 03:35.100
Huh?!

03:35.190 --> 03:38.230
I just wanted to kill time
chatting, anyway.

03:38.230 --> 03:39.870
I'm sorry!

03:39.870 --> 03:41.360
I won't do anything bad ever again!

03:41.360 --> 03:44.300
So please! Please spare my life!

03:44.300 --> 03:48.270
Ui Ui, tell me the value of a life.

03:48.270 --> 03:51.860
How would you measure the weight of a life?

03:51.860 --> 03:53.270
Of course!

03:53.280 --> 03:56.830
It's how valuable they
are to you, Nee-sama!

03:58.500 --> 03:59.560
Thank you.

03:59.880 --> 04:00.920
And you?

04:00.920 --> 04:05.360
Huh? I-I, u-uh...

04:07.190 --> 04:11.520
You can't immediately describe the scale you
use to measure the lives you hunt down.

04:12.120 --> 04:15.120
That's why you lost.

04:16.030 --> 04:22.070
Coincidentally, I measure
lives by their potential assets.

04:36.670 --> 04:37.670
Huh?

04:38.130 --> 04:41.770
Only the veil keeping sorcerers
out just lifted, right?

04:41.770 --> 04:45.510
Even though we just broke
three of these with Ino-san?

04:45.510 --> 04:52.640
22:04 Shuto Expressway No. 3 Shibuya Route
In Front of Cerulean Tower

04:46.020 --> 04:49.120
Either they used all three
to lower one veil,

04:49.120 --> 04:51.530
or two were dummies.

04:51.530 --> 04:55.210
Either way, now sorcerers
can act freely in Shibuya.

04:55.950 --> 04:58.800
That just leaves the veil
trapping Gojo-sensei in,

04:58.800 --> 05:01.560
and the veil trapping ordinary people in.

05:02.120 --> 05:05.320
I wanted to ask this geezer all kinds of
questions, but he won't wake up soon.

05:05.320 --> 05:06.800
We should rejoin Ino-san andâ€”

05:08.320 --> 05:09.480
Ino-san!

05:36.390 --> 05:38.140
The veil's lifted.

05:38.680 --> 05:41.100
What now, Granny?

05:41.100 --> 05:47.200
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What do we do now?

05:47.980 --> 05:51.750
It won't hurt to keep
Satoru Gojo out of play.

05:52.030 --> 05:55.140
So go down below and kill sorcerers.

05:59.120 --> 06:00.420
Grandson?

06:05.400 --> 06:09.800
Who the hell do you think
you're ordering around, old hag?

06:13.560 --> 06:15.410
What's the meaning of this?!

06:15.410 --> 06:19.270
I only channeled the body's information!

06:19.920 --> 06:21.280
Channeled?

06:21.280 --> 06:23.470
Oh, so that's why.

06:24.520 --> 06:28.110
Yes. I've always made it a point not
to channel the soul's information

06:28.110 --> 06:31.340
in order to prevent accidents
like this ahead of time.

06:32.280 --> 06:34.600
I don't really get it,

06:34.600 --> 06:37.020
but my body's special.

06:37.020 --> 06:40.870
I guess it just means this guy's
soul couldn't win against my body.

06:40.880 --> 06:43.780
A soul losing to a body?!

06:43.780 --> 06:45.220
No!

06:45.560 --> 06:47.220
That's impossible!

06:47.920 --> 06:49.720
Kill sorcerers, huh?

06:54.190 --> 06:56.290
You're a sorcerer, too, right?

07:00.630 --> 07:01.930
They hit Ijichi-san?

07:07.590 --> 07:10.200
It sounded like he got attacked
while on the phone with Nitta-chan,

07:10.630 --> 07:13.190
so it probably happened
after he left Fushiguro's group.

07:13.190 --> 07:15.050
He might be in trouble by himself right now.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.550
Nobara, go with Akari-san to Ijichi-san.

07:19.370 --> 07:21.620
We can't use our cell phones in here,

07:21.620 --> 07:24.130
so we won't get anywhere
without the assistant supervisors.

07:24.960 --> 07:27.330
I doubt that idiot would ever lose,

07:27.330 --> 07:29.700
but this whole situation
is smelling even fishier.

07:30.740 --> 07:32.880
I'll take care of things here for now.

07:34.360 --> 07:37.020
That old man is slacking off too much.

07:37.850 --> 07:39.230
Hey, booze.

07:39.240 --> 07:40.220
Ignore him.

07:40.750 --> 07:41.880
Now go.

07:41.880 --> 07:43.040
Right!

07:45.310 --> 07:47.200
Once they're outside the veil,

07:47.480 --> 07:49.880
they'll be able to run if the worst happens.

07:52.910 --> 07:54.080
How's Ino-san?

07:54.320 --> 07:56.870
He's not... okay,

07:56.880 --> 07:58.320
but he's not dead.

07:58.610 --> 08:00.320
I'm going to punch them.

08:00.320 --> 08:01.450
Itadori!

08:01.450 --> 08:03.680
I understand how you feel, but hold back!

08:03.690 --> 08:05.640
What's our highest priority right now?

08:06.770 --> 08:08.330
Gojo-sensei.

08:08.330 --> 08:09.950
The veil was lifted.

08:09.950 --> 08:12.760
The people at the top might
have escaped already anyway.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.980
I'll take Ino-san with me and
head outside the veil for a bit.

08:20.180 --> 08:21.800
Take care of Ino-san for me.

08:21.800 --> 08:23.640
I'll go on ahead to the station.

08:23.640 --> 08:26.000
That's right. That's the best course.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.810
Though operating alone in
Shibuya right now isn't...

08:29.930 --> 08:32.020
All right. But...

08:32.020 --> 08:34.590
If I die, you'll kill me, right?

08:37.910 --> 08:39.710
Don't worry!

08:39.710 --> 08:41.610
I have Mechamaru with me!

08:41.610 --> 08:44.870
Though I haven't heard any response
from Mechamaru for a while now...

08:46.150 --> 08:47.570
So long as you understand.

08:49.670 --> 08:50.840
See you later.

08:51.720 --> 08:52.810
Yeah!

08:56.030 --> 08:56.840
Nee-sama.

08:56.840 --> 08:59.180
Looks like the veil has lifted.

08:59.180 --> 09:04.800
The thought of how much I'll get for
making Satoru Gojo owe me a favor

09:05.770 --> 09:08.020
is making me excited.

09:08.440 --> 09:11.480
That was faster than expected.

09:17.780 --> 09:19.530
Nitta-chan, stop.

09:19.530 --> 09:25.120
21:40 Shoto Bunkamura Street (outside the veil)

09:19.540 --> 09:25.120
Oh, it's a woman in a suit!

09:25.120 --> 09:27.240
I'm so happy!

09:27.240 --> 09:30.680
I was getting sick of them all being men.

09:31.760 --> 09:33.680
Nitta-chan, hide.

09:34.120 --> 09:35.700
I'll finish this quickly.

09:45.680 --> 09:48.010
Pretend to hide in Bunkamura,

09:48.010 --> 09:49.990
then keep going and slip through Tokyu.

09:51.230 --> 09:54.480
From the way he's talking,
he probably took out Ijichi-san.

09:54.480 --> 09:56.390
Which means we need to hurry.

09:56.390 --> 09:57.240
Right!

09:57.940 --> 10:00.220
Kugisaki-san, don't push
yourself too hard, either.

10:00.660 --> 10:02.400
Whispering to each other?

10:02.400 --> 10:04.450
You've got me curious now.

10:08.200 --> 10:11.720
Aw, she went and hid.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.430
Close one!

10:19.650 --> 10:22.190
Coming at me unarmed?
You throwing the match?

10:24.300 --> 10:25.970
I met you before, right?

10:30.450 --> 10:33.400
Most who rely on cursed tools
are mid- or long-range fighters.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.320
So keep up the attack!

10:36.160 --> 10:38.200
Who are you again?

10:52.250 --> 10:54.210
Shooting nails is dangerous, you know.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.960
I'll make it even more dangerous!

11:02.150 --> 11:04.140
Ow!

11:05.960 --> 11:09.390
Hey, so she wasn't hiding!

11:15.480 --> 11:16.360
Nitta-chan!

11:18.860 --> 11:20.320
Shoot!

11:23.120 --> 11:25.250
Why, you!

11:31.930 --> 11:33.800
The sword he dropped earlier?!

11:34.890 --> 11:36.000
How is it above me?!

11:42.760 --> 11:44.210
Too bad.

11:44.880 --> 11:45.980
Hairpin!

12:02.050 --> 12:03.200
Nitta-chan!

12:22.720 --> 12:27.230
Man, you really are dangerous.

12:27.600 --> 12:30.120
Oh, did it hit your chin?

12:30.120 --> 12:31.730
Can't stand?

12:31.730 --> 12:33.420
Hey, can you stand?

12:33.970 --> 12:36.910
Hey, come on...

12:38.440 --> 12:39.980
You know,

12:39.980 --> 12:43.500
you've gotten an awful lot
stronger since we last met.

12:43.500 --> 12:45.950
I didn't even recognize you at first.

12:46.740 --> 12:48.380
Though, you know,

12:48.380 --> 12:51.910
being strong isn't enough
to win in this world.

12:51.910 --> 12:55.160
Especially when my technique is involved.

12:55.160 --> 13:01.020
Though, I don't really understand
my own technique all that well.

13:05.890 --> 13:09.940
Now, which of you should I kill first?

13:10.750 --> 13:13.390
Wh-What...

13:15.060 --> 13:17.040
Work, mouth, work!

13:17.480 --> 13:20.120
...are you after?

13:20.120 --> 13:22.520
Buy as much time as possible!

13:22.520 --> 13:27.280
Oh, they said something about
wanting to seal Satoru Gojo.

13:27.280 --> 13:30.450
I was asking you!

13:30.450 --> 13:34.710
Oh, me? Hmm...

13:35.510 --> 13:38.820
What do you think someone
with a great talent and love

13:38.820 --> 13:42.600
for soccer would do if they were
born in a world without soccer?

13:43.800 --> 13:44.710
That's not right.

13:44.710 --> 13:47.100
I can't explain it well.

13:47.100 --> 13:51.020
Though, is the reason all that important?

13:51.950 --> 13:53.800
Who cares?

13:53.800 --> 13:55.680
It's fun, right?

13:55.680 --> 13:59.910
As long as I have fun, what else matters?!

14:01.060 --> 14:03.110
Don't you think so, too?

14:03.110 --> 14:05.120
Stop it!

14:13.750 --> 14:16.490
Make me stop.

14:16.500 --> 14:20.000
Don't let me commit anymore cliâ€”

14:20.750 --> 14:22.760
Ah, I flubbed it.

14:24.930 --> 14:25.920
It's full of phlegm...

14:27.670 --> 14:28.820
Whoa.

14:35.840 --> 14:37.680
You're totally wobbling!

14:46.520 --> 14:47.830
Yeah, yeah.

15:12.380 --> 15:14.260
It was okay, right?

15:15.420 --> 15:17.970
To kill people in suits that aren't black, too?

15:20.440 --> 15:22.980
JUJUTSU KAISEN

15:31.990 --> 15:34.910
He came to Shibuya with Fushiguro, right?

15:36.410 --> 15:37.990
Nanami-san?

15:45.920 --> 15:48.510
Come on now, look around you.

15:48.510 --> 15:50.680
Why are you strutting this way?

15:50.680 --> 15:53.690
Can't you see I'm holding
a woman hostage here?

15:56.320 --> 15:57.420
Huh?

15:57.860 --> 15:58.940
Huh?

15:58.940 --> 16:00.430
She ran away.

16:04.100 --> 16:07.940
What's the number and
locations of your allies?

16:10.690 --> 16:12.520
I don't know.

16:16.030 --> 16:17.690
Huh? A wall?

16:19.730 --> 16:23.230
It didn't cut him?!

16:23.580 --> 16:27.510
What's the number and
locations of your allies?!

16:31.800 --> 16:32.800
I don'tâ€”

16:47.380 --> 16:49.320
Huh? I died?

16:49.320 --> 16:51.790
I would have died without my technique?!

16:53.110 --> 16:55.160
I-I have to run!

17:06.610 --> 17:11.750
What's the number and
locations of your allies?

17:12.210 --> 17:13.970
I told you, I don'tâ€”

17:38.070 --> 17:39.570
I won't let you!

17:39.570 --> 17:41.890
Read the room!

17:49.080 --> 17:50.940
On my way here,

17:50.940 --> 17:54.480
I found several of our
assistant supervisors dead.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.080
That was you, wasn't it?

18:02.220 --> 18:04.950
I-I'm sorry.

18:25.490 --> 18:27.400
He's on a different level.

18:27.400 --> 18:30.520
So this is a grade 1 sorcerer!

18:32.600 --> 18:35.120
Let's make our way to Nitta-san.

18:37.310 --> 18:39.930
Well, now. You, huh?

18:41.480 --> 18:44.780
Mei-san, long time no see.

18:45.660 --> 18:49.870
Quite the thing to say after sending
an assassin after me, Geto-kun.

18:50.640 --> 18:52.480
How is he alive?

18:52.480 --> 18:54.850
Did Gojo-kun screw up last year?

18:55.520 --> 19:00.020
Were Gojo-kun and Geto-kun in on
this whole commotion together?

19:00.900 --> 19:02.460
No, definitely not.

19:02.460 --> 19:07.170
Gojo-kun could kill every person
in this country all on his own.

19:07.170 --> 19:09.000
There would be no need and no point in

19:09.000 --> 19:11.570
setting up these tricks or
getting anyone else involved.

19:13.050 --> 19:16.680
I actually held you in higher regard
than Gojo-kun, you know.

19:16.680 --> 19:19.540
Your nihilistic smile was quite charming.

19:20.480 --> 19:26.090
It's a bitter shame that
I'll have to kill you now.

19:26.550 --> 19:29.080
It really is quite a shame.

19:29.080 --> 19:32.100
This Geto-kun is most likely a fake.

19:32.510 --> 19:35.540
Mei-san, I think it's a shame, too...

19:36.600 --> 19:39.630
that I have to go after
my former upperclassman.

19:39.630 --> 19:43.110
Special-Grade Disease Curse

19:39.630 --> 19:43.110
Smallpox Deity

19:43.400 --> 19:45.090
Curse manipulation?!

19:45.530 --> 19:47.740
Did I read this wrong?

19:48.030 --> 19:51.670
The Special-Grade Disease
Curse, Smallpox Deity.

19:51.670 --> 19:55.160
I did use up my stock
of cursed spirits last year,

19:55.160 --> 19:57.130
but they haven't lost their quality.

19:58.220 --> 20:02.460
Just to be safe, I want to
keep the humans on B5F.

20:02.460 --> 20:04.320
I'll be waiting down this line.

20:04.320 --> 20:06.880
If you manage to exorcise that,
I'll take you on.

20:12.700 --> 20:14.210
Domain Expansion?!

20:14.850 --> 20:17.580
This is a little troublesome.

20:23.240 --> 20:24.800
I've been trapped?

20:25.510 --> 20:27.650
In a coffin, I suppose?

20:27.650 --> 20:29.160
Nee-sama!

20:32.820 --> 20:35.300
Three, two...

20:39.840 --> 20:42.240
How many years has it been...

20:42.240 --> 20:45.220
since something threatened my life?

20:45.220 --> 20:47.200
Nee-sama!

20:49.970 --> 20:52.480
22:10 Shibuya Station Premises

20:52.840 --> 20:54.640
There's absolutely no one here!

20:54.640 --> 20:58.230
I thought there was a huge
crowd trapped inside the station?

21:00.050 --> 21:02.840
So Ijichi-san's okay, then?

21:03.690 --> 21:10.120
I did what I could, and he was
originally aiming to be a sorcerer.

21:12.080 --> 21:17.080
Though it looks you all really
haven't heard about Gojo-san yet.

21:17.090 --> 21:21.960
We entered the building right away,
so that was probably why.

21:21.960 --> 21:25.900
The fact that he's still holding out
after being sealed makes it sound real.

21:25.900 --> 21:28.800
You two, please wait here for rescue.

21:28.800 --> 21:31.840
I'll join Zen'in-san,
and we'll head down to B5F.

21:33.300 --> 21:33.970
I'll go, too!

21:33.970 --> 21:35.110
No, you won't.

21:37.260 --> 21:41.020
I'm the minimum level required
for the fights ahead.

21:41.730 --> 21:44.130
You would hinder me, and be in the way.

21:44.520 --> 21:46.170
Please wait here.

21:58.850 --> 22:00.890
Yuji Itadori!

22:03.390 --> 22:07.600
I'll avenge my brothers!

23:40.560 --> 23:42.240
Ijichi-san! I'll help you with work!

23:42.250 --> 23:43.630
It's fine. I'm fine.

23:43.630 --> 23:44.750
Don't be shy!

23:44.750 --> 23:46.550
We're from the digital native generation!

23:46.550 --> 23:47.980
Excel, Power Point, they're nothing!

23:47.980 --> 23:49.980
I mean it. I'm really fine.

23:49.980 --> 23:51.060
Next time, "Red Scale."

23:49.990 --> 23:55.030
Next Episode
Red Scale

23:51.060 --> 23:52.340
What's "merge cells"?

23:52.340 --> 23:53.240
Do it, do it!

23:53.240 --> 23:54.690
Seriously, go away!
