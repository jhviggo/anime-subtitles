00:05.400 --> 00:07.830
Things were busy that summer.

00:08.820 --> 00:13.160
The frequent disasters of the
past year probably played a role,

00:13.950 --> 00:16.310
but cursed spirits were
springing up like maggots.

00:45.410 --> 00:47.780
Exorcise, absorb.

00:47.780 --> 00:49.340
Over and over.

00:54.080 --> 00:55.060
Exorcise.

00:55.630 --> 00:56.600
Absorb.

00:57.860 --> 00:59.220
No one else understands

00:59.920 --> 01:01.520
what cursed spirits taste like.

01:03.490 --> 01:07.760
It's like swallowing a dirty rag that's
been used to clean up shit and vomit.

01:08.630 --> 01:09.600
Exorcise.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.570
Absorb.

01:12.830 --> 01:15.950
"What I witnessed isn't uncommon."

01:15.950 --> 01:17.890
"I understood the ugliness of the masses,

01:18.640 --> 01:24.300
and still chose to be a
jujutsu sorcerer who saves others."

01:26.360 --> 01:30.040
That's what I've been telling
myself ever since that day.

01:30.970 --> 01:32.310
Ever since that day.

01:34.810 --> 01:39.120
Apparently, this used to be
the home of the president

01:39.120 --> 01:42.720
of a company managing a local
chain of barbecue restaurants.

01:43.510 --> 01:46.220
However, in July of last year,

01:46.220 --> 01:51.880
the mad cow disease breakout dealt
a fatal blow to his restaurants,

01:51.880 --> 01:55.400
so he committed suicide with his family
after they were buried under vast debt.

01:55.400 --> 01:59.360
From then on, local rumors claimed
the president's home was haunted,

01:59.630 --> 02:02.370
so local school kids, college students
from outside the prefecture,

02:02.790 --> 02:05.960
job-hoppers, and others would visit
it as part of a test of courage,

02:05.960 --> 02:07.830
and subsequently go missing.

02:09.580 --> 02:11.460
Those rumors brought about more rumors,

02:11.460 --> 02:13.550
and the damage just continued to spread.

02:14.320 --> 02:18.880
Rumors do tend to spread rather
quickly around haunted spots.

02:19.220 --> 02:25.380
They can spread at an unbelievable
pace nowadays, thanks to the Internet.

02:25.380 --> 02:30.150
This all just means even more
work for us jujutsu sorcerers.

02:30.780 --> 02:35.910
In addition to that, three grade school kids
went missing on their way home from school.

02:35.910 --> 02:39.400
There's also a high chance
the families, police, colleagues,

02:39.400 --> 02:43.160
and friends who trace the paths
of those who disappeared

02:43.160 --> 02:45.520
will reach the mansion and
become victims themselves.

02:46.160 --> 02:49.410
We have to sever the root of
this issue as soon as possible.

02:50.550 --> 02:52.750
HQ sent us to investigate because
they reached the same conclusion.

02:52.750 --> 02:54.990
Entering These Premises Is Forbidden! Many Have Gone Missing!

02:57.750 --> 02:58.370
They're even paying my fees,
which aren't cheap.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.390
Did you overcharge them again?

03:01.710 --> 03:03.860
You make it sound so bad.

03:03.860 --> 03:06.160
Call it negotiation.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.040
We're here.

03:08.880 --> 03:10.840
Let's go, then.

03:11.930 --> 03:16.230
JUJUTSU KAISEN

03:16.230 --> 03:18.600
Emerge from darkness, blacker than darkness.

03:18.600 --> 03:19.790
Purify that—

03:20.560 --> 03:22.320
There's no need for a veil.

03:22.320 --> 03:23.240
Huh?

03:24.240 --> 03:26.700
I don't sense the presence of any Curses.

03:26.700 --> 03:30.530
The cause is almost certainly
inside the building.

03:31.260 --> 03:35.280
You can cast the veil later if we
end up attacking it from outside.

03:35.790 --> 03:37.000
...True.

03:38.120 --> 03:39.210
It's unlocked.

03:40.420 --> 03:42.400
Seems like something's blocking the door.

03:45.990 --> 03:47.170
What is all this?

03:51.550 --> 03:52.710
Mei-san.

03:53.720 --> 03:54.800
It's here.

03:55.560 --> 03:57.350
And it's all around us, too.

04:03.190 --> 04:05.110
Let's get going.

04:05.110 --> 04:07.950
I don't need that, but you do, right?

04:08.800 --> 04:11.270
Thank you.

04:12.910 --> 04:14.450
All right.

04:25.170 --> 04:27.960
I-Incredible.

04:30.320 --> 04:32.710
Oh, it still has electricity.

04:33.950 --> 04:37.260
For now, let's have a
look inside the building.

04:37.500 --> 04:39.070
I'll take this floor,

04:39.070 --> 04:40.740
you take the second.

04:40.740 --> 04:43.270
Huh? All by myself?

04:43.270 --> 04:44.970
Is there a problem with that?

04:44.970 --> 04:48.600
N-No, i-it's fine.

04:48.600 --> 04:50.350
Off you go, then.

04:53.680 --> 04:54.800
Okay.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.040
This is the last one.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.560
You could be the next big Scream Queen.

06:33.570 --> 06:34.640
Jeez!

06:34.640 --> 06:37.040
Please don't startle me like that!

06:37.540 --> 06:40.140
You got startled all on your own.

06:40.920 --> 06:43.810
Are you done exploring the first floor?

06:46.820 --> 06:48.520
This is the first floor.

06:49.760 --> 06:50.530
Huh?

06:51.260 --> 06:54.320
I was walking down
the first floor hallway.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.720
What? But...

06:57.190 --> 07:02.440
I know I entered a room
at the end of the hallway...

07:03.780 --> 07:05.490
A box of candy.

07:05.700 --> 07:07.630
A bag of potato chips.

07:08.140 --> 07:08.670
Cans.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.510
A backpack.

07:10.840 --> 07:12.170
A sweatshirt.

07:13.570 --> 07:15.980
I've already seen this three times.

07:16.700 --> 07:21.960
And see these marks? I made
them on my way through here.

07:23.360 --> 07:28.200
It would seem that we're already
in the belly of the beast.

07:28.200 --> 07:30.430
Huh?

07:35.860 --> 07:37.560
For real?

07:39.810 --> 07:43.660
How long <i>is</i> this hallway?

07:44.920 --> 07:46.820
We've been moving for thirty minutes,

07:46.820 --> 07:49.080
so about four kilometers so far.

07:49.980 --> 07:53.040
It's not an innate domain, is it?

07:53.600 --> 07:54.820
It's not.

07:55.100 --> 07:58.180
Those are manifestations
of the spirit's mindscape.

07:58.720 --> 08:00.120
Which means...

08:00.390 --> 08:01.880
This is a barrier.

08:02.300 --> 08:03.470
Correct.

08:03.700 --> 08:07.110
Most likely, the victims
were trapped inside this

08:07.110 --> 08:09.210
and then killed by the cursed spirit.

08:11.960 --> 08:14.560
Though, considering the
use of this technique,

08:14.560 --> 08:17.150
the cursed spirit itself should be weak.

08:17.960 --> 08:21.060
So if we can just escape this barrier...

08:23.870 --> 08:25.740
Now, quiz time.

08:25.740 --> 08:29.110
How would you break this, Utahime?

08:33.600 --> 08:35.880
This hallway is repeating itself.

08:35.880 --> 08:37.720
At first...

08:41.200 --> 08:42.770
I thought...

08:43.360 --> 08:45.080
I'm surprised you could touch them.

08:45.080 --> 08:47.940
...it was shaped like a donut.

08:48.560 --> 08:52.040
But we passed by four of
the marks you made, right?

08:52.440 --> 08:55.690
When I calculated how many
paces apart they were, I got...

08:55.690 --> 08:57.300
122,

08:57.300 --> 08:58.440
203,

08:58.440 --> 08:59.760
157,

08:59.760 --> 09:00.690
and 270 paces.

09:01.290 --> 09:05.040
So the spacing between marks was random.

09:05.600 --> 09:06.660
I see.

09:07.160 --> 09:11.210
The interval between
repetitions isn't standardized.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.720
Which means that, most likely...

09:14.720 --> 09:17.800
this barrier is patching spaces together.

09:18.410 --> 09:23.380
So if we both run down the hallway
at top speed, then at some point...

09:27.490 --> 09:28.480
It'll break.

09:30.450 --> 09:32.390
Close. Ninety points.

09:32.390 --> 09:33.400
D'oh.

09:33.910 --> 09:35.640
What's the remaining ten?

09:36.360 --> 09:41.530
When we run, we do so in opposite
directions at the same time.

09:41.530 --> 09:43.070
I get it!

09:43.070 --> 09:45.130
So my patching theory was correct,

09:45.130 --> 09:47.900
and if we quickly advance
in different directions,

09:47.900 --> 09:51.190
that makes it harder for the cursed
spirit to hold the barrier together.

09:51.190 --> 09:54.190
And once we have that opening,
we might be able to get out.

09:54.190 --> 09:55.340
One hundred points.

09:55.340 --> 09:56.840
Then, with that settled...

09:57.590 --> 10:01.680
If this works, I'll be expecting a promotion.

10:02.300 --> 10:04.550
How much do you have in savings?

10:04.550 --> 10:05.370
What?

10:06.130 --> 10:08.720
Never mind. I'll think about it.

10:08.720 --> 10:09.780
Right!

10:10.410 --> 10:14.140
Okay... Ready, set...

10:15.440 --> 10:16.160
Go!

10:21.400 --> 10:22.690
We did it!

10:23.040 --> 10:24.950
Wait, wha—

since Mei-san was with you.

15:53.470 --> 15:55.500
You feeling lonely?

15:55.500 --> 15:55.510
Go by yourself.
You feeling lonely?

15:55.510 --> 15:56.880
Go by yourself.

15:59.680 --> 16:01.610
How long are you going
to keep fooling around?

16:01.960 --> 16:03.270
Where did Shoko go?

16:03.470 --> 16:04.610
Who knows?

16:04.610 --> 16:05.770
Bathroom, probably.

16:06.650 --> 16:07.770
Whatever.

16:07.770 --> 16:10.600
This mission is being assigned to you two.

16:11.710 --> 16:13.530
What are those faces for?

16:13.960 --> 16:15.110
Nothing.

16:15.840 --> 16:18.490
Frankly, I think it's too much for you,

16:18.910 --> 16:20.940
but Tengen-sama asked for you specifically.

16:22.920 --> 16:24.790
Your mission has two goals.

16:25.080 --> 16:26.690
The Star Plasma Vessel

16:27.020 --> 16:29.140
is the one compatible with Tengen-sama.

16:29.140 --> 16:33.260
You are to escort that girl and erase her.

16:33.630 --> 16:36.270
Escort a brat and erase her?

16:36.900 --> 16:38.180
That's right.

16:38.180 --> 16:39.740
Have you finally gone senile?

16:39.940 --> 16:41.520
It is spring.

16:41.520 --> 16:44.270
He's probably got his head full
with being the next principal.

16:44.790 --> 16:46.040
Jokes aside, though—

16:46.040 --> 16:47.530
I'll be the one to decide
if I let that off as a joke.

16:47.530 --> 16:49.070
Is this about renewing
Tengen-sama's technique?
I'll be the one to decide
if I let that off as a joke.

16:49.070 --> 16:50.420
Is this about renewing
Tengen-sama's technique?

16:52.000 --> 16:52.940
What's that?

16:56.260 --> 16:57.530
What?

16:58.170 --> 17:01.250
Tengen-sama possesses the
cursed technique of Immortality,

17:01.250 --> 17:02.770
but it is not Eternal Youth.

17:02.770 --> 17:05.480
It wouldn't be an issue
if all he did was get older,

17:05.480 --> 17:07.830
but after his body ages to a certain point,

17:07.830 --> 17:10.580
the cursed technique
begins rewriting his body.

17:12.150 --> 17:13.480
Evolution.

17:13.480 --> 17:17.010
He'll cease to be human and become
a higher form of existence.

17:17.230 --> 17:18.920
What's wrong with that?

17:18.920 --> 17:20.700
Sounds cool.

17:20.700 --> 17:22.330
According to Tengen-sama,

17:22.330 --> 17:26.370
those who reach that state
of being have no will.

17:26.670 --> 17:29.770
It means Tengen-sama would
cease to be Tengen-sama.

17:29.770 --> 17:31.520
All the jujutsu schools,
Tokyo Jujutsu High School

17:31.520 --> 17:33.970
the barriers that form the
foundation of jujutsu society,

17:33.970 --> 17:36.340
the many barrier techniques
of the assistant supervisors...

17:36.340 --> 17:40.720
They're all being strengthened by Tengen-sama.

17:41.030 --> 17:43.290
Without the aid of his power,

17:43.290 --> 17:46.310
we could hardly maintain security
or clean up after missions.

17:46.660 --> 17:48.120
In the worst-case scenario,

17:48.120 --> 17:51.630
Tengen-sama could even become
a threat to mankind.

17:51.630 --> 17:54.950
That's why, every 500 years,
he finds the Plasma Star Vessel—

17:55.220 --> 17:58.350
someone who is compatible with him—

17:58.350 --> 18:00.510
and assimilates them,
overwriting the information of their body.

18:00.910 --> 18:02.750
By renewing his body,

18:02.750 --> 18:05.270
he resets his cursed
technique back to the start

18:05.270 --> 18:07.030
and avoids Evolution.

18:07.030 --> 18:08.440
I get it.

18:08.440 --> 18:10.990
It would be fine if he turned
into MetalGreymon,

18:10.990 --> 18:13.480
but we can't have him
becoming SkullGreymon.

18:13.480 --> 18:16.270
So we have him start over from Koromon.

18:17.030 --> 18:19.750
What? Yeah, sure, that works.

18:19.750 --> 18:24.060
The Star Plasma Vessel's
location has been leaked.

18:24.060 --> 18:28.340
Right now, there are two major
groups after the young girl's life.

18:28.830 --> 18:30.990
One is the Curse User Group Q,

18:31.350 --> 18:35.480
which seeks to upend jujutsu society
with Tengen-sama's rampage.

18:36.560 --> 18:40.020
The other is the Star Religious
Group, also known as the

18:40.020 --> 18:42.860
"Time Vessel Association,"
which worships Tengen-sama as a god.

18:43.470 --> 18:48.130
Tengen-sama will assimilate the
Star Plasma Vessel two days from now.

18:48.130 --> 18:53.000
You are to protect the girl until then and
ensure that she reaches Tengen-sama!

18:53.000 --> 18:56.990
If you fail, the effects will ripple
throughout even normal society!

18:56.990 --> 18:58.570
Don't forget that!

18:59.230 --> 19:00.820
Yeah, but you know,

19:00.820 --> 19:03.710
I get why Curse User Group Q
would be after her,

19:03.710 --> 19:07.000
but why would this Star Religious
Group want to kill a brat?

19:07.620 --> 19:10.870
Their object of worship is
the pure form of Tengen-sama.

19:11.230 --> 19:12.680
Allowing the Star Plasma Vessel—

19:12.680 --> 19:16.430
in their minds, an impurity—
to blend into him is unforgivable.

19:17.220 --> 19:20.070
The Star Religious Group is an
organization of non-sorcerers.

19:20.070 --> 19:22.210
I don't think we need to pay them any mind.

19:22.430 --> 19:24.880
The ones to be wary of are Q.

19:25.170 --> 19:27.050
Well, I'm sure it'll be fine.

19:27.050 --> 19:28.890
We're the strongest, after all.

19:28.890 --> 19:32.000
That's why Tengen-sama asked
for us specifically, right?

19:34.420 --> 19:35.350
What is it?

19:35.910 --> 19:38.380
You know, Satoru...

19:38.380 --> 19:40.670
I've been wanting to say this for a while,

19:40.670 --> 19:43.200
but you should stop being
so full of yourself.

19:43.510 --> 19:45.030
Huh?!

19:46.000 --> 19:48.790
Especially when you're
addressing your superiors.

19:48.790 --> 19:51.390
We might end up meeting
Tengen-sama, after all.

19:51.390 --> 19:55.040
You should be more polite and humble.

19:55.040 --> 19:57.270
You'd scare your juniors less, too.

19:57.270 --> 19:58.000
Hah!

19:58.240 --> 19:59.590
Screw that!

19:59.590 --> 20:01.740
Come on, Satoru.

20:01.740 --> 20:02.960
Whatever.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.510
I'll bring it up again later.

20:09.150 --> 20:10.130
Coming.

20:10.560 --> 20:11.510
Huh?

20:18.310 --> 20:19.520
You alive?

20:19.920 --> 20:21.070
I am, at least.

20:22.020 --> 20:25.030
You think we'll be blamed
if the brat died from that?

20:25.930 --> 20:26.320
<b>Ah</b>

20:36.160 --> 20:37.880
Don't blame me.

20:38.560 --> 20:39.000
If you must hate someone, hate Tengen.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.030
<b>Q Combatant
Kokun
If you must hate someone, hate Tengen.</b>

20:41.030 --> 20:41.510
<b>Q Combatant
Kokun</b>

20:41.510 --> 20:42.260
Wha—
<b>Q Combatant
Kokun</b>

20:44.870 --> 20:47.130
Would you please stop making us stand out?

20:47.130 --> 20:49.220
We just got chewed out
for that this morning.

20:49.970 --> 20:51.680
So this girl is the Star Plasma Vessel?

20:52.110 --> 20:55.310
I know those uniforms. You're
sorcerers from Jujutsu High, right?

20:55.310 --> 20:56.770
Hand over the kid.

20:57.150 --> 20:58.360
Or I'll kill you.

20:58.770 --> 21:00.390
Can't hear you.

21:00.390 --> 21:02.400
Come closer and talk.

21:02.790 --> 21:05.130
Man, barely safe.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.160
Wonderful.

21:11.720 --> 21:14.160
You're Gojo Satoru, right?

21:14.160 --> 21:14.450
<b>Q Combatant
Bayer</b>

21:14.450 --> 21:16.120
You're famous.
<b>Q Combatant
Bayer</b>

21:16.120 --> 21:16.160
You're famous.

21:17.140 --> 21:18.850
I hear you're strong.

21:18.850 --> 21:21.620
Let me find out if the rumors are true.

21:22.160 --> 21:25.470
I'm down for that, but let's set some rules.

21:25.470 --> 21:26.680
Rules?

21:27.150 --> 21:30.110
I don't want to get yelled
at for going overboard.

21:30.380 --> 21:33.520
So if you cry and apologize,
I won't kill you.

21:33.520 --> 21:34.980
That's our rule.

21:35.280 --> 21:36.580
Damn brat.

21:38.320 --> 21:40.040
It's started.

21:40.990 --> 21:44.700
The Star Religious Group doesn't have the
power to fight against jujutsu sorcerers.

21:45.010 --> 21:46.610
But they can pay very well.

21:46.610 --> 21:48.390
That I guarantee.

21:49.400 --> 21:50.750
How about it, Zen'in?

21:51.270 --> 21:54.890
Want to get in on the assassination
of the Star Plasma Vessel?

21:55.600 --> 21:57.680
I'm not a Zen'in anymore.

21:57.680 --> 21:59.500
I took my wife's name.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.470
It's Fushiguro now.

22:02.440 --> 22:03.490
But sure.

22:03.870 --> 22:05.740
Count me in.

22:06.970 --> 22:09.970

Hidden Inventory

23:40.600 --> 23:42.190
You know how there are some
words you can't get out of

23:42.190 --> 23:44.020
your head, even though they
have no connection to you?

23:44.020 --> 23:45.640
Like "The Privatization of
Reclaimed Lands in Perpetuity Act"?

23:45.640 --> 23:47.500
Yeah! Or like "Corporate Governance."
