WEBVTT

00:05.980 --> 00:10.860
23:28 BEFORE SHIBUYA STREAM

00:31.930 --> 00:33.910
Kusakabe!

00:35.700 --> 00:39.640
Hey, Kusakabe!

00:47.480 --> 00:49.540
Found you.

00:52.370 --> 00:56.810
Panda, it's nothing like
what you've told me.

00:56.810 --> 00:57.720
Huh?

00:58.270 --> 00:59.910
I'm talking about Itadori.

01:00.360 --> 01:02.070
No, that was Sukuna...

01:02.070 --> 01:04.960
Itadori holds dominance over his body.

01:06.320 --> 01:08.030
Isn't that what they said?

01:12.530 --> 01:14.180
Let me speak frankly.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.110
Now that Gojo has disappeared,

01:17.110 --> 01:20.060
no matter how Itadori will be punished,

01:20.980 --> 01:23.130
I won't join your side.

01:28.620 --> 01:31.740
I agree to execute Yuji Itadori.

01:33.110 --> 01:37.120
22:36 LOCAL TIME
KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA

01:41.700 --> 01:43.190
I'm truly sorry.

01:44.180 --> 01:46.380
You must be exhausted, Ui Ui.

01:47.190 --> 01:50.580
Let's share the bed today.

01:50.990 --> 01:53.790
But this is so inappropriate.

01:55.710 --> 01:58.060
Do you dislike me
being inappropriate?

01:58.060 --> 01:58.890
Of course notâ€”

01:59.650 --> 02:02.340
Sorry, someone is calling me back.

02:02.340 --> 02:04.650
Aww, you are so meanie!

02:06.290 --> 02:08.190
Sorry to bother you at night.

02:09.370 --> 02:11.590
Ah, I forgot it's morning over there.

02:12.710 --> 02:15.390
Me? I'm in Kuala Lumpur.

02:17.370 --> 02:19.810
Yes, I used Ui Ui's technique.

02:20.610 --> 02:22.870
I nearly got killed.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.720
I advise you to sell all Japanese Stocks
and real estate in Tokyo.

02:29.540 --> 02:31.620
I have even exchanged all my money.

02:33.020 --> 02:35.380
Yes, immediately.

02:36.850 --> 02:40.720
Major developed countries will
inevitably be affected negatively.

02:41.380 --> 02:45.860
No matter what, Japan still has
the world's third-largest economy.

02:47.540 --> 02:49.780
Anyway, it's up to you.

02:51.160 --> 02:53.220
No, don't thank me.

02:53.810 --> 02:56.340
Just stay in there as usual.

03:00.410 --> 03:02.780
I'm looking forward
to our cooperation.

03:07.570 --> 03:10.440
What's wrong brother?
Are you feeling unwell?

03:21.680 --> 03:24.140
23:28 SHIBUYA STATION
B3, DENEN-TOSHI LINE PLATFORM

03:24.140 --> 03:25.670
I must go.

03:28.230 --> 03:30.060
Yuji Itadori...

03:30.550 --> 03:32.700
Who exactly are you?

03:35.840 --> 03:37.570
I must figure it out.

03:39.500 --> 03:40.570
What...

03:42.870 --> 03:44.080
...am I?

03:46.490 --> 03:48.370
Do you need me to save you,

03:48.370 --> 03:48.790
23:36 SHIBUYA POLICE STATION

03:48.790 --> 03:49.750
23:36 SHIBUYA POLICE STATION
Mahito.

03:49.750 --> 03:51.380
SITE OF UDAGAWA POLICE STATION

03:59.740 --> 04:01.850
He just called him \"Geto\"!

04:02.740 --> 04:03.740
Give him back...

04:04.560 --> 04:07.340
Give Mr. Gojo back!

04:08.500 --> 04:11.060
Seeing catfish as a monster
associated with earthquake

04:11.060 --> 04:14.000
is a folk tale from the mid-Edo era.

04:14.700 --> 04:17.320
They believed that a giant catfish
moving underground

04:17.320 --> 04:19.910
was the cause of earthquakes.

04:31.180 --> 04:32.860
What just happened?!

04:34.310 --> 04:36.210
You thought you were falling, right?

04:36.860 --> 04:38.270
But in others' eyes,

04:38.270 --> 04:41.590
you just tripped.

04:43.750 --> 04:46.970
The advantage of cursed spirits manipulation
is its endless tactics.

04:47.640 --> 04:50.810
It can command various cursed spirits
of Semi Grade 1 or higher grade.

04:51.240 --> 04:54.770
Even if one is seen through or broken,

04:54.770 --> 04:57.330
you can just release a new cursed spirit.

04:58.900 --> 05:02.720
You can also launch
all of them at once.

05:12.350 --> 05:14.060
This thing...

05:21.180 --> 05:23.350
In the Night Parade of
a Hundred Demons last year,

05:23.350 --> 05:26.360
if he hadn't spread forces
to Shinjuku and Kyoto,

05:26.360 --> 05:30.220
he would have won
instead of Okkotsu.

05:31.870 --> 05:34.650
But this has nothing
to do with you.

05:37.470 --> 05:38.740
Give him back...

05:39.180 --> 05:41.940
Even I have to admire it.

05:42.300 --> 05:45.580
Sukuna's vessel is really tough.

05:49.620 --> 05:51.050
I've always known it.

05:51.730 --> 05:52.790
Because I was...

05:53.660 --> 05:56.880
...born from you humans.

06:35.540 --> 06:36.960
Shall we continue?

06:39.520 --> 06:41.800
Let's talk about
the future of the world.

06:42.960 --> 06:45.960
EPISODE 46: TRANSFORMATION PART 2

06:56.510 --> 07:01.030
JUJUTSU KAISEN SEASON 2:
SHIBUYA INCIDENT

08:18.210 --> 08:21.060
Do you know about
the 'Maximum' technique?

08:25.000 --> 08:29.320
That is equivalent to the essence
of techniques, apart from the \"Domain.\"

08:33.050 --> 08:36.210
Cursed Spirits Manipulation,
Maximum: Uzumaki.

08:36.950 --> 08:39.370
It combines absorbed
cursed spirits into one,

08:39.370 --> 08:42.580
forming an ultra-dense cursed energy
to attack the opponent.

08:51.500 --> 08:53.930
Why are you laughing?

08:55.030 --> 08:56.680
Ah, sorry.

08:57.120 --> 09:00.700
I just thought that I now
behave just like him.

09:01.530 --> 09:03.370
We were talking
about \"Uzumaki\", right?

09:04.620 --> 09:06.500
\"Uzumaki\" is indeed strong,

09:06.500 --> 09:09.400
but it negates Cursed Spirit
Manipulation's advantage and gives up

09:09.400 --> 09:10.950
the diversity of attacks.

09:11.570 --> 09:14.830
So I initially had little interest in it.

09:15.420 --> 09:19.250
I thought it was just recycling
low-grade cursed spirits for future use.

09:24.820 --> 09:26.340
But I was wrong.

09:26.830 --> 09:28.200
Uzumaki's true value...

09:28.200 --> 09:32.490
...is only manifested when using
Semi Grade 1 or higher cursed spirits.

09:33.050 --> 09:34.230
Which is...

09:35.090 --> 09:36.510
...Extraction of techniques.

09:48.210 --> 09:49.650
How foolish.

09:50.670 --> 09:52.920
Do you think I would not notice

09:52.920 --> 09:55.400
the presence you can sense?

10:00.400 --> 10:02.500
A signal! And the target is...

10:03.130 --> 10:04.670
...right below Nishimiya!

10:26.460 --> 10:29.320
A sniper rifle?
How nice.

10:30.190 --> 10:32.800
I also think that when
dealing with sorcerers,

10:32.800 --> 10:36.530
one should actively use
conventional weapons.

10:37.380 --> 10:40.140
When I was the captain of
a children's basketball team,

10:40.600 --> 10:44.160
my mom often
dyed my hair black.

10:45.150 --> 10:47.480
Later in junior high,
I met my master.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.920
Let alone a real sword,

10:48.920 --> 10:51.670
I had never held a wooden
or bamboo sword.

10:51.670 --> 10:53.920
Yet I still chose
to become a sorcerer.

10:55.130 --> 10:57.430
I keep swinging the sword

10:57.870 --> 11:00.510
because I don't want to become
a burden to my mom.

11:02.510 --> 11:04.560
I keep swinging the sword...

11:08.380 --> 11:10.360
...because I don't want to die.

11:11.220 --> 11:12.940
New Shadow Style.

11:13.300 --> 11:14.490
This sword...

11:15.540 --> 11:17.180
...carries everything in the past...

11:17.560 --> 11:19.370
...and in the future.

11:19.920 --> 11:23.600
Even if I can no longer wield a sword,
I won't regret it!

11:24.080 --> 11:25.460
Quick Draw!

11:38.440 --> 11:39.930
Maximum:

11:42.930 --> 11:44.710
Uzumaki.

11:46.690 --> 11:47.810
Wait!

12:09.650 --> 12:13.090
New Shadow?
That's great.

12:13.840 --> 12:16.800
Fortunately, the person
who came isn't bad.

12:23.060 --> 12:24.560
Mr. Kusakabe!

12:24.850 --> 12:27.670
If you come out,
it will be pointless!

12:27.670 --> 12:29.520
I don't have any choice, okay?!

12:33.670 --> 12:35.720
Itadori.

12:35.720 --> 12:38.380
You're Itadori now, right?

12:38.380 --> 12:39.000
Senior Panda!

12:39.000 --> 12:40.200
AND PEOPLE FROM KYOTO
Senior Panda!

12:40.540 --> 12:41.880
Great.

12:41.880 --> 12:43.580
I'M CURRENTLY A GORILLA
You are back.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.080
Is that the man
who has Satoru Gojo

12:46.640 --> 12:48.460
and the Prison Realm?

12:48.930 --> 12:50.310
It seems so.

12:50.310 --> 12:53.800
But what's the fun in carrying
that kind of nuisance around?

12:54.380 --> 12:55.460
Who is he?

12:55.820 --> 12:57.970
He's Suguru Geto on the outside.

12:57.970 --> 13:00.140
But I have no idea who's inside.

13:15.680 --> 13:17.600
Hi, Choso.

13:19.740 --> 13:21.110
That guy is...

13:27.810 --> 13:30.450
I have three parents.

13:30.850 --> 13:34.280
Mother, the cursed spirit that
made my mother pregnant,

13:34.280 --> 13:37.150
and the one who blended in his own blood

13:38.020 --> 13:42.070
and manipulated my mother,
the detestable...

13:42.830 --> 13:44.430
So you've noticed.

13:45.040 --> 13:46.930
So that's how it was.

13:48.090 --> 13:50.430
Noritoshi Kamo!

13:50.790 --> 13:51.810
Kamo?

13:51.810 --> 13:53.240
Noritoshi?!

13:53.240 --> 13:54.560
NORITOSHI KAMO
Me?

13:55.090 --> 13:57.500
What? What does that mean?

13:57.500 --> 13:59.070
The stain of the Kamo family.

13:59.070 --> 14:00.910
The most evil sorcerer in history.

14:01.920 --> 14:06.460
If it's really him, the person inside Geto
would be over 150 years old!

14:07.780 --> 14:10.110
An outrageous barrier technique,

14:10.110 --> 14:12.870
with a ludicrous cursed tool.

14:12.870 --> 14:17.460
Having a Cursed Technique
that can replace physical bodies...

14:17.460 --> 14:19.840
That's suitable to be
the mastermind indeed.

14:20.710 --> 14:24.360
Noritoshi Kamo is just
one of my many names.

14:24.360 --> 14:25.730
Call me whatever you like.

14:27.150 --> 14:28.970
How dare you...

14:29.630 --> 14:31.230
How dare you...

14:31.620 --> 14:34.740
...try to make me...

14:34.740 --> 14:37.150
...kill my little brother Itadori!

14:41.600 --> 14:43.660
Step aside.

14:43.660 --> 14:45.950
Don't make me wait too long.

14:45.950 --> 14:49.600
Get out of my way!
I am the older brother!

14:53.250 --> 14:55.000
JUJUTSU KAISEN SEASON 2

14:58.250 --> 15:00.000
JUJUTSU KAISEN SEASON 2

15:07.650 --> 15:10.260
Due to the influence of my technique,

15:11.200 --> 15:13.950
I can sense my brothers' anomalies,

15:13.950 --> 15:16.730
no matter how far away they are.

15:26.680 --> 15:28.450
My little brothers died.

15:29.510 --> 15:30.540
Death.

15:30.540 --> 15:32.550
For a living creature,

15:32.550 --> 15:34.910
it's the last and biggest anomaly.

15:35.940 --> 15:37.960
At that time,

15:38.500 --> 15:42.730
I strongly sensed Yuji Itadori 's
\"death\" before my eyes.

15:44.500 --> 15:46.210
In other words, Yuji...

15:46.210 --> 15:48.960
...is my blood-related brother.

15:51.550 --> 15:56.140
If Noritoshi Kamo can keep replacing
his body to prolong his life,

15:56.590 --> 15:58.850
then nothing is impossible.

16:00.340 --> 16:01.860
In that case...

16:03.540 --> 16:07.070
I will do my utmost to fulfill
my duty as the older brother.

16:07.640 --> 16:09.660
Blood Manipulation?!

16:13.330 --> 16:15.020
Such a strong pressure!

16:20.180 --> 16:21.180
So fast!

16:21.700 --> 16:23.290
So this is Piercing blood!

18:27.140 --> 18:28.840
Don't push yourself.

18:29.180 --> 18:30.620
You must be tired, right?

18:32.660 --> 18:34.220
So what?

18:35.500 --> 18:40.850
Is that a reason not to fight
to the death for my brother?!

18:44.460 --> 18:47.650
I'm just asking, but...
You're not related, right?

18:48.100 --> 18:51.190
Absolutely not, he almost
killed me last time.

18:51.750 --> 18:56.260
Todo considers you a brother too. Do you
emit some kind of strange pheromones?

18:57.860 --> 18:59.870
But thanks to his interference,

19:00.390 --> 19:01.820
we can seize this opportunity.

19:02.350 --> 19:03.350
Yeah.

19:03.350 --> 19:06.580
I have two lives left,
so I'll take the lead.

19:06.580 --> 19:09.630
If we attack together,
he will show his flaw, right?

19:10.570 --> 19:13.840
We must take back
Prison Realm by any means.

19:22.030 --> 19:23.670
Drummingâ€”

19:24.660 --> 19:26.020
Ice Formation:

19:27.040 --> 19:28.400
Frost Calm.

19:35.260 --> 19:38.910
It's quite an advanced
cursed technique of ice!

19:38.910 --> 19:42.040
If you move recklessly,
your body will shatter.

19:47.190 --> 19:48.580
Don't kill him.

19:48.580 --> 19:50.780
We need someone to pass on information.

19:50.780 --> 19:53.050
Is that a reason
to let all of them be alive?

19:57.050 --> 19:58.950
Reverse Cursed Technique...

19:58.950 --> 20:01.690
The scale of their cursed technique
far surpasses ours.

20:02.040 --> 20:04.060
I want to go home.

20:04.580 --> 20:06.610
This level of ice is nothing.

20:07.060 --> 20:08.900
Flowing Red Scale.

20:12.950 --> 20:15.070
Which level did you say?

20:22.780 --> 20:24.580
Whose body do you think that is?!

20:24.580 --> 20:26.910
Only the ice on me is especially fragile.

20:26.910 --> 20:28.580
It seems she's related to Sukuna.

20:29.670 --> 20:31.100
You are a friend, right?

20:31.100 --> 20:32.160
No!

20:33.590 --> 20:35.980
I am your big brother.

20:35.980 --> 20:37.920
Can you take this seriously?!

20:38.340 --> 20:41.100
Why don't you try to call me that?

20:41.100 --> 20:42.580
Call me brother.

20:44.210 --> 20:45.770
Tool Manipulation.

20:46.860 --> 20:48.520
Wind Scythe!

20:51.160 --> 20:54.770
Damn it, he blocked it bare-handed!

20:55.400 --> 20:56.700
Itadori!

20:56.700 --> 20:58.990
We're the only ones
who can move right now!

20:58.990 --> 21:01.100
Before Miss Utahime is ready,

21:01.100 --> 21:02.530
we need to buy time.

21:03.100 --> 21:05.200
The messenger...

21:07.080 --> 21:10.120
Yuji Itadori alone will be enough!

21:11.340 --> 21:12.790
Ice Formation:

21:12.790 --> 21:14.220
Icefall!

21:26.180 --> 21:26.930
We're gonna beâ€”

21:34.350 --> 21:36.230
Long time no see.
