WEBVTT

00:15.250 --> 00:16.570
No good.

00:16.570 --> 00:18.150
It's not budging at all.

00:18.630 --> 00:21.790
W-Well, that was some decent force.

00:22.430 --> 00:24.030
Is this guy for real?!

00:24.030 --> 00:27.310
He could give Nanami-san a run for
his money in terms of physical blows.

00:27.310 --> 00:29.540
Though I suppose that's why...

00:29.540 --> 00:32.260
It's a rather sturdy veil.

00:32.260 --> 00:34.530
We'll have to search for its weak point

00:34.530 --> 00:37.050
and put a hole in it,
even if it's only for a second.

00:37.050 --> 00:39.850
We can't get anywhere
without getting inside first.

00:40.670 --> 00:42.550
Huh? Why not?

00:42.550 --> 00:44.350
Why not?

00:44.350 --> 00:47.860
Listen, this is a veil to keep sorcerers out.

00:47.860 --> 00:50.190
It's a barrier.

00:50.190 --> 00:53.910
Barriers are all designed to surround
you and protect yourself, right?

00:53.910 --> 00:57.360
Which fundamentally means
that whoever lowered this veil

00:57.360 --> 01:00.080
is inside it.

01:00.900 --> 01:03.990
But back in Harajuku...

01:07.790 --> 01:09.790
I see!

01:09.790 --> 01:13.580
So staying outside the veil instead of
surrounding themselves with it increases

01:13.580 --> 01:15.790
the risk of being discovered and defeated,

01:15.790 --> 01:17.790
thereby raising the strength of the veil.

01:18.530 --> 01:20.690
It's a real egg of Columbus idea.

01:20.690 --> 01:22.020
Egg?

01:22.020 --> 01:26.020
Though, man, they're completely ignoring
the fundamentals of barriers!

01:26.020 --> 01:27.820
What a crazy idea!

01:28.160 --> 01:32.880
Now I can see why the barrier didn't
break from Yuji's earlier blow.

01:32.880 --> 01:34.370
If that's the logic,

01:34.370 --> 01:38.090
the veil's source should be somewhere
that really stands out, right?

01:38.390 --> 01:40.950
By increasing the risk of discovery,

01:40.950 --> 01:43.430
they're further increasing
its strength, then?

01:44.990 --> 01:47.830
Somewhere that stands out?

01:49.460 --> 01:52.960
<b>22:01 Shibuya Central Tower</b>

01:54.300 --> 01:56.800
Think the sorcerers will realize it?

02:03.580 --> 02:07.550
This is the place that stands out
the most within the veil, right?

02:07.550 --> 02:09.290
Probably.

02:09.290 --> 02:12.140
But even if they do realize it...

02:12.620 --> 02:13.890
Yeah.

02:14.610 --> 02:18.690
The lower floors are swarming
with those transfigured humans.

02:19.520 --> 02:22.880
They won't be able to
climb up here that fast.

02:27.610 --> 02:28.950
Wires?!

02:29.220 --> 02:29.270
These are great.

02:29.270 --> 02:30.600
These are great.
These are great.

02:30.600 --> 02:31.480
These are great.

02:38.620 --> 02:43.930
Do these bastards know
about the entrusted veil?

02:45.030 --> 02:47.390
Good! Just as planned!

02:48.010 --> 02:50.520
So this is the source of the veil?

02:50.520 --> 02:52.610
Yeah. According to Mei-san,

02:52.610 --> 02:55.620
it already has the barrier programmed in,

02:55.620 --> 02:59.480
and it just needs someone
to pour cursed energy into it.

02:59.480 --> 03:02.610
Which means as long as we destroy those,

03:02.610 --> 03:05.490
we can ignore the curse users until later.

03:06.750 --> 03:08.830
There were three of them?!

03:09.700 --> 03:12.080
The veil keeping sorcerers
out is still active.

03:12.080 --> 03:13.820
Where are the remaining two?

03:15.010 --> 03:16.210
With him?!

03:32.110 --> 03:34.110
Fushiguro! Dismiss Nue!

03:41.920 --> 03:43.190
Grandson.

03:43.670 --> 03:47.110
Yes, I know, Granny.

03:47.630 --> 03:50.560
I have some endearing underclassmen now,

03:50.560 --> 03:54.290
so it's time to earn some achievements here

03:54.660 --> 03:58.280
so I can become a first-grade, too.

04:02.390 --> 04:03.390
Fushiguro!

04:04.630 --> 04:05.750
Where is he?!

04:05.750 --> 04:07.130
Right there.

04:09.110 --> 04:11.460
I didn't see the moment of impact.

04:12.780 --> 04:14.500
His body is too clean.

04:15.720 --> 04:17.310
Even if he is a sorcerer,

04:17.310 --> 04:20.310
he plummeted from the 41st floor.

04:20.310 --> 04:23.310
Get up, you old trickster!

04:28.560 --> 04:30.040
Good grief.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.510
Youngsters these days have
no pity for the elderly.

04:37.920 --> 04:39.910
We can't waste time here.

04:39.910 --> 04:41.610
It won't take long.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
Episode 35
Seance

04:55.560 --> 05:00.070
JUJUTSU KAISEN
Shibuya Incident

06:17.950 --> 06:21.270
Why are you so insistent
on my recommendation?

06:21.700 --> 06:25.780
You could easily become
semi-first-grade with your technique.

06:26.500 --> 06:30.050
Because I believe it's important
to do things the right way.

06:30.450 --> 06:34.030
Especially with bloody
work like being a sorcerer.

06:34.540 --> 06:39.540
But I'm not that bright, so sometimes
I don't know what the right way is.

06:41.010 --> 06:43.900
So whenever I'm at a loss, I think to myself,

06:45.180 --> 06:47.360
"What would Nanami-san do?"

06:48.040 --> 06:52.250
So it wouldn't be right to become
a first-grade without your approval.

06:53.270 --> 06:55.770
Oh, would you like another drink?

06:56.510 --> 06:57.760
A makgeolli.

06:58.800 --> 07:01.230
Auspicious Beast Summon: #1,

07:02.970 --> 07:04.240
Kaichi!

07:12.860 --> 07:14.120
It's homing?

07:14.680 --> 07:17.750
The Seance technique,
Auspicious Beast Summon.

07:17.750 --> 07:20.780
By hiding his face, Ino can
become a spiritual medium

07:20.780 --> 07:23.990
used to manifest the powers
of the four auspicious beasts.

07:24.620 --> 07:27.190
Granny, that was...

07:27.190 --> 07:30.000
Yes, quite the coincidence.

07:32.230 --> 07:34.510
Number 2, Reiki.

07:34.920 --> 07:37.230
Nanami-san entrusted those two to me,

07:37.230 --> 07:39.260
so I can't just leave them alone,

07:39.730 --> 07:43.260
but it would be a bad idea to
lead these two to them, too.

07:43.260 --> 07:47.020
The best option is to kill them fast
and rejoin my underclassmen.

08:09.970 --> 08:13.520
Adapt to the facts,
and maintain self-control.

08:14.660 --> 08:17.270
Cast aside pride.

08:31.540 --> 08:33.170
Honestly, matching pace with him

08:33.610 --> 08:36.650
takes more effort than matching the enemy.

09:02.700 --> 09:03.980
Itadori!

09:05.470 --> 09:06.730
All good!

09:06.730 --> 09:08.050
It's just a scratch!

09:09.830 --> 09:11.240
So full of life.

09:11.240 --> 09:12.990
What promising futures.

09:14.990 --> 09:17.440
Makes it worth killing you.

09:18.460 --> 09:21.460
Demon Dog's claws can
hurt even special-grades.

09:21.990 --> 09:24.320
I hit him with serious force, too.

09:25.220 --> 09:27.250
Then how...

09:28.480 --> 09:30.970
is he not damaged at all?!

09:31.750 --> 09:34.030
I thought this wouldn't take long?

09:34.030 --> 09:34.210
No comment.

09:34.210 --> 09:35.710
No comment.
No comment.

09:52.070 --> 09:54.860
He's just as he seems—not all that strong.

09:55.500 --> 09:59.610
But he's doing whatever it takes and
sacrificing himself to protect that old hag.

10:00.340 --> 10:03.110
There's something more to them.
I should hurry up.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.630
Their aura's changed!

10:11.630 --> 10:13.540
We're all set now.

10:13.540 --> 10:15.630
Got it, Granny.

10:15.630 --> 10:16.870
I won't let you!

10:25.690 --> 10:28.020
Zen'in Toji.

10:34.720 --> 10:36.620
How is it, Grandson?

10:37.770 --> 10:42.030
Yeah, it's great, Granny.

10:43.430 --> 10:45.350
Better than any before.

<b>December 7th, 1989</b>

11:10.810 --> 11:13.820
<b>Satoru Gojo Is Born</b>

11:17.190 --> 11:20.240
Happy birthday, Daddy.

11:22.750 --> 11:26.340
Your present is seeing me in my uniform.

11:26.340 --> 11:28.240
Isn't it cute?

11:28.240 --> 11:31.590
I'm glad I went with Mori High after all.

11:32.040 --> 11:33.950
That's all well and good,

11:33.950 --> 11:36.240
but if you do this with that much confidence,

11:36.240 --> 11:38.550
you'll turn out just like your mother.

11:38.550 --> 11:42.500
Huh? Do you hate Mom?

11:42.820 --> 11:44.880
I don't hate her,

11:44.880 --> 11:46.880
but she did cheat on me.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.480
Right.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.230
Poor Daddy.

11:58.600 --> 11:59.800
Who?

12:01.680 --> 12:03.690
Honoka...

12:05.330 --> 12:07.880
Where's my daughter?

12:07.880 --> 12:09.330
I killed her.

12:09.330 --> 12:12.490
I need a corpse in order to transform
into someone I've called.

12:16.800 --> 12:22.250
It was her mother that she
screamed for when she died.

12:22.840 --> 12:25.600
I'm sorry!

12:26.280 --> 12:28.520
I'm sorry!

12:29.160 --> 12:31.710
I'm sorry!

12:32.500 --> 12:34.780
It ripped halfway through.

12:34.780 --> 12:37.850
Please let me out of here!

12:37.850 --> 12:39.280
Shut up.

12:39.280 --> 12:43.590
Why are you doing this?

12:50.940 --> 12:53.550
My job is killing people.

12:54.330 --> 12:58.430
So I need to really understand
how the human body works.

13:00.920 --> 13:02.490
We were

13:03.330 --> 13:05.040
free.

13:06.320 --> 13:08.820
The sorcerers had their hands
full with the cursed spirits

13:08.820 --> 13:10.820
that had grown more active over the years.

13:10.820 --> 13:12.240
As long as we did things right,

13:12.240 --> 13:15.180
we could easily earn a living
without being tied down by anything.

13:15.480 --> 13:19.620
We curse users were free to
live and do as we pleased.

13:23.180 --> 13:24.940
Satoru Gojo?

13:24.940 --> 13:26.030
Yes.

13:26.440 --> 13:29.620
The child born to the Gojo
clan with the Six Eyes.

13:29.620 --> 13:30.960
A kid?

13:31.700 --> 13:35.450
The total bounty on his head is already
over a hundred million yen.

13:36.120 --> 13:39.110
Oh, and this isn't a request.

13:40.760 --> 13:42.820
It's first come first served.

13:51.170 --> 13:52.880
Thank you for waiting.

14:33.090 --> 14:35.740
Cursed spirits had been growing
stronger over the years...

14:35.740 --> 14:39.270
And in that instant,
I understood exactly why!

14:39.270 --> 14:42.530
Because of him! Satoru Gojo!

14:42.530 --> 14:47.600
It was the same as when an insurmountable
track and field record was suddenly broken!

14:47.600 --> 14:50.180
The same as when figure
skaters all started adding

14:50.180 --> 14:53.030
more revolutions to their
jumps due to one athlete!

14:53.030 --> 14:57.700
The balance of the world changed
when Satoru Gojo was born!

14:57.700 --> 14:59.790
Quit looking at me, weakling.

15:00.560 --> 15:03.950
We were free.

15:05.210 --> 15:08.800
And in our later years,
that freedom was stolen from us!

15:09.800 --> 15:11.640
Screw him!

15:16.270 --> 15:19.230
I'll never retire!

15:24.030 --> 15:27.950
I'll trample over the weak until the day I die!

15:29.950 --> 15:31.950
This is fun!

15:41.130 --> 15:43.420
Seriously, what is with this guy?!

15:43.420 --> 15:46.040
It's not even about him
being tough at this point!

15:46.950 --> 15:50.060
It's almost certainly the
result of his technique.

15:50.680 --> 15:52.710
Is it damage nullification?

15:53.040 --> 15:54.050
No...

15:57.560 --> 15:58.560
Hey!

15:58.560 --> 16:00.780
Satoru Gojo is here in Shibuya!

16:00.780 --> 16:03.820
Why don't you leave those foundations for
the veil behind and get out while you can?!

16:05.260 --> 16:07.450
What a lousy bluff.

16:08.320 --> 16:10.120
"Gojo has been sealed."

16:10.120 --> 16:13.570
You were the ones shouting that so loudly.

16:14.130 --> 16:17.040
That's why we're out here having fun, you know.

16:17.040 --> 16:20.080
If Gojo was still active,
we'd be sleeping at home.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.040
I knew it.

16:22.040 --> 16:24.520
He can't beat Gojo-sensei.

16:24.520 --> 16:27.080
Fushiguro, you suck at lying.

16:27.080 --> 16:31.720
So this guy's technique can't be
something as grand as nullification.

16:32.380 --> 16:33.600
But that's okay.

16:33.930 --> 16:34.840
That's okay!

16:34.840 --> 16:36.090
Shut up.

16:38.490 --> 16:41.850
If you don't want to fight,
then I'll kill you now.

16:43.120 --> 16:44.160
Here he comes!

16:48.200 --> 16:49.320
Fleeing Hares.

17:04.430 --> 17:05.480
Fall back for now.

17:07.290 --> 17:09.440
I've figured out his technique.

17:14.940 --> 17:17.640
Transformation through Seance?

17:17.640 --> 17:19.880
That hag is a medium?!

17:20.230 --> 17:22.640
No, that's not the problem here.

17:22.640 --> 17:24.280
What's up with him?

17:24.280 --> 17:25.970
Is he some famous sorcerer?!

17:25.970 --> 17:28.160
I can tell by his stance...

17:28.160 --> 17:29.900
He's hella strong!

17:29.900 --> 17:31.320
Number 4, Ryu!

17:54.710 --> 17:57.670
The type of shikigami
that distracts with numbers?

17:58.290 --> 18:02.520
So they're planning to launch a big attack
from the cover of these hares, huh?

18:05.650 --> 18:06.750
They're gone!

18:06.750 --> 18:08.030
They ran away?!

18:11.940 --> 18:13.040
Max Elephant!

18:22.290 --> 18:24.410
What the hell is this?

18:25.800 --> 18:28.690
Appearing and disappearing...
Talk about restless.

18:28.930 --> 18:31.130
If you're a man, be clear and decisive!

18:31.790 --> 18:34.590
That stuff's not my role.

18:34.940 --> 18:35.840
Huh?

18:44.360 --> 18:47.430
What is with this brat's power?!

18:47.430 --> 18:49.420
He's giving me chills!

18:53.300 --> 18:55.030
For now, just keep attacking away.

18:57.280 --> 18:59.440
This guy's engine is getting revved up, too!

18:59.440 --> 19:01.280
Yes, yes!

19:07.500 --> 19:09.540
A finishing blow!

19:12.930 --> 19:15.550
My technique is Inverse.

19:15.820 --> 19:17.370
While activated,

19:17.370 --> 19:19.980
attacks that hit me are made
weaker the stronger they are,

19:19.980 --> 19:22.300
and the weaker they are,
the stronger they become.

19:22.860 --> 19:28.280
Not one person has ever managed to dodge my
counter after landing their finishing blow.

19:28.280 --> 19:33.310
The more serious you two get,
the less chance you have against me!

19:44.400 --> 19:46.280
I've figured out his technique.

19:47.440 --> 19:49.790
It's probably Inverse.

19:49.990 --> 19:54.250
The attack I threw out of sync
landed more effectively than your own.

19:55.140 --> 19:57.020
Fleeing Hares isn't meant for offense,

19:57.020 --> 19:59.800
but he didn't try to immediately
break through once he was surrounded.

19:59.800 --> 20:04.680
I think that's also how he managed to stay
perfectly fine after slamming into the ground.

20:05.340 --> 20:07.820
So we can defeat him with a forehead flick?

20:07.820 --> 20:10.440
No, the attack can't be too weak.

20:10.700 --> 20:12.200
If were just a pure inversion of force,

20:12.200 --> 20:16.070
activating it would kill himself
with the minor force of air resistance.

20:16.070 --> 20:16.350
True.
activating it would kill himself
with the minor force of air resistance.

20:16.350 --> 20:17.020
True.

20:17.740 --> 20:19.630
Since that doesn't happen,

20:19.630 --> 20:22.450
there must be an upper and
a lower limit to his inversion.

20:22.450 --> 20:24.400
Even with it activated,

20:24.400 --> 20:27.620
he was still matching our attacks and
using cursed energy to defend from slashes

20:27.620 --> 20:29.620
and the effects of our techniques, right?

20:29.620 --> 20:31.080
Makes sense.

20:31.710 --> 20:35.020
That also explains why he can't beat
an anomaly like Gojo-sensei,

20:35.020 --> 20:38.080
and his technique's probably a bad
match against complex techniques, too.

20:38.080 --> 20:40.980
Which means we need to strike together.

20:40.980 --> 20:45.700
Hit him with a powerful attack and a
somewhat weak attack at the same time!

20:46.470 --> 20:47.270
Yeah.

20:47.270 --> 20:50.360
But we don't want him to realize
we've figured out his technique.

20:50.880 --> 20:55.110
So we'll keep going at full power
and make a show of our crazy strength.

21:00.930 --> 21:03.390
We'll start with a weak blow from Gama.

21:04.110 --> 21:06.800
Then we pummel him with a rush.

21:14.100 --> 21:15.310
When...

21:17.480 --> 21:19.120
did they figure it out?!

21:24.510 --> 21:25.760
But still...

21:26.640 --> 21:32.790
Don't get cocky over that, you brats!

21:54.560 --> 21:56.180
He stopped it?!

21:56.560 --> 22:00.670
He killed his momentum for just a moment—

22:06.270 --> 22:08.520
You're surprisingly adept.

22:08.520 --> 22:10.010
Really?

23:40.850 --> 23:44.480
So, did you hear that the Gojos'
little Satoru-kun was sealed?!

23:44.480 --> 23:45.290
Huh? Oh, yes.

23:45.290 --> 23:46.180
Ah, not interested?

23:46.180 --> 23:47.070
Hey, you!

23:47.070 --> 23:48.980
We heard this gossip from Geto-san there!

23:48.980 --> 23:51.290
Oh, heavens me! How could I?
Please do forgive me!

23:51.290 --> 23:51.360
