WEBVTT

00:01.480 --> 00:02.780
Nanami-san!

00:04.500 --> 00:09.800
That octopus currently thinks our
domains are pushing for control.

00:09.800 --> 00:12.040
But my goal is different.

00:13.440 --> 00:15.990
I'll open a small hole

00:16.890 --> 00:19.050
in the barrier of this domain!

00:19.540 --> 00:22.300
The hole I entered through
is already sealed.

00:22.300 --> 00:24.410
It's harder to open one
from inside than outside,

00:24.410 --> 00:29.070
but I can open a hole large enough for
someone to pass through for a few seconds.

00:29.070 --> 00:31.140
The edge of his domain is beneath my feet.

00:31.140 --> 00:33.570
I can tell, since I touched it when I entered.

00:33.570 --> 00:34.860
I'm ready to go at any time!

00:34.860 --> 00:36.970
If all three of you jump in at once...

00:38.380 --> 00:41.420
None of this leaving yourself
behind alone, all right?

00:42.210 --> 00:43.820
I'm risking my life,

00:44.800 --> 00:46.740
but I don't intend to throw it away.

00:46.740 --> 00:49.740
Episode 39
Fluctuations, Part 2

00:54.500 --> 00:55.740
You two!

00:59.000 --> 01:00.250
Gather 'round!

01:03.440 --> 01:05.630
They faced an enemy
that understood language.

01:06.260 --> 01:11.180
And with faith in their fellow grade-1
indirectly conveying his intentions,

01:12.520 --> 01:14.980
the previously excluded possibility

01:15.860 --> 01:20.000
of escaping the domain became
an option once more.

01:20.940 --> 01:24.210
They're bolstering their defense of the boy?

01:24.210 --> 01:26.940
That just groups them up for me to—

01:27.230 --> 01:27.950
No!

01:28.390 --> 01:30.560
He figured it out?! But it's too late!

01:30.880 --> 01:32.820
To Fushiguro-kun's feet!

01:48.040 --> 01:51.760
One who had inherited the curse
of the Zen'in clan from birth,

01:54.250 --> 01:57.850
and one who could not
completely cast off that curse,

01:58.470 --> 02:00.630
both stood in witness

02:03.270 --> 02:05.860
to the one who cast it all off

02:06.370 --> 02:08.860
now manifested in raw flesh...

02:10.200 --> 02:12.360
and taking action.

02:13.890 --> 02:14.860
Who's that?!

02:15.240 --> 02:16.300
A person?

02:17.000 --> 02:18.370
A sorcerer?

02:20.040 --> 02:24.380
They brought a new sorcerer
in instead of escaping?

02:29.380 --> 02:32.390
He's fast! He was just in mid-air!

02:32.730 --> 02:34.760
That's not all, either!

02:34.760 --> 02:37.020
What's with his strength?!

02:40.900 --> 02:42.220
Maki-san!

02:42.950 --> 02:45.440
I didn't feel any cursed energy from him!

02:45.440 --> 02:47.440
Did I just lose a contest of pure strength?!

02:47.440 --> 02:48.740
Me, of all people?!

02:49.850 --> 02:51.230
Fushiguro-kun?

02:51.420 --> 02:52.360
It's no good.

02:52.360 --> 02:54.140
The hole has been sealed.

02:54.140 --> 02:56.750
To make things worse,
it just figured out our goal.

02:57.240 --> 03:00.240
It won't let us open a hole as easily again.

03:10.800 --> 03:12.200
Toji!

03:13.540 --> 03:18.010
Granny Ogami's seance technique
still continued after her death.

03:18.590 --> 03:21.660
Her summoning of the dead
should have ceased

03:21.660 --> 03:24.700
once her grandson, the vessel,
ran out of cursed energy.

03:27.730 --> 03:30.600
But there was no cursed energy
in the grandson's soul

03:30.600 --> 03:32.810
that was overwritten by Toji Zen'in's body,

03:32.810 --> 03:36.700
and his body never expended
cursed energy, either.

03:37.540 --> 03:41.020
Her technique had lost
its chance to terminate.

03:41.780 --> 03:46.440
The compounding irregularities
left her technique running rampant,

03:47.150 --> 03:49.660
and Toji Zen'in was currently
fighting as directed

03:49.660 --> 03:52.960
by his instincts until his
vessel ultimately broke.

03:52.960 --> 03:56.080
He had become a murder machine.

03:57.020 --> 03:58.720
This man...

03:59.080 --> 04:00.880
has no cursed energy?

04:01.170 --> 04:03.390
Not worth my attention, then.

04:24.570 --> 04:27.000
His fangs were constantly

04:28.340 --> 04:31.000
directed toward the strongest.

04:41.550 --> 04:46.060
JUJUTSU KAISEN
Shibuya Incident

08:19.920 --> 08:21.240
Old man,

08:22.640 --> 08:24.190
who is that?

08:35.460 --> 08:37.100
A ghost.

08:40.760 --> 08:43.630
Fushiguro-kun, can you
hold out a little longer?

08:45.940 --> 08:47.060
Yes.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.100
I'm sorry.

08:48.620 --> 08:50.220
We're placing our bets on him.

09:01.940 --> 09:04.480
He's smashing Playful Cloud against itself?

09:05.520 --> 09:06.730
He's changing its shape...

09:09.550 --> 09:10.960
Is he sharpening it?!

09:19.500 --> 09:22.800
Am I going to lose?

09:24.860 --> 09:28.060
Against a human with no cursed energy?!

09:28.880 --> 09:29.760
No!

09:29.760 --> 09:32.640
I can feel that young
boy's domain weakening!

09:32.640 --> 09:36.270
If I can regain my guaranteed-hit
effect, I can kill them all!

09:36.610 --> 09:37.760
I need to...

09:38.160 --> 09:39.520
buy time!

09:40.020 --> 09:42.820
Of course, you can hover, too, right?

09:44.220 --> 09:46.520
Do I need to say it again?

10:00.070 --> 10:01.660
It's not...

10:01.660 --> 10:03.340
over yet!

10:25.800 --> 10:26.980
The domain!

10:27.320 --> 10:29.980
He seriously exorcised
that octopus all by himself!

10:35.390 --> 10:37.780
If Fushiguro-kun hadn't come,

10:37.780 --> 10:40.270
we all would've been wiped out for sure.

10:40.990 --> 10:43.860
Though problems still remain.

10:47.160 --> 10:49.070
Is he an ally or not?

11:24.150 --> 11:25.000
Huh?

11:29.550 --> 11:32.320
When did I get forced outside?

11:33.700 --> 11:35.590
This goes beyond just fast!

11:35.850 --> 11:37.590
He might be worse than Sukuna!

11:39.140 --> 11:41.120
What is with this guy?!

11:42.100 --> 11:43.550
Megumi!

11:50.980 --> 11:53.920
You've passed on, Dagon?

11:54.960 --> 11:56.510
Hey, hey, hey!

11:56.510 --> 11:57.870
You're kidding, right?

11:58.560 --> 12:00.620
This one's another level stronger...

12:01.660 --> 12:03.820
Leave the rest to me.

12:03.820 --> 12:05.620
...than that cursed spirit, Dagon!

12:05.620 --> 12:10.390
Our souls will reincarnate,
even without relying on human beings.

12:11.210 --> 12:14.420
Let us meet again in the
wasteland a century from now.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.140
Now, then.

12:25.960 --> 12:27.390
First one down.

12:28.800 --> 12:29.640
Nana—

12:31.430 --> 12:32.400
Second one down.

12:57.120 --> 12:59.130
Third one down.

13:03.560 --> 13:05.120
Sukuna?

13:06.020 --> 13:07.680
No, it's not!

13:07.680 --> 13:08.800
The fingers!

13:09.130 --> 13:13.060
Someone has released Sukuna's
fingers somewhere here in Shibuya!

13:13.990 --> 13:15.710
Let's hurry, Nanako.

13:17.090 --> 13:18.910
The fingers might draw cursed spirits here.

13:19.280 --> 13:20.570
I know.

13:21.110 --> 13:22.280
Please,

13:23.080 --> 13:24.180
come out,

13:26.880 --> 13:28.300
Sukuna-sama.

13:41.090 --> 13:44.430
You two! How many fingers did you feed him?!

13:45.430 --> 13:46.360
I won't tell!

13:46.770 --> 13:47.430
Mimiko!

13:47.430 --> 13:49.440
That so? Then die.

13:54.750 --> 13:58.070
Good, the markings haven't disappeared.

13:58.070 --> 14:02.580
This was an unexpected turn of events,
but I'll make use of it to greatest effect.

14:03.420 --> 14:07.950
Yuji Itadori probably wouldn't
transfer control of his body to Sukuna

14:07.950 --> 14:11.730
even after taking in all 20 fingers.

14:12.480 --> 14:19.210
But that's only if he spent
20 days taking one in every day.

14:19.760 --> 14:22.220
If he took in ten at once,

14:22.220 --> 14:24.400
his body wouldn't be able
to adapt quickly enough,

14:24.400 --> 14:28.800
and control would transfer to Sukuna,
even if only temporarily.

14:38.620 --> 14:39.980
Wake up,

14:40.340 --> 14:41.550
Sukuna!

14:45.440 --> 14:47.990
JUJUTSU KAISEN

14:50.950 --> 14:52.990
JUJUTSU KAISEN

15:09.410 --> 15:11.880
I fed him all ten.

15:11.880 --> 15:16.220
Now there should be at least
15 fingers inside Itadori.

15:26.330 --> 15:28.320
You're alive?

15:28.780 --> 15:31.320
Must have been the technique of one of them.

15:31.320 --> 15:35.460
But given how frightened they are,
I doubt they can stop me that many times.

15:35.460 --> 15:37.680
Don't waste my time!

15:44.420 --> 15:46.100
I'll give you one second.

15:48.390 --> 15:49.590
Move.

15:56.690 --> 15:58.610
This is Sukuna...

15:59.260 --> 16:01.600
Strength of a different kind than Satoru Gojo!

16:01.600 --> 16:04.100
Overwhelming evil!

16:04.520 --> 16:09.620
Fear that even the slightest
move could lead to death!

16:11.610 --> 16:13.070
Breathe!

16:13.070 --> 16:15.120
Breathe, breathe!

16:15.120 --> 16:17.220
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe!

16:17.220 --> 16:20.020
It's okay to breathe, right?

16:20.570 --> 16:22.100
He won't kill us for that, right?

16:40.080 --> 16:42.140
You hold your heads quite high.

16:52.330 --> 16:55.160
Did you believe taking one knee was enough?

16:55.820 --> 16:58.150
The greatest men bow
the lowest, or so it goes.

16:58.150 --> 17:00.790
I see you value your head quite lightly.

17:02.440 --> 17:03.680
You brats,

17:04.120 --> 17:05.930
I'll start with you.

17:06.420 --> 17:09.170
You wished to speak to me, yes?

17:09.620 --> 17:12.320
I'll grant you a finger's worth of audience.

17:12.320 --> 17:13.680
Now speak.

17:18.830 --> 17:26.420
B-Below us, there's a man in monk's robes
with a suture across his forehead.

17:27.900 --> 17:34.160
P-Please kill him.

17:36.440 --> 17:41.340
Please free Geto-sama.

17:51.910 --> 17:53.840
Hey, Geto-sama?

17:54.440 --> 17:56.500
Who is Satoru Gojo?

17:57.020 --> 17:58.500
He's super strong, right?

17:59.610 --> 18:00.480
Well...

18:01.050 --> 18:02.910
He was my best friend.

18:02.910 --> 18:05.440
But we had a fight and haven't spoken since.

18:07.600 --> 18:08.800
I love you.

18:10.200 --> 18:11.380
I love you.

18:12.720 --> 18:13.860
I love you.

18:14.700 --> 18:16.000
I love you.

18:21.060 --> 18:26.380
We'll never forgive Satoru Gojo for
killing Geto-sama, so long as we live.

18:26.660 --> 18:29.880
But we did feel that was appropriate.

18:30.500 --> 18:31.600
After all,

18:31.600 --> 18:35.640
Satoru Gojo was Geto-sama's
one and only best friend.

18:36.630 --> 18:38.640
But you are different.

18:39.440 --> 18:41.210
Go to hell!

18:41.810 --> 18:43.730
We'll make you regret this!

18:45.220 --> 18:48.840
We know the location of one other finger.

18:50.640 --> 18:52.660
If you'll kill that man for us,

18:53.140 --> 18:55.360
we'll tell you where it is.

18:55.910 --> 18:58.460
So please...

18:58.460 --> 19:00.120
Raise your heads.

19:18.760 --> 19:21.770
Mimiko! Mimiko! Mimiko!

19:21.770 --> 19:24.120
Mimiko! Mimiko!
Did you think a measly one or two fingers

19:24.120 --> 19:26.720
No! Mimiko!
would grant you the right to order me around?

19:26.720 --> 19:26.730
No! Mimiko!

19:26.730 --> 19:27.560
No way, no way!

19:27.560 --> 19:30.350
Mimiko! Mimiko!

19:30.350 --> 19:30.870
How offensive.

19:30.870 --> 19:31.740
Mimiko!
How offensive.

19:31.740 --> 19:32.230
Mimiko!

19:32.490 --> 19:33.690
Sukuna!

19:33.970 --> 19:35.400
Die!

19:49.620 --> 19:52.260
Hmm, a cell phone?

19:52.260 --> 19:55.300
No, the photo function, huh?

19:55.300 --> 20:00.050
It was probably some ability to do something
to whatever was pictured in the photo.

20:00.820 --> 20:01.600
Boring.

20:03.140 --> 20:06.310
You're next, cursed spirit.

20:06.310 --> 20:07.790
What do you want?

20:09.530 --> 20:11.200
I want...

20:12.220 --> 20:13.300
nothing!

20:15.940 --> 20:17.240
What?

20:17.560 --> 20:22.510
Our objective, Sukuna,
is your complete resurrection.

20:23.200 --> 20:28.880
Currently, you only have temporary freedom
while Itadori struggles to adapt.

20:28.880 --> 20:32.880
I'm sure you're the most
aware of that yourself.

20:34.800 --> 20:39.580
Even if Sukuna's Reverse Cursed Technique
is capable of healing others as well,

20:39.580 --> 20:41.700
it can't do anything about the shape of

20:41.700 --> 20:45.260
a soul once it's changed by
Mahito's Idle Transfiguration.

20:47.400 --> 20:51.780
It wasn't that he didn't forge a pact back then.

20:51.780 --> 20:53.840
It was that he couldn't.

20:55.330 --> 21:00.580
Forge a pact with Yuji Itadori
before he returns!

21:00.910 --> 21:05.330
A pact to grant you perpetual
authority over his body!

21:06.470 --> 21:10.140
Many of Itadori's allies are already here.

21:10.140 --> 21:13.180
There are plenty of ways you could do it.

21:18.060 --> 21:19.750
There's no need.

21:23.680 --> 21:26.400
I already have my own plans.

21:26.400 --> 21:28.800
But I see...

21:30.330 --> 21:33.370
You all are desperate, too.

21:34.810 --> 21:37.690
This is your reward for the fingers. Come at me.

21:38.250 --> 21:40.940
If you manage to land even
a single blow on me,

21:41.680 --> 21:44.200
I'll work under you all.

21:49.040 --> 21:53.200
For starters, how about
I slaughter every human in Shibuya?

21:53.820 --> 21:55.770
Except for one.

22:04.790 --> 22:07.120
You're true to your word, yes?

23:40.440 --> 23:42.790
If you're going to use jujutsu,
you should do it like this!

23:42.790 --> 23:44.470
Um, there are minors present.
If you're going to use jujutsu,
you should do it like this!

23:44.470 --> 23:44.480
Barrier! Technique! One, two, shoot!
If you're going to use jujutsu,
you should do it like this!

23:44.480 --> 23:45.550
Barrier! Technique! One, two, shoot!

23:45.550 --> 23:47.070
Please, students are watching.
Barrier! Technique! One, two, shoot!

23:47.070 --> 23:47.520
I threw out paper, so all
of you who threw scissors
Please, students are watching.

23:47.520 --> 23:49.030
I threw out paper, so all
of you who threw scissors

23:49.030 --> 23:50.360
might see something
good happening tomorrow!

23:50.360 --> 23:51.070
Please don't suddenly try
to make this kid-friendly.
