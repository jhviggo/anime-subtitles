00:16.530 --> 00:18.370
Well, this is awful.

00:18.830 --> 00:25.120
There's another veil centered underneath
here that also traps non-sorcerers inside.

00:29.840 --> 00:31.460
Hey, pardon me.

00:33.720 --> 00:34.970
Hup, hup.

00:42.560 --> 00:45.100
I think I have a good idea what they're after.

00:48.400 --> 00:50.110
I'll play along.

00:50.110 --> 00:50.900

00:50.900 --> 00:53.860
They're making Gojo-sensei do this alone?!
<b>20:39 Aoyama Cemetery</b>

00:54.280 --> 00:58.410
I understand the logic, but there
has to be something we can do, too!

00:58.410 --> 01:00.030
Be his backup or something!

01:00.330 --> 01:01.450
Huh?

01:01.910 --> 01:08.380
Yeah. That's why we're heading to Shibuya now.

01:08.380 --> 01:10.090
Oh, we are?

01:10.090 --> 01:11.210
Give it back.

01:11.210 --> 01:12.320
"Give it back"?

01:14.380 --> 01:17.340
Forcing Nee-sama to be his backup...

01:17.720 --> 01:21.180
Satoru Gojo must think he's some big-shot.

01:21.180 --> 01:24.930
You shouldn't treat him
like some ordinary guy.

01:24.930 --> 01:28.730
Some Ordinary Guy
You're not like ordinary
women yourself, Nee-sama.

01:28.730 --> 01:30.440
Ah, Ui Ui!

01:30.440 --> 01:33.190
You truly are adorable!

01:58.380 --> 01:59.180
Huh?

01:59.180 --> 02:03.680
Another veil like the one over Shibuya
was lowered over Meiji Shrine Station.

02:03.680 --> 02:05.790
We're heading to that one.

The Shibuya Incident

02:53.560 --> 02:58.070
JUJUTSU KAISEN
Shibuya Incident

04:12.980 --> 04:14.140
<b>Platform</b>

04:14.140 --> 04:16.450
There's a veil to keep
ordinary people trapped inside
<b>Platform</b>

04:16.450 --> 04:18.980
covering the entire
underground subway station,
<b>Platform</b>

04:18.980 --> 04:22.650
<b>20:51 - Tokyo Metro, Meiji Shrine Station - Exit 2
and within that, there's another
veil centered around the platform</b>

04:22.650 --> 04:25.660
on level B5 that prevents
sorcerers from entering.
<b>20:51 - Tokyo Metro, Meiji Shrine Station - Exit 2</b>

04:26.280 --> 04:30.290
We believe the cursed spirit or
curse user who lowered these veils

04:30.290 --> 04:32.350
is located somewhere between these two.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.000
Between them?

04:34.580 --> 04:37.000
Not on the platform they're centered around?

04:37.380 --> 04:41.630
We believe they're most likely taking
on the risk of being outside

04:41.630 --> 04:44.380
the veil as well in order
to strengthen the barrier.

04:44.380 --> 04:47.360
Two of our assistant supervisors
have already been taken out.

04:47.660 --> 04:50.430
Also, in between these barriers...

04:51.060 --> 04:56.100
Well, we can't say for certain yet, but...

04:56.560 --> 04:59.360
That's fine. Say it.

05:03.440 --> 05:08.620
There are transfigured
humans between the barriers.

05:31.470 --> 05:33.810
What are you two doing?! We have to hurry!

05:33.810 --> 05:34.480
Shh!

05:34.480 --> 05:38.270
Nee-sama is currently sharing
the crows' perception.

05:38.270 --> 05:41.570
It's a process that takes
concentration, so be quiet.

05:41.900 --> 05:44.610
I don't mind if you talk.

05:44.610 --> 05:45.440
She says it's fine.

05:45.440 --> 05:48.030
Oh, Nee-sama!

05:52.660 --> 05:53.410
Yeah.

05:54.750 --> 05:56.330
I've got the gist of it.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.210
Itadori-kun,

05:58.420 --> 06:01.210
which would you prefer?
Killing lots of weak, transfigured humans,

06:01.210 --> 06:04.130
or exorcising one powerful cursed spirit?

06:06.220 --> 06:09.590
Knowing you, it's probably the latter.

06:13.600 --> 06:15.890
This is a map of the underground station.

06:16.140 --> 06:18.390
The transfigured humans are mulling about

06:18.390 --> 06:21.020
and attacking normal people here, on level B4.

06:23.480 --> 06:27.190
The majority of the normal people are
probably at the train platform on level B5.

06:28.650 --> 06:29.660
"Probably"?

06:29.660 --> 06:32.910
The crows I used are imbued
with cursed energy,

06:33.530 --> 06:35.910
so they couldn't enter B5.

06:36.200 --> 06:41.380
I'm guessing they're forcing normal people
to flee to B5, and serving them up.

06:41.880 --> 06:47.380
Also, my crows got hunted
down here, between B1 and B2.

06:47.380 --> 06:51.430
This is likely where the cursed spirit
or curse user who lowered the veil is.

06:51.970 --> 06:55.600
Maybe they're planning to hunt down
any common people that come back up,

06:55.600 --> 06:57.980
or maybe it has something to do
with the veils' conditions,

06:57.980 --> 06:59.850
but it's unclear why they've chosen

06:59.850 --> 07:03.710
this positioning, and what they hope
to achieve by isolating level B5.

07:06.360 --> 07:07.650
He's here, though, right?

07:08.580 --> 07:09.900
Right below us.

07:10.780 --> 07:11.820
That curse.

07:12.780 --> 07:14.070
Maybe?

07:14.070 --> 07:19.080
My crows all got killed before they
could confirm seeing Patchface.

07:19.080 --> 07:23.580
Though the presence of transfigured
humans would suggest that's likely.

07:24.130 --> 07:26.920
I'm not so sure about dividing up our forces,

07:26.920 --> 07:30.880
but if we keep wasting time, all the
common people on B4 will be wiped out.

07:31.880 --> 07:37.760
The two of us will take Exit 7 directly
to B4 and rescue the civilians.

07:38.310 --> 07:42.140
If it gets too dangerous,
you head down there, as well.

07:42.140 --> 07:46.860
Though, if I can be greedy,
I hope that by the time we reunite,

07:46.860 --> 07:50.240
the veil will be lifted,
the civilians will be freed,

07:50.240 --> 07:54.870
and we'll know what our
opponent on B5 is after.

07:55.820 --> 07:58.040
Don't worry, Mei-san.

07:58.040 --> 07:58.700

A jujutsu sorcerer, right?

08:34.450 --> 08:35.610
Right?

08:35.610 --> 08:37.820
I'm clever.

08:38.450 --> 08:41.250
The patchfaced cursed spirit is here, right?

08:41.250 --> 08:42.370
Where is he?

08:43.750 --> 08:47.580
Patch... face? Patchface?

08:48.340 --> 08:50.750
The one with stitches all over his face.

08:51.380 --> 08:54.090
Don't insult me! I know that much!

08:54.090 --> 08:56.340

08:56.840 --> 08:58.550
Mahito is below.

08:58.550 --> 09:01.850
I'm here protecting the veil.

09:02.640 --> 09:03.480
Mahito...

09:04.310 --> 09:06.350
I think Junpei called him that, too...

09:06.840 --> 09:09.380
No, its name doesn't matter right now.

09:09.740 --> 09:12.210
Barriers are pretty complicated, yeah.

09:12.210 --> 09:15.490
There are plenty of people who
are strong and still can't do them.

09:15.490 --> 09:17.640
Though I'm both strong and capable.

09:18.200 --> 09:21.330
This thing is responsible for
the veil? Both of them?

09:21.330 --> 09:22.580
Doesn't seem likely...

09:24.120 --> 09:27.830
Mahito's sorcery is bad.

09:29.040 --> 09:32.630
He did say he was "protecting the veil."

09:32.630 --> 09:34.970
Which makes that object very suspicious.

09:34.970 --> 09:36.630
I'll smash it for starters.

09:36.630 --> 09:38.010
Did you know?

09:38.010 --> 09:41.930
The humans he transfigures
lose their flavor.

09:43.430 --> 09:48.100
I'm clever, so I can tell the difference!

09:55.860 --> 10:04.410
All of you need to stop
underestimating humans.

10:09.210 --> 10:13.210
I take it y-you're not clever, huh?

10:13.580 --> 10:18.010
You don't know what curse I am, do you?

10:18.800 --> 10:20.340

JUJUTSU KAISEN

10:52.250 --> 10:54.040
JUJUTSU KAISEN

10:54.290 --> 10:55.420
Locust plague.

10:55.750 --> 10:59.590
A large-scale disaster arising
from an outbreak of locusts.

11:00.180 --> 11:03.760
The locusts will consume not just crops,
but paper, clothes, buildingsâ€”

11:03.760 --> 11:07.140
anything and everything
made from plant fibers.

11:07.680 --> 11:12.600
A locust is required to eat its own
weight in food every day to grow,

11:12.600 --> 11:15.230
so a locust swarm weighing one ton

11:15.230 --> 11:19.610
must consume 2,500 people's
worth of food each day.

11:20.110 --> 11:23.290
The abnormal sounds of chewing fill the
air around the swarm all day and night,

11:23.290 --> 11:25.830
and once the swarm has passed,

11:25.830 --> 11:30.120
it leaves behind a wasteland covered
in the black fluid secreted by locusts,

11:30.120 --> 11:33.540
creating a sight that is far from tranquil.

11:34.290 --> 11:40.630
Mankind has long feared, hated,
and cursed such demonic pests.

11:46.720 --> 11:48.850
What an incredible jaw and jump.

11:48.850 --> 11:52.640
The fact that it can understand speech
means it's decently powerful, too, right?

12:39.440 --> 12:41.280
You keep just running away...

12:41.280 --> 12:43.240
Which is it with you?

12:43.570 --> 12:46.410
He probably doesn't have any tricks.

12:46.910 --> 12:47.740
Which what?

12:47.740 --> 12:49.620
Are you clever?

12:50.240 --> 12:52.000
Or not clever?

12:53.250 --> 12:55.750
I'm... clever.

12:57.080 --> 13:01.270
Clever people wouldn't really go
around calling themselves clever.

13:01.670 --> 13:03.300
Really?!

13:29.030 --> 13:30.490
Time to go fist-to-fist.

13:30.780 --> 13:32.830
Your two arms

13:33.620 --> 13:35.160
versus my four.

13:53.520 --> 13:58.900
My arms, my jaw, and my eyes
are all superior to those of humans.

13:59.230 --> 14:01.400
So why?

14:07.780 --> 14:11.280
Why am I the only one getting hit?

14:34.010 --> 14:36.930
Still, I am the more clever one!

14:37.230 --> 14:39.980
Locusts lay their eggs underground.

14:39.980 --> 14:43.520
To facilitate this, they're capable of extending
their abdomens, the tips of which are hard,

14:43.520 --> 14:47.280
to nearly three times their normal length.

14:50.070 --> 14:51.740
I win.

14:57.450 --> 14:59.710
He did have a trick.

15:00.040 --> 15:02.170
But more importantly...

15:02.170 --> 15:04.460
You've eaten people.

15:05.250 --> 15:07.300
You're prepared for what that means, right?

15:07.840 --> 15:14.010
There was a gap in their strength
that no trick could overcome.

To be honest, I thought you

Get back or you'll die.

17:34.240 --> 17:37.320
Ah, so they sealed the exit
off earlier to create a blind

17:37.320 --> 17:37.780
<b>Eek!
Can't Break It
Bang
Ah, so they sealed the exit
off earlier to create a blind</b>

17:37.780 --> 17:41.080
so I wouldn't know if there were
people on the other side or not.
<b>Bang
Can't Break It
Eek!</b>

17:41.080 --> 17:41.580
so I wouldn't know if there were
people on the other side or not.

17:41.910 --> 17:46.600
Any jujutsu sorcerer with him
is basically just a hindrance.

17:46.600 --> 17:51.710
So we'll go one step lower and completely
surround him with non-sorcerers.

18:09.350 --> 18:13.360
Blood Manipulation: Slicing Exorcism.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.880
The minimum output of his cursed technique
reversal is double that of his amplification.

18:38.880 --> 18:42.800
It'll be nearly impossible for him to use it
without catching non-sorcerers in it, too.

18:42.800 --> 18:47.900
He probably won't be able to charge his
Blue up to an effective output, either.

18:51.230 --> 18:54.900
It should prove difficult for him to use
Blue for high-speed movement, as well.

18:54.900 --> 18:58.920
It would make him a dump truck as
far as non-sorcerers are concerned.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.780
Get hit and it's instant death.

19:00.780 --> 19:05.910
So in that situation, Satoru Gojo will
have to focus his energy on defense.

19:11.000 --> 19:11.920
<b>Hmph</b>

19:18.090 --> 19:19.970
Domain Amplification!

19:45.070 --> 19:46.620
Makes sense.

19:46.620 --> 19:50.290
I suppose you would think of
that after allying with curse users.

19:51.370 --> 19:53.040
Domain Amplification...

19:53.040 --> 19:55.960
It's the same principle as the
New Shadow School's simple domain.

19:56.390 --> 19:58.840
They envelop themselves with the domain.

19:58.840 --> 20:00.720
While that reduces its
guaranteed-hit effect,

20:00.720 --> 20:03.640
it ensures they neutralize
any technique used.

20:06.930 --> 20:11.160
That would allow their attacks to hit me.

20:11.500 --> 20:15.400
What do we do about his
domain, Infinite Void?

20:15.400 --> 20:22.150
The only ones unaffected by Infinite Void are
Satoru Gojo himself and anyone he touches.

20:22.570 --> 20:29.910
Even if he does have the skill
to selectively trap you all in it,

20:29.910 --> 20:29.920
Veil
Even if he does have the skill
to selectively trap you all in it,

20:29.920 --> 20:32.230
a great number of non-sorcerers
would get crushed
Veil

20:32.230 --> 20:32.290
to death in the space left
between his domain and the veil.
Veil

20:32.290 --> 20:35.170
<b>Ack!
Ack!
Infinite Void
to death in the space left
between his domain and the veil.
Veil</b>

20:35.500 --> 20:39.920
Chances are 99% that he won't use his domain.

20:40.630 --> 20:44.450
But that means you mustn't
use your domains, either.

20:44.450 --> 20:47.220
If you draw a large mass of
non-sorcerers into your domain,

20:47.220 --> 20:51.270
he'll be forced to give up
on them and use his, too.

20:51.560 --> 20:54.930
And you already realize that you can't
win a tug-of-war of domains, right?

20:57.940 --> 21:01.190
At any rate, you just need
to get Satoru Gojo to focus.

21:01.190 --> 21:04.610
Focus on defeating cursed spirits
and rescuing non-sorcerers.

21:09.780 --> 21:11.330
Hey, stand up!

21:11.800 --> 21:13.870
Come on, keep it together!

21:14.620 --> 21:15.790
You're okay!

21:16.460 --> 21:18.330
Come on, take my hand.

21:23.590 --> 21:26.300
I thought I told you not to run.

21:27.430 --> 21:29.970
Can you not understand unless I do this?

21:31.560 --> 21:33.310
Man...

21:33.640 --> 21:35.890
Honestly, I'm shocked.

21:35.890 --> 21:38.900
What? Making excuses?

21:39.520 --> 21:41.230
Not at all, baldy.

21:46.490 --> 21:52.540
I'm saying I'm shocked that you ever thought
you could beat me if this is all you've got.

21:56.540 --> 21:59.330
I'll want you to hold out
for at least twenty minutes.

21:59.670 --> 22:05.130
After that, it's time for me
and the Prison Realm.

23:40.270 --> 23:42.820
Time for the Yamanote Line Game!
The topic is Satoru Gojo's good points!

23:42.820 --> 23:44.170
Yay!

23:44.170 --> 23:45.200
Strong!

23:45.460 --> 23:46.560
Strong!

23:46.800 --> 23:47.740
Only strong!

23:47.740 --> 23:47.780
