WEBVTT

00:15.310 --> 00:16.740
What's the matter?

00:16.740 --> 00:18.950
Uh... Something in my ear.

00:18.950 --> 00:21.840
Can you hear me, Yuji Itadori?

00:21.840 --> 00:22.940
Listen and—

00:29.450 --> 00:31.630
Wait, wait, wait! I'm your ally, you idiot!

00:31.630 --> 00:33.590
It's me, Mechamaru from the Kyoto school!

00:35.430 --> 00:36.780
There's no time.

00:36.780 --> 00:38.340
Listen and understand the first time.

00:39.150 --> 00:42.370
Satoru Gojo has been sealed.

00:49.080 --> 00:51.540
Goodnight, Satoru Gojo.

00:51.980 --> 00:54.990
We'll meet again in the new world.

00:54.990 --> 00:56.660
Maybe for me.

00:56.660 --> 00:58.990
But it's time for you to wake up already.

00:59.260 --> 01:02.240
How long will you keep letting it
have its way with you, Suguru?

01:21.580 --> 01:23.000
Incredible!

01:23.000 --> 01:24.930
This is a first!

01:30.260 --> 01:32.070
Hey, Geto.

01:32.070 --> 01:34.190
Mahito, look at this.

01:34.530 --> 01:38.630
You proposed that the soul
exists before the body,

01:38.630 --> 01:41.030
but actually, the body is part of the soul,

01:41.030 --> 01:43.520
and the soul is part of the body.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.760
There's no other way to
explain this phenomenon

01:45.760 --> 01:51.590
or the fact that the body's memories flow
into my brain after I swap hosts.

01:51.590 --> 01:54.210
Does that really have to be a universal truth?

01:54.970 --> 01:58.300
Are you sure the world doesn't operate
differently for your technique and mine?

01:58.920 --> 02:01.510
So each technique is its own world-view?

02:02.670 --> 02:05.170
I like it. What a lovely idea.

02:05.170 --> 02:07.180
Hey!

02:07.450 --> 02:09.830
If you're going to do this, hurry it up.

02:09.830 --> 02:12.190
Not only is it absolutely foul,
but the view here is awful, too.

02:12.770 --> 02:16.190
I wanted to enjoy this
sight for a bit longer, but...

02:16.190 --> 02:19.680
Indeed, I wouldn't want anything to happen.

02:20.080 --> 02:21.200
Gate, Close.

02:43.640 --> 02:46.330
Now we can't use this anymore, right?

02:46.330 --> 02:49.080
Yeah, it only holds one.

02:49.080 --> 02:52.720
Unless the man inside kills
himself, it's unusable now.

02:52.720 --> 02:55.030
Huh. Lame.

02:55.030 --> 02:57.190
Well, in any case...

02:58.460 --> 02:59.940
The sealing is complete.

02:59.940 --> 03:00.600
Episode 34
Pandemonium
The sealing is complete.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.940
Episode 34
Pandemonium

03:13.500 --> 03:18.010
JUJUTSU KAISEN
Shibuya Incident

04:38.670 --> 04:41.000
We're talking about Satoru Gojo here.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
What proof do you have
for me to believe you?

04:44.000 --> 04:46.220
Sorry, but I have nothing.

04:46.220 --> 04:48.060
If I must provide something,

04:48.060 --> 04:50.010
it's the very fact that I'm here.

04:50.430 --> 04:52.770
I was killed on October 19th

04:52.770 --> 04:56.100
by the special-grade
cursed spirit called Mahito.

04:56.100 --> 05:00.020
What's here is now is no more than the
insurance I left when I was still alive.

05:00.020 --> 05:01.740
Advanced insurance, yes.

05:01.740 --> 05:03.280
So I had no choice but to

05:03.280 --> 05:06.660
set its condition for activating to
"after Satoru Gojo has been sealed."

05:06.660 --> 05:09.080
To decrease the risk of it not going off,

05:09.080 --> 05:13.030
I only managed to sneak these puppets
into three locations ahead of time.

05:13.320 --> 05:16.420
Yuji Itadori was the Jujutsu High sorcerer

05:16.420 --> 05:19.040
least likely to be leaking any information.

05:19.570 --> 05:24.480
And Mei Mei, given the situation,
I'm now certain you're in the clear, too.

05:24.480 --> 05:25.550
Why?

05:26.820 --> 05:30.310
Because someone as skilled
at intelligence gathering as you

05:30.310 --> 05:33.550
was dispatched here to Meiji Shrine Station
instead of acting in the shadows at Shibuya.

05:33.550 --> 05:38.670
Itadori wasn't even a part of Jujutsu
society until several months ago, either.

05:38.670 --> 05:42.560
Hey, that might have been so I'd have
an excuse to refuse aiding them.

05:42.560 --> 05:46.080
Besides, I'm the one who has
kept stopping Itadori-kun

05:46.080 --> 05:49.290
from heading straight
to Shibuya all this time.

05:49.290 --> 05:51.630
Even if we were ordered to be on standby.

05:51.630 --> 05:52.980
Then why...

05:53.780 --> 05:57.790
is a curse user currently heading
your way to eliminate you?

06:07.870 --> 06:10.960
One, two... Two, huh?

06:11.340 --> 06:16.340
Itadori-kun, which is stronger, these two
or the cursed spirit you fought earlier?

06:16.860 --> 06:19.830
They're probably stronger
than that grasshopper.

06:20.470 --> 06:24.810
Apparently, the cursed spirit Itadori-kun
fought was able to speak human language,

06:24.810 --> 06:27.830
so it was semi-first-grade or higher, at least...

06:27.830 --> 06:30.960
and things like that are
crawling out of the woodwork?

06:32.010 --> 06:34.830
I wonder where they've been hiding
and what they've been up to until now.

06:36.480 --> 06:39.040
Let's ignore the curse users
and move onward.

06:39.040 --> 06:41.400
We need to confirm Gojo-kun's status first.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.780
Don't.

06:43.110 --> 06:45.830
The situation in Shibuya has already changed.

06:45.830 --> 06:49.110
Their barrier techniques are
several degrees better than ours.

06:49.110 --> 06:49.650
Shibuya Station

06:49.650 --> 06:52.870
There are currently four
veils lowered over Shibuya,
Shibuya Station

06:53.140 --> 06:56.250
A: the veil trapping common people inside,

06:56.250 --> 06:59.430
B: the veil trapping Satoru Gojo inside,

06:59.430 --> 07:01.860
C: the veil keeping sorcerers from entering,

07:02.160 --> 07:06.860
and D: another veil like A to keep
common people trapped inside.

07:06.860 --> 07:10.790
And you're saying the area further
down these tracks is blocked by C.

07:10.790 --> 07:12.050
That's right.

07:12.050 --> 07:15.890
The sorcerers on standby are
already inside the veil, right?

07:15.890 --> 07:19.130
And you can't use cell phones inside the veil.

07:19.130 --> 07:21.250
Looks like that's not all, either.

07:21.250 --> 07:24.750
I can't get a hold of the assistant supervisors
who are supposed to be outside the veils.

07:24.750 --> 07:27.870
Please, just follow my directions.

07:28.220 --> 07:31.000
This insurance of mine won't last long.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.110
Please.

07:33.720 --> 07:34.790
Mei-san.

07:37.360 --> 07:40.270
All right, tell us.

07:40.750 --> 07:45.270
Itadori, return to Meiji Shrine Station,
and head to Shibuya from the surface.

07:45.730 --> 07:48.280
Tell all the sorcerers there
about Gojo being sealed.

07:48.820 --> 07:52.030
Get them to share our
goal of recovering Gojo.

07:52.030 --> 07:53.030
Right!

07:53.380 --> 07:56.380
Mei Mei, create an opportunity
for Itadori to escape.

07:56.380 --> 07:57.770
After defeating the curse users,

07:57.770 --> 08:00.280
I'd like you to follow
this track, for starters.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.380
But I don't know what moves
the enemy will make.

08:02.380 --> 08:04.030
So adapt and respond.

08:04.030 --> 08:07.630
By the way, they haven't frozen
your bank account yet, have they?

08:07.630 --> 08:08.650
Huh?

08:10.170 --> 08:14.870
If Satoru Gojo disappears, both jujutsu
and human society will be upended.

08:14.870 --> 08:17.300
I'm sorry, but please stake your life on this.

08:18.100 --> 08:20.590
And I even thought that
would be worth it once...

08:20.890 --> 08:23.310
I was the worst.

08:23.600 --> 08:24.950
Hey, what about me?

08:24.950 --> 08:26.150
Follow whichever one you prefer.

08:26.150 --> 08:27.310
Okay, Nee-sama it is!

08:28.770 --> 08:30.770
Everyone, they're here.

08:35.150 --> 08:36.760
You're Mei Mei, right?

08:37.950 --> 08:39.950
Go ahead and do as you please.

08:39.950 --> 08:41.760
I'll match you.

08:41.760 --> 08:43.070
Thanks!

08:51.170 --> 08:52.340
What's wrong?

08:57.590 --> 08:59.090
I can't believe this guy!

09:12.510 --> 09:15.750
Looks like physical time
isn't passing inside here.

09:16.950 --> 09:18.960
Man, I screwed up.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.950
This is all kinds of bad.

09:22.450 --> 09:24.410
Well, it'll all work out somehow.

09:27.560 --> 09:31.290
I'm counting on you, everyone.

09:40.730 --> 09:42.640
True...

09:42.640 --> 09:45.800
Even accounting for those
trapped inside the station,

09:45.800 --> 09:48.280
the crowd density was low.

09:52.620 --> 09:56.590
So the transfigured humans were
lying in wait inside the buildings,

09:56.600 --> 09:59.950
and now they've started attacking
the non-sorcerers, huh?

09:59.950 --> 10:02.960
That's why we've stopped
standing by and started to act.

10:03.620 --> 10:05.590
There wasn't much else we could do.

10:05.590 --> 10:08.280
Our response is falling too far behind.

10:08.280 --> 10:10.470
But my biggest concern is...

10:10.470 --> 10:11.970
The veil keeping sorcerers out
that lowered at the same time, right?
The veil—

10:11.970 --> 10:13.930
The veil keeping sorcerers out
that lowered at the same time, right?

10:14.520 --> 10:18.210
It's been some time since
Gojo-sensei arrived at the site.

10:18.210 --> 10:20.200
Why did they choose now, of all times?

10:20.200 --> 10:22.410
Either something has happened inside

10:22.410 --> 10:26.200
or they needed to wait for this
moment as part of their strategy.

10:26.530 --> 10:28.200
All I can say for certain is

10:28.560 --> 10:32.080
that these aren't the types
to face us without a plan.

10:32.490 --> 10:35.210
I'll focus on the enemies
who lowered the veils.

the common people you can.

10:52.430 --> 10:54.400
Yes. Right.

please exit the veil again, Nitta-san.

10:58.890 --> 11:01.000
With signal blocked inside,

11:01.000 --> 11:03.900
we'll constantly need
someone on the outside.

11:04.910 --> 11:07.400
I would like you to take on that role.

11:07.730 --> 11:09.580
We'll do whatever it takes

11:09.580 --> 11:12.400
to establish a communication network
using just the assistant supervisors.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.990
It should be possible if we
mobilize those off-duty

11:14.990 --> 11:15.110

11:15.110 --> 11:16.410

hasn't finished processing

12:11.540 --> 12:13.980
all of the information that is Satoru Gojo.

12:14.420 --> 12:17.410
We won't be able to move it for a while.

15:34.900 --> 15:38.290
From what I could tell after
seeing Satoru Gojo in person,

15:38.290 --> 15:42.300
now that he's sealed away, the sorcerers
and cursed spirits are evenly matched.

15:42.300 --> 15:45.160
If Sukuna is resurrected,
we'll have a huge advantage,

15:45.160 --> 15:47.120
and victory is basically ours, right?

15:47.120 --> 15:48.800
Well, that's true.

15:48.800 --> 15:49.890
But then,

15:49.890 --> 15:53.310
that also means we're perfectly capable of
winning with the forces we have now, right?

15:54.120 --> 15:56.280
So let's kill Itadori!

15:56.280 --> 15:57.650
It'll be fine!

15:57.650 --> 16:00.990
Even if we lose Sukuna, we can still win.

16:01.320 --> 16:02.360
Are you serious?

16:02.360 --> 16:04.610
As serious as can be.

16:13.360 --> 16:18.370
I don't need to be the one smiling
in the wasteland a century from now.

16:18.730 --> 16:22.410
As long as curses can live as people,
that's all that matters.

16:24.630 --> 16:27.280
Sukuna isn't our ally.

16:27.280 --> 16:31.880
We might even be the ones facing
greater risk if he is resurrected.

16:31.880 --> 16:36.400
But if Sukuna is resurrected, that's
guaranteed to usher in the age of curses.

16:36.400 --> 16:39.390
We are not like the humans of today.

16:39.390 --> 16:41.080
We do not fear death,

16:41.080 --> 16:43.890
and we follow the path to
our goals without falsehoods.

16:43.890 --> 16:47.740
That is the essence of us curses
that those fakes lack.

16:47.740 --> 16:48.820
You're wrong.

16:48.820 --> 16:49.660
Wha?!

16:49.660 --> 16:52.500
No matter how off-kilter or inconsistent,

16:52.500 --> 16:56.050
we always act in accordance
with our true desires.

16:56.050 --> 16:58.160
That's what it means to be a curse.

16:58.160 --> 17:02.470
Oh, when I said you were wrong,
I meant regarding what curses are.

17:02.470 --> 17:04.800
I agree, the whole resurrection
thing is one possibility.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.970
Nor do I really want to fight you over it.

17:06.970 --> 17:09.670
So how about we play a game?

17:09.930 --> 17:13.860
If I run into Itadori first, I'll kill him.

17:14.350 --> 17:18.330
If you find him first, you can give him the
fingers and let Sukuna regain his power.

17:18.680 --> 17:21.780
And if I find him first, I kill him. That okay?

17:21.780 --> 17:22.620
Hey!

17:22.620 --> 17:25.010
Oh! You want in, too, Choso?

17:25.010 --> 17:26.360
That's fine, of course.

17:26.810 --> 17:29.520
You're more on Jogo's side
if you had to pick, right, Geto?

17:29.520 --> 17:30.800
What about you?

17:30.800 --> 17:33.940
I have to stay here and watch
over the Prison Realm.

17:33.940 --> 17:35.810
So I'll abstain.

17:37.470 --> 17:39.410
Do whatever you'd like.

17:39.410 --> 17:41.200
As far as I'm concerned,

17:41.200 --> 17:44.440
Sukuna was just the alternative
if the Prison Realm failed.

17:44.440 --> 17:46.380
This is ridiculous.

17:46.380 --> 17:50.890
All the sorcerers, even Itadori,
will be heading this way to save Gojo.

17:50.890 --> 17:53.000
So all you have to do is wait here.

17:53.000 --> 17:53.540
This won't even be a game.

17:53.540 --> 17:54.590
Ready, go!
This won't even be a game.

17:54.590 --> 17:55.660
Ready, go!

17:56.500 --> 17:59.360
Wha—Wait up!

18:01.480 --> 18:04.850
Those cursed spirits are
smarter than you two.

18:05.160 --> 18:06.270
Give him back.

18:10.860 --> 18:15.640
We cooperated with you and
kept dropping monkeys for you.

18:15.640 --> 18:18.740
Now give us back Geto-sama's
body like you promised.

18:18.740 --> 18:21.010
Don't toy with...

18:21.010 --> 18:23.240
...Geto-sama any further.

18:23.500 --> 18:25.870
Obviously, I'm not giving him back.

18:25.870 --> 18:29.870
I don't recall leaving your heads empty, too.

18:29.870 --> 18:32.160
Next time you make a promise with a sorcerer,

18:32.160 --> 18:35.130
you should make it clear that it's a pact.

18:35.130 --> 18:36.240
Now, begone.

18:36.240 --> 18:39.220
Or do you want to be killed by this body?

18:41.960 --> 18:43.580
You'll regret this.

18:45.300 --> 18:47.130
Regret, huh?

18:47.730 --> 18:48.740
Now...

18:48.740 --> 18:51.880
How did that taste again?

18:52.900 --> 18:54.910
Nanamin!

18:54.910 --> 18:56.740
Nanamin!
Nanamin!

18:56.740 --> 18:59.740
Na-na-min! Na-na-min!

18:59.740 --> 19:03.350
Na-na-na-na-na-na-min!

19:03.350 --> 19:04.310
Hey.

19:04.990 --> 19:06.750
Hey!

19:07.160 --> 19:08.750
Na-na—

19:08.750 --> 19:10.920
Fushiguro! Nanamin!

19:10.920 --> 19:12.110
And... who?

19:12.110 --> 19:15.760
You really were referring to
Nanami-san with that "Nanamin," huh?

19:16.130 --> 19:17.410
Geto-san did?

19:18.010 --> 19:22.950
To be more precise, the thing
that's living within Suguru Geto.

19:22.950 --> 19:25.920
The inside of Shibuya Station
is currently a real Pandemonium.

19:25.920 --> 19:28.550
It's full of those special-grades,
the cursed spirits they brought with them,

19:28.550 --> 19:30.730
the curse users tied to Geto,

19:30.730 --> 19:33.520
as well as transfigured humans
and normal people.

19:33.520 --> 19:36.090
In that case, it would be
faster to attack through

19:36.090 --> 19:38.040
the subway from the neighboring stations.

19:38.040 --> 19:41.520
But in order to do that,
we need to lift that veil first.

19:41.520 --> 19:43.320
It's an emergency.

19:43.320 --> 19:45.040
Please multi-task.

19:45.470 --> 19:48.040
I guess this isn't the time for complaining.

19:48.370 --> 19:51.440
There are several requests only
a first-grade can fulfill.

19:51.440 --> 19:55.410
I'll step outside and take care
of all those with Ijichi-kun.

19:55.880 --> 19:58.250
During that time, I want
you three to do something

19:58.250 --> 20:00.050
about the veil keeping sorcerers out.

20:00.260 --> 20:01.240
Ino-kun.

20:01.920 --> 20:04.910
Kusakabe-san and Zen'in's special first-grade

20:04.910 --> 20:07.600
sorcerer should be inside this veil, as well.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.230
If you're able to meet up with them,

20:09.230 --> 20:12.560
please tell them about the situation
and request their help.

20:12.560 --> 20:15.480
I think they already understand the situation,
though, thanks to that shouting.

20:15.480 --> 20:16.520
Roger that!

20:16.760 --> 20:21.000
Also, please take care of these two.

20:21.940 --> 20:23.500
I will!

20:26.110 --> 20:27.560
Ino-san?

20:27.560 --> 20:30.540
Nanami-san is counting on me!

20:30.540 --> 20:32.240
You two!

20:32.600 --> 20:35.760
Before we start the mission,
let me make it clear how important this is.

20:35.760 --> 20:39.910
The two main issues with losing Gojo-san...

20:39.910 --> 20:42.660
First, the collapse of the Gojo clan.

20:42.660 --> 20:45.160
The Gojo clan is currently a one-man
team of Satoru Gojo himself.

20:45.160 --> 20:48.070
There are also lots of
sorcerers who have been saved

20:48.070 --> 20:48.120
due to Gojo-san's influence, pride, and whims.

20:48.120 --> 20:50.520
<b>Throughout Heaven and Earth, I Alone Am the Honored One
due to Gojo-san's influence, pride, and whims.</b>

20:50.520 --> 20:53.520
Itadori, you're one of those sorcerers, right?

20:53.520 --> 20:54.160
Yeah!

20:54.160 --> 20:55.400
So casual about it!

20:55.770 --> 20:59.240
All of those people are going to
find themselves in trouble,

20:59.240 --> 21:01.160
and, worst case, eliminated!

21:01.160 --> 21:05.580
That brings us to issue two:
the collapse of the power balance.

21:05.580 --> 21:07.410
All of the cursed spirits
and curse users who've

21:07.410 --> 21:09.320
been keeping quiet because
Satoru Gojo was around

21:09.320 --> 21:11.410
will start taking action all at once.

21:11.410 --> 21:14.200
Now, if those guys from
issue two try starting a war

21:14.200 --> 21:17.160
while society's in disarray
from fighting over issue one,

21:17.160 --> 21:18.420
we'll lose.

21:18.970 --> 21:21.130
That's the future as Nanami-san and I see it.

21:21.130 --> 21:22.920
So what do you think happens if we lose?

21:22.920 --> 21:27.680
At the very least, the age of humans
would probably be over for Japan.

21:27.680 --> 21:29.690
See, you get it!

21:30.280 --> 21:32.190
Now, let's go, you guys!

21:32.540 --> 21:36.040
We'll break that veil before
Nanami-san gets back!

21:36.940 --> 21:39.280
Let's rescue Satoru Gojo!

23:11.200 --> 23:13.820
Did you hear that, Awasaka?

23:13.820 --> 23:16.320
"Satoru Gojo has been sealed."

23:16.320 --> 23:19.250
They're leaking information
to their enemies.

23:19.770 --> 23:22.110
What's wrong with that, Old Ogami?

23:22.110 --> 23:24.840
It's finally starting to feel real to me.

23:24.840 --> 23:28.470
Satoru Gojo really has been sealed.

23:28.470 --> 23:30.840
I'm getting excited.

23:30.840 --> 23:34.670
I wonder what's going to
happen to this country now.

23:35.360 --> 23:36.920
Nothing new.

23:36.920 --> 23:39.850
People will curse, be cursed, and die.

23:40.140 --> 23:42.080
Madam, did you hear?

23:42.080 --> 23:45.220
They said the Gojos' little
Satoru-kun was sealed!

23:45.220 --> 23:45.950
Oh, my!

23:45.950 --> 23:47.690
I always thought that would
happen to that boy one day!

23:47.690 --> 23:49.320
He was always flaunting his style,

23:49.320 --> 23:50.940
acting like he was nothing
but leg below his nipples!

23:50.940 --> 23:50.990
Next time, "Seance"!

23:50.990 --> 23:52.130
Next Episode
Seance
Next time, "Seance"!

23:52.130 --> 23:54.870
Oh, Geto-san, did you hear? The Gojos' little—
Next Episode
Seance

23:54.870 --> 23:54.970
Oh, Geto-san, did you hear? The Gojos' little—
