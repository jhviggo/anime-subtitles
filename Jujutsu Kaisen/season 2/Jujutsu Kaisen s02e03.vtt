WEBVTT

00:25.420 --> 00:26.910
It's from Kuroi.

00:29.590 --> 00:31.280
Wh-What do we do?!

00:31.830 --> 00:33.240
Kuroi has...

00:33.680 --> 00:35.240
Kuroi has been...

00:37.420 --> 00:39.590
There's always a chance
the worst could happen.

00:39.900 --> 00:41.720
You're much faster than me,

00:41.720 --> 00:43.720
so go on ahead! Hurry to Riko's side!

00:46.890 --> 00:49.520
I'm sorry. This was my mistake.

00:49.520 --> 00:50.780
Really?

00:50.780 --> 00:53.180
I don't think this even counts as a mistake.

00:53.180 --> 00:56.770
I underestimated how much our
enemies would value Kuroi-san.

00:57.210 --> 00:58.560
Their next move

00:58.560 --> 01:01.280
will probably be offering to
arrange an exchange for her.

01:01.280 --> 01:04.000
Something like trading Amanai for Kuroi-san,

01:04.000 --> 01:07.130
or saying they'll kill Kuroi-san
if we don't kill Amanai.

01:08.090 --> 01:11.710
But we have the leverage in any
negotiations since we have Amanai.

01:12.280 --> 01:14.620
As long as they set up
the location for the deal,

01:14.620 --> 01:16.780
we can make it work out.

01:17.420 --> 01:20.140
I'm taking Amanai back to Jujutsu High now.

01:20.140 --> 01:23.230
We can have Shoko or someone
stand in as her body double.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.340
I'm going to this deal, too!

01:26.340 --> 01:28.170
I still can't trust you two yet!

01:28.170 --> 01:30.890
Huh?! You're still saying
that after all this, youâ€”

01:30.890 --> 01:32.550
Even if you do manage to save her...

01:33.740 --> 01:37.790
What if Kuroi isn't back before
I assimilate with Tengen-sama?

01:39.050 --> 01:39.770
I haven't...

01:43.420 --> 01:45.210
I haven't even said goodbye to her!

01:56.510 --> 01:59.240
The kidnapper will reach
out to us eventually.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.960
If they seem like they're
smarter than we expect,

02:02.960 --> 02:07.550
and bringing you with us is likely to
hurt Kuroi-san's chance of survival...

02:11.300 --> 02:13.490
then we will leave you behind.

02:21.480 --> 02:24.230
All right. That works.

02:25.240 --> 02:27.040
In exchange,

02:27.040 --> 02:30.690
if you get scared partway through and
want to go home, we'll just ignore you.

02:31.660 --> 02:33.080
Bear that in mind.

02:38.560 --> 02:41.450
Mensore!

02:45.460 --> 02:48.220
<b>Protection Mission Day 2</b>

02:48.220 --> 02:51.220

02:51.220 --> 02:54.220
Episode 27
Hidden Inventory 3

03:03.350 --> 03:08.490
JUJUTSU KAISEN
Hidden Inventory/Premature Death

04:29.690 --> 04:32.130
I can't believe I got captured
by the Star Religious Group,

04:32.130 --> 04:34.160
and by a non-sorcerer at that.

04:34.490 --> 04:36.650
I'm ashamed of myself.

04:36.650 --> 04:39.280
You couldn't help it if they
caught you off-guard.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.160
Part of the blame lies with me, too.

04:41.690 --> 04:44.910
Was I really caught off-guard?

04:46.400 --> 04:50.510
I thought I was on high alert
after the incident with Q.

04:51.350 --> 04:52.810
Kuroi!

04:54.530 --> 04:58.010
I still don't have much
recollection of being attacked.

04:58.300 --> 05:01.080
And you all came here by plane?

05:01.080 --> 05:02.640
Were you okay?

05:02.640 --> 05:04.140
You weren't attacked?

05:04.470 --> 05:06.230
Satoru has good eyes.

05:07.830 --> 05:10.650
Before we took off, he checked over
all the passengers and staff,

05:11.870 --> 05:14.300
as well as the inside
and outside of the plane.

05:15.060 --> 05:18.820
And while we were in the air, I had
my cursed spirit keep watch outside.

05:20.760 --> 05:23.350
It was safer than using a land route.

05:24.590 --> 05:26.570
I'm more curious as to why

05:26.570 --> 05:29.840
they designated Okinawa for the exchange.

05:30.170 --> 05:32.340
Probably to buy time, right?

05:32.890 --> 05:34.800
Even if they fail to kill Riko-sama,

05:34.800 --> 05:37.370
they could keep her from making
tomorrow's full moon deadline.

05:37.370 --> 05:38.900
If that were the goal,

05:38.900 --> 05:42.310
they would choose a rural area
with poor transit infrastructure.

05:42.310 --> 05:45.780
You don't think they're planning
to take over the airport, do you?

05:45.780 --> 05:47.120
Maybe so.

05:47.120 --> 05:48.310
But we'll be fine.

05:48.690 --> 05:51.800
We're not the only ones who came here.

05:53.810 --> 05:57.990
Clearly this isn't a mission
fit for a first-year.

05:57.990 --> 06:00.210
I'm psyched, though!

06:00.210 --> 06:02.830
I want to show off in front of Geto-san, too!

06:02.830 --> 06:06.440
Besides, I hear our upperclassmen
are wearing themselves to the bone

06:06.440 --> 06:08.350
to protect an innocent young girl!

06:08.350 --> 06:11.300
So we have to give it our all, too!

06:11.700 --> 06:15.630
If a typhoon rolls in and shuts down the
airports, our efforts will be for naught.

06:18.070 --> 06:19.550
Sea cucumber, sea cucumber!

06:19.550 --> 06:22.520
Gross! That's so gross!

06:23.630 --> 06:25.890
Should we really be sightseeing like this?

06:25.890 --> 06:28.160
Satoru's the one who suggested it.

06:28.860 --> 06:32.040
He's probably showing consideration
for Riko-chan, in his own way.

06:32.990 --> 06:34.440
Though it is getting close...

06:34.970 --> 06:37.520
Satoru! It's time.

06:37.520 --> 06:39.340
Oh, it's that time already?

06:41.360 --> 06:42.950
Boo.

06:44.950 --> 06:48.200
Suguru, let's head back
tomorrow morning instead.

06:50.430 --> 06:51.840
But...

06:51.840 --> 06:54.090
The weather's holding steady, right?

06:55.330 --> 06:56.220
Besides...

06:56.710 --> 07:01.120
there are fewer curse users in
Okinawa than there are in Tokyo.

07:01.120 --> 07:03.520
Let's keep it a little more serious, Satoru.

07:04.320 --> 07:08.120
It's better if the time limit on the bounty
runs out while we're mid-flight, right?

07:08.850 --> 07:10.020
Satoru.

07:10.020 --> 07:13.010
You haven't released your technique
since yesterday, have you?

07:13.290 --> 07:14.590
You haven't slept, either.

07:14.590 --> 07:16.530
And you don't plan to sleep tonight, do you?

07:16.980 --> 07:19.910
Are you sure we don't need
to go back to Jujutsu High?

07:22.030 --> 07:23.970
It's not a problem.

07:23.970 --> 07:27.700
Playing through 99 years of <i>MomoTetsu</i>
was far more draining.

07:29.290 --> 07:32.040
Besides, you're here, too.

07:38.520 --> 07:41.500
Nanami, they said they're
extending their stay another day!

07:41.500 --> 07:43.090
You think something happened?!

09:36.470 --> 09:38.420
Good work, everyone.

09:40.920 --> 09:43.000
We're inside Jujutsu High's barrier now.

09:44.430 --> 09:46.450
What a relief.

09:46.450 --> 09:47.470
Yes.

09:49.500 --> 09:50.520
Satoru.

09:52.340 --> 09:54.230
You really worked hard this time.

09:57.630 --> 10:00.810
I never wanna get stuck
babysitting a brat again.

10:00.810 --> 10:01.660
Huh?

10:10.720 --> 10:11.770
Impossible!

10:12.280 --> 10:16.460
We're inside Jujutsu High's barrier!

10:16.820 --> 10:20.200
Have we met before?

10:20.200 --> 10:21.550
Don't worry about it.

10:21.550 --> 10:26.220
I'm terrible at remembering guys' names, too.

10:28.590 --> 10:31.220
JUJUTSU KAISEN

10:34.970 --> 10:40.430
I once went to see the brat born into
the Gojo clan with the Six Eyes on a lark.

11:00.300 --> 11:02.080
Never before or after that

11:02.080 --> 11:06.340
had anyone noticed me standing behind them.

11:07.220 --> 11:09.480
That is why I wore him down...

11:14.300 --> 11:16.270
until his senses dulled.

11:26.440 --> 11:27.480
Satoru!

11:28.950 --> 11:30.710
I'm fine.

11:30.710 --> 11:33.910
I didn't make it in time with my
technique, but it missed my vitals.

11:34.300 --> 11:36.320
I then strengthened myself
with cursed energy

11:36.320 --> 11:38.470
so the blade couldn't be drawn out at all.

11:39.110 --> 11:43.140
It was like passing a safety
pin through a knit sweater.

11:43.640 --> 11:45.300
Seriously, I'm fine.

11:45.620 --> 11:48.050
Prioritize Amanai first.

11:48.360 --> 11:50.490
I'll deal with this guy.

11:51.260 --> 11:55.080
Suguru, you two get her to Tengen-sama.

11:56.350 --> 11:57.540
Satoru...

12:03.330 --> 12:04.730
Be careful!

12:05.190 --> 12:06.060
Let's go!

12:06.580 --> 12:07.200
Right!

12:08.280 --> 12:10.200
Who do you think you're talking to?

12:17.430 --> 12:20.590
That's different from the
blade he stabbed me with.

12:20.920 --> 12:23.460
And where did that
cursed spirit come from?

12:23.920 --> 12:26.460
Too many unknowns, damn it!

12:26.940 --> 12:29.060
The Star Plasma Vessel is gone.

12:29.730 --> 12:32.760
I had hoped to take you down
with that earlier attack.

12:32.760 --> 12:33.960
I guess I've gotten rusty.

12:34.210 --> 12:37.480
The bounty on Amanai has already
been taken down, you idiot.

12:37.740 --> 12:40.470
Because I took it down, prideful bastard.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.360
When facing people
without openings like you,

12:43.360 --> 12:46.860
you have to first create ups and
downs leading to several false goals.

12:47.230 --> 12:51.470
I laughed when those Star Religious
Group men went to Okinawa.

12:51.770 --> 12:55.400
It sucked that none of the
sorcerers around her died,

12:55.400 --> 12:57.870
but if I hadn't set that
time limit on the bounty,

12:58.680 --> 13:02.370
you wouldn't have released
your technique until the very end.

13:02.960 --> 13:04.430
That so?

13:10.040 --> 13:11.260
He's fast!

13:11.740 --> 13:13.080
And not just that.

13:13.080 --> 13:16.110
I knew there was something off about him!

13:16.110 --> 13:18.110
He has zero cursed energy!

13:18.700 --> 13:21.730
He has a Heavenly Pact
gifting him physical prowess!

13:54.010 --> 13:57.520
I can't imagine anyone who knows
my technique coming without a plan.

13:58.060 --> 14:00.020
Is that cursed tool your
precious trump card?

14:00.020 --> 14:02.740
Sorry, but I won't let it get close!

14:17.800 --> 14:20.440
Since he has no cursed energy,
I can't read his presence.

14:20.440 --> 14:23.580
And I can't just rely on instinct.

14:23.580 --> 14:26.370
There's that cursed spirit
wrapped around him.

14:26.370 --> 14:28.960
I just need to follow its presence.

14:30.520 --> 14:34.350
Even so, he's too damn fast!

14:34.840 --> 14:36.600
Cursed Technique Amplification,

14:37.210 --> 14:38.760
Maximum Output...

14:44.710 --> 14:45.430
Blue!

15:00.530 --> 15:02.280
Now there's no cover.

15:02.280 --> 15:03.950
He can't launch surprise attacks.

15:03.950 --> 15:05.590
Did he hide in the woods?

15:08.100 --> 15:09.080
Are those...

15:10.200 --> 15:11.580
Fly Heads?!

15:15.980 --> 15:18.720
Was he keeping them inside
that cursed spirit?

15:19.000 --> 15:21.480
So you're using Fly Heads like chaff.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.400
Now I can't tell where he is.

15:25.210 --> 15:27.240
He's created a blind spot.

15:27.240 --> 15:28.680
I should use Blue again...

15:29.340 --> 15:32.230
No, wait! He's after...

15:32.230 --> 15:33.570
Amanai!

15:40.350 --> 15:42.780
His intuition is keen enough
to sense me empty-handed.

15:43.160 --> 15:45.730
There's no way your Six Eyes would overlook

15:46.110 --> 15:48.960
the unusual cursed energy
oozing from this cursed tool.

15:50.320 --> 15:51.690
Though that finally...

15:54.880 --> 15:57.760
got you to focus on defense
with your technique.

16:30.510 --> 16:33.390
The Special-Grade Cursed Tool,
Inverted Spear of Heaven.

16:33.800 --> 16:37.600
Its effect is the forced release
of any active techniques.

16:38.690 --> 16:39.500
I think...

16:43.320 --> 16:45.280
I'm getting my edge back now.

17:24.060 --> 17:25.030
Riko-sama.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.520
This is as far as I go.

17:30.640 --> 17:32.180
Riko-sama, please...

17:32.720 --> 17:33.600
Please...

17:38.090 --> 17:40.810
Kuroi, I love you!

17:41.130 --> 17:44.550
I always have, and I always will!

17:45.360 --> 17:46.570
Me, too!

17:47.160 --> 17:49.240
I love you, too!

18:11.100 --> 18:12.380
So this is...

18:12.380 --> 18:13.390
Yeah.

18:13.720 --> 18:15.770
We're in Tengen-sama's territory now.

18:17.360 --> 18:19.520
This is the foundation of
the nation's key barriers,

18:20.330 --> 18:22.650
The Main Hall of the Tombs of the Star.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.760
Once you descend the stairs,

18:25.760 --> 18:29.780
pass through the gate and continue
to the base of the big tree.

18:30.170 --> 18:33.430
Then you'll be inside the special
barrier that's separate from

18:33.430 --> 18:35.290
the barrier surrounding Jujutsu High.

18:35.770 --> 18:38.470
Only those invited are able to enter it.

18:39.160 --> 18:42.500
Tengen-sama will protect
you until the assimilation.

18:45.130 --> 18:46.540
That...

18:46.540 --> 18:49.680
or we can turn back around
and go home with Kuroi-san.

18:53.930 --> 18:54.790
Huh?

18:54.790 --> 18:58.400
When our teacher told us about this mission,

18:58.400 --> 19:01.740
he called the assimilation "erasing."

19:02.440 --> 19:06.650
He was trying to tell us to be aware
of how heavy a sin that was.

19:06.650 --> 19:08.980
Our teacher may be a muscle-brain,

19:08.980 --> 19:11.040
but he often does roundabout things.

19:14.990 --> 19:19.320
Satoru and I already talked it
over before we met you.

19:21.080 --> 19:24.800
What if the Star Plasma Vessel
brat refuses to assimilate?

19:24.800 --> 19:28.300
Then... the assimilation's off!

19:29.850 --> 19:31.040
Are you sure about that?

19:31.040 --> 19:31.800
Huh?

19:32.200 --> 19:35.810
It might mean fighting
Tengen-sama, you know.

19:37.500 --> 19:39.320
You scared?

19:39.800 --> 19:42.480
It's fine. It'll all work out somehow.

19:43.390 --> 19:46.080
We are the strongest.

19:46.420 --> 19:49.050
No matter what decision you make,

19:49.050 --> 19:51.660
we will guarantee your future.

19:55.980 --> 19:57.000
I have...

19:58.030 --> 20:00.170
always been special,
since the day I was born.

20:00.780 --> 20:03.450
Everyone kept telling me
that I was different.

20:04.840 --> 20:07.630
Being special was normal to me,

20:08.050 --> 20:10.110
and I've lived my life trying
to avoid danger

20:10.110 --> 20:12.220
as much as possible
for the sake of this day.

20:13.740 --> 20:17.610
I don't really remember the
day my mother and father died.

20:17.920 --> 20:20.350
I no longer feel sad or lonely about that.

20:22.070 --> 20:23.600
I figured everything would be fine,

20:23.600 --> 20:27.070
even if I was taken away
from everyone and assimilated.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.440
That no matter how hard it was,

20:32.830 --> 20:36.620
it would stop feeling sad and lonely one day.

20:38.380 --> 20:39.360
But...

20:40.260 --> 20:41.320
But...

20:41.820 --> 20:43.100
Honestly...

20:44.120 --> 20:47.100
I want to be with everyone longer!

20:47.100 --> 20:50.800
I want to go to all kinds
of places with everyone!

20:51.390 --> 20:55.990
I want to see all kinds
of things and do more!

20:56.760 --> 20:59.480
Let's go home, Riko-chan.

21:06.650 --> 21:07.510
Yeah!

21:23.540 --> 21:24.680
Riko-chan?

21:26.520 --> 21:28.150
Okay, job's done.

21:30.410 --> 21:32.230
You're free to go now.

21:37.140 --> 21:39.400
Why are you here?

21:41.320 --> 21:42.750
Why?

21:43.270 --> 21:45.800
Oh, that's what you mean.

21:48.160 --> 21:51.320
Because I killed Gojo Satoru.

22:05.240 --> 22:06.230
Is that so?

22:07.130 --> 22:08.310
Die!

23:41.470 --> 23:45.050
They say it's never too late
to start something,

23:45.050 --> 23:49.130
but the bigger problem is always
when to quit, not when to start.

23:49.570 --> 23:52.610
"Please look forward to the next
episode: Hidden Inventory 4!"

23:52.610 --> 23:54.460
I can't even say that.
