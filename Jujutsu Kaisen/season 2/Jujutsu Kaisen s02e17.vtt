WEBVTT

00:02.020 --> 00:03.150
Yuji.

00:06.240 --> 00:09.010
You are very strong,
so go help others.

00:18.290 --> 00:21.540
EPISODE 41: THUNDERBOLT PART 2

00:21.540 --> 00:24.710
23:05 DAOGENZAKA,

00:24.710 --> 00:26.300
BEFORE SHIBUYA 109
My Ten Shadows Technique...

00:26.300 --> 00:28.220
My Ten Shadows Technique...

00:28.220 --> 00:32.020
...can only get two Divine Dogs at first.

00:32.550 --> 00:34.470
If I want to use other Shikigami,

00:34.470 --> 00:37.590
I must figure out how to tame them.

00:39.060 --> 00:44.200
I can only acquire all ten Shikigami
by increasing the amount...

00:44.900 --> 00:49.600
...while taming them.

00:53.570 --> 00:54.760
Are you finished?

00:55.790 --> 00:58.160
Like the girl just now,

00:58.160 --> 01:01.220
you are very young,
yet very strong.

01:01.960 --> 01:05.750
You're seriously injured, yet you
managed not to let me get close.

01:05.750 --> 01:10.030
But from the way you're bleeding,
even if I don't do anything...

01:13.760 --> 01:15.680
The so-called taming...

01:16.080 --> 01:18.850
...can also be conducted
by multiple people together.

01:19.310 --> 01:25.320
However, a taming carried out by multiple
people will become invalid afterward.

01:25.320 --> 01:28.990
In other words, for the sorcerer,

01:28.990 --> 01:30.990
this ritual is meaningless.

01:32.070 --> 01:33.740
But,

01:33.740 --> 01:36.990
even if it's meaningless,
it still can be useful.

01:40.830 --> 01:43.390
Who's there making such a fuss?

01:44.500 --> 01:46.200
I haven't finished yet.

01:48.170 --> 01:52.910
So, although the Shikigami can
only be used after being tamed,

01:53.630 --> 01:55.620
if it's for the sake of taming,

01:56.260 --> 01:58.360
I can summon them anytime.

01:58.930 --> 01:59.770
Could it be...

02:02.770 --> 02:04.980
Among the generations of sorcerers,

02:04.980 --> 02:08.610
not a single person
has been able to tame this one.

02:09.570 --> 02:13.570
Do you know why the Gojo family
and the Zenin family don't get along?

02:14.160 --> 02:16.780
Were they never close,
to begin with?

02:16.780 --> 02:19.450
Right, we can't get along at all.

02:19.450 --> 02:22.250
It was in the Edo period,
or maybe the Keicho era.

02:22.580 --> 02:23.870
I forgot.

02:23.870 --> 02:26.420
But the leaders of both sides

02:26.420 --> 02:29.250
had a duel in a head-to-head contest.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.880
Both died in the end.

02:31.550 --> 02:33.480
The leader at that time was...

02:34.220 --> 02:35.390
Just like me.

02:35.890 --> 02:39.140
He had Six Eyes and
limitless cursed technique user.

02:39.140 --> 02:43.640
By the way, the technique
of the other side was the same as yours.

02:45.100 --> 02:46.980
Ten Shadows Technique.

02:49.650 --> 02:52.720
You know what I'm trying to say, right?

02:53.440 --> 02:54.690
Even so,

02:55.240 --> 02:58.280
I still can't become a sorcerer
who can defeat you.

02:59.490 --> 03:01.370
The leader at that time

03:01.370 --> 03:03.730
must have used it like this too.

03:06.210 --> 03:07.460
Furube,

03:07.880 --> 03:09.380
Yurayura.

03:13.210 --> 03:14.920
Lord Sukuna.

03:14.920 --> 03:16.250
I have urgent matters.

03:16.760 --> 03:18.060
I see.

03:18.850 --> 03:23.140
I will soon regain my freedom.

03:24.020 --> 03:26.730
Do not neglect preparation.

03:26.730 --> 03:28.400
See you later, Uraume.

03:28.400 --> 03:29.410
Yes.

03:30.570 --> 03:32.600
I am always waiting for your return.

03:50.250 --> 03:51.500
I've been tricked.

03:52.920 --> 03:54.050
It's a ritual.

03:54.050 --> 03:58.180
He started a ritual
and forced me to take part!

03:58.890 --> 04:01.180
Eight-Handled Sword,

04:01.680 --> 04:03.180
Divergent Sila Divine General,

04:04.000 --> 04:05.440
Mahoraga.

04:17.630 --> 04:18.570
See you later.

04:19.110 --> 04:19.950
Okay.

04:21.030 --> 04:23.060
Sorry, Itadori.

04:23.950 --> 04:25.950
Hey, jerk.

04:26.700 --> 04:30.170
I'm going to die first.
So good luck.

04:42.510 --> 04:46.220
Hold on...

04:46.220 --> 04:48.730
What kind of joke is this?!

04:49.140 --> 04:50.600
Damn it.

04:50.600 --> 04:53.990
Get up, you damn sorcerer!

04:55.190 --> 04:58.280
The technique of curse user Haruta Shigemo

04:58.280 --> 05:02.160
is to erase the tiny miracles
in daily life from memory

05:02.160 --> 05:03.570
and store them.

05:04.080 --> 05:07.410
The stored miracles will manifest
as patterns around his eyes

05:07.410 --> 05:11.110
and be released in a critical situation.

05:16.250 --> 05:20.900
But he does not know this.

05:28.930 --> 05:30.890
Is he in suspended animation?

05:32.190 --> 05:33.520
I see.

05:33.830 --> 05:37.780
It seems I did right by saving this trash.

05:38.320 --> 05:42.660
Fushiguro probably wanted to die with him,
so he got him into the exorcism ritual.

05:43.280 --> 05:46.120
Once he dies, the ritual will end.

05:46.120 --> 05:49.060
And Megumi Fushiguro will also die.

05:50.520 --> 05:51.520
You can't die.

05:52.120 --> 05:55.510
I still have work for you.

05:56.840 --> 05:58.880
U-Umm...

05:58.880 --> 06:00.040
Shut up.

06:02.680 --> 06:05.180
In order to save Megumi Fushiguro's life,

06:05.180 --> 06:08.680
the Shikigami must be taken
down by me, an outsider.

06:08.990 --> 06:12.180
Make it appear as if
the exorcism ritual never happened.

06:16.440 --> 06:17.820
Then let me...

06:17.820 --> 06:20.000
...have a taste.

06:26.370 --> 06:27.950
JUJUTSU KAISEN SEASON 2

06:53.020 --> 06:53.680
\"Dismantle.\"

07:10.370 --> 07:12.160
That sword...

07:12.160 --> 07:15.850
A specialized sword for cursed spirits.
The Sword of Extermination, huh?

07:16.420 --> 07:19.830
It's like the reverse cursed technique
and carries positive energy.

07:22.250 --> 07:24.010
If I were a cursed spirit,

07:24.010 --> 07:27.010
I would have vanished
with the first strike.

07:29.470 --> 07:31.180
Tastes terrible.

07:41.520 --> 07:42.190
Come on!

09:07.650 --> 09:09.520
What did you do?

10:00.660 --> 10:02.640
That was a strange response.

10:26.060 --> 10:27.190
Again?

11:22.580 --> 11:24.160
Cursed energy?

11:26.370 --> 11:28.380
You're really something.

12:02.160 --> 12:04.330
You can see...

12:04.330 --> 12:06.450
...my technique, right?

14:16.840 --> 14:18.250
As expected,

14:18.250 --> 14:21.050
it's something similar
to Yamata no Orochi.

14:21.840 --> 14:23.930
It saw through my slash

14:24.260 --> 14:27.100
and attacked me with cursed energy.

14:27.100 --> 14:30.060
Both happened after
that magic circle rotated.

14:31.060 --> 14:33.140
Furu's Incantation
and that magic circle

14:33.140 --> 14:36.560
represent a complete cycle and harmony.

14:37.020 --> 14:40.570
From this, I infer that
the Shikigami's ability is...

14:40.860 --> 14:43.320
...able to adapt to all phenomena.

14:43.320 --> 14:45.910
Kind of like a late throw-in
rock-paper-scissors!

14:48.370 --> 14:50.080
If it were me back then,

14:50.330 --> 14:52.840
perhaps I would have
already been defeated.

14:58.710 --> 15:01.880
Megumi Fushiguro,
you've fascinated me.

15:04.590 --> 15:06.820
Domain Expansion.

15:08.350 --> 15:10.010
Malevolent Shrine.

15:17.100 --> 15:18.730
Sukuna's Domain...

15:19.060 --> 15:20.770
...\"Malevolent Shrine.\"

15:21.900 --> 15:23.740
It's unlike other domains.

15:23.740 --> 15:26.740
It does not create
a separate space with a barrier

15:27.490 --> 15:31.370
or close the barrier, but makes
the Innate Domain visible.

15:31.370 --> 15:35.500
It's like not using a canvas,
but rather painting directly in the sky.

15:36.460 --> 15:38.760
A truly divine technique.

15:40.250 --> 15:44.210
Besides, with Binding Vow on the escape
route for the opponent,

15:44.210 --> 15:46.760
it increases the range of guaranteed hits

15:46.760 --> 15:50.410
to a maximum radius of 200 meters.

15:52.220 --> 15:55.140
Considering the effect would
affect Megumi Fushiguro,

15:55.140 --> 16:00.770
Sukuna has reduced the range
to a radius of 140 meters on the ground.

16:08.110 --> 16:09.160
How is it?

16:09.160 --> 16:10.780
No, no signal.

16:10.780 --> 16:11.530
Me either.

16:12.200 --> 16:15.350
But I don't think we need to be worried.

16:16.870 --> 16:18.570
We have the megaphone guy, right?

16:22.040 --> 16:25.010
Sukuna's slash attack has two types.

16:25.010 --> 16:26.710
Within the guaranteed hit range,

16:26.710 --> 16:29.740
\"Cleave\" is used against those
with cursed energy,

16:29.740 --> 16:32.550
while \"Dismantle\" is used against those
without cursed energy.

16:33.310 --> 16:35.180
Before \"Malevolent Shrine\" disappears,

16:35.180 --> 16:37.480
there will be an endless
series of attacks.

16:39.100 --> 16:42.360
This is the only way to break Mahoraga.

16:42.360 --> 16:46.390
Use a technique to the opponent
and kill him before he can adapt.

16:47.280 --> 16:49.570
\"Cleave\" fits this requirement.

16:49.570 --> 16:51.820
But if he adapts to the act of \"slash,\"

16:51.820 --> 16:55.080
instead of \"Dismantle,\"

16:55.720 --> 16:58.380
it will be a different story.

17:17.180 --> 17:21.100
The regeneration of Mahoraga
is about to end.

17:49.380 --> 17:50.360
\"Open.\"

18:42.980 --> 18:44.420
What are you looking at?

18:45.520 --> 18:46.540
Get lost.

18:52.240 --> 18:55.700
Well... I'll excuse myself then.

18:56.070 --> 18:58.250
I'm indeed very lucky!

18:59.030 --> 18:59.950
Today,

18:59.950 --> 19:02.830
I've escaped death again...!

19:04.080 --> 19:06.670
The miracles Shigemo stored

19:06.670 --> 19:10.590
have been run out during
his battle with Kento Nanami.

19:14.630 --> 19:16.220
It's almost time.

19:19.810 --> 19:20.870
Fushiguro!

19:22.560 --> 19:25.000
I just saw Itadori for a moment.

19:26.230 --> 19:27.100
No...

19:27.100 --> 19:28.770
23:14 DAOGENZAKA,
Was it Sukuna?

19:28.770 --> 19:31.480
BEFORE SHIBUYA 109

19:35.610 --> 19:37.030
Kid.

19:37.030 --> 19:39.400
You just savor it.

20:24.600 --> 20:25.910
Die...

20:27.160 --> 20:31.310
Only I should die...!

20:32.460 --> 20:33.610
Die!

20:34.960 --> 20:36.390
Die now!

21:36.360 --> 21:37.610
I have to go.

21:39.610 --> 21:40.900
I must fight.

21:50.020 --> 21:51.590
If this continues...

21:53.250 --> 21:54.250
JUJUTSU KAISEN SEASON 2: SHIBUYA INCIDENT

21:54.250 --> 21:55.960
JUJUTSU KAISEN SEASON 2: SHIBUYA INCIDENT
I'm nothing but a murderer.

21:55.960 --> 21:57.710
JUJUTSU KAISEN SEASON 2: SHIBUYA INCIDENT

23:52.620 --> 23:54.830
Things are getting out of hand!

23:54.830 --> 23:57.000
Let's count to calm down.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.340
One... two... three... nine.

24:00.340 --> 24:01.800
Five, seven.

24:01.800 --> 24:02.840
Next Episode: \"Right and Wrong.\"

24:02.840 --> 24:03.800
NEXT EPISODE: RIGHT AND WRONG
If you don't watch,

24:03.800 --> 24:04.670
NEXT EPISODE: RIGHT AND WRONG
I'll turn into a polar bear!

24:04.670 --> 24:07.010
NEXT EPISODE: RIGHT AND WRONG
Have you turned out to be a beast?
