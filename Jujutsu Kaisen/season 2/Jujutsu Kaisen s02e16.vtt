WEBVTT

00:01.610 --> 00:03.610
I understand very well.

00:04.900 --> 00:07.610
I've known this for a long time.

00:10.280 --> 00:13.280
But I didn't expect...!

00:23.540 --> 00:27.880
JUJUTSU KAISEN SEASON 2:
SHIBUYA INCIDENT

01:51.290 --> 01:53.590
He has no cursed energy,
but he is so fast.

01:53.590 --> 01:57.110
This guy might amount
to the best version of Senior Maki.

01:58.040 --> 01:59.390
I need to concentrate.

01:59.700 --> 02:01.020
Thanks to Senior Inumaki,

02:01.020 --> 02:03.390
All normal and transfigured humans
have been evacuated.

02:04.330 --> 02:05.610
I need to imagine...

02:06.110 --> 02:07.940
...a scene where I defeat him.

02:09.360 --> 02:10.220
Imagine...

02:11.440 --> 02:12.830
...defeating him!

02:15.320 --> 02:16.200
Rabbit Escape!

02:19.580 --> 02:21.330
That is the aura of Sukuna's finger!

02:22.080 --> 02:25.290
What's happening in Shibuya right now?!

02:33.420 --> 02:35.260
He dashed here based on his intuition!

02:44.480 --> 02:45.170
Dammit!

02:45.170 --> 02:47.940
The cursed energy I have left
is not enough to expand my domain.

03:30.900 --> 03:33.860
23:01 SHIBUYA STREAM

03:34.280 --> 03:35.280
Kusakabe.

03:35.280 --> 03:37.820
We don't need to investigate
inside the building, right?

03:38.240 --> 03:40.370
I know it's inside the curtain,

03:40.370 --> 03:43.290
but thanks to Toge, most people
have already been evacuated.

03:43.290 --> 03:45.500
Let's go to Satoru.

03:46.460 --> 03:49.400
How can we get to
the fifth floor underground?

03:50.080 --> 03:53.920
Toge said that Satoru was really sealed.
We should hurry up.

03:55.260 --> 03:57.170
You have mentioned Gojo all the time.

03:57.720 --> 04:01.300
It's not like he's
the only person in the world!

04:03.600 --> 04:05.480
Right now,

04:05.480 --> 04:09.310
perhaps there's someone
trembling in a corner of Shibuya.

04:09.310 --> 04:13.190
For example, a lower-grade
elementary school girl.

04:13.540 --> 04:16.070
What if we can't find her?

04:16.070 --> 04:21.450
We could be culprits
if she's deprived of her future.

04:21.940 --> 04:23.870
T-That makes sense.

04:23.870 --> 04:28.690
If you understand, check every building,
every floor, and even every toilet's lid.

04:29.540 --> 04:33.340
Damn, I can't come up
with more excuses.

04:33.960 --> 04:36.880
I am not going to
the fifth floor underground.

04:36.880 --> 04:40.090
I just want to keep procrastinating.

04:40.090 --> 04:42.600
Why? Because I don't want to die.

04:43.090 --> 04:45.050
Once Panda knows the location,

04:45.050 --> 04:47.340
he will rush to the fifth floor
underground alone.

04:47.340 --> 04:48.600
I want to avoid that too.

04:48.600 --> 04:51.350
Because I do not want
to be left alone here.

04:51.810 --> 04:56.070
He is a Panda, but he's more like
a human than me.

04:56.070 --> 04:59.240
But because he is a Panda,
he is not familiar with Shibuya.

04:59.240 --> 05:02.820
He's totally unaware of how close
we are to the fifth floor underground.

05:02.820 --> 05:05.330
I'll take a look over there.

05:05.330 --> 05:07.540
Okay, check carefully.

05:08.200 --> 05:10.790
Next, I'll pretend to be lost in the station.

05:10.790 --> 05:12.630
This is the group that sealed Gojo...

05:12.630 --> 05:15.470
Moreover, I've noticed
intermittent strong cursed energy.

05:16.090 --> 05:18.680
How am I supposed to proceed?
Ridiculous.

05:23.610 --> 05:25.890
Are you Jujutsu Sorcerers
from Jujutsu High?

05:26.260 --> 05:30.040
Just surrender. If possible,
I don't want to kill sorcerers.

05:31.520 --> 05:32.770
Panda.

05:32.770 --> 05:34.480
There are three people behind us.

05:34.480 --> 05:36.220
Probably more hiding.

05:37.900 --> 05:40.240
I don't want to be killed either.

05:40.240 --> 05:43.400
But I can't just surrender.

05:43.400 --> 05:45.580
Why don't you introduce yourselves?

05:46.030 --> 05:48.700
Make it long, if possible.

06:22.740 --> 06:24.700
Dragging this out
will only disadvantage me!

06:24.700 --> 06:27.120
I have to finish it quickly,
and I have no other choice.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.950
My only advantage is...

06:29.950 --> 06:32.580
22:51 CAPITAL EXPRESSWAY NO.3,
Principal, we still have cursed corpses here.

06:32.580 --> 06:33.870
SHIBUYA LINE, SHIBUYA TOLL STATION
I can stay here alone.

06:33.870 --> 06:35.500
SHIBUYA LINE, SHIBUYA TOLL STATION
You can't.

06:35.500 --> 06:38.460
If the enemy finds this place,
you will become their primary target.

06:38.460 --> 06:42.670
You can heal others with your reverse cursed
technique that even Satoru can't do.

06:42.670 --> 06:45.890
If you hadn't come,
Ino and Ijichi would have already died.

06:45.890 --> 06:48.890
Your accurate judgment is crucial too.

06:48.890 --> 06:52.180
If I had waited for Nanami's signal,
it would have been too late.

06:52.180 --> 06:55.250
And it's important
to let Nanami act freely.

06:58.900 --> 07:01.630
Didn't you quit smoking?

07:02.900 --> 07:06.700
It's because I recalled something
from my school days.

07:27.760 --> 07:30.000
Miss Ieiri is not far away.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.430
I must bear all the risks
of the battle by myself.

07:33.770 --> 07:35.820
Keep the injuries at a controllable level,

07:35.820 --> 07:37.230
and end this battle.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.730
I limited his route.

07:41.730 --> 07:43.890
His speed is like that
of Sukuna back then.

07:43.890 --> 07:46.610
I can't rely on my eyes,
and I have to seize the opportunity.

07:47.150 --> 07:49.240
If I miss the opportunity, I will die.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.560
If I miss the opportunity...

07:53.910 --> 07:55.250
...I will die!

08:15.850 --> 08:17.020
Damn it...

08:21.150 --> 08:22.400
My child...

08:23.050 --> 08:25.610
He must be very talented.

08:25.610 --> 08:29.030
When he reaches five or six, I can see
whether he possesses cursed techniques,

08:29.530 --> 08:31.460
then I can sell him to you.

08:31.900 --> 08:34.650
But of course, it depends on
how much you're willing to offer.

08:34.650 --> 08:37.040
If it's an Inherited Technique,
I'll charge 8.

08:37.040 --> 08:38.920
If something else, I'll charge 7.

08:40.920 --> 08:43.670
If it's an Inherited Technique,
I'll give you 10.

08:46.800 --> 08:49.090
Even though that place is a dump to me,

08:49.090 --> 08:51.910
he should be able to get by
if he's talented.

08:52.890 --> 08:54.220
It doesn't matter.

08:56.220 --> 08:57.660
It doesn't matter.

08:59.480 --> 09:01.400
I'll leave Megumi to you.

09:06.070 --> 09:07.370
Hey.

09:10.740 --> 09:11.910
What's your name?

09:14.490 --> 09:15.330
Fushiguro.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.160
Not Zenin?

09:25.840 --> 09:27.450
That's great.

09:45.190 --> 09:48.180
What's with this guy?

09:52.280 --> 09:54.370
Don't think about it.

09:54.370 --> 09:57.020
I should find Miss Ieiri quickly.

09:58.040 --> 09:59.200
No.

09:59.200 --> 10:02.790
I have to check if Senior Maki
and the others are safe.

10:07.840 --> 10:09.880
This is more like it!

10:09.880 --> 10:12.410
This suits me best!

10:16.550 --> 10:18.010
JUJUTSU KAISEN SEASON 2

10:19.850 --> 10:21.850
You want to assist that guy?

10:21.850 --> 10:26.150
You just want to use the opportunity
to reclaim Master Geto's body, right?

10:26.150 --> 10:27.610
No.

10:27.610 --> 10:31.110
The imposter's motive
and identity are still unclear.

10:31.110 --> 10:32.400
But...

10:32.400 --> 10:34.530
If the world falls into chaos,

10:34.530 --> 10:37.530
it's the non-sorcerer monkeys
who will suffer the most.

10:37.530 --> 10:40.740
Survival will necessitate
them being strong.

10:40.740 --> 10:43.760
Monkeys will be phased out,
while sorcerers will increase.

10:43.760 --> 10:45.790
Cursed Spirits will gradually disappear.

10:46.460 --> 10:48.820
That is the world Master Geto wanted.

10:49.460 --> 10:50.980
So I will assist him.

10:51.550 --> 10:54.090
I no longer care about the physical body.

10:54.840 --> 10:57.010
It's about carrying on a will.

10:57.420 --> 11:00.140
Don't make it more complicated.

11:00.140 --> 11:04.890
How can we stand by and watch the person
we love being used like a zombie?

11:05.560 --> 11:08.360
Master Geto's story has come to an end.

11:08.360 --> 11:10.480
I will not let anyone tarnish it.

11:10.480 --> 11:13.790
You should start acting
like an adult, Nanako.

11:15.320 --> 11:17.360
Adult or child...

11:17.780 --> 11:20.790
We have nothing left to discuss
if you talk like that!

11:26.580 --> 11:28.760
Stop, both of you.

11:30.420 --> 11:35.380
The thing Suguru didn't want to see
was us hurting each other.

11:36.300 --> 11:39.430
Neither of you are wrong.

11:40.140 --> 11:41.810
Let's part ways here.

11:43.100 --> 11:45.540
Do what we want to do.

11:46.100 --> 11:47.860
Larue, what about you?

11:48.900 --> 11:50.940
I will not join either side.

11:50.940 --> 11:52.790
Just like Miguel,

11:53.320 --> 11:57.580
I just wanted to help Suguru
become the king.

11:58.320 --> 12:01.580
But... never forget.

12:02.660 --> 12:04.580
We are family.

12:05.870 --> 12:08.060
One day, somewhere,

12:08.750 --> 12:11.100
we will gather again for a meal.

12:12.750 --> 12:16.130
We've inherited Master Geto's will.

12:16.130 --> 12:17.930
Since you are from the Jujutsu High,

12:17.930 --> 12:20.430
there's no need for more words.

12:20.840 --> 12:23.220
Are you going to surrender or not?

12:23.220 --> 12:25.430
I hate indecisive men.

12:26.140 --> 12:28.810
I'm Panda, so she's not talking about me.

12:28.810 --> 12:32.310
She makes it so brief, damn it.

12:33.480 --> 12:34.820
But then again,

12:35.190 --> 12:37.860
they are just a mediocre group.

12:37.860 --> 12:39.700
It's too easy.

12:39.700 --> 12:43.330
I will just deal with it casually
and kill time.

12:45.540 --> 12:49.080
New Shadow Style:
Evening Moon Sword Drawing.

12:49.370 --> 12:51.080
So that's your answer, huh?

13:15.740 --> 13:18.440
To thank you for the fingers,
just come at me.

13:18.440 --> 13:22.480
If you can hit me once,
I'll work under you.

13:23.160 --> 13:27.540
By then, I'll kill all
the humans in Shibuya,

13:28.120 --> 13:30.210
except for one.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.420
Is this all you've got?

13:31.420 --> 13:33.880
- It's not over yet!
- Cursed spirit!

14:12.210 --> 14:17.030
Geto, how many Sukuna's fingers
is my power equivalent to?

14:17.030 --> 14:20.580
Optimistically, eight or nine.

14:28.390 --> 14:29.810
I understand very well.

14:30.520 --> 14:32.890
I've known this for a long time.

15:17.980 --> 15:21.150
I knew the power gap was huge...

15:21.150 --> 15:23.150
But I didn't expect...

15:36.290 --> 15:38.890
The moonlight is so bright.

15:39.630 --> 15:43.580
Thanks to that, I can clearly see
how miserable you are.

15:45.470 --> 15:49.050
Come on, try harder.

15:49.550 --> 15:51.220
Before I get tired,

15:51.220 --> 15:53.480
I will keep playing with you.

15:57.230 --> 15:59.900
This place is dangerous now. Run!

15:59.900 --> 16:01.320
Where are you going?

16:02.590 --> 16:03.280
Listen...!

16:10.120 --> 16:11.670
Curse users, listen carefully.

16:11.670 --> 16:14.870
I'm not sure why, but there are
special grades killing each other!

16:14.870 --> 16:18.370
They're basically like
elephants dancing about on ants.

16:18.750 --> 16:21.740
- Let's leave now!
- To be clear, we're the ants!

16:27.340 --> 16:28.820
Maximum...

16:29.470 --> 16:30.340
...Meteor!

16:37.060 --> 16:38.540
New Shadow Style:

16:38.980 --> 16:40.690
Quick Draw.

16:41.190 --> 16:42.030
Panda.

16:42.650 --> 16:44.100
Let's escape...

16:44.100 --> 16:45.400
I won't allow that.

16:48.200 --> 16:51.910
To all humans in the vicinity,

16:51.910 --> 16:55.910
you are not allowed to move
until I say okay.

16:56.450 --> 17:00.180
If anyone dares to defy,
they will be killed without mercy.

17:04.380 --> 17:05.300
Not yet.

17:07.010 --> 17:08.420
Not yet.

17:14.470 --> 17:15.060
Okay.

17:32.570 --> 17:37.080
Even Sukuna wouldn't
come out unscathed.

17:38.160 --> 17:39.830
If you hit me.

17:41.710 --> 17:44.580
Why don't you use your domain?

17:46.550 --> 17:50.600
I know I can't defeat you
with a head-on domain.

17:51.090 --> 17:54.050
Because that was
how you lost to Satoru Gojo?

17:54.850 --> 17:57.380
Spoken like a true loser.

17:59.100 --> 18:03.100
But I'm just getting excited.

18:03.100 --> 18:05.690
Why don't you fight me
with your best skills?

18:08.320 --> 18:09.820
Open.

18:11.820 --> 18:12.950
Is that...

18:14.990 --> 18:16.700
...fire?!

18:17.700 --> 18:21.960
Aren't Sukuna's techniques
\"Dismantle\" and \"Cleave\"?

18:22.790 --> 18:26.960
I see. I thought you knew about this.

18:26.960 --> 18:30.010
But I supposed cursed spirits
probably wouldn't know.

18:30.010 --> 18:31.550
Don't worry.

18:31.550 --> 18:34.620
I won't resort to the trick
of revealing the technique.

18:35.890 --> 18:37.300
Get ready.

18:39.930 --> 18:42.560
Let's have a firepower battle.

19:13.010 --> 19:16.430
I'm sorry, Hanami, Dagon.

19:17.470 --> 19:19.690
Mahito is still alive.

19:21.720 --> 19:24.670
Humans fear death.

19:25.690 --> 19:27.480
But on the other end of death,

19:27.480 --> 19:29.660
there are also \"humans\" standing.

19:30.230 --> 19:32.810
To humans, death is a mirror.

19:32.810 --> 19:36.490
And Mahito is that mirror.

19:37.990 --> 19:41.080
Mahito can become even stronger.

19:41.080 --> 19:45.140
That's also why you made him
the leader, right?

19:46.120 --> 19:48.580
When we are reborn,

19:48.580 --> 19:51.500
we will no longer be ourselves.

19:51.500 --> 19:55.760
Even so, I really want
to meet you all again.

19:56.970 --> 20:00.180
Because we are the real humans.

20:00.180 --> 20:02.180
What?

20:02.890 --> 20:05.330
You want to become a human?

20:08.310 --> 20:10.190
I understand what you mean.

20:10.190 --> 20:12.150
You don't want to become a human.

20:12.150 --> 20:15.650
You just want to attain
the status of a human.

20:16.110 --> 20:19.380
Even though I understand,
I still find it incredibly dull.

20:20.160 --> 20:24.330
Crowds of humans,
crowds of curses.

20:24.330 --> 20:27.210
It is the flock mentality
that measures one's value

20:27.210 --> 20:30.670
that makes all beings weaker and weaker.

20:31.210 --> 20:34.300
You should burn everything.

20:34.300 --> 20:37.970
Regardless of gains, losses,
or plans, burn them all.

20:37.970 --> 20:40.430
Until you reach the realm of Satoru Gojo,

20:40.430 --> 20:43.140
and completely abandon
your future or race.

20:43.720 --> 20:49.190
What you lack is this kind of \"hunger\"
that clings to your ideals.

20:50.690 --> 20:54.190
Maybe that's how it is.

20:55.440 --> 20:59.320
But, I had fun.

21:01.160 --> 21:04.410
Humans, sorcerers, cursed spirits.

21:04.410 --> 21:07.990
Compared to those I fought
a thousand years ago, you are not bad.

21:09.460 --> 21:10.830
Be proud.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.750
You are strong.

21:18.920 --> 21:21.720
What is this?

21:23.050 --> 21:24.500
Who knows.

21:26.520 --> 21:28.460
I don't know either.

21:39.070 --> 21:40.490
Who are you?

21:41.200 --> 21:43.450
I have come to greet you.

21:44.950 --> 21:46.250
Lord Sukuna.

21:49.870 --> 21:51.370
Are you Uraume?

21:51.370 --> 21:53.490
Long time no see.

21:54.130 --> 21:56.860
23:07 SHIBUYA, DAOGENZAKA 109

21:56.860 --> 21:58.670
Are you kidding?

21:59.710 --> 22:00.630
Damn it...

22:04.260 --> 22:07.010
Get up, you damn sorcerer!

22:07.010 --> 22:10.020
EPISODE 40: THUNDERCLAP

23:40.770 --> 23:43.780
I see videos of cola with mentos
on the internet. Is that real?

23:43.780 --> 23:44.450
Why?

23:44.450 --> 23:48.030
I think I accidentally had mentos
with cola as a child,

23:48.030 --> 23:50.340
but I don't remember it,
so the video must be fake.

23:50.340 --> 23:51.390
Okay, eat it.

23:51.390 --> 23:53.160
Next Episode: \"Thunderbolt Part 2.\"

23:53.160 --> 23:55.040
See you next week.
