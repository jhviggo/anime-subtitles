WEBVTT

00:29.530 --> 00:32.220
Try harder, Itadori!

00:32.220 --> 00:36.470
This is our last chance
to curse each other!

00:40.400 --> 00:44.180
Hey, are you trying to forget me?

01:02.250 --> 01:03.260
He cut himself?!

01:25.730 --> 01:27.230
Soul Multiplicity!

01:28.150 --> 01:33.660
Numerous souls with a weak repulsion
response intermixed and turned into flesh.

01:34.780 --> 01:36.700
Polymorphic Soul Isomer!

01:37.870 --> 01:39.450
That transfigured human is...

01:53.050 --> 01:56.220
Since he's strong enough
to stop me and my brother,

01:56.220 --> 01:59.020
the proportion of his power
after splitting is probably...

01:59.020 --> 02:00.390
...2 to 8.

02:06.060 --> 02:09.230
And it indicates he weakened
the main body!

02:09.230 --> 02:12.570
I can leave that to my brother!
He can handle it!

02:15.410 --> 02:20.040
I heard the grade of transfigured humans
is about Grade 3 to Grade 2.

02:20.040 --> 02:23.000
You must finish him quick, Aoi Todo!

02:26.630 --> 02:27.380
What?

02:27.380 --> 02:28.420
Todo!

02:30.180 --> 02:31.630
You underestimated me!

03:00.700 --> 03:02.130
He's dead?

03:03.330 --> 03:05.580
He was so strong,

03:05.580 --> 03:07.170
yet he died from a single blow.

03:11.380 --> 03:13.170
I see.

03:13.600 --> 03:17.220
He let several souls
burn out in an instant

03:17.220 --> 03:20.300
to obtain explosive power, huh?

03:20.300 --> 03:24.350
Super offensive transfigured human, and...

03:25.180 --> 03:27.340
...there are two more.

03:34.490 --> 03:38.310
Forgive me, you poor souls.

03:49.540 --> 03:53.630
JUJUTSU KAISEN SEASON 2:
SHIBUYA INCIDENT

05:16.460 --> 05:19.760
I've finally separated him
from that gorilla.

05:19.760 --> 05:21.220
That's exactly...

05:21.220 --> 05:22.300
...what I want!

06:35.290 --> 06:36.880
It seems...

06:37.170 --> 06:40.130
...you don't want me
to join the fun, eh?

06:41.270 --> 06:44.880
Even Two Polymorphic Soul Isomers
couldn't kill him?

06:47.970 --> 06:51.600
It seems quite hard to hit him.

06:52.140 --> 06:55.650
But if I expand my domain,

06:58.860 --> 07:01.770
I will encounter Sukuna
and get killed by him.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.860
Barrier techniques are complex.

07:04.860 --> 07:08.200
Itadori knows that I once expanded
a domain that excluded him.

07:08.830 --> 07:11.390
Repeating the same trick on him
probably won't work.

07:11.830 --> 07:14.460
Then, what should I do?

07:14.460 --> 07:17.120
The person who taught me
this trick was...

07:19.960 --> 07:21.590
Domain Expansion.

07:23.380 --> 07:25.970
Self-Embodiment of Perfection!

07:27.760 --> 07:29.670
That's practically suicide!

07:30.220 --> 07:32.180
Let's take a gamble!

07:32.180 --> 07:35.230
0.2 seconds of Domain Expansion!

07:39.020 --> 07:42.980
Todo expanded the Simple Domain
that Yuki Tsukumo taught him

07:42.980 --> 07:44.690
to protect himself from the domain.

07:47.450 --> 07:51.280
Itadori was faster, and he sprinted forward,
attempting to exorcise Mahito

07:51.280 --> 07:53.450
before the activation
of Idle Transfiguration.

07:55.830 --> 07:59.000
However, Mahito launched
the technique faster than Itadori.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.250
The materialization of Innate Domain
and the activation of the technique

08:02.250 --> 08:05.300
combined the project
of two stages into one.

08:05.300 --> 08:09.280
Experiencing Black Flash and being in
an awakened state enabled him to act so fast.

08:12.760 --> 08:16.520
Did I pass safely, Sukuna?

08:18.560 --> 08:20.020
For someone like you,

08:20.020 --> 08:22.790
you must have set up a barrier
between you and Itadori.

08:23.860 --> 08:25.380
I'm not gonna let that happen.

08:25.900 --> 08:28.950
I'll kill him before you switch with him.

08:28.950 --> 08:31.030
Just stay here and watch.

08:52.050 --> 08:53.240
Todo!

08:59.060 --> 09:00.310
What's the matter?

09:00.810 --> 09:02.690
I just made it prettier for you.

09:03.630 --> 09:04.900
After the Domain Expansion,

09:04.900 --> 09:10.070
the technique etched on the body
will become difficult to use.

09:10.070 --> 09:15.240
Mahito realized this when he escaped
from Satozakura High School.

09:17.660 --> 09:19.540
Black Flash!

09:22.670 --> 09:23.920
This guy...

09:24.540 --> 09:28.420
He instinctively concentrated
all his cursed energy in his abdomen.

09:34.680 --> 09:37.100
But my technique has already recovered.

09:37.100 --> 09:38.850
And he can't clap!

09:39.230 --> 09:41.850
This time, I can definitely kill him!

Black Flash!

11:06.980 --> 11:08.940
He still touched me for a moment.

11:09.400 --> 11:12.080
It's a miracle to only
have such a slight injury.

11:24.790 --> 11:27.500
Leave the rest to me, Todo.

11:27.830 --> 11:30.130
Thank you, Todo!

11:32.000 --> 11:33.380
Damn!

11:33.380 --> 11:36.720
I got hit directly
by Black Flash at this time!

11:36.720 --> 11:40.010
That gorilla was messing around
till the very end!

11:40.600 --> 11:43.020
But I've finally grasped...

11:43.340 --> 11:46.060
...the essence of my soul...

11:46.060 --> 11:48.020
...and its true form!

11:49.230 --> 11:51.020
Idle Transfiguration.

12:04.240 --> 12:06.580
Instant Spirit Body of Distorted Killing.

12:07.330 --> 12:09.960
Time to say happy birthday.

12:10.750 --> 12:12.000
Itadori.

12:15.380 --> 12:17.970
JUJUTSU KAISEN SEASON 2

12:18.800 --> 12:22.390
This is different from any
transformations he used before.

12:23.930 --> 12:25.280
What's the difference?

12:25.720 --> 12:28.690
After experiencing Black Flash,
I finally understood

12:28.690 --> 12:32.480
my true, unbridled soul.

12:32.860 --> 12:34.440
That's unexpected.

12:34.440 --> 12:37.490
Didn't expect you to be
the type to find your life purpose.

12:38.860 --> 12:40.070
Yeah.

12:40.860 --> 12:43.030
But I'm just beginning to wrap things up.

12:43.490 --> 12:45.490
After I kill you,

12:45.490 --> 12:48.750
I will truly be born into this world.

13:29.120 --> 13:31.870
So hard. His body...

13:32.460 --> 13:33.420
...is even harder now.

13:52.310 --> 13:55.310
After experiencing Black Flash,
I finally understood

13:55.310 --> 13:59.070
my true, unbridled soul.

13:59.530 --> 14:01.360
So that's how it is.

14:09.870 --> 14:11.910
This guy...

14:22.170 --> 14:23.880
In terms of cursed spirit,

14:23.880 --> 14:28.010
he has become totally different compared
with the one before the transformation!

14:59.460 --> 15:02.010
To defeat him,

15:03.050 --> 15:03.970
I can only activate...

15:03.970 --> 15:06.220
NO SORCERER CAN CONSCIOUSLY
Black Flash with maximum

15:06.220 --> 15:07.220
UNLEASH BLACK FLASH
cursed energy and hit him.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.390
This is the only way.

15:26.950 --> 15:28.160
It's only for a moment,

15:28.160 --> 15:33.250
but the Black Flash I took after
Domain Expansion indeed has effects.

15:47.720 --> 15:49.260
It seems that we...

15:50.470 --> 15:53.100
...are still full of vitality!

16:17.710 --> 16:20.790
No one can consciously
unleash Black Flash.

16:21.500 --> 16:22.920
But the current Itadori

16:23.380 --> 16:26.510
makes one feel he can freely unleash it.

16:28.130 --> 16:29.260
In that case...

16:58.910 --> 17:00.580
He used the time difference?!

17:12.720 --> 17:16.720
Cursed spirit, there is
something you don't know.

17:18.100 --> 17:20.440
The wrist is just for decoration.

17:21.020 --> 17:24.270
The so-called clap is the cheer...

17:25.320 --> 17:26.530
...of souls.

17:29.440 --> 17:32.360
No position switch?

17:32.360 --> 17:34.030
Unfortunately,

17:34.740 --> 17:39.040
my \"Boogie Woogie\" is dead.

17:50.090 --> 17:52.280
Black flash!

18:23.830 --> 18:26.850
Not yet...

18:32.380 --> 18:35.090
The stock of my transfigured humans...

18:35.510 --> 18:37.850
I admit it, Mahito.

18:39.930 --> 18:41.220
I am you.

18:42.890 --> 18:44.850
I've always wanted to deny you.

18:45.900 --> 18:48.480
I didn't want to agree
with what you said.

18:50.820 --> 18:52.090
But now it's different.

18:53.020 --> 18:54.610
I just want to kill you.

18:55.110 --> 18:57.370
If you are born again as a new curse,

18:57.870 --> 18:59.120
I will kill that guy too.

18:59.660 --> 19:01.950
Even if you change your name and look,

19:01.950 --> 19:03.370
I will kill you again.

19:04.210 --> 19:06.380
There's no need for meaning or reason.

19:07.130 --> 19:09.420
Maybe centuries after my death,

19:10.340 --> 19:13.630
this act will only become meaningful.

19:14.720 --> 19:20.140
I guess I must be only
a cog of some great thing.

19:21.260 --> 19:24.000
I will keep killing curses
before I get rusty.

19:25.060 --> 19:25.980
This is...

19:27.480 --> 19:29.650
...my mission in this war.

21:46.990 --> 21:48.500
Geto!

21:49.250 --> 21:52.000
Do you need me to save you, Mahito?

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
EPISODE 45: TRANSFORMATION

23:25.510 --> 23:28.600
An arranged fate
may not be considered fate.

23:28.600 --> 23:29.300
However,

23:29.680 --> 23:32.310
in the moment when false fates intertwine,

23:32.310 --> 23:34.680
it becomes a kind of fate.

23:34.680 --> 23:37.190
Next Episode: \"Transformation Part 2.\"

23:37.190 --> 23:39.560
Some things flourish
within the gilded layers.
