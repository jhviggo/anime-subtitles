WEBVTT

00:01.340 --> 00:03.760
Let's go home, Riko-chan.

00:04.350 --> 00:05.300
Yeah!

00:16.360 --> 00:17.780
Riko-chan?

00:19.320 --> 00:21.280
Okay, job's done.

00:21.700 --> 00:23.610
You're free to go now.

00:24.370 --> 00:26.530
Why are you here?

00:27.240 --> 00:28.790
Why?

00:29.160 --> 00:31.370
Oh, that's what you mean.

00:32.250 --> 00:35.130
Because I killed Satoru Gojo.

00:35.130 --> 00:36.590
Is that so?

00:36.590 --> 00:37.630
Die!

01:12.370 --> 01:14.160
Don't be so impatient.

01:14.160 --> 01:17.170
Episode 27
Hidden Inventory 4

01:26.300 --> 01:31.310
JUJUTSU KAISEN
Hidden Inventory/Premature Death

02:56.390 --> 02:58.310
The Tombs of the Star
and the Forbidden Vault

02:58.310 --> 02:59.900
use barriers that conceal.

03:00.230 --> 03:02.400
So they can't place guards at the entrances.

03:03.480 --> 03:05.780
As long as you know where the doors are,

03:05.780 --> 03:07.360
they're full of holes.

03:07.820 --> 03:10.610
Sorcerers are busy during this time of year,

03:10.610 --> 03:14.030
and Jujutsu High is brimming
with Fly Heads right now.

03:14.030 --> 03:16.500
It's pure chaos outside.

03:16.890 --> 03:20.420
And since I have no cursed energy,
I'm like the invisible man.

03:20.780 --> 03:23.380
There was one problem, though.

03:23.950 --> 03:25.380
If I wield a cursed tool,

03:25.780 --> 03:29.470
the cursed energy from it will stop
me from being an invisible man.

03:36.970 --> 03:38.810
Now, there's more to this story.

03:40.560 --> 03:44.150
See, I keep a cursed spirit
capable of storing objects around.

03:44.150 --> 03:46.820
So I usually put my cursed tools
in it when I'm walking around.

03:48.320 --> 03:49.900
You don't have to say it.

03:49.900 --> 03:51.610
Yes, that means the cursed energy from

03:51.610 --> 03:54.450
the cursed spirit should stop me
from being an invisible man.

03:57.160 --> 04:01.620
So I make the cursed spirit smaller,
until it can fit inside my body.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.750
Then I keep it inside my stomach.

04:05.750 --> 04:08.840
After all, the organs of the invisible
man are invisible, too, right?

04:09.180 --> 04:11.840
That's how I'm able to
pass through any barrier

04:11.840 --> 04:14.300
while still carrying
all kinds of cursed tools.

04:17.970 --> 04:22.140
That's also why I didn't use
a cursed tool at first.

04:23.980 --> 04:26.020
A surprise attack on the Six Eyes

04:26.020 --> 04:28.610
would be pointless if I wasn't invisible.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.200
I could've killed the Star Plasma Vessel first,

04:32.200 --> 04:34.740
but the risk of the Six Eyes seeing me was too—

04:34.740 --> 04:35.660
Enough.

04:35.660 --> 04:37.450
You have a Heavenly Pact, right?

04:37.450 --> 04:39.160
I know revealing information about

04:39.160 --> 04:42.620
your ability increases its fundamental
strength, just like for a sorcerer.

04:42.940 --> 04:45.130
That's not what I want to know.

04:46.790 --> 04:49.670
How did you know which doors
led to the Tombs of the Star?

04:50.090 --> 04:53.380
We didn't leave even
the slightest residuals.

04:53.740 --> 04:57.070
Humans leave plenty of
traces aside from residuals.

04:57.070 --> 04:59.520
Like scents, footprints, and so on.

04:59.520 --> 05:01.980
My pact enhances all five of my senses, too.

05:02.270 --> 05:05.060
There should have been
another woman on the way here.

05:05.060 --> 05:06.440
What happened to her?

05:06.440 --> 05:07.440
Hm?

05:07.860 --> 05:10.280
Oh, that maid?

05:10.280 --> 05:11.820
She's probably dead.

05:11.820 --> 05:14.150
I didn't care if she lived or died, though.

05:14.150 --> 05:15.860
If she's lucky, she might still be alive.

05:16.280 --> 05:17.780
Is that so?

05:17.780 --> 05:20.660
You really should... die!

06:01.680 --> 06:04.100
That Rainbow Dragon has
the toughest hide there is!

06:12.340 --> 06:14.300
Curse Manipulation...

06:15.170 --> 06:16.430
Riffraff.

06:29.450 --> 06:31.270
Hey, am...

06:31.270 --> 06:34.030
Am... Am I...

06:34.030 --> 06:35.610
pretty?

06:36.850 --> 06:38.450
A potential apparition?

06:38.450 --> 06:40.240
It deploys a simple domain that

06:40.240 --> 06:43.960
enforces non-violence on both of us
until I answer its question, then?

06:44.580 --> 06:46.790
Ah, well...

06:46.790 --> 06:48.620
Then I'll just come out and say

06:48.620 --> 06:49.890
you're not my type.

06:55.670 --> 06:57.380
So that's how it is.

07:03.100 --> 07:04.350
Idiot.

07:05.350 --> 07:06.560
It's over.

07:07.140 --> 07:08.310
For you!

07:11.900 --> 07:13.570
Curse Manipulation.

07:14.020 --> 07:16.150
It's a technique that lets me
absorb cursed spirits

07:16.150 --> 07:18.570
that have surrendered,
and freely manipulate them.

07:18.570 --> 07:21.530
If there's roughly a two-grade
difference in our levels,

07:21.530 --> 07:22.950
I skip making them submit

07:22.950 --> 07:25.120
and absorb them unconditionally.

07:26.540 --> 07:29.980
His cursed spirit may have a unique ability,
but it's not that strong itself.

07:30.540 --> 07:33.130
I can absorb it. That'll lock down his armory.

07:34.130 --> 07:36.000
Then I can just brute-force him—

08:03.490 --> 08:06.660
I didn't cut you badly enough to kill you.

08:06.980 --> 08:09.200
I would've killed you if
you were a shikigami user,

08:09.200 --> 08:11.580
but since it's Curse Manipulation,

08:11.920 --> 08:16.010
there's no telling what might happen to the
cursed spirits you've absorbed after you die.

08:17.350 --> 08:19.980
I'd rather avoid extra trouble here.

08:20.510 --> 08:22.220
You have the blessing of parentage.

08:22.970 --> 08:25.970
But even with that blessing,

08:26.300 --> 08:30.520
you were all beaten by a monkey like me
who can't even use cursed techniques.

08:31.250 --> 08:33.770
If you want to live a long life,
never forget that.

08:37.750 --> 08:40.240
Oh, speaking of blessings...

08:40.240 --> 08:42.200
That's right. I almost forgot.

08:42.200 --> 08:44.410
I named him Megumi.

08:51.370 --> 08:54.170
JUJUTSU KAISEN
JUJUTSU KAISEN

08:54.170 --> 08:56.930
Star Religious Group Headquarters
House of the Children of the Star

09:10.320 --> 09:11.820
Go on, now.

09:16.380 --> 09:19.370
The corpse of the Star Plasma
Vessel, Riko Amanai.

09:19.370 --> 09:20.990
All four limbs intact, too.

09:25.280 --> 09:27.040
Hmm, indeed.

09:27.570 --> 09:30.170
We'll issue your payment as we discussed.

09:31.380 --> 09:33.300
I'll even throw in a bonus.

09:33.590 --> 09:35.470
Thank you, Founder.

09:35.470 --> 09:36.800
You're so generous.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.890
He's not the founder.

09:38.890 --> 09:39.890
Huh?

09:41.100 --> 09:42.510
Do you mean it?

09:42.510 --> 09:46.270
I know it was a necessary expense,
but you've already helped us out a lot, too.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.940
I thought you'd complain a bit more.

09:50.530 --> 09:54.230
We hired you for the assassination
expecting that it would fail.

09:54.230 --> 09:56.190
Our Star Religious Group
was founded in the Nara Era,

09:56.190 --> 09:59.410
when Tengen-sama began preaching

09:59.410 --> 10:01.780
about the moral foundation
of jujutsu sorcerers,

10:01.780 --> 10:04.360
a minority, as Buddhism
spread throughout Japan.

10:04.990 --> 10:08.500
Jujutsu society and religious corporations
are at complete odds with each other.

10:08.500 --> 10:10.750
That strain is what gave birth

10:10.750 --> 10:15.090
to our modern Star Religious Group,
the Time Vessel Association.

10:15.090 --> 10:18.510
That is also why we have devoted
ourselves to remaining non-sorcerers.

10:19.080 --> 10:22.350
Jujutsu sorcerers are granted
many privileges above the law,

10:22.350 --> 10:25.270
but they're still fundamentally forbidden
to lay a hand on non-sorcerers.

10:25.680 --> 10:28.310
However, the time had finally arrived.

10:28.770 --> 10:32.560
The time of the taboo
recorded in our scriptures!

10:32.940 --> 10:34.650
Our Star Religious Group has evolved to

10:34.650 --> 10:36.860
a monotheistic religion
worshiping one absolute god!

10:36.860 --> 10:40.910
And it was now time for our object of
worship to assimilate with that impurity!

10:42.820 --> 10:45.790
If our believers saw us simply sit back
and watch the assimilation happen,

10:45.790 --> 10:47.540
our Association would crumble.

10:48.250 --> 10:52.790
Yet if we took excessive action,
jujutsu sorcerers would crush us.

10:53.080 --> 10:56.550
So we were truly desperate.

10:56.550 --> 10:58.760
And how did it all turn out?

10:58.760 --> 11:01.180
We thought we were going to lose everything,

11:01.180 --> 11:03.300
and now we have it all!

11:03.600 --> 11:06.770
Of course that would
loosen our purse strings.

11:08.730 --> 11:14.310
Human society might be what crumbles
if Tengen-sama loses control, though.

11:16.270 --> 11:19.900
If we should perish along with our star,
then that is all there is to it.

11:31.560 --> 11:34.960
Were you referring to Okinawa
when you said they helped us?

11:34.960 --> 11:35.830
Yeah.

11:36.170 --> 11:39.380
Why didn't you kill the maid then?

11:39.380 --> 11:40.790
I know I told you,

11:41.020 --> 11:44.510
"Take her someplace far away,
and kill her at some point."

11:45.050 --> 11:49.270
Because I had a good idea of what
you were planning at the time.

11:49.600 --> 11:52.340
I made the call that the relief
from the maid's successful rescue

11:52.340 --> 11:56.190
would wear him down more than
heightened tensions from failure.

11:56.690 --> 12:02.140
You often ignore the lines of communication
and toss out whatever I was planning, right?

12:02.820 --> 12:04.780
It all worked out in the end.

12:04.780 --> 12:08.030
And stop running your mediator ragged.

12:08.030 --> 12:10.790
Yeah, but why Okinawa?

12:12.790 --> 12:15.080
I had a laugh at that myself.

12:15.080 --> 12:18.250
Normally, you'd use a car
to transport a captive, right?

12:18.250 --> 12:21.460
Public transportation carries
too many risks, after all.

12:21.840 --> 12:26.010
But get this. The president
owned his own private jet.

12:26.640 --> 12:28.890
Even so...

12:30.890 --> 12:33.850
Rich people think on a different scale, man.

12:33.850 --> 12:36.190
Well, let's go eat with their money.

12:36.190 --> 12:38.820
Take me to one of the
restaurants you use for clients.

12:39.780 --> 12:40.820
No way.

12:40.820 --> 12:42.820
You never pay for a guy, anyway.

12:44.280 --> 12:46.610
I've already decided I'll only see you

12:46.610 --> 12:49.830
either for work or in Hell.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.050
Huh?

13:11.140 --> 13:13.850
Hey, it's been a while.

13:15.100 --> 13:16.350
For real?

13:16.600 --> 13:18.310
For real, real.

13:19.270 --> 13:21.570
I'm alive and kicking!

13:21.980 --> 13:23.760
Reverse cursed technique!

13:24.400 --> 13:26.030
Bingo!

13:26.030 --> 13:28.630
When you stabbed me through the throat,

13:28.630 --> 13:30.160
I gave up on counterattacking

13:30.160 --> 13:32.990
and poured all my focus into
the reverse cursed technique.

13:33.620 --> 13:35.660
Cursed energy is negative energy.

13:35.660 --> 13:38.880
While it can enhance the body,
it can't regenerate it.

13:38.880 --> 13:43.460
So you multiply that negative energy
against itself to create positive energy.

13:43.460 --> 13:45.220
That's the reverse cursed technique.

13:45.220 --> 13:47.050
Easier said than done!

13:47.050 --> 13:49.420
I hadn't been able to do
that up until now myself!

13:49.420 --> 13:51.260
And I couldn't understand anything
the one person who could do it said!

13:51.260 --> 13:53.010
He's blabbing on and on...
And I couldn't understand anything
the one person who could do it said!

13:53.390 --> 13:56.730
He's high.

13:57.270 --> 13:59.680
But I finally grasped it
on the verge of death!

13:59.680 --> 14:01.680
The true essence of cursed energy!

14:01.680 --> 14:05.280
The reason you're going to lose is
because you didn't chop my head off,

14:05.280 --> 14:08.950
and because you didn't use that cursed
tool when you stabbed my head.

14:09.450 --> 14:10.950
I'm going to lose?

14:13.740 --> 14:15.740
Our fight is just getting started.

14:16.120 --> 14:18.160
Oh? Is it?

14:18.160 --> 14:19.670
Yeah...

14:19.670 --> 14:21.460
Maybe so!

14:34.810 --> 14:36.350
Cursed Technique Reversal:

14:38.480 --> 14:39.350
Red.

14:54.660 --> 14:56.110
Monster.

15:03.250 --> 15:04.960
No bones are broken.

15:05.460 --> 15:08.880
That shock wave was an
application of Limitless,

15:08.880 --> 15:10.920
the cursed technique reversal, Red, huh?

15:11.930 --> 15:15.390
So he poured the positive energy generated
by the reverse cursed technique

15:15.390 --> 15:20.190
into the Limitless
technique ingrained into him.

15:20.730 --> 15:22.770
One, the power to stop:

15:22.770 --> 15:24.940
the neutral application
of the Limitless technique.

15:26.370 --> 15:28.610
Two, the power to attract:

15:28.610 --> 15:31.320
the amplified application of
the Limitless technique, Blue.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.780
And three, the power to repel:

15:34.780 --> 15:36.620
the reversal of his cursed technique, Red.

15:39.660 --> 15:42.530
All things I can handle.

15:44.500 --> 15:45.500
Something's off.

15:51.380 --> 15:52.630
Something's off.

15:55.660 --> 15:57.640
No, this is fine.

15:59.930 --> 16:01.180
I'll kill you.

16:21.360 --> 16:23.670
Sorry, Amanai.

16:24.170 --> 16:27.670
I'm not even angry over you right now.

16:28.880 --> 16:30.880
I bear no grudge against anyone.

16:33.210 --> 16:37.900
It's just that the world feels
so, so wonderful right now.

16:55.140 --> 16:58.160
"Throughout Heaven and Earth,
I alone am the honored one."

17:01.840 --> 17:04.870
The merit of having a technique
that's passed down for generations

17:04.870 --> 17:06.460
is having a user's manual.

17:07.380 --> 17:08.920
The demerit is that

17:08.920 --> 17:11.840
information about the
technique is easily leaked.

17:11.840 --> 17:14.800
You were a member of
the Zen'in clan, weren't you?

17:15.320 --> 17:18.680
That's why you know so much
about the Limitless technique.

17:20.350 --> 17:23.520
However, even in the Gojo clan,

17:23.520 --> 17:25.810
only a scant few know about this.

17:36.880 --> 17:38.910
Take the amplified and the reversal,

17:38.910 --> 17:41.740
then smash together those
two different expressions

17:41.780 --> 17:44.410
of infinity to create and
push out imaginary mass.

17:44.750 --> 17:47.170
Imaginary Technique: Purple.

17:56.300 --> 17:57.760
Something's off.

17:59.390 --> 18:01.680
"I refuse to do any work for free."

18:02.010 --> 18:05.310
Normally I would've said that
and hightailed it out of there.

18:06.270 --> 18:11.020
Yet the freshly awakened wielder of the
Limitless technique was right before my eyes.

18:11.560 --> 18:14.650
He was probably the strongest jujutsu
sorcerer of the modern age.

18:15.400 --> 18:17.400
I wanted to reject him.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.490
I wanted to bring him to his knees.

18:19.960 --> 18:23.240
I wanted to take down the
pinnacle of the jujutsu world

18:23.240 --> 18:24.870
and the Zen'in clan that rejected me.

18:25.950 --> 18:30.830
I twisted myself to try to affirm myself.

18:32.130 --> 18:34.880
That was the moment I lost.

18:44.600 --> 18:46.890
I thought you had abandoned that pride.

18:48.180 --> 18:54.480
I thought you had chosen to live without
respecting yourself or anyone else.

18:58.900 --> 19:01.400
Any last words?

19:04.330 --> 19:05.870
Nah.

19:17.260 --> 19:19.470
Two or three years from now,

19:19.470 --> 19:22.140
my kid will be sold off to the Zen'in clan.

19:22.930 --> 19:24.800
Do what you will with that.

21:24.420 --> 21:26.470
Mommy!

21:26.840 --> 21:28.840
Hug me!

22:07.830 --> 22:09.630
You're late, Suguru.

22:10.060 --> 22:12.300
No, I guess you got here fast.

22:12.730 --> 22:16.590
There are several Star Religious
Group facilities in the city, after all.

22:17.940 --> 22:20.560
Satoru? Is that you?

22:21.370 --> 22:23.020
What happened?

22:23.560 --> 22:25.690
I see you already saw Shoko.

22:26.120 --> 22:28.110
Yeah, she healed me.

22:28.590 --> 22:30.070
I'm fine now.

22:33.150 --> 22:36.580
No, me being safe doesn't
help anything here.

22:36.940 --> 22:38.500
I screwed up.

22:38.500 --> 22:39.950
You're not at fault.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.080
Let's head back.

22:42.580 --> 22:46.210
Suguru, should we kill these guys?

22:46.980 --> 22:49.920
The way I feel right now,
I doubt I'd feel anything about it.

22:52.460 --> 22:54.890
No. There's no point.

22:55.720 --> 22:59.260
It looks like there are only
common believers here.

22:59.660 --> 23:03.150
The masterminds who know about our
world have probably fled already.

23:03.940 --> 23:05.980
And unlike with the bounty,

23:05.980 --> 23:08.690
they won't be able to
talk their way out of this.

23:08.690 --> 23:11.110
The organization had
problems to begin with.

23:11.470 --> 23:13.080
It'll be dissolved soon enough.

23:15.160 --> 23:16.370
No point, huh?

23:16.740 --> 23:19.870
Does there really need
to be any point to it?

23:31.550 --> 23:33.380
It's very important that there is.

23:34.050 --> 23:37.010
Especially for a jujutsu sorcerer.

23:40.470 --> 23:43.000
I wonder if whoever came up with the phrase

23:43.000 --> 23:45.270
"a surprising side"
thought of people as cubes,

23:45.270 --> 23:47.600
and if whoever came up with the insult

23:47.600 --> 23:50.030
"shallow" thought of people as flat surfaces?

23:50.030 --> 23:51.740
Next time, "Premature Death."

23:51.740 --> 23:54.780
Either way, people do have two sides to them.
