00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
<b>Q: What do you think of Satoru Gojo?</b>

00:04.160 --> 00:05.360
He's a teacher!

00:05.800 --> 00:10.090
And without him, I would have been 
executed by now, so he's also—

00:10.090 --> 00:11.990
Technically, he's my benefactor.

00:12.290 --> 00:13.420
Technically.

00:13.420 --> 00:16.560
That also goes for other 
people, too, not just me.

00:16.560 --> 00:20.670
Honestly, I don't know him all that well.

00:20.670 --> 00:22.930
But there's one thing I can say for certain.

00:23.230 --> 00:23.990
He's an idiot.

00:23.990 --> 00:24.910
Yeah, he's an idiot.

00:24.910 --> 00:25.890
Salmon.

00:26.350 --> 00:27.560
But still...

00:27.560 --> 00:29.980
He's flippant. Egotistical.

00:29.980 --> 00:31.860
And it goes without saying, but...

00:32.500 --> 00:33.930
He's the strongest!

<b>JUJUTSU KAISEN

02:26.020 --> 02:29.020
<b>Episode 33
Shibuya Incident - Gate, Open</b>

02:35.030 --> 02:37.010
Hey there, weed.

02:37.010 --> 02:38.970
This is the third time we've met, right?

02:40.630 --> 02:43.240
And you still underestimate 
the hell out of me.

02:43.240 --> 02:45.330
I'll kill you first.

02:48.300 --> 02:49.920
Come on, bring it.

02:50.330 --> 02:51.500
What's your problem?

02:51.840 --> 02:53.590
You're the ones who said

02:54.790 --> 02:56.850
not to run, right?

03:07.380 --> 03:08.850
<i>Did he just touch—</i>

03:27.110 --> 03:28.490
One, two...

03:35.030 --> 03:37.130
<i>He's only targeting Jogo.</i>

03:45.550 --> 03:48.670
<i>So his earlier declaration 
was just misdirection?</i>

03:48.670 --> 03:50.360
<i>He's also...</i>

03:54.580 --> 03:57.570
<i>stopped using his Limitless technique!</i>

03:59.790 --> 04:00.870
No!

04:01.110 --> 04:03.580
<i>He's given up on adjusting his technique,</i>

04:03.580 --> 04:06.320
<i>and started focusing on 
compact attacks using</i>

04:06.320 --> 04:10.040
<i>cursed energy manipulation in this 
space that's filling up with humans?</i>

04:15.320 --> 04:19.810
<i>However, that means there's 
no need to slip into the crowd.</i>

04:20.640 --> 04:23.750
<i>I can just use my technique!</i>

04:29.410 --> 04:32.350
Don't dismiss Domain Amplification, Hanami!

04:38.650 --> 04:41.610
This is where you're weak, right?

04:45.830 --> 04:46.920
I knew it.

04:46.920 --> 04:50.370
You can't use Domain Amplification and 
your Innate Technique at the same time.

04:50.650 --> 04:54.850
<i>I remained safe only because I used 
Domain Amplification to protect myself.</i>

04:54.850 --> 04:58.500
<i>He's operating at this level with only basic 
cursed energy manipulation and martial arts!</i>

05:00.790 --> 05:02.960
<i>Satoru Gojo,</i>

05:02.960 --> 05:06.260
<i>what is there that you're </i>not<i> capable of?!</i>

05:09.190 --> 05:10.180
Tsk.

05:10.180 --> 05:12.250
<i>He's not a cursed spirit.</i>

05:12.250 --> 05:14.890
<i>I bet he's one of the incarnated 
Death Painting Wombs.</i>

05:14.890 --> 05:16.770
<i>He's annoying, but he comes later.</i>

05:20.090 --> 05:21.670
Are you sure about this?

05:22.810 --> 05:26.490
The more you try to neutralize my technique 
with your Domain Amplification,

05:26.490 --> 05:29.700
the stronger I have to maintain my technique.

05:29.700 --> 05:34.110
I don't think this asparagus has the 
energy left to withstand that, do you?

05:34.320 --> 05:35.090
Wha—

05:51.770 --> 05:53.520
Satoru Gojo!

05:53.520 --> 05:54.730
Look over here!

06:09.740 --> 06:11.250
Hanami...

06:21.610 --> 06:22.520
Next.

06:23.390 --> 06:25.630
The Prison Realm is a living barrier.

06:25.630 --> 06:27.490
It's what Genshin was reduced to.

06:27.490 --> 06:30.520
There's nothing that cannot be 
sealed in the Prison Realm.

06:32.360 --> 06:35.970
Then of course there are conditions 
to sealing something in it, right?

06:36.870 --> 06:38.150
One minute.

06:43.200 --> 06:44.160
Huh?

06:45.230 --> 06:46.950
Once the Prison Realm's gate is opened,

06:46.950 --> 06:51.000
we'll have to keep Satoru Gojo 
in its effective sealing range

06:51.710 --> 06:54.450
of four meters for one whole minute.

07:26.400 --> 07:27.820
Hey.

07:28.810 --> 07:31.130
I'll burn you to death!

07:31.130 --> 07:37.290
You didn't join forces with us just to push 
that impossible task onto us, did you?

07:37.290 --> 07:40.540
Even the lives of several 
thousand ignorant humans

07:40.540 --> 07:44.980
wouldn't be enough to warrant fighting 
that thing under those conditions

07:44.980 --> 07:46.850
for a full minute.

07:49.070 --> 07:51.380
You're getting heated up, Jogo.

07:52.010 --> 07:53.370
It's all right.

07:53.370 --> 07:55.460
Even though we do need a minute—

08:24.810 --> 08:27.740
<i>Don't let Hanami's death be in vain.</i>

08:27.740 --> 08:32.210
<i>Use the humans as cover, 
and focus on hit-and-run tactics!</i>

08:39.600 --> 08:41.180
Choso!

08:41.350 --> 08:45.190
If you're not going to help, 
I'll kill you myself!

08:48.720 --> 08:50.280
Yeah, yeah.

08:54.830 --> 08:56.770
<i>Not too close, not too far.</i>

08:56.770 --> 08:58.770
<i>But that's the best they can do.</i>

08:58.770 --> 09:02.210
<i>The people who can't see cursed 
spirits have started avoiding me.</i>

09:02.210 --> 09:05.170
<i>If their numbers keep declining 
and space opens up,</i>

09:05.170 --> 09:07.370
<i>then I can catch Volcano Head.</i>

09:07.370 --> 09:10.960
<i>No more releasing my technique 
to lure it in like before.</i>

09:10.960 --> 09:14.750
<i>I've revealed my goal of beating 
them to a pulp in close combat,</i>

09:14.750 --> 09:17.200
<i>and it'll be an issue if it keeps 
its distance and coordinates with</i>

09:17.200 --> 09:19.800
<i>that Death Painting to unleash 
a big attack through the crowd.</i>

09:22.110 --> 09:25.280
<i>I'm sorry. I can't save everyone.</i>

09:26.140 --> 09:32.230
<i>So I promise to exorcise them instead!</i>

09:32.650 --> 09:34.290
<i>It's still not time?!</i>

09:34.290 --> 09:37.230
<i>It has to have been over 
twenty minutes by now!</i>

09:40.210 --> 09:41.840
Not yet.

09:42.860 --> 09:45.520
Satoru Gojo's still completely composed.

12:11.410 --> 12:13.210

Let me tell you one of the 
gross things about humans.

13:03.760 --> 13:06.090
There are too many of them!

13:15.560 --> 13:18.900

<i>Satoru Gojo isn't like Yuji Itadori.</i>

13:44.840 --> 13:47.880
<i>I know he's capable of cold logic.</i>

13:48.340 --> 13:50.970
<i>He probably assumes 
some degree of sacrifice</i>

13:50.970 --> 13:54.220
<i>is needed as he makes certain to exorcise us.</i>

13:54.890 --> 13:59.060
<i>But with both the death count and 
the number of living people rising,</i>

13:59.060 --> 14:03.400
<i>the scales determining what degree 
is acceptable can no longer function.</i>

14:04.230 --> 14:07.610
<i>What you need to do right now</i>

14:07.610 --> 14:11.410
<i>is use your Infinite Void to 
kill us and all the people here</i>

14:11.410 --> 14:14.660
<i>so you can save the people 
outside of your domain.</i>

14:14.660 --> 14:17.330
<i>But you're incapable of doing that.</i>

14:17.330 --> 14:19.830
<i>Because the sacrifices 
you're willing to accept</i>

14:19.830 --> 14:22.540
<i>are "people killed by cursed spirits,"</i>

14:22.540 --> 14:26.670
<i>not "people killed by Satoru Gojo."</i>

14:28.010 --> 14:29.430
<i>Now, think.</i>

14:29.800 --> 14:31.470
<i>Ponder it.</i>

14:31.470 --> 14:33.850
<i>Focus your mind!</i>

14:38.390 --> 14:40.060
For real?

14:40.060 --> 14:42.230
Domain Expansion:

14:43.110 --> 14:45.030
Infinite Void.

15:16.140 --> 15:20.730
<i>It was a desperate gamble on a Domain 
Expansion lasting two tenths of a second.</i>

15:25.570 --> 15:29.570
<i>Two tenths of a second was the limit 
Satoru Gojo set purely on instinct.</i>

15:29.570 --> 15:31.610
<i>It was the amount of time he believed</i>

15:31.610 --> 15:34.280
<i>non-sorcerers could 
withstand being in Infinite Void</i>

15:34.280 --> 15:37.540
<i>without becoming vegetables 
or facing after-effects.</i>

15:47.300 --> 15:49.130
<i>During that two tenths of a second,</i>

15:49.130 --> 15:52.130
<i>roughly half a year's worth 
of information flowed into</i>

15:52.130 --> 15:56.180
<i>the brains of the non-sorcerers 
and transfigured humans present,</i>

15:56.180 --> 15:59.640
<i>rendering every one of them 
unconscious while standing upright.</i>

16:15.990 --> 16:19.040
<i>However, all the survivors from B5F</i>

16:19.040 --> 16:22.710
<i>were able to return to 
society two months later.</i>

16:22.710 --> 16:24.920
<i>That's how limited his Infinite Void was.</i>

16:36.390 --> 16:41.180
<i>Of course, that meant the special-grade 
cursed spirits could reawaken at any moment.</i>

16:41.180 --> 16:43.770
<i>So, with their potential 
counterattack in mind,</i>

16:43.770 --> 16:47.270
<i>Satoru Gojo narrowed his focus 
on the transfigured humans.</i>

17:10.210 --> 17:14.880
<i>After dismissing his domain, 
the strongest sorcerer of the modern age</i>

17:14.880 --> 17:19.800
<i>slaughtered all of the roughly 1,000 
transfigured humans unleashed upon B5F</i>

18:08.730 --> 18:10.980
Even though we do need a minute...

18:24.660 --> 18:25.330
Hey,

18:28.580 --> 18:29.670
Satoru.

18:30.880 --> 18:31.670
Huh?

18:32.670 --> 18:34.170
Long time no see.

18:39.760 --> 18:41.430
<i>A fake?</i>

18:42.390 --> 18:44.510
<i>A transformation technique?</i>

18:46.810 --> 18:49.310
<i>No, it's really him!</i>

19:01.110 --> 19:04.740
It's only a minute in Satoru Gojo's mind.

19:12.500 --> 19:14.710
You shouldn't lose yourself in thought

19:14.710 --> 19:17.340
in the midst of battle, Satoru.

19:17.340 --> 19:19.670
<i>I can't sense any cursed energy.</i>

19:19.670 --> 19:21.760
<i>I can't get my body to move, either.</i>

19:22.340 --> 19:23.760
<i>This is checkmate, huh?</i>

19:24.970 --> 19:27.640
So, who the hell are you?

19:28.810 --> 19:30.390
I'm Suguru Geto.

19:31.100 --> 19:32.810
Don't you remember me?

19:32.810 --> 19:34.110
How sad.

19:34.480 --> 19:36.730
Your body, your cursed energy...

19:36.730 --> 19:40.950
All the information provided by these 
eyes is telling me you're Suguru Geto.

19:44.950 --> 19:46.370
But...

19:48.370 --> 19:51.370
By soul is rejecting all that!

19:51.370 --> 19:53.210
Now, answer me already!

19:53.210 --> 19:54.960
Who the hell are you?!

19:59.340 --> 20:00.720
Creepy.

20:09.560 --> 20:11.390
How could you tell?

20:13.910 --> 20:15.830
That's my technique, you see.

20:16.260 --> 20:19.860
I can pass from one body to another 
by replacing its brain with myself.

20:19.860 --> 20:23.360
Of course, I'm also able to use the 
technique etched into the body I inhabit.

20:23.860 --> 20:27.530
I really wanted this man's curse 
manipulation and this situation, too.

20:27.530 --> 20:28.580
You didn't have

20:28.580 --> 20:33.250
Shoko Ieiri handle the disposal of 
Suguru Geto's body that day, did you?

20:37.250 --> 20:39.880
That was an odd time for 
you to show consideration.

20:39.880 --> 20:43.050
But thanks to that, I was able 
to obtain this body with ease.

20:43.880 --> 20:47.220
You needn't worry. 
I'll release your seal eventually.

20:48.390 --> 20:51.850
A hundred... no, maybe 
a thousand years from now?

20:51.850 --> 20:54.020
You're just too strong.

20:54.770 --> 20:56.980
And you're in the way of my plans.

20:56.980 --> 20:59.360
Hah! Have you forgotten?

20:59.690 --> 21:03.950
Who was it that beat the crap out 
of that body before I killed him?

21:04.490 --> 21:06.570
Yuta Okkotsu, huh?

21:06.570 --> 21:10.830
I just don't see as much appeal 
in that boy as you do.

21:13.250 --> 21:17.920
Copying techniques without any conditions, 
and a bottomless well of cursed energy...

21:18.250 --> 21:21.050
Both of those were just effects obtained

21:21.050 --> 21:24.220
from binding the soul of his 
most beloved with a pact.

21:25.800 --> 21:27.550
Sorry to say this,

21:27.550 --> 21:30.760
but Yuta Okkotsu can never replace you.

21:35.980 --> 21:38.150
Goodnight, Satoru Gojo.

21:39.610 --> 21:42.730
We'll meet again in the new world.

21:48.360 --> 21:49.910
What's the matter?

21:50.330 --> 21:52.700
Something in my ear.

21:53.200 --> 21:55.410
<i>Can you hear me, Yuji Itadori?</i>

21:55.410 --> 21:56.210
Huh?

21:57.040 --> 21:58.710
<i>There's no time.</i>

21:58.710 --> 22:00.750
<i>Listen and understand the first time.</i>

22:02.840 --> 22:08.220
<i>Satoru Gojo has been sealed.</i>

23:40.300 --> 23:41.880
What do you think of skin care?

23:41.880 --> 23:44.200
What? You're asking me that? Not that I mind.

23:44.200 --> 23:46.540
I do all kinds of things, but like, 
it ultimately comes down to genetics.

23:46.540 --> 23:48.120
I'm sure those with pale, smooth skin

23:48.120 --> 23:50.770
like Gojo-sensei would say, 
"I don't really do anything."

23:50.770 --> 23:51.760
Next time, "Pandemonium."

23:50.780 --> 23:54.990
<b>Next Episode
Pandemonium</b>

23:51.740 --> 23:52.560
So what do you actually do?

23:52.560 --> 23:53.360
Nothing, really.

23:53.360 --> 23:54.710
Grr!
