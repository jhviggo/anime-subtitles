00:29.840 --> 00:31.510
That's more like it!

00:48.310 --> 00:52.610
<b>Ultimate Mechamaru, Mode: Absolute
“Armored Puppet Ultimate Mechamaru Prototype 0”</b>

00:53.530 --> 00:57.620
That's right. My victory
condition is Satoru Gojo.

00:57.990 --> 01:01.830
I have to use any means necessary
to get in contact with Satoru Gojo,

01:01.830 --> 01:03.500
and tell him about the Shibuya plot.

01:04.120 --> 01:05.960
Then I'll have him protect me.

01:06.290 --> 01:09.590
But even if I want to focus on Geto,
the one who lowered this veil,

01:10.000 --> 01:12.210
Mahito, is too dangerous to ignore.

01:12.550 --> 01:14.670
I'll have to exorcise him first.

01:15.450 --> 01:18.450
17 years 1 month 29 days

01:18.450 --> 01:19.430
16 Years

01:19.430 --> 01:21.560
Charge, one year!

01:21.560 --> 01:24.180
Burn him, Mechamaru!

01:27.390 --> 01:29.690
Ultra Cannon!

01:51.170 --> 01:54.590
Are you planning to keep burning me
until you run out of cursed energy?

01:55.300 --> 01:59.800
I'll start by drawing you out of there!

02:01.970 --> 02:04.970
Episode 31
Evening Festival

02:15.530 --> 02:20.030
JUJUTSU KAISEN
Shibuya Incident

03:40.570 --> 03:42.360
Mechamaru's attacks

03:42.360 --> 03:44.870
won't be able to damage Mahito's soul.

03:45.120 --> 03:47.950
Now he should be certain of that, as well.

04:29.490 --> 04:31.120
Charge, two years!

04:32.100 --> 04:35.540
Miracle Cannon!

04:45.460 --> 04:47.930
You won't break off your attack.

04:48.260 --> 04:51.100
You're not paying my attacks any heed now.

04:51.640 --> 04:55.100
That's when I shoot you with this!

05:00.190 --> 05:02.440
What power!

05:02.440 --> 05:06.320
If I take too long, he'll break all my armor.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.830
Technique loaded.

05:10.830 --> 05:14.080
I have four chances!

05:14.710 --> 05:19.340
I'll end this quickly!

05:24.760 --> 05:27.550
Fire, Mechamaru!

05:32.470 --> 05:34.180
There's no point.

05:34.180 --> 05:36.560
What have you been watching all this time?

05:39.400 --> 05:40.060
Huh?

06:01.540 --> 06:03.210
What's going on here?

06:03.590 --> 06:05.840
My soul was destroyed, too?

06:18.980 --> 06:22.230
Tsk! Another bird? No imagination!

06:24.230 --> 06:27.320
The left arm I blew away has regenerated?

06:28.050 --> 06:33.620
No, he's just tweaking the shape of his soul
to make it look like it regenerated.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.790
The fact that he's showing
it off is proof of that.

06:40.870 --> 06:42.210
It's all right.

06:42.920 --> 06:44.800
I will...

06:47.800 --> 06:49.300
It's affecting him.

06:49.760 --> 06:51.430
He's not doing badly.

06:51.430 --> 06:55.220
It might be temporary, but his cursed
energy output is special-grade class,

06:55.220 --> 06:57.520
and he came fully prepared
to deal with Mahito, too.

06:57.980 --> 07:00.850
Depending on how this goes,
this could be the moment I get...

07:07.400 --> 07:08.990
Charge, five years!

07:15.240 --> 07:18.080
Pigeon Viola!

07:49.900 --> 07:50.780
Tsk!

08:03.680 --> 08:07.040
I can't tell which of his attacks
will actually affect my soul.

08:07.040 --> 08:10.010
I need to make that clear first.

08:29.520 --> 08:30.820
I can do this!

08:35.740 --> 08:37.320
Technique loaded.

08:38.620 --> 08:40.120
I can win!

08:40.980 --> 08:44.370
I'll be able to see everyone!

08:58.970 --> 09:00.850
Domain Expansion:

09:00.850 --> 09:03.060
Self-Embodiment of Perfection.

09:24.710 --> 09:26.330
And you're finished.

09:36.050 --> 09:37.720
Idle Transfiguration.

09:45.310 --> 09:50.150
It doesn't matter if I touch you
directly once you're inside my domain.

09:50.150 --> 09:52.900
<b>9 Years 5 Months 6 Days
You already understood that, too, right?</b>

09:52.900 --> 09:56.950
<b>9 Years 5 Months 6 Days</b>

09:58.400 --> 10:02.200
That cursed technique is sealed in these.

10:02.780 --> 10:07.750
Though that was the only way
I was able to manage this technique.

10:08.510 --> 10:11.380
There's only ten days until Halloween.

10:11.380 --> 10:15.090
Did you think that meant I'd hold back my
cursed energy and avoid using my domain?

10:15.090 --> 10:17.720
Give me ten days to rest
and I'll make a full recovery.

10:19.580 --> 10:21.680
I have two left in stock.

10:24.050 --> 10:26.100
This was devised in the Heian Era,

10:26.100 --> 10:32.400
an era full of fierce cursed spirits and
curse users when jujutsu was at its height,

10:32.400 --> 10:35.730
by Sadatsuna Ashiya to protect his disciples.

10:37.750 --> 10:40.950
Don't incorporate hopes and
dreams into your strategy.

10:40.950 --> 10:44.200
I feel so bad for you that I don't
know what expression to take.

10:45.490 --> 10:47.200
It was passed down in his school,

10:47.680 --> 10:49.540
and a pact forbade his students

10:49.540 --> 10:53.000
from intentionally conveying
that technique to others.

10:53.490 --> 10:57.050
It's a means for them to protect
themselves from others' domains,

11:02.180 --> 11:04.930
a domain for the weak...

11:12.690 --> 11:13.880
Huh?

11:14.870 --> 11:18.530
New Shadow Style: Simple Domain!

11:24.710 --> 11:27.740
<i>I've seen it all.</i>

11:49.220 --> 11:51.230
Simple Domain!

11:51.820 --> 11:54.730
A domain neutralizes all other techniques.

11:54.730 --> 11:58.980
Attacks will land, even on Satoru Gojo,
when they're made within a domain.

11:59.630 --> 12:00.990
Even if it's a simple one,

12:01.310 --> 12:04.260
activating it inside a domain

12:04.260 --> 12:08.870
would damage Mahito,
regardless of any techniques.

12:14.330 --> 12:17.170
No more spectating from the sidelines,

12:18.880 --> 12:20.010
Geto!

12:24.340 --> 12:26.260
What a happy miscalculation!

12:26.260 --> 12:29.930
I still have one simple domain and
nine years of cursed energy left.

12:29.930 --> 12:31.560
I can fight Geto!

12:35.400 --> 12:36.270
I can win!

12:37.050 --> 12:41.780
I'll be able to see everyone!

12:51.950 --> 12:54.330
I failed to finish him off?!

12:54.690 --> 12:59.250
Come out! Mechamaru!

13:07.220 --> 13:09.470
I still have one domain left.

13:09.470 --> 13:11.470
I'll ram it directly into him!

13:13.230 --> 13:15.100
Here we go, Mechamaru!

14:14.910 --> 14:16.200
Hey, Mechamaru?

14:16.930 --> 14:19.370
Is it okay if I pay you
a visit sometime soon?

14:22.630 --> 14:24.130
Since the exchange event...

14:24.130 --> 14:28.550
Since the baseball game, I feel like
we've all become closer to each other.

14:28.840 --> 14:31.760
Maybe it's because we all
work as jujutsu sorcerers,

14:31.760 --> 14:35.930
but I feel like there was always distance
between us, even if we all got along.

14:37.930 --> 14:42.270
I suppose that's because being too close would
make it even more painful when we died.

14:44.090 --> 14:48.320
But I love the relationship we all have now.

14:48.610 --> 14:52.370
And you couldn't quite participate
in the baseball game, remember?

14:52.370 --> 14:55.290
So you had a pitching
machine fill in for you.

14:59.370 --> 15:03.520
But I want to be even closer
to you, Mechamaru.

15:05.380 --> 15:10.970
So, one day, I will come see you.

15:14.340 --> 15:16.810
That was a bit dangerous for you, wasn't it?

15:17.160 --> 15:21.310
I made myself burst apart at the
same instant his technique activated.

15:21.770 --> 15:24.610
Undoing my domain after that would
make him think I was dead, right?

15:24.610 --> 15:26.070
It was all calculated.

15:26.070 --> 15:28.070
It wasn't dangerous at all.

15:28.070 --> 15:30.590
So that was another use of a simple domain...

15:31.030 --> 15:33.570
Good thing we got to see it in
action before the main event, huh?

15:33.570 --> 15:34.870
Yeah.

15:34.870 --> 15:37.870
I was able to finish adjusting
the entrusted veil, too.

15:38.500 --> 15:42.880
There won't be any problems with entrusting
the cursed energy and chant to others.

15:46.380 --> 15:49.260
November 1, Heisei 30 [Hokkaido] Sunny, Partly Cloudy [Aomori] Rain [Miyagi]
Today's Weather

16:05.310 --> 16:10.360
Just after 7 PM on October 31st, 2018,

16:10.360 --> 16:13.660
a roughly 400-meter radius veil was lowered,

16:13.660 --> 16:17.830
centered around Tokyu
Department Store's Toyoko Outlet.

16:21.160 --> 16:23.960

16:38.110 --> 16:39.510

Yay, yay, yay, yay!

16:39.510 --> 16:40.050

Yay, yay, yay, yay!

16:40.050 --> 16:41.360
Idiot, stop that!

16:41.740 --> 16:46.430
I heard a lot of people come in from
Ibaraki and Tochigi for Halloween.

16:46.430 --> 16:47.710
From way out there?

16:47.710 --> 16:49.230
Excuse me!

16:49.230 --> 16:50.770
Can I take your picture?

16:50.770 --> 16:52.650
You're really cute!

16:52.650 --> 16:53.820
Thanks!

16:53.820 --> 16:54.820
Gladly!

16:58.240 --> 16:59.280
Way to go.

16:59.280 --> 17:01.780
Let's not do Shibuya again next year.

17:03.620 --> 17:04.990
What is that?

17:04.990 --> 17:06.450
Hm? What's what?

17:06.450 --> 17:08.290
That. That right there.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.960
Huh? What do you mean?

17:13.630 --> 17:15.550
I'm telling you, that right there!

17:15.550 --> 17:17.760
Are your eyes okay?

17:27.100 --> 17:28.680
Yay!

17:29.770 --> 17:30.640
Ow!

17:30.640 --> 17:32.060
What are you doing?

17:32.060 --> 17:33.100
Idiot!

17:33.100 --> 17:34.770
Are you already drunk?

17:34.770 --> 17:36.070
It's too early for that!

17:36.070 --> 17:38.940
Look, I'm telling you there's
a wall there! A wall!

Did you know that when adding
effects to the barrier of a veil,

18:36.210 --> 18:39.710
you can basically only apply them
to "things with cursed energy"?

18:39.710 --> 18:43.420
That's roughly people,
cursed spirits, and cursed objects.

18:43.420 --> 18:47.930
So blocking cell phone signals is just
a side effect of a veil being lowered,

18:47.930 --> 18:52.890

surrounding signal into a veil's barrier.

once we're inside the veil anyway.

20:27.030 --> 20:31.200
Minimize casualties? They're talking
about sorcerer casualties, aren't they?

20:31.200 --> 20:34.440
They don't care about any casualties
among regular people, do they?

20:34.440 --> 20:36.450
Don't get bristly with me.

20:36.450 --> 20:39.670
Unlike last year's Night Parade of
a Hundred Demons on Christmas,

20:39.670 --> 20:41.170
events are already in motion.

20:41.170 --> 20:43.420
I think this was the best call, too.

20:43.420 --> 20:46.630
Besides, I had a peek inside the veil earlier,

20:46.630 --> 20:48.480
and it was pretty peaceful.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.510
Regular people were panicking, sure,

20:50.510 --> 20:53.930
but there weren't any cursed spirits
or curse users going around killing them.

20:53.930 --> 20:57.300
At present, those regular people
are just trapped inside.

20:57.850 --> 21:01.270
Though, honestly, I don't want to
go back inside there again.

21:01.270 --> 21:02.440
Why's that?

21:02.900 --> 21:05.820
It was in Hikarie, I think.

21:05.860 --> 21:06.690
<b>Same Time, Bunkamura Street
Dogenzaka 2-Chome East (Inside the Veil)</b>

21:06.690 --> 21:10.740
Most likely, there's lots of special-grade
cursed spirits underground.

<b>Same Time, Bunkamura Street
Dogenzaka 2-Chome East (Inside the Veil)</b>

21:11.740 --> 21:13.070
What's going on?!

21:13.070 --> 21:14.490
Why can't we pass through here?!

21:14.490 --> 21:17.500
Hurry up and bring Satoru Gojo!

21:17.500 --> 21:19.290
Who is this Gojo?!

21:19.290 --> 21:20.790
I don't know!

21:20.790 --> 21:23.500
But we were told we can't get
out unless he comes here!

21:23.500 --> 21:24.300
Who said that?

21:24.300 --> 21:26.090
I don't know! Everyone!

21:26.090 --> 21:29.420
What do you think of guys who can't
keep a cool head at times like these?

21:29.420 --> 21:32.470
Well, being trapped is something
out of a horror film,

21:32.470 --> 21:34.510
but we're not really in
that much trouble, right?

21:34.510 --> 21:36.260
I'm sure help will come soon.

21:36.260 --> 21:36.640
Oh, but we have no signal!

21:36.640 --> 21:38.390

Oh, but we have no signal!

21:38.390 --> 21:41.060
Did you all not see it earlier?

21:41.060 --> 21:42.850
They got sucked up.

21:42.850 --> 21:47.150
The people crowded around in the
intersection got sucked into the station!

21:47.150 --> 21:49.940
Like they were water
going down a bathtub drain!

21:49.940 --> 21:53.070
If it wasn't for that, I'd just
be going home on the train, too!

21:53.070 --> 21:55.780
Use your brain a little, you dumb fucks!

21:55.780 --> 21:56.330
Huh?!

21:56.660 --> 21:59.340
Then why don't you go ahead and make
it so smart people can pass through?!

22:00.710 --> 22:02.210
Ow.

22:05.500 --> 22:06.920
Oh, sorry.

22:06.960 --> 22:09.960
<b>20:31 Satoru Gojo Arrives</b>

23:40.840 --> 23:44.380
I told you to go buy melon bread,
but this is chocolate chip melon bread!

23:44.380 --> 23:46.310
Obviously it's way better
with chocolate chips!

23:46.310 --> 23:48.310
They're as different as fried
taters and Gundam models!

23:48.310 --> 23:49.720
Huh? What are taters?

23:49.720 --> 23:50.120
Huh?
