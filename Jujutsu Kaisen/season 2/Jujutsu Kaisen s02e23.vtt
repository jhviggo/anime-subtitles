JUJUTSU KAISEN SEASON 2:
SHIBUYA INCIDENT

01:44.610 --> 01:46.090
Do you still remember...

01:47.810 --> 01:50.670
...the method to make
cursed spirits disappear?

01:53.790 --> 01:55.870
No matter what methods are used,

01:56.360 --> 02:00.170
humans will advance to a higher stage.

02:01.670 --> 02:02.830
For now,

02:02.830 --> 02:05.400
I need to buy time for Larue to move.

02:07.730 --> 02:10.050
The next stage for humans

02:10.050 --> 02:13.150
is to detach from Cursed Energy.

02:15.290 --> 02:18.020
Wrong, it's about optimizing
Cursed Energy.

02:23.680 --> 02:26.420
No, I don't understand
either of those.

02:26.990 --> 02:29.430
I thought that when
Toji Zenin died 12 years ago,

02:29.430 --> 02:32.920
the \"detachment\" plan
was already abandoned.

02:33.200 --> 02:35.820
I've discussed this with you...

02:37.060 --> 02:38.680
Well, never mind.

02:39.690 --> 02:41.420
Let's go back to the origin.

02:41.920 --> 02:45.310
Besides, your plan has a major flaw.

02:46.010 --> 02:48.120
Compared to Japan,

02:48.120 --> 02:51.320
there are far fewer sorcerers
and cursed spirits abroad.

02:52.380 --> 02:57.280
The barrier of Tengen will be
indispensable for the \"Optimization\" plan.

02:58.680 --> 03:00.840
If you want to use Tengen,

03:00.840 --> 03:02.560
then only people in this country

03:02.560 --> 03:05.860
can optimize Cursed Energy
and become sorcerers.

03:07.020 --> 03:11.500
Cursed Energy will almost
be monopolized by Japan.

03:12.260 --> 03:13.900
And for another country...

03:13.900 --> 03:16.010
No country in the whole
world will remain silent.

03:17.290 --> 03:19.760
Living humans will become an energy source.

03:20.200 --> 03:24.020
It's easy to imagine what kind
of misfortune will happen, isn't it?

03:26.560 --> 03:30.520
That's not the ideal world
I have depicted.

03:32.810 --> 03:34.150
So what?

03:34.930 --> 03:37.410
Our goals were different from the start.

03:37.910 --> 03:40.160
What I pursue is not a world
without cursed spirits,

03:40.520 --> 03:43.160
nor a peaceful world.

03:43.560 --> 03:46.790
Non-sorcerers, sorcerers, and cursed spirits...

03:46.790 --> 03:49.670
All of these are a \"possibility.\"

03:49.670 --> 03:52.550
A possibility of \"human\" as
a form of \"cursed energy\".

03:54.450 --> 03:58.440
But a human's potential
should be more than this.

03:59.140 --> 04:01.180
I have also tried...

04:01.560 --> 04:03.930
...to bring that possibility by myself.

04:08.290 --> 04:10.650
But that doesn't work.

04:10.650 --> 04:12.440
What I have created

04:12.870 --> 04:15.280
is ultimately limited
by my own possibilities.

04:15.930 --> 04:17.640
The answer is always

04:17.640 --> 04:20.990
the entity with a black glow amidst chaos.

04:21.950 --> 04:23.350
Do you understand?

04:23.350 --> 04:25.270
What I should create

04:25.270 --> 04:28.410
is chaos that cannot
be controlled by me.

04:29.090 --> 04:32.420
The cursed technique
has been extracted.

04:34.530 --> 04:36.840
There should be a cursed
spirit called Mahito, right?!

04:36.840 --> 04:39.270
The one that has a cursed technique
to manipulate souls!

04:39.270 --> 04:41.050
He just swallowed him.

04:41.050 --> 04:42.350
Seriously?!

04:44.950 --> 04:46.880
Idle Transfiguration.

05:08.870 --> 05:11.210
Tengen's barrier... No.

05:11.700 --> 05:12.710
This is...

05:13.050 --> 05:15.000
...the long-range activation
of a technique.

05:15.570 --> 05:18.560
I want to thank you, Yuji Itadori.

05:19.360 --> 05:23.610
From the moment cursed spirits are absorbed
through cursed spirits manipulation,

05:23.610 --> 05:26.880
the precision of the technique
won't improve again.

05:27.290 --> 05:30.310
Mahito has grown after battling with you.

05:30.980 --> 05:33.870
Actually, I also wanted Jogo.

05:33.870 --> 05:35.770
But I didn't get it.

05:36.580 --> 05:37.770
What have you done?

05:38.610 --> 05:41.620
I have used Idle Transfiguration
from a distance

05:41.620 --> 05:44.120
on two types of non-sorcerers that
I marked in advance.

05:51.100 --> 05:56.960
TSUMIKI FUSHIGURO

06:10.210 --> 06:14.060
There are people like Yuji Itadori
who swallowed cursed objects.

06:14.870 --> 06:18.730
And those like Junpei Yoshino
who have techniques

06:18.730 --> 06:21.570
but not the brains of sorcerers.

06:21.570 --> 06:25.320
I adjusted both of their brains
to the ones of the sorcerers.

06:26.020 --> 06:28.450
The former gained strength
to become a vessel.

06:28.820 --> 06:32.580
The latter learned how
to utilize the technique.

06:34.110 --> 06:35.320
Then...

06:38.680 --> 06:42.340
I have lifted the seal
on those cursed objects.

06:43.270 --> 06:44.680
When I was marking them,

06:44.680 --> 06:48.500
some people were unconscious
due to my cursed energy.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.310
They should wake up soon.

06:51.890 --> 06:55.920
To make them understand
cursed energy better,

06:55.920 --> 06:57.810
I will make them kill each other.

06:58.460 --> 07:01.360
Those are the children and cursed
objects I have carefully selected.

07:01.830 --> 07:03.610
You can imagine it

07:03.610 --> 07:06.530
as a thousand malicious Yuji Itadoris
have been released.

07:07.370 --> 07:10.240
A thousand?
That's not much.

07:10.800 --> 07:13.160
Moreover, you underestimate
human rationality.

07:13.700 --> 07:15.430
Do you think that with the power granted,

07:15.430 --> 07:17.880
humans will start killing each other?

07:18.450 --> 07:20.820
Order is essential to everything.

07:21.340 --> 07:24.920
How could I possibly have missed
such basic prior preparation?

07:25.650 --> 07:27.890
Your questions are straying
further from the point.

07:31.040 --> 07:33.570
He's pissing me off!
Let's beat him up!

07:33.570 --> 07:36.120
But I can't move now.

07:42.480 --> 07:44.610
What's wrong, Uraume?

07:44.980 --> 07:47.940
I used the reverse cursed technique
to regenerate my body, but...

07:48.380 --> 07:49.240
This is...

07:49.640 --> 07:50.490
Poison?

07:51.390 --> 07:55.250
Piercing Blood contains my blood.
Of course, it's poisonous.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.770
Wait, we don't have Mai's support.

07:58.770 --> 08:01.090
The enemy might have other accomplices.

08:02.720 --> 08:04.530
Aoi, the girl with a gun,

08:04.530 --> 08:08.020
and the girl in the suit are all under
the protection of my companions.

08:08.020 --> 08:09.390
They are not fit to fight now.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.260
Can you still move?

08:11.260 --> 08:15.890
Yeah, I can regulate my body
temperature. It's okay.

08:17.940 --> 08:20.150
I'll pass.

08:20.630 --> 08:22.650
I haven't finished speaking yet.

08:23.410 --> 08:25.480
The cursed objects I gave to those people

08:25.480 --> 08:30.260
are the remnants of the sorcerers I've made
contracts with since a thousand years ago.

08:30.630 --> 08:35.120
But it's not just sorcerers who
have made contracts with me.

08:36.330 --> 08:38.750
Even though those contracts

08:38.750 --> 08:41.790
had already expired
when I obtained this body.

08:43.720 --> 08:44.800
Could it be...

08:45.300 --> 08:49.260
This is the world of the future.

09:40.830 --> 09:43.480
Goodbye, Yuji Itadori.

09:45.840 --> 09:48.250
Mr. Gojo!

09:50.960 --> 09:53.190
I'm looking forward
to your performance.

09:54.310 --> 09:56.760
Are you listening, Sukuna?

09:56.760 --> 09:57.990
It's beginning once again.

09:59.230 --> 10:00.690
The golden age of sorcery.

10:02.360 --> 10:06.200
The Heian period is about to return.

10:25.390 --> 10:28.730
This is the footage taken by a team
at another interview site

10:28.730 --> 10:33.460
when all this happened
in Tokyo a few days ago.

10:33.460 --> 10:35.030
Please take a look at it.

10:37.530 --> 10:40.860
The power outage has lasted
for about ten minutes...

10:40.860 --> 10:44.330
- Seems like something big happened.
- Currently there's a massive power outage.

10:44.330 --> 10:45.920
Isn't this fake news?

10:45.920 --> 10:47.670
- But they've been reporting it all day long.
- Authorities can't be reached.

10:47.670 --> 10:49.620
- But they've been reporting it all day long.
- The cause is still unknown.

10:49.620 --> 10:52.290
- I'll be home late. Defrost something for dinner.
- What exactly happened

10:52.290 --> 10:54.340
- Okay.
- is still unknown.

10:54.710 --> 10:57.340
District 23 is almost all gone.

10:57.340 --> 10:58.980
Including the Chief Cabinet Secretary,

10:58.980 --> 11:01.760
the condition of the entire
Prime Minister's deputies is unknown.

11:01.760 --> 11:05.980
A political vacuum...
Just like it said!

11:06.530 --> 11:08.440
No matter how

11:08.440 --> 11:11.410
a plan to evacuate five million
residents should be formulated.

11:11.410 --> 11:15.010
Love hotels, campsites,
and abandoned villages.

11:15.010 --> 11:16.940
Even the most basic public facilities.

11:16.940 --> 11:19.300
Get anything we can use.

11:19.300 --> 11:22.870
More importantly, how do we
explain it to the residents?

11:22.870 --> 11:25.570
We don't even know the cause.
What should we tell them?

11:26.580 --> 11:29.980
Furthermore, the government has not
made any public statements yet.

11:30.380 --> 11:32.930
Whether it's just a power
substation malfunction,

11:32.930 --> 11:34.400
a terrorist attack,

11:34.400 --> 11:37.160
or some kind of natural disaster
like an earthquake,

11:37.160 --> 11:38.930
- Too many conspiracy have emerged.
- or some kind of natural disaster,

11:38.930 --> 11:40.830
- Stop scrolling on your phone, help me.
- there is still no answer.

11:40.830 --> 11:42.070
- Stop scrolling on your phone, help me.
- We can only hope that it'll be clarified

11:42.070 --> 11:43.810
- I understand.
- as soon as possible.

11:44.180 --> 11:47.580
The only places confirmed to be safe
are the towns and villages of Okutama,

11:47.580 --> 11:50.170
Ome, Akiruno, Hachioji,

11:50.170 --> 11:52.320
part of Machida, and various islands.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.140
Only safe for now, I suppose.

11:54.140 --> 11:57.220
More than ten million
cursed spirits were released.

11:57.220 --> 12:00.670
Should we designate the entire
metropolitan area as an evacuation zone?

12:00.670 --> 12:03.100
Then list it as a prohibited area.

12:03.100 --> 12:04.830
It's simply a hell.

12:05.410 --> 12:07.830
But how do we tell the public?

12:07.830 --> 12:08.920
Who should come forward?

12:08.920 --> 12:09.940
Compared to that,

12:09.940 --> 12:11.960
the issue is how to make the statement.

12:11.960 --> 12:14.330
We still haven't reached
the deputy commissioner?

12:16.150 --> 12:17.620
No.

12:17.620 --> 12:19.840
We can't get in touch
with the secretary either.

12:22.090 --> 12:24.230
What should we do now?

12:24.230 --> 12:25.670
Calm down.

12:25.670 --> 12:27.880
The higher-ups have
their own considerations.

12:27.880 --> 12:31.440
We should just contact
each provincial office.

12:32.200 --> 12:34.600
The yen keeps depreciating.

12:34.600 --> 12:36.990
Isn't that beneficial for exports?

12:37.370 --> 12:39.130
The economic groups are furious.

12:39.130 --> 12:42.080
Once everyone is dead, those lobbying
groups will be meaningless.

12:43.050 --> 12:45.370
Relocate the office to Osaka.

12:45.730 --> 12:48.370
At this rate, tons of cursed
spirits will be everywhere.

12:48.840 --> 12:52.240
But now, most sorcerers are
protecting the people

12:52.240 --> 12:53.590
in the metropolitan area.

12:53.590 --> 12:55.300
With such a large-scale power vacuum,

12:55.300 --> 12:57.610
there could be an intervention
of a foreign military.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.600
Yes.

12:58.600 --> 13:00.380
Eh? Ah, no...

13:00.380 --> 13:01.350
Yes.

13:02.470 --> 13:03.390
I understand.

13:06.140 --> 13:08.580
We need to disclose
the existence of cursed spirits.

13:09.520 --> 13:11.730
We must publicize the existence
of cursed spirits?!

13:11.730 --> 13:13.190
Seriously?

13:13.190 --> 13:17.460
We're supposed to declare that the cursed spirits
will only appear in Tokyo.

13:17.460 --> 13:20.390
To draw the cursed energy
emitted by ordinary people to Tokyo,

13:20.390 --> 13:23.400
so that the cursed spirits
will be limited to Tokyo?

13:23.400 --> 13:26.530
That's why when Kansai International
Airport was completed, I recommended

13:26.530 --> 13:27.960
transferring it to Itami.

13:27.960 --> 13:30.140
Isn't that just right?

13:30.140 --> 13:33.670
If Kasumigaseki was still operating,
we wouldn't make this kind of judgment.

13:36.590 --> 13:39.310
Uh... We'll repeat that for you once more.

13:39.810 --> 13:42.450
The power outage is continuing.

13:42.450 --> 13:44.360
We are still unable to contact various units.

13:44.360 --> 13:46.410
Also, due to the lack
of any public statement,

13:46.410 --> 13:48.180
the cause remains unclear.

13:48.920 --> 13:50.790
ABNORMALITIES IN THE CITY CENTER?
How long will this situation last...

13:50.790 --> 13:58.130
ABNORMALITIES IN THE CITY CENTER?
DAMAGE KEEPS ESCALATING

13:58.130 --> 14:01.950
What? What's going on?

14:01.950 --> 14:04.360
ABNORMALITIES IN THE CITY CENTER?
DAMAGE KEEPS ESCALATING

14:06.110 --> 14:13.830
PLEASE WAIT A MOMENT

14:15.140 --> 14:16.240
What's going on?

14:16.850 --> 14:17.910
Are they making a movie?

14:21.700 --> 14:25.350
The barrier centered on the Imperial Palace
rebuilt during the Meiji era,

14:25.350 --> 14:27.850
and the other barrier centered
above the Tombs of the Star

14:27.850 --> 14:30.850
at the candidate site for capital
at the end of the Edo period.

14:30.850 --> 14:33.770
Expand those two barriers
to the prefectural borders.

15:42.500 --> 15:47.760
Come over...
It's dangerous here.

15:57.430 --> 15:59.820
Take a hot bath.

16:05.180 --> 16:07.650
You can sing too.

16:13.700 --> 16:15.080
What about my mom?

16:17.980 --> 16:20.480
Your mom and dad,

16:20.480 --> 16:24.840
your sister, your brother,
and your teacher are all here.

16:27.710 --> 16:30.040
I don't have a brother.

16:30.040 --> 16:32.050
And I hate teachers.

16:32.050 --> 16:40.440
I don't have a brother,
and I hate teachers.

16:41.980 --> 16:44.300
Are you okay? Want a drink?

16:49.570 --> 16:52.120
Give me...

17:27.240 --> 17:28.070
Sorry.

17:29.830 --> 17:31.150
Did I scare you?

17:34.110 --> 17:35.080
Are you hurt?

17:38.190 --> 17:39.960
Are you with someone?

17:41.520 --> 17:43.630
Where's your father or mother?

17:45.230 --> 17:46.230
I don't know.

17:47.790 --> 17:50.000
All commercial buildings are in this area.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.680
She probably doesn't live around here.

17:53.350 --> 17:54.850
You've walked a long way, right?

17:58.280 --> 18:01.080
I see. It must be hard for you.

18:08.910 --> 18:10.860
So you can see it?

18:12.030 --> 18:14.280
Don't do that, Rika.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.360
It's gone too far.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.040
Sorry, I hesitated at the time.

18:21.930 --> 18:24.650
I thought with this situation,

18:24.650 --> 18:27.880
why not just play
the long game and wait?

18:29.250 --> 18:30.610
Have you noticed?

18:30.610 --> 18:33.590
I'm not really on your side.

18:34.510 --> 18:37.260
I'm just an ordinary beauty,

18:37.260 --> 18:39.260
hoping that the cursed spirits disappear.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.990
Although it doesn't count as an apology,

18:42.990 --> 18:46.170
my friends and I will take responsibility

18:46.170 --> 18:48.480
and send back the children
who were present.

18:50.480 --> 18:51.760
And it's about time

18:52.610 --> 18:54.780
for me to face Tengen.

18:58.950 --> 19:00.230
What are your plans?

19:07.620 --> 19:09.460
Good work, Okkotsu.

19:09.820 --> 19:11.800
You're not sincere anyway.

19:11.800 --> 19:13.800
Let's get to the point.

19:15.070 --> 19:15.960
Now,

19:15.960 --> 19:19.120
you should understand
that I follow your orders.

19:21.240 --> 19:25.420
Killing cursed spirits
doesn't prove anything.

19:26.770 --> 19:29.610
Well, you can set up a
\"binding vow\" or whatever.

19:30.450 --> 19:33.030
It doesn't matter
whether he's Mr. Gojo's student.

19:34.440 --> 19:38.660
He cut off Inumaki's arm in Shibuya.

19:40.240 --> 19:44.330
I will kill Yuji Itadori myself.

19:46.420 --> 19:49.920
