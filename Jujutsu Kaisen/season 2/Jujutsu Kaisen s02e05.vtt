<b>JUJUTSU KAISEN
Hidden Inventory/Premature Death</b>

01:29.980 --> 01:31.980
<b>1 Year Later
August 2007</b>

01:32.970 --> 01:34.820
Here we go.

01:39.680 --> 01:41.450
Yeah, it's working.

01:41.450 --> 01:44.280
Ugh, what the heck was that?

01:44.280 --> 01:46.910
Automatic selection of targets 
for your jujutsu technique?

01:46.910 --> 01:47.910
Yup.

01:47.910 --> 01:51.050
Though, to be precise, 
I'm the target for the technique.

01:51.400 --> 01:54.630
I've automated what I used to do manually.

01:54.630 --> 01:56.420
Now it can discern an object's danger level

01:56.710 --> 02:01.300
based on the strength of its cursed energy, 
its mass, its velocity, and its shape.

02:01.300 --> 02:04.490
I'd like to get it to discern poisons, too,

02:04.490 --> 02:06.470
but that's still proving difficult.

02:06.470 --> 02:09.110
This will allow me to keep 
my Limitless technique active

02:09.110 --> 02:11.610
almost perpetually with minimal resources.

02:11.610 --> 02:14.570
Having it perpetually active 
will fry your brain.

02:14.570 --> 02:17.010
But I can also keep running 
the reverse cursed technique

02:17.010 --> 02:18.660
with the energy I generate on my own.

02:18.660 --> 02:21.200
So I'm constantly giving it 
a fresh brain to work with.

02:21.970 --> 02:24.750
I'd already been working on shortening 
my hand seals. That's nailed now, too.

02:24.750 --> 02:30.000
So I can also activate multiple 
instances of Blue and Red simultaneously.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.420
The only remaining hurdles are

02:31.420 --> 02:34.170
Domain Expansion and 
teleportation over long distances.

02:34.670 --> 02:36.830
I should be able to get 
that down if we set up

02:36.830 --> 02:39.670
some courses without any 
obstacles in Jujutsu High.

02:40.090 --> 02:42.960
Shoko, could you lend me some lab rats?

02:42.960 --> 02:44.230
Uh...

02:44.230 --> 02:46.530
<i>Satoru had become the "strongest."</i>

02:46.530 --> 02:49.200
Suguru, have you lost weight?

02:49.200 --> 02:50.280
You okay?

02:50.640 --> 02:53.640
<i>He handled all of his missions alone,</i>

02:53.640 --> 02:57.270
<i>and Shoko was never sent out on 
dangerous missions in the first place,</i>

02:57.710 --> 03:01.130
<i>which naturally meant I was sent 
on missions alone more often, too.</i>

03:01.530 --> 03:03.330
It's just heat fatigue.

03:03.330 --> 03:04.800
I'll be fine.

03:05.550 --> 03:07.290
Did you eat too much somen?

03:08.780 --> 03:11.230
<i>Things were busy that summer.</i>

03:12.540 --> 03:15.550
<b>Episode 29
Premature Death</b>

03:16.290 --> 03:19.840
<i>Likely spurred by the frequent 
disasters of the past year,</i>

03:20.550 --> 03:22.930
<i>cursed spirits were 
springing up like maggots.</i>

03:24.430 --> 03:26.670
<i>Exorcise, absorb.</i>

03:26.670 --> 03:28.050
<i>Over and over.</i>

03:28.640 --> 03:29.540
<i>Exorcise.</i>

03:29.540 --> 03:30.510
<i>Absorb.</i>

03:31.520 --> 03:34.430
<i>No one else understands 
what cursed spirits taste like.</i>

03:34.870 --> 03:38.270
<i>It's like swallowing a dirty rag that's 
been used to clean up shit and vomit.</i>

03:40.980 --> 03:42.410
<i>Who am I doing this for?</i>

03:46.440 --> 03:47.590
<i>Exorcise.</i>

03:47.590 --> 03:48.410
<i>Absorb.</i>

03:49.390 --> 03:52.760
<i>Ever since that day, 
I've been telling myself,</i>

03:52.760 --> 03:55.510
<i>"What I witnessed isn't uncommon."</i>

03:55.510 --> 03:59.440
<i>"I understood the ugliness of the masses,</i>

03:59.440 --> 04:03.840
<i>"and still chose to be a 
jujutsu sorcerer to save others."</i>

04:13.290 --> 04:14.400
<i>"Don't waver."</i>

04:14.900 --> 04:17.350
<i>"Fulfill your duty as a 
strong jujutsu sorcerer."</i>

04:36.910 --> 04:38.380
Damn monkeys...

04:41.800 --> 04:43.080
Geto-san!

04:44.400 --> 04:45.760
Haibara...

04:46.670 --> 04:48.190
Good work out there!

04:48.630 --> 04:50.010
Want something to drink?

04:50.210 --> 04:52.570
Huh? No, I'd feel bad!

04:52.570 --> 04:53.550
But I'll take a cola!

04:56.510 --> 04:59.650
I'm going pretty far away 
for my mission tomorrow.

04:59.650 --> 05:00.830
That so?

05:00.830 --> 05:02.270
Bring back souvenirs.

05:02.270 --> 05:03.480
Of course!

05:03.480 --> 05:06.520
Do you prefer sweet stuff or salty stuff?

05:07.300 --> 05:11.160
Satoru might eat some, too, so... sweet, I guess?

05:11.380 --> 05:12.750
Got it!

05:16.650 --> 05:17.730
Haibara...

05:18.200 --> 05:21.790
Do you think you can keep going as a 
jujutsu sorcerer? It's not too hard for you?

05:23.280 --> 05:24.630
Well...

05:25.730 --> 05:29.510
I'm not really one to think 
about things too deeply,

05:29.830 --> 05:34.140
so it feels really good to be able to 
give my all to something I can actually do.

05:36.070 --> 05:37.200
I see.

05:38.090 --> 05:39.200
Yeah, it does.

05:43.730 --> 05:45.440
Are you Geto-kun?

05:46.310 --> 05:49.010
What kind of woman is your type?

05:50.520 --> 05:52.000
Who are you?

05:52.780 --> 05:55.180
I like girls who eat a lot!

05:55.180 --> 05:56.160
Oh?

05:56.160 --> 05:57.660
Haibara...

05:57.660 --> 05:59.590
It's okay.

05:59.590 --> 06:01.350
She's not a bad person.

06:01.350 --> 06:03.670
I'm a great judge of character!

06:03.880 --> 06:06.510
You say that while sitting next to me?

06:07.970 --> 06:09.070
Yes!

06:10.880 --> 06:13.490
He was being sarcastic, you know.

06:14.870 --> 06:16.050
Excuse me.

06:17.190 --> 06:18.650
Your underclassman?

06:18.650 --> 06:20.780
He's cute. I like how frank he is.

06:20.780 --> 06:24.090
I think he should be more 
suspicious of people as a sorcerer.

06:24.090 --> 06:27.820
So, are you not going to answer?

06:28.300 --> 06:31.060
Please answer my question first.

06:31.060 --> 06:32.330
Who are you?

06:32.670 --> 06:35.440
Special-grade sorcerer Yuki Tsukumo.

06:35.440 --> 06:37.240
That ring any bells?

06:38.030 --> 06:39.510
You're <i>her</i>?

06:39.510 --> 06:42.080
Oh, I like the sound of that! What do they say?

06:43.200 --> 06:46.190
That you're a special-grade 
who never accepts any missions,

06:46.190 --> 06:49.470
and you're a good-for-nothing 
who's been wandering around abroad.

06:49.470 --> 06:52.570
I hate Jujutsu High.

06:52.510 --> 06:53.470
<b>She's pouting...</b>

06:52.570 --> 06:53.470
<i>She's pouting.</i>

06:53.910 --> 06:55.120
I'm joking.

06:55.120 --> 06:59.250
Though it's true that I don't get along 
with Jujutsu High's policies.

06:59.250 --> 07:02.840
What they're doing is just treating symptoms,

07:02.840 --> 07:05.360
and I want to do something 
to treat the cause.

07:05.750 --> 07:07.570
Treat the cause?

07:07.570 --> 07:09.870
Rather than hunt down cursed spirits,

07:09.870 --> 07:13.030
I want to create a world 
where cursed spirits aren't born.

07:15.790 --> 07:17.660
Care for a little lesson?

07:18.130 --> 07:20.650
What are cursed spirits to begin with?

07:20.650 --> 07:23.480
They're creatures that take 
shape when cursed energy

07:23.480 --> 07:26.790
leaking from humans 
builds up like sediment.

07:26.790 --> 07:28.650
Excellent.

07:28.650 --> 07:33.050
Now this means there are two ways to create 
a world where cursed spirits aren't born.

07:33.050 --> 07:36.990
One: Eliminate cursed energy from mankind.

07:36.990 --> 07:41.060
Two: Make it possible for all of humanity 
to control their cursed energy.

07:41.290 --> 07:44.820
I thought number one had a 
pretty good chance of working.

07:45.210 --> 07:47.050
There was a model case for it, too.

07:47.050 --> 07:48.510
A model case?

07:48.510 --> 07:50.780
Someone you know well.

07:50.780 --> 07:52.400
Toji Zen'in.

07:53.300 --> 07:55.840
I've seen plenty of cases 
where a Heavenly Pact reduced

07:55.840 --> 07:58.760
a person's cursed energy to the 
level of your average person,

07:58.760 --> 08:00.900
but you could search the 
whole world only to find

08:00.900 --> 08:03.550
he was the only case in which 
that cursed energy dropped to zero.

08:04.510 --> 08:07.980
That wasn't the only intriguing 
thing about him, either.

08:08.410 --> 08:11.660
Even though Zen'in Toji 
had zero cursed energy,

08:11.660 --> 08:14.080
he was able to perceive cursed 
spirits with his five senses.

08:14.080 --> 08:16.430
By completely casting aside cursed energy,

08:16.430 --> 08:18.290
his body drew a hard line

08:18.290 --> 08:21.180
and actually gave him 
great resistance to curses.

08:21.410 --> 08:23.280
He truly was superhuman.

08:23.660 --> 08:25.810
You shouldn't be ashamed of losing to him.

08:26.740 --> 08:30.730
I wanted to try studying him, 
but he turned me down.

08:30.730 --> 08:32.690
It was a real shame to lose him.

08:33.190 --> 08:35.660
And there aren't many people 
with Heavenly Pacts,

08:35.660 --> 08:38.350
so I'm currently favoring route number two,

08:38.350 --> 08:42.040
making it possible for all of humanity 
to control their cursed energy.

08:42.880 --> 08:44.040
Did you know?

08:44.520 --> 08:46.990
Cursed spirits aren't born from sorcerers.

08:47.940 --> 08:50.850
Of course, that excludes cases 
where the jujutsu sorcerer

08:50.850 --> 08:52.640
turns themselves into a curse after death.

08:53.250 --> 08:57.790
Compared to non-sorcerers, jujutsu sorcerers 
leak extremely little cursed energy.

08:58.140 --> 09:00.260
There's some variance based 
on the sorcerer's capacity

09:00.260 --> 09:02.560
and the amount of cursed 
energy their technique expends,

09:02.880 --> 09:05.160
but the main reason is their flow.

09:05.160 --> 09:09.520
Jujutsu sorcerers circulate cursed 
energy through their own bodies well.

09:09.520 --> 09:11.450
To put it in rough, general terms,

09:11.450 --> 09:14.050
if all of mankind were jujutsu sorcerers,

09:14.050 --> 09:15.790
curses wouldn't be born.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.290
Then you could solve it simply 
by killing all non-sorcerers.

09:23.320 --> 09:24.740
Geto-kun.

09:25.710 --> 09:27.620
That's possible.

09:27.620 --> 09:29.270
Huh? But...

09:30.510 --> 09:34.300
I mean, that's probably 
the easiest way to achieve it.

09:34.750 --> 09:37.080
Just keep culling non-sorcerers and

09:37.080 --> 09:40.500
force them to adapt into sorcerers 
as a survival strategy.

09:40.500 --> 09:45.550
You would be forcing them to 
evolve using fear and danger,

09:45.550 --> 09:48.310
the same way birds gained wings.

09:48.310 --> 09:52.350
But unfortunately, I'm not 
crazy enough to do that.

09:52.350 --> 09:55.570
Do you hate non-sorcerers, Geto-kun?

09:59.530 --> 10:01.290
I don't know.

10:01.290 --> 10:05.270
I always thought jujutsu sorcery 
existed to protect non-sorcerers.

10:05.270 --> 10:08.060
But lately, the value of non-sorcerers

10:08.060 --> 10:10.610
has been wavering in my mind.

10:11.110 --> 10:13.040
The admirability of the weak...

10:13.040 --> 10:14.960
The ugliness of the weak...

10:14.960 --> 10:18.470
I find myself struggling to discern 
the difference and accept those things.

10:18.930 --> 10:20.800
There's a part of me 
that despises non-sorcerers,

10:20.800 --> 10:22.890
and a part of me that wants to reject that part.

10:22.890 --> 10:25.470
My vision for what lies at 
the end of the marathon game

10:25.470 --> 10:27.890
of being a jujutsu sorcerer is so vague now

10:28.440 --> 10:30.630
that I can't tell which 
represents how I truly feel.

10:31.620 --> 10:33.910
Neither one is how you truly feel.

10:37.520 --> 10:39.650
You're not at that stage yet.

10:39.650 --> 10:42.150
This part of you despising non-sorcerers,

10:42.150 --> 10:44.410
and this part of you rejecting that,

10:44.630 --> 10:47.730
are both just possibilities 
that you're considering.

10:48.160 --> 10:50.400
It's up to you to choose which part

10:50.400 --> 10:53.020
becomes your true 
feelings from here on out.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.060
See you later.

10:58.060 --> 11:01.180
It's a shame I didn't get to 
talk to Gojo-kun, too,

11:01.180 --> 11:03.080
but it looks like I missed him today.

11:03.550 --> 11:06.910
I hope the three of us can all 
get along as fellow special-grades.

11:08.140 --> 11:10.960
I'll pass that along to Satoru.

11:11.530 --> 11:14.200
Oh, right, one last thing.

11:14.200 --> 11:17.090
You don't need to worry 
about the Star Plasma Vessel.

11:17.090 --> 11:20.740
Either there was already another 
Star Plasma Vessel at the time,

11:20.740 --> 11:24.180
or a new Star Plasma Vessel 
has already been born.

11:24.650 --> 11:28.090
Either way, Tengen is stable.

11:32.190 --> 11:33.460
I'm sure.

11:34.480 --> 11:34.860
Oh...

11:34.480 --> 11:37.350
Oh, I didn't get his type.

11:35.770 --> 11:36.610
I didn't get his type.

11:40.110 --> 11:44.850
It was supposed to be an easy mission to 
exterminate a second-grade cursed spirit!

11:49.590 --> 11:50.470
Damn it!

11:55.560 --> 11:57.490
Their faith in Ubusunagami...

11:59.560 --> 12:01.530
That was a local deity.

12:02.260 --> 12:03.950
That was a first-grade case!

12:06.950 --> 12:09.750
You need to rest for now, Nanami.

12:10.110 --> 12:12.200
Satoru has taken up your mission.

12:14.300 --> 12:17.590
Can't we just leave everything 
up to him alone at this point?

12:19.390 --> 12:22.210
<i>This marathon game of being 
a jujutsu sorcerer...</i>

12:24.480 --> 12:26.590
<i>If the only thing waiting at the end</i>

12:28.390 --> 12:31.770
<i>is a mountain of our 
comrades' corpses, then...</i>

12:43.230 --> 12:44.700
What is this?

12:44.700 --> 12:46.390
What, you ask?

12:46.390 --> 12:49.450
These two are responsible 
for the latest incidents, right?

12:52.130 --> 12:53.210
No, they're not.

12:59.920 --> 13:01.880
These two are crazy!

13:02.230 --> 13:05.790
They used their mysterious powers 
to attack the villagers!

13:06.290 --> 13:09.430
I've already exterminated 
the cause of those incidents.

13:09.430 --> 13:12.550
My granddaughter was nearly 
killed by these two, too!

13:12.550 --> 13:13.680
That's because she—

13:13.680 --> 13:15.670
Shut up, you monsters!

13:15.670 --> 13:17.720
Your parents were just as bad!

13:17.720 --> 13:21.110
It... It's okay.

13:17.730 --> 13:21.110
I knew we should have killed you 
two when you were babies!

13:23.560 --> 13:25.820
This part of you despising non-sorcerers,

13:25.820 --> 13:27.440
and this part of you rejecting that..

13:27.870 --> 13:30.160
It's up to you to choose which part...

13:30.750 --> 13:34.620
Everyone, shall we step 
outside for a moment?

13:34.620 --> 13:37.120
...becomes your true 
feelings from here on out.

13:42.510 --> 13:43.910
What?!

13:44.550 --> 13:45.040
Why?!

13:47.550 --> 13:48.900
No!

14:02.860 --> 14:05.190
...112 residents of the village were killed,
after which a fire...
(By the time Jujutsu High investigated
on September 23rd...
Investigations confirmed that all 112 were...
...residuals revealed to be the work of
Suguru Geto's curse manipulation.

14:05.190 --> 14:07.570
Investigations confirmed that all 112 were killed by a cursed spirit,
which the residuals revealed to be the work 
of Suguru Geto's curse manipulation.

14:07.570 --> 14:10.950
<b>...sentenced to death.</b>

14:16.230 --> 14:17.150
Huh?

14:17.960 --> 14:20.080
Don't make me repeat myself.

14:20.080 --> 14:23.100
Suguru killed everyone in the village and—

14:22.160 --> 14:24.010
I heard you the first time.

14:24.010 --> 14:26.380
That's why I said, "Huh?"

14:27.730 --> 14:31.270
Suguru's old home was already 
an empty husk, as well.

14:31.720 --> 14:35.470
Though, from the bloodstains and residuals, he most likely killed his parents, too—

14:35.470 --> 14:36.630
Like hell he did!

14:36.630 --> 14:37.980
Satoru.

14:37.980 --> 14:41.480
I don't understand what's going on, either.

14:50.240 --> 14:51.360
<b>Huh?
A high
schooler?</b>

14:55.240 --> 14:56.890
Need a light?

14:58.830 --> 14:59.780
Hey.

15:00.830 --> 15:02.290
It's the criminal.

15:02.630 --> 15:04.040
Need something?

15:04.040 --> 15:06.340
Just testing my luck, I guess.

15:07.790 --> 15:09.230
I'll go ahead and ask...

15:09.230 --> 15:10.880
Any chance the charges are false?

15:11.080 --> 15:13.350
Nope. Unfortunately not.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.790
I'll ask further, then. Why?

15:17.220 --> 15:19.340
I'm going to create a world 
of only jujutsu sorcerers.

15:20.460 --> 15:22.480
I don't get it.

15:22.480 --> 15:24.320
I'm not a child.

15:24.320 --> 15:27.700
I'm not holding out hope 
that everyone will understand.

15:28.110 --> 15:31.380
Sulking over the idea that 
no one will understand you

15:31.380 --> 15:33.870
sounds pretty childish to me, though.

15:33.870 --> 15:35.480
Hey, Gojo?

15:35.820 --> 15:37.040
I found Geto.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.160
Yeah, Shinjuku.

15:40.320 --> 15:42.620
No way. I don't want to get killed.

15:51.910 --> 15:54.340
Explain yourself, Suguru.

15:58.760 --> 16:00.670
You already heard from Shoko, right?

16:01.000 --> 16:03.310
That's all there is to it.

16:03.310 --> 16:05.810
So you're just going to kill 
everyone who's not a sorcerer?

16:06.560 --> 16:07.820
Even your parents?!

16:07.820 --> 16:10.870
I can't allow my parents 
to be a special exception.

16:10.870 --> 16:14.070
Besides, those people 
aren't my family anymore.

16:14.070 --> 16:15.940
That's not what I was asking!

16:16.300 --> 16:19.120
I thought we weren't allowed to 
kill when there's no point to it!

16:19.820 --> 16:22.270
There is a point to it. Significance, too.

16:22.270 --> 16:23.660
Even a great cause.

16:23.660 --> 16:25.150
There's not!

16:25.150 --> 16:28.730
You're going to kill all non-sorcerers and 
create a world of only jujutsu sorcerers?!

16:28.730 --> 16:30.170
You know that's impossible!

16:30.880 --> 16:32.920
There's no point in chipping away bit by bit

16:32.920 --> 16:34.680
at something you can't possibly do!

16:36.370 --> 16:37.680
How arrogant.

16:38.650 --> 16:39.810
Huh?

16:40.310 --> 16:43.150
You could do it, couldn't you, Satoru?

16:45.910 --> 16:47.980
Yet you would try to convince someone else

16:48.570 --> 16:52.900
that it's impossible to do 
something that's possible for you?

16:56.110 --> 16:59.630
Are you the strongest 
because you're Satoru Gojo?

16:59.630 --> 17:02.190
Or does being the strongest 
make you Satoru Gojo?

17:02.190 --> 17:04.320
What are you trying to say?

17:04.320 --> 17:07.070
If I were able to become you,

17:07.540 --> 17:11.120
this foolish ideal would become a lot 
more grounded and real, don't you think?

17:12.870 --> 17:14.750
I've decided how I'll live my life.

17:14.750 --> 17:17.630
Now it's just a matter of doing 
the best I can to achieve that.

17:27.100 --> 17:28.840
If you want to kill me, then kill me.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.600
There would be a point to that.

17:42.600 --> 17:44.670
Why didn't you pursue him?

17:48.110 --> 17:50.510
You're actually asking me that?

17:52.550 --> 17:54.050
Nah, it's fine.

17:54.370 --> 17:55.630
My bad.

17:59.390 --> 18:02.000
Sensei, I'm strong, right?

18:02.000 --> 18:04.790
Yeah, brazenly so.

18:06.580 --> 18:10.210
But apparently, it's not good enough 
for just me to be strong.

18:10.850 --> 18:12.710
The only ones I can save

18:12.710 --> 18:15.440
are those who are already ready 
to be saved by another.

18:20.270 --> 18:23.070
I thought the Star Religious Group 
was already dissolved.

18:23.070 --> 18:25.900
It's a different group, 
but their roots are the same.

18:25.900 --> 18:28.790
They're claiming they just bought 
the existing space as-is.

18:28.790 --> 18:29.870
Don't like it?

18:29.870 --> 18:33.670
No, it doesn't matter, as long as 
I can gather curses and money.

18:33.840 --> 18:36.470
Are you really going out dressed like that?

18:36.470 --> 18:39.360
Why not? A little showmanship is important.

18:39.750 --> 18:41.370
Geto-sama...

18:41.370 --> 18:42.750
Watch closely.

18:43.200 --> 18:44.430
They're all there, right?

18:44.430 --> 18:47.680
All the branch directors, 
all the representatives, and the president.

18:47.680 --> 18:49.960
All the big donors, as well.

18:53.290 --> 18:58.390
Test, test. Sorry for the wait, everyone.

18:58.390 --> 19:00.270
Now, I'll keep this brief.

19:00.630 --> 19:04.270
From this moment onward, 
this organization belongs to me.

19:04.770 --> 19:06.360
I'll be changing the name, too,

19:06.360 --> 19:09.150
so everyone, please be sure to follow me.

19:09.150 --> 19:11.160
<b>Many Objected</b>

19:11.160 --> 19:13.230
Now, that's not good.

19:13.790 --> 19:15.170
I know!

19:15.170 --> 19:18.150
Sonoda-san, if you wouldn't mind, 
please come to the stage.

19:19.090 --> 19:20.910
Yes! You there!

19:21.590 --> 19:23.580
Now, once again.

19:24.110 --> 19:25.590
<i>I hate monkeys.</i>

19:25.590 --> 19:27.530
You obey me now...

19:27.750 --> 19:30.020
<i>That's the true feeling I chose.</i>

19:30.680 --> 19:32.070
...monkeys.

19:34.620 --> 19:37.520
You're Megumi Fushiguro-kun, right?

19:39.650 --> 19:41.070
Who are you?

19:41.070 --> 19:43.360
And what's with that weird face?

19:44.880 --> 19:47.290
You look just like him, is all.

19:48.650 --> 19:50.190
My own issue.

19:50.560 --> 19:52.470
So listen. About your dad...

19:52.470 --> 19:55.540
He's from this big shot jujutsu 
sorcerer family called the Zen'in,

19:55.540 --> 19:57.710
but they're such scumbags 
they make even me sick,

19:57.710 --> 20:00.790
and that's why your dad left 
the family and had you.

20:00.790 --> 20:03.330
Now, you're one of the 
ones who can see things,

20:03.330 --> 20:04.830
so you're privileged there, right?

20:05.380 --> 20:08.080
You've noticed the power 
within yourself, too, yeah?

20:08.630 --> 20:11.270
The Zen'in clan just loves strong powers.

20:11.270 --> 20:14.470
Most become aware of their cursed 
techniques around 4-6 years old.

20:14.470 --> 20:16.940
So it's the perfect timing to sell a kid off.

20:17.190 --> 20:18.850
So, Megumi-kun,

20:18.850 --> 20:23.190
you were the ultimate card that your dad 
kept on hand against the Zen'in clan.

20:23.190 --> 20:24.890
Pisses you off, doesn't it?

20:24.890 --> 20:28.780
So, about that dad of yours. I ki—

20:27.780 --> 20:28.780
I don't care.

20:29.370 --> 20:32.150
I have no interest in where 
he is or what he's doing.

20:32.150 --> 20:35.040
I haven't even seen him in years, 
so I don't remember what he looks like.

20:35.470 --> 20:37.660
Though I get the general idea 
from what you just said.

20:38.330 --> 20:41.490
Tsumiki's mother hasn't come home 
for a while now, either.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.850
Ah, Megumi's home!

20:44.290 --> 20:46.590
That means they're finished with us,

20:46.590 --> 20:49.090
and they're off enjoying 
themselves elsewhere, right?

20:50.380 --> 20:53.080
Are you really a first grader?

20:53.680 --> 20:54.990
Well, whatever.

20:54.990 --> 20:58.110
If you ever want to know about 
your father, you can ask me.

20:58.110 --> 20:59.920
Hup.

20:59.920 --> 21:02.390
I think it'll be pretty interesting to hear.

21:02.390 --> 21:04.110
Now, on to the main point.

21:04.110 --> 21:05.780
What do you want to do?

21:05.780 --> 21:07.470
Do you want to go to the Zen'in clan?

21:08.390 --> 21:09.950
What will happen to Tsumiki?

21:10.270 --> 21:14.030
If I go there, will Tsumiki be able to 
find happiness? It all depends on that.

21:14.030 --> 21:16.310
No. A hundred percent no.

21:16.310 --> 21:18.130
I can say that with certainty.

21:21.480 --> 21:22.990
Okay!

21:23.840 --> 21:25.750
Leave the rest to me, then.

21:27.610 --> 21:30.870
I might need you to push yourself a bit, though.

21:31.190 --> 21:32.550
So do your best.

21:32.960 --> 21:34.570
Get stronger.

21:35.420 --> 21:37.980
Strong enough to keep up with me.

21:39.380 --> 21:43.300
<b>October 19, 2018</b>

21:44.580 --> 21:46.020
Gojo-sensei.

21:46.020 --> 21:47.980
So even Sensei sleeps, huh?

21:47.980 --> 21:50.490
Of course he does. 
What kind of nonsense is that?

21:50.490 --> 21:51.850
Gojo-sensei!

21:52.900 --> 21:54.430
Oh, he's awake.

21:54.430 --> 21:56.870
Hey, that's one of those 
expensive chairs, isn't it?

21:56.870 --> 21:59.830
Please don't fall asleep 
after summoning all of us here.

22:01.310 --> 22:03.230
Hey, no fair! I get it next, got it?!

22:03.230 --> 22:05.150
Hey! Hurry up!

22:05.150 --> 22:06.460
What are you smiling about?

22:05.150 --> 22:08.340
Don't be mean! Move it!

22:08.340 --> 22:09.330
Nothing.

23:40.940 --> 23:43.750
How do you write "motto" in kanji?

23:43.750 --> 23:46.560
Wait, you use katakana? It's a foreign word?

23:47.020 --> 23:48.730
Next time, "It's Like That."

23:47.400 --> 23:54.990
<b>Next Episode
It's Like That</b>

23:49.770 --> 23:53.430
There's so much I thought I knew, but I don't.
