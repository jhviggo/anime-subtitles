00:29.120 --> 00:30.450
Please!

00:30.450 --> 00:32.040
Please listen to me!

00:32.040 --> 00:33.750
I was wrong!

00:33.750 --> 00:34.750
I'm sorry!

00:34.750 --> 00:35.950
I'm really sorry!

00:36.340 --> 00:37.750
Let's kiss!

00:37.750 --> 00:38.130
Huh?!

00:38.130 --> 00:41.170
Let's kiss!

00:41.720 --> 00:43.680
I'll pull out of this job!

00:43.680 --> 00:45.340
I'll quit being a curse user, too!

00:45.340 --> 00:46.650
Let's kiss!

00:47.010 --> 00:49.100
C'mon, kiss!

00:49.100 --> 00:51.310
Of course I'll quit Q, too!

00:51.310 --> 00:54.310
I know! I'll go back to the
countryside and farm rice!

00:56.270 --> 00:57.730
I know you can hear me!

00:58.520 --> 01:01.280
Like a curse user could cut it as a farmer.

01:01.280 --> 01:02.950
You <i>can</i> hear me!

01:02.950 --> 01:05.280
Damn student acting all condescending!

01:05.280 --> 01:05.530
Lick, lick.
Damn student acting all condescending!

01:05.530 --> 01:07.870
But Bayer-san is here, too!
Lick, lick.

01:07.870 --> 01:09.030
He's Q's strongest combatant!
Lick, lick.

01:09.030 --> 01:10.200
He's Q's strongest combatant!

01:11.040 --> 01:13.000
He'll take care of you and these things!

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Hey.

01:14.620 --> 01:16.500
Is this your "Bayer"?

01:16.710 --> 01:17.500
Huh?

01:21.170 --> 01:23.170
That's him.

01:24.630 --> 01:28.010
Departure of Top Combatant, Bayer,
Leads to Organization's Collapse
<b>"Q"</b>

01:33.350 --> 01:35.980
And all the boats are off at once.

01:35.980 --> 01:39.230
From the inside, we have Numbers
1, 2, 4, 5, 3, and 6 starting the race.

01:39.230 --> 01:41.980
They're off with a beautiful straight shot.

01:42.940 --> 01:46.490
And just what are you doing after
suddenly disappearing on me?

01:49.200 --> 01:51.290
Getting more money.

01:51.950 --> 01:54.870
I've never seen you win once.

01:55.210 --> 01:56.870
What about your job?

01:57.580 --> 01:59.290
Oh, give it a rest.

01:59.290 --> 02:01.920
You're talking like I'm unemployed.

02:03.710 --> 02:05.210
Because you are.

02:05.600 --> 02:10.600
As a mediator, it's my duty to report
how the job's going to the client.

02:10.600 --> 02:12.970
I'm up against the Gojo clan's kid.

02:12.970 --> 02:16.390
I wouldn't be able to do anything
if I just popped up in front of him.

02:16.730 --> 02:19.860
I have to wear him down
using some idiots first.

02:20.210 --> 02:21.940
You go do your own damn job.

02:21.940 --> 02:23.730
Already did, dumbass.

02:23.730 --> 02:27.750
What were you thinking,
letting go of the entire deposit?

02:28.450 --> 02:30.530
I told you, wearing him down.

02:30.530 --> 02:33.240
Don't you worry. All that
money will come back to me.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.200
Just like with this race.

02:37.040 --> 02:39.290
Number 6, Hateno, crosses the line first!

02:39.290 --> 02:41.500
Number 1, Doguchi, finishes next!

02:41.500 --> 02:43.670
Following them in third is Number 2, Matsuda.

02:43.670 --> 02:44.210
In fourth is Number 4, Nakaoka.

02:44.210 --> 02:45.300
Tsk.
In fourth is Number 4, Nakaoka.

02:45.300 --> 02:45.460
In fourth is Number 4, Nakaoka.

02:45.460 --> 02:47.300
You're not cut out for making easy money.
In fifth is Number 3, Tanaka.

02:47.300 --> 02:48.720
In sixth is Number 5,
Okazaki, finishing last!
You're not cut out for making easy money.

02:48.720 --> 02:49.510
In sixth is Number 5,
Okazaki, finishing last!

02:49.510 --> 02:49.680
Number 6, Hateno, has given us an amazing
comeback to watch in his first race!

02:49.680 --> 02:52.720
I'm counting on you, Sorcerer Killer.
Number 6, Hateno, has given us an amazing
comeback to watch in his first race!

02:52.720 --> 02:53.930
Number 6, Hateno, has given us an amazing
comeback to watch in his first race!

02:53.930 --> 02:54.010
That was our third race of the day.

02:54.010 --> 02:55.430
Oh, right.
That was our third race of the day.

02:56.100 --> 02:57.560
How's Megumi doing?

03:09.410 --> 03:10.570
Who's that?

03:11.160 --> 03:14.160
Episode 26
Hidden Inventory 2

03:23.290 --> 03:28.300
JUJUTSU KAISEN
Hidden Inventory/Premature Death

04:45.080 --> 04:47.130
Should we get her to a doctor?

04:47.440 --> 04:51.590
I wish I could use reverse
cursed energy like Shoko.

04:51.590 --> 04:53.090
Yeah, that's impossible.

04:53.090 --> 04:55.840
I can't understand a word she says about it.

04:56.120 --> 04:58.390
You go "fwoo," then "hyoi."

04:58.390 --> 05:01.430
Fwoo, hyoi. Get it?

05:01.430 --> 05:03.140
You've got no sense for this.

05:07.940 --> 05:09.150
You're awake.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.240
You scum!

05:19.240 --> 05:22.500
If you want to kill me,
you'll be the one to die first!

05:24.960 --> 05:26.920
Riko-chan, calm down.

05:26.920 --> 05:30.440
We're not with the group that attacked you.

05:30.440 --> 05:31.670
Liar!

05:31.670 --> 05:33.090
You have the face of a liar!

05:33.090 --> 05:34.800
Your bangs are weird, too!

05:41.390 --> 05:42.560
<b>Grind</b>

05:42.560 --> 05:42.980
This is disrespectful!
<b>Grind</b>

05:42.980 --> 05:44.390
<b>This is disrespectful!
This is disrespectful!
Grind</b>

05:44.390 --> 05:44.770
P-Please stop it!
<b>This is disrespectful!
This is disrespectful!
Grind</b>

05:44.770 --> 05:45.940
This is disrespectful!
<b>Grind
P-Please stop it!</b>

05:45.940 --> 05:46.140
Kuroi!
<b>Grind</b>

05:46.140 --> 05:47.150
Kuroi!

05:49.310 --> 05:52.480
Young lady, these men are our allies.

05:53.360 --> 05:56.570
Kuroi, what are you riding on?

05:56.950 --> 05:59.700
This is thanks to Bangs Guy's technique.

05:59.700 --> 06:01.950
Could you please not call me that?

06:03.000 --> 06:04.750
It's Curse Manipulation.

06:04.750 --> 06:08.210
As the name suggests, I can absorb
and manipulate cursed spirits.

06:08.540 --> 06:11.460
This brat is more aggressive
than I expected.

06:11.460 --> 06:13.960
I was trying to figure out
how to be considerate,

06:13.960 --> 06:16.550
thinking she'd be more sentimental
about the assimilation thing.

06:16.930 --> 06:17.880
Hmph!

06:17.880 --> 06:20.680
A commoner's way of thinking!

06:20.680 --> 06:21.510
Huh?!

06:21.510 --> 06:22.300
Listen up!

06:24.640 --> 06:29.020
Tengen-sama is me, and I am Tengen-sama!

06:29.020 --> 06:32.820
Some might mistake
assimilation for death, as you do,

06:32.820 --> 06:35.480
but there's a big difference!

06:35.740 --> 06:38.780
I might become Tengen-sama
through the assimilation,

06:38.780 --> 06:41.360
but Tengen-sama will also become me!

06:41.640 --> 06:43.740
My will! My heart!

06:43.740 --> 06:46.100
My soul will continue to live
on after the assimilation!

06:46.100 --> 06:47.250
You changed your home screen?

06:47.250 --> 06:48.540
To Inoue Waka.

06:48.540 --> 06:49.710
Listen to me!

06:50.210 --> 06:53.340
I bet you don't have many
friends if you talk like that.

06:53.340 --> 06:55.340
We won't have to feel bad sending you off.

06:55.340 --> 06:57.590
I talk normally at school!

07:00.260 --> 07:01.140
School!

07:01.140 --> 07:02.600
Kuroi, what time is it?!

07:02.600 --> 07:05.720
It's not yet noon. But I think going to school—

07:05.720 --> 07:06.560
Be quiet!

07:06.560 --> 07:08.350
I said I'm going, and I'm going!

07:10.560 --> 07:11.810
Huh?!

07:12.630 --> 07:15.700
Surely it'd be safer to head
back to Jujutsu High at once!

07:16.030 --> 07:20.780
As much as I want to do that,
this is an order from Tengen-sama.

07:21.110 --> 07:24.620
He said to fulfill all of
Amanai Riko's demands.

07:26.040 --> 07:27.160
Tsk.

07:30.670 --> 07:32.830
Lax upbringing at its finest.

07:33.360 --> 07:35.050
Don't be like that, Satoru.

07:35.050 --> 07:36.380
Despite what she may say,

07:36.380 --> 07:38.670
after the assimilation, she'll spend
her whole life as Tengen-sama

07:38.670 --> 07:41.180
in the deepest floor of Jujutsu High,
as the foundation of all barriers.

07:41.720 --> 07:46.770
She won't be able to see her friends,
family, or anyone precious to her ever again.

07:47.890 --> 07:49.270
Riko!

07:50.600 --> 07:52.120
Our next class is in a different room.

07:52.120 --> 07:52.680
Okay!

07:53.060 --> 07:54.520
Let her do what she wants.

07:55.230 --> 07:57.990
That's part of our mission.

08:00.870 --> 08:03.490
Riko-sama has no family.

08:03.490 --> 08:05.470
They were in an accident when she was little.

08:05.470 --> 08:08.290
I've taken care of her ever since then.

08:08.950 --> 08:12.340
So I want her to at least have
what time she can with her friends.

08:13.460 --> 08:16.000
So you're her family, then.

08:18.590 --> 08:19.500
Yes.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.010
Suguru.

08:24.010 --> 08:25.930
How're the cursed spirits you
sent to watch over her?

08:27.100 --> 08:30.980
I just wish I could share my senses
with them like Mei-san does.

08:30.980 --> 08:33.850
Even so, they'll let us know as
soon as anything unusual happens.

08:34.940 --> 08:36.110
Satoru.

08:36.110 --> 08:38.070
Hurry to Riko-chan's side.

08:38.070 --> 08:38.980
Huh?

08:40.600 --> 08:42.520
Two have been exorcised.

08:43.020 --> 08:45.320
Who will be the ace of the next generation?

08:45.320 --> 08:47.990
This will be an important match
to help us find out.

08:48.580 --> 08:51.540
Number 6's final position
is finally starting to solidify.

08:51.540 --> 08:55.080
Now, the fifth race, the one all eyes
are focused on, is about to begin.

09:00.550 --> 09:02.050
<b>Amanai Riko
Renchoku Girls' Academy
#DEAD OR ALIVE</b>

09:06.550 --> 09:10.020
<b>Renchoku Girls' Academy
Middle School Second-year
DEAD OR ALIVE
Time Remaining</b>

09:15.350 --> 09:17.150
JUJUTSU KAISEN

09:17.770 --> 09:19.190
Where's Amanai?!

09:19.190 --> 09:21.230
She has music this period,

09:21.230 --> 09:23.320
so either the music room or the chapel.

09:23.320 --> 09:24.950
Chapel?!

09:24.950 --> 09:27.370
It changes depending on what
the music teacher wants.

09:27.370 --> 09:29.240
Also, this is a missionary school.

09:29.580 --> 09:31.160
Satoru, you take the chapel.

09:31.160 --> 09:32.790
Kuroi-san, take the music room.

09:32.790 --> 09:34.660
I'll take the two unknowns.

09:34.660 --> 09:36.200
Roger that.

09:36.670 --> 09:38.130
I told you not to follow me!

09:38.130 --> 09:40.670
What if my friends see you?!

09:40.670 --> 09:42.300
I'm sorry.

09:42.300 --> 09:45.130
I even told her to text us
when she was on the move.

09:45.130 --> 09:49.220
This is why I told that brat to stay within
eyeshot so we could protect her!

09:52.220 --> 09:53.350
And they're off.

09:53.350 --> 09:55.810
Numbers 1 and 2 make a good start,
favoring the inside.

09:55.810 --> 09:56.390
Number 3 trails a bit behind.

09:56.390 --> 09:57.900
What?
Number 3 trails a bit behind.

09:57.900 --> 09:57.980
Taking the lead at the first mark of
the first lap is Number 2, Yamazaki.
What?

09:57.980 --> 09:58.270
Taking the lead at the first mark of
the first lap is Number 2, Yamazaki.

09:58.270 --> 10:00.440
They didn't go back to Jujutsu High?
Taking the lead at the first mark of
the first lap is Number 2, Yamazaki.

10:00.440 --> 10:01.270
Lucky me.
Taking the lead at the first mark of
the first lap is Number 2, Yamazaki.

10:01.270 --> 10:01.980
Behind him is Number 1, Masaki.
Lucky me.

10:01.980 --> 10:02.710
Behind him is Number 1, Masaki.

10:02.710 --> 10:02.960
They're followed by Number 3, Kawano.

10:02.960 --> 10:04.900
Now the ones drawn to the bounty will
be reasonable fools instead of just fools.
They're followed by Number 3, Kawano.

10:04.900 --> 10:07.030
Then comes Number 4, Nomiya, Number 5,
Mifune, and in last is Number 6, Funegi.
Now the ones drawn to the bounty will
be reasonable fools instead of just fools.

10:07.030 --> 10:08.370
Are you sure?
Then comes Number 4, Nomiya, Number 5,
Mifune, and in last is Number 6, Funegi.

10:08.370 --> 10:09.700
About what?
Then comes Number 4, Nomiya, Number 5,
Mifune, and in last is Number 6, Funegi.

10:10.030 --> 10:14.560
The bounty is the thirty-million deposit
that the Star Religious Group paid you.

10:14.960 --> 10:18.080
If they kill the Star Plasma Vessel,
the deposit is gone,

10:18.080 --> 10:20.840
and worst-case, you might not
get the full reward, either.

10:20.840 --> 10:23.550
They might start saying
they could have posted

10:23.550 --> 10:26.050
a bounty from the start
instead of hiring you.

10:26.050 --> 10:29.030
Gojo Satoru is with the girl.

10:29.030 --> 10:31.390
He's the first in several
centuries to possess both

10:31.390 --> 10:33.470
the Six Eyes and the Limitless technique.

10:33.470 --> 10:37.640
No one can kill the Star Plasma
Vessel as long as he's nearby.

10:37.640 --> 10:39.160
Not even you?

10:47.950 --> 10:50.090
Number 3, Kawano,
is making a rushing comeback!

10:50.090 --> 10:51.950
He's pulled into first place!

10:51.950 --> 10:54.560
Who knows?

10:54.790 --> 10:56.120
He's managed to take the lead twice now.

10:56.120 --> 10:57.330
For now, we'll leave the bounty
up for another 47 hours,
He's managed to take the lead twice now.

10:57.330 --> 11:00.750
This race has been
filled with ups and downs.
For now, we'll leave the bounty
up for another 47 hours,

11:00.750 --> 11:01.080
Can Number 3, Kawano,
defend his position at the top?

11:01.080 --> 11:02.840
and let the fools wear down Gojo
and the sorcerers with him.
Can Number 3, Kawano,
defend his position at the top?

11:02.840 --> 11:05.010
The race is now entering its third lap.
and let the fools wear down Gojo
and the sorcerers with him.

11:05.010 --> 11:05.510
and let the fools wear down Gojo
and the sorcerers with him.

11:14.010 --> 11:15.100
Hey!

11:15.470 --> 11:16.770
Hold it right there!

11:23.110 --> 11:24.740
Nah, never mind.

11:27.990 --> 11:30.280
They won't be able to kill the
Star Plasma Vessel, of course,

11:30.280 --> 11:31.780
so they're working for free.

11:32.280 --> 11:35.200
It's a good thing you put
that time limit on it.

11:35.200 --> 11:38.000
The curse users are
quickly flocking to them.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.960
That's not the only reason.

11:39.960 --> 11:40.580
Eh?

11:41.920 --> 11:43.250
Just talking to myself.

11:43.250 --> 11:44.460
What?!

11:45.250 --> 11:48.930
Number 3, Kawano, just lost his balance,
and Number 2, Yamazaki, is passing him!

11:49.170 --> 11:49.220
Number 3 has drifted far to the outside,

11:49.220 --> 11:51.130
I'll head out soon enough.
Number 3 has drifted far to the outside,

11:51.130 --> 11:53.350
but he's righted his boat
and is chasing after them!
Looks like things are developing
faster than I expected.

11:53.350 --> 11:53.510
but he's righted his boat
and is chasing after them!

11:53.510 --> 11:53.850
But there is now a considerable
gap between them!

11:53.850 --> 11:55.510
Make sure you get that
thirty million back for me.
But there is now a considerable
gap between them!

11:55.510 --> 11:56.810
Make sure you get that
thirty million back for me.

11:56.810 --> 11:59.020
Number 2, Yamazaki, crosses the goal first!

11:59.020 --> 11:59.390
Number 5, Mifune, crosses next.

11:59.390 --> 12:00.730
Don't be ridiculous.
Number 5, Mifune, crosses next.

12:00.730 --> 12:03.270
Number 1, Masaki, crosses next, followed by Number 3, Kawano.
This wasn't your average
anonymous message board.

12:03.270 --> 12:04.310
There are posting fees, handling fees, and—
Following them is Number 4, Nomiya, and last is Number 6, Funegi.

12:04.310 --> 12:05.950
Signal's dropping.
There are posting fees, handling fees, and—
Following them is Number 4, Nomiya, and last is Number 6, Funegi.

12:06.270 --> 12:07.400
Hey!

12:08.690 --> 12:10.360
That bastard.

12:20.360 --> 12:22.590
Are the unknowns remnants of Q?

12:22.950 --> 12:26.500
This will be a little troublesome if they've
been sent by the Star Religious Group.

12:29.140 --> 12:31.630
That uniform...

12:36.720 --> 12:40.180
As soon as he saw the Jujutsu High
uniform, he anticipated a fight against

12:40.180 --> 12:42.770
multiple opponents and set
shikigami in front of and behind him.

12:42.770 --> 12:44.230
He's experienced.

12:45.860 --> 12:47.520
No catalyst?!

12:47.520 --> 12:49.940
Their cursed energy is different
from the sorcerer's, too.

12:49.940 --> 12:51.280
It couldn't be...

12:51.280 --> 12:53.030
Curse Manipulation?!

12:53.390 --> 12:54.610
Correct.

12:54.610 --> 12:57.410
Living a long life has its perks, I see.

12:57.410 --> 13:00.580
Nah, it's not worth
living too long, you know.

13:00.580 --> 13:03.870
It costs money just to stay alive.

13:03.870 --> 13:06.630
His cursed technique is stronger than mine.

13:06.630 --> 13:10.090
However, he thinks like
a typical shikigami user.

13:10.090 --> 13:12.380
Add his youth on top of that,

13:12.380 --> 13:15.840
and I can tell exactly what he's thinking.

13:15.840 --> 13:17.600
I knew it.

13:17.600 --> 13:20.390
Types like him never
step forward themselves.

13:20.640 --> 13:23.270
Close combat is his weakness!

13:23.270 --> 13:28.820
Plus, he thinks a shikigami user
like me would never get close to him.

13:28.820 --> 13:32.400
He's someone who hates close
combat, and he isn't wary of it.

13:32.400 --> 13:35.280
No one is easier to kill.

13:35.610 --> 13:38.740
Looks like you're thinking up lots of plans,

13:38.990 --> 13:40.330
but there's no point.

13:45.670 --> 13:46.170
What?!

13:46.170 --> 13:48.920
Those first two were to prevent
me from anticipating this?!

13:53.720 --> 13:56.430
Now, that leaves one more.

14:00.430 --> 14:02.060
You're mine!

14:18.300 --> 14:21.790
Tasuke? Is that you, Tasuke?

14:22.520 --> 14:26.960
My parents used all their time and money
on my well-behaved little brother.

14:26.960 --> 14:30.670
They thought I was creepy
because I could see the unseen.

14:31.210 --> 14:36.300
But Tasuke was my one and only friend,
who interacted with me without such fear.

14:38.470 --> 14:40.640
It's been a long time.

14:40.640 --> 14:43.520
Has it been over 50 years already?

14:43.520 --> 14:46.310
Since the day you died—

14:47.020 --> 14:48.600
I see now!

14:54.320 --> 14:56.240
My life flashed before my eyes!

14:56.650 --> 14:58.910
You lured me in!

14:58.910 --> 15:00.160
Well, yeah.

15:00.160 --> 15:03.430
You were itching to get in
close that whole time, right?

15:03.430 --> 15:05.370
Those with a set means of victory

15:05.370 --> 15:08.410
will easily jump on the chance
when you give them that opening.

15:10.170 --> 15:13.400
More importantly, are you with Q?

15:13.400 --> 15:14.880
Or the Star Religious Group?

15:38.320 --> 15:39.530
Amanai!

15:45.120 --> 15:47.700
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wha...

15:47.700 --> 15:49.290
What?!

15:49.290 --> 15:51.040
Riko, you have a boyfriend?!

15:51.040 --> 15:53.920
No! He's a cousin! Just a cousin!

15:53.920 --> 15:55.550
You're a smooth operator.

15:55.550 --> 15:57.380
I told you, he's not!

15:57.380 --> 15:59.720
A high schooler?! He's so tall!

15:59.720 --> 16:01.220
Hey, mister!

16:01.220 --> 16:02.720
Take off your sunglasses!

16:05.430 --> 16:05.600
Squee! He's so hot!

16:05.600 --> 16:07.240
<b>Squee!
Squee! He's so hot!</b>

16:07.240 --> 16:07.770
Such long lashes!

16:07.770 --> 16:08.640
Hey.
Such long lashes!

16:08.640 --> 16:10.270
Why are your eyes blue?

16:10.270 --> 16:12.480
Could you pose for me?

16:13.020 --> 16:14.940
Hey! Quit getting carried away!

16:14.940 --> 16:17.150
All right, everyone! Quiet down!

16:17.150 --> 16:18.900
This is disgraceful!

16:18.900 --> 16:21.280
You know you're curious
about him, too, Sensei!

16:21.280 --> 16:22.610
Yeah.

16:22.960 --> 16:24.410
This is inappropriate.

16:24.410 --> 16:26.700
Even if you are a relative,
you can't just barge in.

16:26.700 --> 16:30.660
Oh, you'll have to forgive me.
It was an emergency.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.830
Also, here. My phone number.

16:34.830 --> 16:35.440
Hey! That's against the rules!

16:35.440 --> 16:36.190
<b>GRAAAH
Hey! That's against the rules!</b>

16:36.190 --> 16:37.090
Hey! That's against the rules!

16:37.090 --> 16:39.890
Shut up! You don't get many chances
to meet people as a teacher!

16:39.890 --> 16:42.090
The same is true for us, too!

16:42.090 --> 16:44.510
I can't believe you're into younger men!
I've lost respect for you!

16:44.510 --> 16:47.060
What?! You dissin' Hikaru Genji?!

16:47.060 --> 16:48.990
What a lively school.

16:48.990 --> 16:52.280
You idiot! I told you not to show
yourself before my friends!

16:52.940 --> 16:55.730
Curse users attacked. Figure out the rest.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.400
I'm floating?!

17:03.770 --> 17:05.460
We're heading to Jujutsu High now.

17:05.900 --> 17:08.230
You don't want you friends to
get caught up in this, do you?

17:10.540 --> 17:12.540
Is that the thirty million?

17:12.540 --> 17:14.500
The one with her is another sorcerer?

17:14.500 --> 17:16.310
Her bodyguard, too, I bet.

17:16.640 --> 17:18.170
What a sweet deal.

17:18.170 --> 17:21.010
Thirty million for killing a kid
who's not even a sorcerer.

17:21.010 --> 17:22.800
Maybe I'll have eel tonight?

17:22.800 --> 17:25.010
Food always tastes best
after killing someone.

17:25.010 --> 17:27.470
Are you from the Star Religious Group?

17:27.850 --> 17:32.120
The people in Q wore even weirder outfits.

17:32.350 --> 17:33.850
Are you a rookie?

17:33.850 --> 17:35.980
If you're killing someone, do it without talking.

17:40.150 --> 17:41.320
Too slow.

17:54.730 --> 17:56.920
Don't you dare take anything from that girl.

17:57.650 --> 17:59.130
I'll kill you.

18:04.260 --> 18:05.430
What's this?

18:06.340 --> 18:08.010
Well, aren't you strong?

18:09.270 --> 18:10.430
Where's Riko-chan?

18:11.220 --> 18:13.810
She left the school with Gojo-sama.

18:13.810 --> 18:16.480
Then we should head that way, too.

18:16.480 --> 18:18.890
This has gotten a bit troublesome.

18:20.150 --> 18:22.940
So that really was the thirty million earlier.

18:25.950 --> 18:27.360
A shikigami?!

18:27.360 --> 18:29.820
No, it's not quite the same as a shikigami.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.240
Satoru.

18:31.620 --> 18:34.450
There's a bounty of thirty
million on Amanai's head?

18:34.450 --> 18:38.420
Yeah. It was posted on an
underground site for curse users.

18:38.420 --> 18:41.130
Apparently, the time limit is
11 AM the day after tomorrow.

18:41.630 --> 18:43.130
Now things make sense.

18:44.100 --> 18:47.880
Two, three, four... They all look the same.

18:47.880 --> 18:49.180
Are they shikigami?

18:49.530 --> 18:53.850
Jeez... And jujutsu sorcerers are
short-handed all year round.

18:53.850 --> 18:56.870
If you want to change jobs,
we'll welcome you, old man.

18:56.870 --> 19:00.190
Nah, public employment
ain't easy work, either.

19:00.190 --> 19:02.820
Just hand over that brat and we'll be fine.

19:02.820 --> 19:04.370
There's more! Five of them now!

19:04.370 --> 19:07.650
What's so great about this brat?

19:16.660 --> 19:18.390
What did you just do?

19:18.650 --> 19:20.210
The shikigami isn't disappearing!

19:20.210 --> 19:21.920
Which is the real one?!

19:21.920 --> 19:23.190
They're not shikigami.

19:23.190 --> 19:24.500
They're clones.

19:24.500 --> 19:26.760
And each one is the real one.

19:31.430 --> 19:32.970
The hell is this?!

19:32.970 --> 19:33.890
Infinity.

19:33.890 --> 19:35.600
It's Achilles and the Tortoise.

19:35.600 --> 19:36.430
Huh?!

19:36.430 --> 19:38.940
It's important to study, you know.

19:41.020 --> 19:44.440
Yours is a cloning technique that allows
a maximum of five, including the original.

19:44.440 --> 19:48.320
And you're always free to decide which
of the clones is the main body, right?

19:48.320 --> 19:50.530
So if your main body is in danger,

19:50.530 --> 19:52.990
you make a safe clone the main body.

19:52.990 --> 19:54.950
That's a nice technique you have there.

19:54.950 --> 19:57.870
I don't understand why you're so weak.

19:58.830 --> 20:02.350
Are you unable to produce a clone
for a while after it's destroyed?

20:02.350 --> 20:04.840
How do you know what my technique is?

20:04.840 --> 20:06.420
Unfortunately for you,

20:06.420 --> 20:08.170
I have good eyes.

20:08.820 --> 20:10.840
You see, my technique

20:10.840 --> 20:13.930
is like a convergent
series of infinite numbers.

20:13.930 --> 20:16.790
Anything that approaches me
grows slower and slower,

20:16.790 --> 20:19.770
and ultimately, it fails to ever reach me.

20:20.300 --> 20:22.810
When I amplify my Limitless technique,

20:22.810 --> 20:25.570
I get what you might call
a negative natural number.

20:25.570 --> 20:29.150
It basically creates a
single imaginary apple.

20:29.780 --> 20:32.780
Doing so causes everything around to
get sucked into that space, like you saw.

20:33.070 --> 20:34.780
Though it's surprisingly inconvenient.

20:35.030 --> 20:38.950
I can't create too large
a reaction near myself,

20:38.950 --> 20:41.250
and if I start worrying
about the vectors, too,

20:41.250 --> 20:44.210
controlling the cursed
energy becomes a real pain.

20:44.670 --> 20:47.180
Basically, it's super exhausting.

20:50.420 --> 20:54.430
But that's all just the proper
operation of the technique.

20:56.220 --> 20:58.100
Protect your head.

21:14.860 --> 21:17.160
This next one is the divergence of infinity.

21:19.450 --> 21:21.260
My reverse cursed technique,

21:22.870 --> 21:23.750
Red!

21:39.060 --> 21:40.560
I failed!

21:50.480 --> 21:53.440
I really thought I could do it that time.

21:54.280 --> 21:56.450
Is this guy for real?

21:59.370 --> 22:00.790
It's from Kuroi.

22:03.120 --> 22:04.620
Wh-What do we do?!

22:04.620 --> 22:05.710
Kuroi has...

22:06.380 --> 22:07.630
Kuroi has been...

23:40.680 --> 23:42.850
I've always thought the voices
of young people should be heard,

23:42.850 --> 23:44.940
so I've voted in every election,

23:44.940 --> 23:48.350
but now I'm debating how long it's actually
okay to consider myself a young person.
