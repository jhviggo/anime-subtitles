TOKYO WAKAMONO HELLOWORK
SHIBUYA POLICE STATION

00:35.000 --> 00:37.458
There are so many of them.

00:37.458 --> 00:39.208
I can't just watch it happen.

00:39.208 --> 00:41.542
But I don't have time to save everyone.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.500
Damn. What should I do...

00:43.500 --> 00:47.042
The station...
Mr. Gojo is right there before me.

00:47.042 --> 00:48.333
Spiced cod roe.

00:48.333 --> 00:49.750
That word...

00:50.958 --> 00:52.292
Senior Inumaki!

00:52.292 --> 00:52.917
Salmon.

00:52.917 --> 00:53.792
I'll leave it to you!

00:53.792 --> 00:55.167
Salmon, salmon.

01:03.958 --> 01:06.958
(Episode 37: Red Scale)
Don't move.

01:17.542 --> 01:21.708
(JUJUTSU KAISEN Shibuya Incident)

02:40.000 --> 02:42.542
10:10 P.M., INSIDE SHIBUYA STATION

02:49.542 --> 02:53.042
For safety reasons, please do
not rush inside the station.

03:30.833 --> 03:32.708
Yuji Itadori.

03:32.708 --> 03:34.375
I will avenge my brothers.

03:37.833 --> 03:38.875
CONVERGENCE
Convergence.

03:40.458 --> 03:43.375
Blood Manipulation Convergence.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.625
This technique compresses
the blood to the maximum.

03:50.542 --> 03:55.167
The compressed blood will
concentrate at one point and be launched.

03:55.167 --> 03:57.167
The blood enhanced by Cursed Energy

03:57.167 --> 04:01.667
will reach a projection speed
that exceeds the speed of sound.

04:02.583 --> 04:05.208
Blood Manipulation...

04:05.208 --> 04:06.625
Its name is...

04:08.167 --> 04:09.625
PIERCING BLOOD
Piercing blood.

04:23.458 --> 04:27.000
A double impact.
What a wonderful technique.

04:42.875 --> 04:47.375
I have a question.

04:47.958 --> 04:52.000
Did my brothers leave any final words?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.125
Your brothers...

04:53.125 --> 04:54.167
My goodness.

04:54.167 --> 04:57.417
The two men that you killed.

04:59.833 --> 05:02.292
No, they didn't say anything specific.

05:03.333 --> 05:04.500
But...

05:06.875 --> 05:08.792
He cried.

05:11.958 --> 05:14.583
Eso, Kechizu.

05:17.917 --> 05:19.667
Just watch.

05:19.667 --> 05:22.042
This is your

05:23.250 --> 05:25.000
elder brother!

06:43.042 --> 06:44.708
Damn it.

06:45.750 --> 06:48.708
He's widened the gap again.

06:48.708 --> 06:51.000
His blood beam is too fast.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.792
I only have a 50 percent
chance of avoiding it.

06:52.792 --> 06:56.167
If I make the wrong guess
and get hit in the head,

06:56.167 --> 06:57.875
I will die.

07:00.083 --> 07:02.167
At least, I need to control

07:08.042 --> 07:12.292
the timing of launching.

07:12.292 --> 07:15.667
Is he luring me to attack? I am all in.

07:35.667 --> 07:37.292
That's right.

07:37.292 --> 07:39.792
This technique is only fast
at the first moment.

07:39.792 --> 07:42.000
Once I dodge it, I can approach him.

07:43.667 --> 07:44.625
Supernova.

07:44.625 --> 07:45.208
SUPERNOVA
Supernova.

08:17.375 --> 08:20.250
I was too hasty.

08:21.708 --> 08:24.208
The compression is not sufficient.

08:26.292 --> 08:28.958
Damn, this guy...

08:31.917 --> 08:33.042
He is really strong.

08:33.042 --> 08:33.875
Hey.

08:35.042 --> 08:37.583
What's the situation now?

08:37.583 --> 08:39.750
Mechamaru, why didn't you...

08:39.750 --> 08:42.958
There is something else
I must do, so I need to save energy.

08:42.958 --> 08:45.458
Is it Blood Manipulation that Choso uses?

08:45.458 --> 08:46.167
You know it?

08:46.167 --> 08:48.500
Because Kamo uses
the same Cursed Technique.

08:49.875 --> 08:51.792
That sleepy-eyed third grader?

08:51.792 --> 08:53.042
So you...

08:53.042 --> 08:55.417
I don't know the weakness
of this technique.

08:55.417 --> 09:01.083
Blood Manipulation is one of the highly valued
techniques passed down in Kamo Family.

09:01.083 --> 09:04.333
Convergence compresses
and condenses the blood,

09:04.333 --> 09:06.500
BLOOD MANIPULATION. CONVERGENCE. PIERCING BLOOD.
leading to Piercing blood and Blood Edge.

09:06.500 --> 09:10.375
BLOOD EDGE. SUPERNOVA.
It can be used at any distance

09:10.375 --> 09:12.000
because of the balanced
power of the technique.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.208
Choso without blood loss
has almost no weakness.

09:14.208 --> 09:16.250
Thank you for the information.

09:17.417 --> 09:20.792
I don't know his weakness,
but I have an idea.

09:20.792 --> 09:22.208
What is it?

09:22.208 --> 09:24.083
Go to the bathroom.

09:24.083 --> 09:25.625
Bathroom? Why?

09:25.625 --> 09:27.792
I'll explain later.

09:27.792 --> 09:30.042
It has only a 10 percent
chance of success.

09:30.042 --> 09:32.875
Sorry. If it fails, you'll have to die.

09:32.875 --> 09:33.917
Come on.

09:33.917 --> 09:36.917
Dragging out will only make it worse.
You'll get killed by him anyway.

09:46.042 --> 09:47.458
Idiot.

09:47.458 --> 09:50.667
There's only a bathroom and an escalator.

09:50.667 --> 09:53.708
I'll catch you no matter
where you run off to.

09:57.750 --> 09:59.917
What's that sound?

09:59.917 --> 10:02.500
He defeated my brothers.

10:02.500 --> 10:05.125
An idiot can never do that.

10:05.125 --> 10:08.500
And what could the sound be...

10:09.750 --> 10:12.292
He's definitely up to something.

10:12.292 --> 10:13.333
I have to be careful.

10:13.333 --> 10:14.708
What?

10:14.708 --> 10:17.042
Aren't you coming over?

10:17.042 --> 10:19.250
You are such a coward.

10:19.250 --> 10:21.458
Just like your little brothers.

10:22.625 --> 10:23.792
I'll kill you!

10:27.417 --> 10:29.042
(JUJUTSU KAISEN)

10:30.417 --> 10:33.083
You are all the same.

10:36.792 --> 10:39.625
All three of you share
such brotherly love,

10:39.625 --> 10:41.750
so it's easy to manipulate you.

10:48.833 --> 10:51.042
So far everything has gone well.

10:51.042 --> 10:53.917
Now you have to take
a gamble, Yuji Itadori.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.917
What a pity.

11:08.917 --> 11:11.208
That was your last chance.

11:11.208 --> 11:14.500
Now you're the one with no escape.

11:18.458 --> 11:20.417
What?

11:20.417 --> 11:22.958
Convergence has been lifted.

11:23.833 --> 11:32.125
Blood Manipulation can inhibit blood clotting
to enhance the effect of the technique.

11:32.125 --> 11:37.708
Therefore, Choso's blood is easier
to dissolve in water than others.

11:37.708 --> 11:41.000
Besides that, when blood
comes into contact with water,

11:41.000 --> 11:46.750
affected by osmotic pressure, red blood cells
swell and the cell membranes rupture.

11:47.500 --> 11:54.000
He can't control the blood cells that
account for about 45 percent of blood.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.292
That's why Convergence has been lifted.

11:57.292 --> 12:00.250
Mechamaru's plan is right.

12:00.250 --> 12:07.125
Now, Choso can no longer
control the blood outside his body.

12:13.167 --> 12:16.958
Flowing Red Scale: Stack.

12:16.958 --> 12:19.667
Choso's combat experience is not enough.

12:19.667 --> 12:23.458
He didn't understand
what was happening to him.

12:23.458 --> 12:29.167
He just accepted reality and completed
blood manipulation inside his body.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.375
I don't figure it out.

12:32.375 --> 12:35.125
I didn't have time to ask him either.

12:35.125 --> 12:38.542
But I'm sure about one thing...

12:38.542 --> 12:40.917
I have the control here now.

13:49.542 --> 13:50.792
I can win.

13:52.542 --> 13:55.542
Just when he thinks he's bound to win,

13:55.542 --> 14:00.875
Choso compressed his blood to the maximum
to avoid contact with water.

14:00.875 --> 14:04.125
The blood reinforced by Cursed Energy

14:05.917 --> 14:11.500
pierced Yuji Itadori's liver.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.625
Blood Manipulation.

14:13.625 --> 14:15.542
Blood Asteroid.

14:15.542 --> 14:16.833
I was too careless.

14:16.833 --> 14:18.917
I thought he had
no other long-range attacks.

14:18.917 --> 14:21.458
What is it? Where was I hit?

14:21.458 --> 14:24.542
This is different from
the last time I got pierced in stomach.

14:24.542 --> 14:27.583
A vital part is injured.

14:27.583 --> 14:30.458
I'll lose. I'll die...

14:36.500 --> 14:40.167
I understand my duty now.

14:40.167 --> 14:44.458
To enable Fushiguro, Kugisaki,
Nanami, and other seniors

14:44.458 --> 14:49.875
to pass through here and get to Mr. Gojo,

14:49.875 --> 14:53.583
I have to disable him
from fighting even if I die.

14:53.583 --> 14:56.292
It's okay

14:56.292 --> 14:58.292
if I'm not the one who saves Mr. Gojo.

14:59.625 --> 15:03.333
Three times, only three times.

15:03.333 --> 15:05.833
Except the attacks I blocked,

15:05.833 --> 15:10.792
Itadori only hit me three times,
yet it's caused such severe damage.

15:10.792 --> 15:12.833
Blood Asteroid is only hard.

15:12.833 --> 15:15.750
It isn't comparable to Piercing blood
in terms of speed and power.

15:15.750 --> 15:20.375
I probably couldn't have pierced him
if I hadn't caught him off guard.

15:21.125 --> 15:26.500
Blood Manipulation doesn't usually
solidify blood like Blood Asteroid.

15:26.500 --> 15:33.375
Blood Edge is only for an outline, allowing blood
to circulate at high speeds and increase lethality.

15:33.375 --> 15:35.833
Even those sorcerers of Blood Manipulation

15:35.833 --> 15:39.458
aren't necessarily able to extend
their consciousness to all blood vessels.

15:39.458 --> 15:42.000
If solidifying the blood,

15:42.000 --> 15:46.625
one is at risk of sudden blood clots.

15:46.625 --> 15:48.625
Come on.

15:48.625 --> 15:56.208
Choso deems that the risk Yuji Itadori
brings greatly outweighs that.

16:32.583 --> 16:33.750
Teeth.

16:37.333 --> 16:38.583
It was a feint.

17:47.708 --> 17:49.083
It's not over yet.

17:52.083 --> 17:56.750
I haven't thrown a left-handed
punch since the first one.

17:56.750 --> 17:59.875
He probably thought
my left hand is useless now.

17:59.875 --> 18:03.542
So, I'll mislead him with
my right hand, then punch him.

18:06.292 --> 18:08.042
Hit!

18:11.542 --> 18:12.917
What is this?

18:12.917 --> 18:14.792
The feeling of hitting him...

18:30.958 --> 18:32.875
What a pity.

18:48.208 --> 18:51.417
You're still breathing?

19:01.250 --> 19:03.542
Just die...

19:03.542 --> 19:06.208
Go apologize to my brothers.

19:10.458 --> 19:12.500
Boring.

19:12.500 --> 19:16.083
How can you lose to such a nobody?

20:02.542 --> 20:04.833
What is happening...

20:10.167 --> 20:14.042
Suddenly, something
floods into Choso's mind.

20:14.042 --> 20:17.292
NON-EXISTENT MEMORIES
Non-existent memories.

21:02.917 --> 21:04.708
Come on.

21:04.708 --> 21:06.708
Have a bite, brother.

21:06.708 --> 21:08.625
Ah...

21:17.833 --> 21:21.958
Why did you...

23:22.542 --> 23:23.958
Found him.

23:31.333 --> 23:33.833
He's still alive, right?

23:33.833 --> 23:37.167
Well...

23:37.167 --> 23:38.583
Let's start.

23:41.042 --> 23:42.250
Mondy.

23:42.250 --> 23:43.458
Monday.

23:43.458 --> 23:44.125
Tuesday.

23:44.125 --> 23:45.333
Well.

23:45.333 --> 23:46.583
Wedonesday.

23:46.583 --> 23:47.333
Wednesday.

23:47.333 --> 23:48.708
What the heck?

23:48.708 --> 23:49.875
(Next Episode: Sway)

23:49.875 --> 23:51.958
Who decided to pronounce it this way?

23:51.958 --> 23:55.500
Someone smarter than you, dummy.
