00:01.410 --> 00:05.990
<i>It's been a month since Alicia secluded 
herself in this shed to study.</i>

00:11.490 --> 00:13.190
Good morning, Gill.

00:13.190 --> 00:15.540
Good morning. Is that for Alicia?

00:15.540 --> 00:19.200
Yes, but this is as close as I can bring it.

00:27.330 --> 00:31.120
She won't let anyone near... and 
even put up a wall with magic.

00:31.430 --> 00:34.560
She must be struggling to get 
by on her own, and yet...

00:35.550 --> 00:37.580
It's sad, isn't it?

00:37.580 --> 00:40.800
But getting all sentimental about it...

00:41.490 --> 00:42.600
won't help.

00:47.470 --> 00:49.060
Good morning, Gill.

00:49.060 --> 00:49.950
Good morning.

00:52.880 --> 00:56.480
Weren't you told that you could 
eat what the young lady eats?

00:56.480 --> 00:58.410
You're a boy of few wants, aren't you?

00:58.410 --> 01:01.280
I want to get to the 
library quickly. Also...

01:01.930 --> 01:06.640
If servants get to eat fine meals 
like this, you're living in luxury.

01:06.640 --> 01:07.870
You think so?

01:07.870 --> 01:09.500
They're just ordinary potatoes...

01:09.990 --> 01:12.920
Well... I grew up very poor.

01:14.460 --> 01:15.850
Have some bacon, too!

01:15.850 --> 01:17.560
And an apple!

01:16.770 --> 01:18.400
Uh, thanks...

01:18.800 --> 01:22.520
<i>I'm the most fortunate villager 
to have ever come from Roana.</i>

01:22.950 --> 01:26.050
<i>We didn't have potatoes 
this big in the village.</i>

01:26.290 --> 01:30.810
<i>So I want to live up to the 
expectations Alicia has for me.</i>

01:38.190 --> 01:39.830
<i>I won't let anyone tell me</i>

01:40.380 --> 01:42.900
<i>that there are things I can't 
do because I'm a commoner!</i>

01:51.750 --> 01:58.760
I'll Become a <b>Villainess</b>
Who Goes Down in History

03:14.000 --> 03:18.960
<b>The Villainess Sits This One Out</b>

03:24.200 --> 03:25.740
Hi there, Gill.

03:28.230 --> 03:29.390
Sir...

03:29.740 --> 03:32.300
I wanted to give you this.

03:32.900 --> 03:35.060
It's the magic potion Avel.

03:35.480 --> 03:38.870
You need it to get through the magic barrier 
and back to your village, don't you?

03:40.090 --> 03:42.280
So that's what this is.

03:42.670 --> 03:46.970
Why give me this? You could just 
pick me up and toss me out.

03:46.970 --> 03:48.720
It's your mansion, after all.

03:49.120 --> 03:50.440
You've got the wrong idea.

03:50.810 --> 03:53.620
I was giving them to Alicia before.

03:53.620 --> 03:57.380
From now on, whenever you 
want to use one, just ask.

03:57.380 --> 03:59.670
Huh? You're not kicking me out?

04:00.130 --> 04:01.170
Why, then?

04:03.010 --> 04:07.250
As Alicia's father, I'm grateful to you.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.080
I only wish for her to be happy,

04:11.080 --> 04:13.630
but I don't think I'm someone 
who can understand her.

04:14.080 --> 04:16.700
I can't guarantee I'll always 
be able to take her side, either.

04:17.450 --> 04:22.520
Ever since Alicia was little, while other 
girls her age were playing together,

04:22.850 --> 04:28.260
she was always throwing herself at her 
studies as if her life depended on it.

04:28.550 --> 04:34.450
You're the only person she's ever 
forged a friendship with on her own.

04:34.930 --> 04:38.880
I hope you'll continue to be my daughter's 
friend for a good, long time.

04:39.890 --> 04:42.040
You sound like a regular dad...

04:42.040 --> 04:44.170
Well, I <i>am</i> her dad!

04:44.170 --> 04:49.340
I thought you were pretty cruel 
for locking her in a shed.

04:49.340 --> 04:51.590
My wife said the same thing.

04:51.590 --> 04:54.570
What is the meaning of this, Arnold?

04:54.570 --> 04:56.340
Well, you see, Layla...

04:56.340 --> 04:59.530
I understand taking her out 
of school for a while,

04:59.530 --> 05:05.580
but locking her up with magic, and not 
letting her out until she reaches level 90?

05:05.580 --> 05:07.960
That crosses the line into child abuse!

05:07.960 --> 05:10.760
And you call yourself her father?!

05:10.760 --> 05:12.310
I'm disappointed in you!

05:12.310 --> 05:16.320
N-Now, wait! Listen to me, Layla! I...

05:17.140 --> 05:20.420
I never told her to go that far.

05:20.880 --> 05:25.240
Do you mean Alicia... went 
into that shed herself?

05:25.240 --> 05:32.030
I set the level 90 condition because I wanted
 her to give up on being the Saint's watcher.

05:32.030 --> 05:34.360
I gave her a difficult task on purpose.

05:34.350 --> 05:40.270
<b>I promise you</b>

05:34.350 --> 05:40.270
<b>that I will reach this goal</b>

05:34.360 --> 05:36.750
<i>I promise you that I will reach this goal.</i>

05:34.980 --> 05:38.290
But for some reason, that just 
made her even more motivated.

05:38.290 --> 05:40.260
So it backfired on you, huh?

05:41.520 --> 05:45.650
My only intention was to no longer allow 
her to be a watcher if she failed.

05:45.650 --> 05:49.260
I was going to let her return to the 
academy when the time was right.

05:49.630 --> 05:51.940
Alicia will pull it off.

05:51.940 --> 05:54.000
Once she says she'll do 
something, she does it.

05:54.440 --> 05:57.620
Can't you just have a little more 
faith and trust her with this?

05:57.620 --> 05:59.240
Alicia is strong.

05:59.780 --> 06:02.430
I don't want her to get 
involved with Liz Cather.

06:03.050 --> 06:07.100
Being on the wrong side of a conflict 
with Liz put Alicia in danger.

06:07.320 --> 06:11.090
Albert has changed since he met Liz.

06:11.090 --> 06:14.010
I'm not even sure I want him
 to succeed me anymore.

06:14.240 --> 06:18.810
After that incident, even the king 
paid me a visit and apologized.

06:18.810 --> 06:22.440
He granted me his blessing to relieve 
her of her duty as watcher.

06:22.440 --> 06:26.620
But in truth, he probably 
wants her to keep doing it.

06:26.850 --> 06:28.900
Because Liz is the Saint?

06:29.240 --> 06:33.320
Do you people really believe <i>she</i>
 is going to save this kingdom?

06:33.320 --> 06:37.500
The concept of "saving this 
kingdom" is quite ambiguous...

06:38.210 --> 06:41.160
But it is true that she's worth using.

06:41.520 --> 06:46.130
Liz's extraordinary magical talents 
could prove useful in countless ways.

06:46.130 --> 06:49.270
Once she graduates, she'll 
be lauded as the Saint

06:49.270 --> 06:52.600
and put to work for the kingdom, I'm sure.

06:52.900 --> 06:55.020
The same goes for Alicia.

06:55.460 --> 07:00.280
Anyone who possesses exceptional 
talents is put to use by the kingdom.

07:00.640 --> 07:02.670
If she were a powerless little girl,

07:02.670 --> 07:04.790
I could've protected her as her father,

07:05.270 --> 07:07.830
but as the head of one of 
the Five Great Noble Families,

07:07.830 --> 07:10.940
I'm just one of the people 
who ends up using her.

07:11.330 --> 07:14.750
That's what I mean when I say I might 
not always be able to take her side.

07:15.310 --> 07:17.270
Will you hold me in contempt for that?

07:17.270 --> 07:18.150
No.

07:18.560 --> 07:22.120
Alicia isn't some pitiful 
child who just gets used.

07:22.420 --> 07:25.500
If anything, she thinks you people are weak.

07:26.770 --> 07:31.330
She was saying the magical supremacy 
in this kingdom is inefficient.

07:31.970 --> 07:35.460
They'll talk about using a little girl
 for the benefit of the kingdom,

07:35.460 --> 07:39.050
but people who lack magic
 aren't even considered.

07:40.910 --> 07:45.920
Alicia intends to train me up
 into someone she can use.

07:45.920 --> 07:49.320
I will always be on her 
side, no matter what.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.220
I see.

07:51.890 --> 07:55.720
I think I understand why 
she trusts you so much.

07:56.950 --> 08:00.160
Wow! We got so many!

08:00.570 --> 08:03.730
Does this mean we can eat enough 
to fill our bellies every day?

08:03.730 --> 08:06.720
I don't think it's quite enough 
to fill you up every day.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.270
But still...

08:08.880 --> 08:12.120
Let's all eat these together 
to celebrate our harvest!

08:12.120 --> 08:13.950
Yay!

08:13.950 --> 08:16.920
I never dreamed we'd be able to grow 
food like this in the village.

08:17.380 --> 08:20.850
I hope we get to show Alicia soon.

08:20.850 --> 08:23.800
Nobles sure are smart, though.

08:23.800 --> 08:26.310
She even knew what varieties 
would grow here.

08:26.650 --> 08:28.960
We grew them just like she told us to,

08:28.960 --> 08:31.510
and the harvest came out even 
better than we expected!

08:31.510 --> 08:32.520
True.

08:33.270 --> 08:37.030
<i>The daughter of a nobleman shouldn't 
know anything about raising crops.</i>

08:37.030 --> 08:39.950
<i>She probably studied it all on her own.</i>

08:40.680 --> 08:42.080
Thief!

08:42.360 --> 08:45.040
It's your own fault for flashing 
food around like that!

08:45.330 --> 08:46.530
Hey! Stop!

08:46.530 --> 08:48.900
Catch me if you think you caâ€”

08:54.040 --> 08:56.410
Nate! You saved our food!

08:56.410 --> 08:59.860
You shouldn't go charging 
at people with that leg.

08:59.860 --> 09:03.030
It was a reflex. Thanks, Nate.

09:03.560 --> 09:05.770
When you grow crops in 
a big field like this,

09:05.770 --> 09:07.710
it's obviously gonna end up a target.

09:07.710 --> 09:09.310
Yeah, I guess...

09:09.310 --> 09:11.830
We're a pretty big family now,

09:11.830 --> 09:14.940
but there are still quite a few 
people who aren't on board yet.

09:15.170 --> 09:19.570
It'd be a big help if you'd join up with us.

09:19.570 --> 09:22.230
All the guys you hang out 
with are strong, too.

09:22.230 --> 09:25.970
Do you seriously believe that noble chick

09:25.970 --> 09:29.420
is gonna set this village free someday?

09:29.830 --> 09:32.250
It's just a noble's passing whim.

09:32.250 --> 09:35.330
She just wants to make herself 
feel good by doing charity work.

09:35.580 --> 09:38.350
She hasn't even been seen 
around here for so long now.

09:38.350 --> 09:39.870
I bet she got bored of us.

09:41.020 --> 09:44.070
And yet you and Grandpa Will
 take her seriously.

09:44.070 --> 09:45.510
Are you stupid?

09:46.430 --> 09:48.060
I can't bear to watch it.

09:49.080 --> 09:51.780
Alicia isn't like that,

09:51.780 --> 09:54.230
but even if she is, I think that's fine.

09:54.740 --> 09:59.180
Alicia taught us how to grow crops.

09:59.180 --> 10:00.670
If it was just about charity,

10:00.670 --> 10:03.650
it would've been easier to 
buy food and give it to us.

10:03.650 --> 10:06.760
But what she did give us

10:06.760 --> 10:11.010
is the knowledge of what crops can 
grow where it's always cloudy,

10:11.010 --> 10:12.590
and how to raise them.

10:12.790 --> 10:18.190
We can live much better lives now, with 
our own hands, than we had before.

10:18.190 --> 10:21.500
That alone is worth so much.

10:21.500 --> 10:27.050
But whether or not we keep moving 
forward from here is up to us.

10:27.420 --> 10:31.360
I don't want to extinguish the hope 
that Alicia set alight for us.

10:36.440 --> 10:39.890
You've been getting involved 
with Roana, haven't you, Duke?

10:41.060 --> 10:43.000
I'm not trying to reproach you.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.940
It was Alicia's written proposal.

10:45.880 --> 10:52.320
Liz's essay has inspired unprecedented 
levels of sympathy for Roana.

10:52.620 --> 10:55.880
But this is not an issue that can be 
resolved with sentimental arguments.

10:56.250 --> 10:59.900
Alicia has compiled various 
concerns and proposed plans

10:59.900 --> 11:02.900
in a way that builds upon Liz's ideas.

11:03.590 --> 11:04.470
Duke...

11:05.110 --> 11:09.240
Have you any interest in undertaking 
an official reformation of Roana?

11:09.980 --> 11:13.650
The village has been used to 
lock up only innocent people

11:13.650 --> 11:16.420
and isolate them using 
magic on a large scale.

11:17.150 --> 11:20.930
As Liz said, it is a humanitarian issue,

11:20.930 --> 11:23.200
and as Alicia pointed out,

11:23.200 --> 11:26.290
it is a waste of land and mana sources.

11:26.520 --> 11:29.200
It was always an issue we'd 
have to deal with eventually,

11:29.200 --> 11:32.870
but the need was simply not pressing enough,

11:32.870 --> 11:36.370
and there are constantly a multitude of 
problems awaiting government action.

11:37.140 --> 11:41.160
Thus it has been put off by generation 
after generation of kings.

11:41.590 --> 11:43.420
I'm no exception, myself.

11:44.330 --> 11:46.720
You are a brilliant prince.

11:46.720 --> 11:48.470
Far more so than me.

11:48.980 --> 11:51.550
You are by far the better choice to...

11:52.150 --> 11:54.830
No, if my brother were here...

11:55.310 --> 11:58.130
Perhaps you should take some time off?

11:58.530 --> 12:00.710
Roana is indeed a matter of concern,

12:00.710 --> 12:04.170
but our king having too much on his 
plate is another issue we must remedy.

12:04.520 --> 12:06.820
The range of issues that 
demand a king's direction,

12:06.820 --> 12:10.200
even provincial administrative matters 
that should be trivial, is far too broad.

12:11.010 --> 12:13.560
Making a decision takes time,

12:13.560 --> 12:16.990
and that, in turn, causes the entire 
kingdom's progress to lag behind.

12:17.230 --> 12:21.190
Perhaps you should trust 
local judgment a bit more?

12:21.190 --> 12:22.850
You think so, as well?

12:23.220 --> 12:24.340
<i>"As well"?</i>

12:24.340 --> 12:27.760
No, you're right. 
Your words are painfully true.

12:28.090 --> 12:33.950
I am aware that you're currently too busy 
to deal with the reformation of Roana.

12:33.950 --> 12:36.690
I am willing to tackle this 
issue, if you'll allow it.

12:36.690 --> 12:38.760
Yes, please do.

12:39.500 --> 12:43.750
But to think she could come up with 
remedial measures at such a young age...

12:43.750 --> 12:48.120
Letting her vanish from center stage 
now would be a waste of talent.

12:50.900 --> 12:53.990
<i>Oh, hello! I'm your savior!</i>

12:50.910 --> 12:55.920
I'll Become a <b>Villainess
</b>Who Goes Down in History

12:53.990 --> 12:55.910
<i>Is there anything troubling yâ€”</i>

12:55.920 --> 13:00.920
I'll Become a <b>Villainess
</b>Who Goes Down in History

12:56.700 --> 13:00.180
<i>It's </i>not<i> macarons? Not macarons...</i>

13:00.180 --> 13:00.920
<i>Macarons.</i>

13:04.810 --> 13:08.230
<i>It's now been six months since Alicia 
secluded herself in the shed.</i>

13:14.130 --> 13:17.680
Alicia's magic practice must 
be pretty intense, huh?

13:18.380 --> 13:21.330
She's still the most talented 
of all us siblings.

13:21.330 --> 13:23.770
Why make her try to get even better?

13:24.130 --> 13:27.490
Alicia told me something once.

13:28.650 --> 13:30.470
I'm impressed you do that every day.

13:31.490 --> 13:35.070
Improving one's magic level 
starts with physical strength.

13:35.330 --> 13:37.970
Muscles are the building 
blocks of everything!

13:39.130 --> 13:42.670
And you're doing all this 
to catch up to Liz Cather?

13:42.900 --> 13:46.900
I'll never catch up to Liz, 
no matter how hard I work.

13:47.250 --> 13:48.600
Not ever.

13:48.600 --> 13:52.560
What? But you're working so hard!

13:52.560 --> 13:54.780
Hard work is never rewarded.

13:55.530 --> 13:56.650
But still...

13:56.650 --> 13:59.630
I want to get as close 
to Liz's level as I can.

13:59.990 --> 14:02.320
I can't act better than her if I don't!

14:04.160 --> 14:08.470
She keeps working hard so she can 
gain the confidence to face her.

14:08.950 --> 14:11.830
She'd go that far just to compete with Liz?

14:12.100 --> 14:14.740
We're talking about an actual prodigy, here.

14:15.110 --> 14:17.230
She can easily cast multiple instances

14:17.230 --> 14:20.130
of spells that are difficult 
enough to cast singularly.

14:20.930 --> 14:25.310
Competing against someone like that 
would normally be unthinkable.

14:25.310 --> 14:26.160
But...

14:28.330 --> 14:33.200
Only those who aren't bound by "normal" 
are able to change the status quo.

14:34.200 --> 14:39.570
I thought she was wasting her time writing 
that proposal about Roana, too...

14:39.890 --> 14:41.320
But, just maybe...

14:42.940 --> 14:46.000
That's why I have to work harder, too.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.490
So that I can stand by Alicia's side.

14:57.020 --> 14:58.090
Henri.

14:59.530 --> 15:01.330
Alicia's not here yet.

15:01.330 --> 15:02.860
Oh...

15:02.860 --> 15:05.210
I feel so bad for Prince Duke.

15:05.670 --> 15:08.070
He hates Alicia Williams so much,

15:08.070 --> 15:12.040
he's worried that she might 
come to the academy.

15:12.320 --> 15:14.870
That girl should just quit school already.

15:16.780 --> 15:21.840
They don't know the first thing about 
Alicia, yet they keep running their mouths.

15:22.990 --> 15:25.830
Did I say something strange?

15:25.830 --> 15:29.570
No. I'm just glad you turned 
to glare at them first.

15:29.980 --> 15:34.730
If that had kept going, those jerks would've 
been expelled by the end of the day.

15:34.730 --> 15:36.410
Huh? For real?

15:36.410 --> 15:39.400
Hey, come on. Don't say 
scary things like that.

15:39.910 --> 15:43.080
Our school lives should be
 healthy and cheerful, right?

15:43.600 --> 15:47.720
If you want to complain, take it up with 
the idiots who keep saying stupid things.

15:47.720 --> 15:50.120
It's so weird, though.

15:50.120 --> 15:54.590
I can't figure out where the nasty 
rumors about Alicia started.

15:54.590 --> 15:57.150
Well, that's just how rumors are.

15:57.370 --> 16:01.890
Also, no matter how hard I try to clear 
up the misunderstandings about her,

16:01.890 --> 16:04.090
nobody will believe me,

16:04.090 --> 16:08.780
yet they call me a nice guy who 
cares about his baby sister.

16:09.920 --> 16:13.220
Is it what they'd call a misunderstanding
 based on prejudice?

16:13.220 --> 16:19.630
Rumors started spreading that Ali is a loose 
girl who paid a visit to Duke at night...

16:19.630 --> 16:21.030
Oh, sorry!

16:21.850 --> 16:23.690
If I'd known this would happen,

16:23.690 --> 16:27.180
I would've come up with an 
unshakable fait accompli.

16:27.180 --> 16:28.000
Huh?

16:28.000 --> 16:29.190
Duke!

16:29.930 --> 16:32.430
You're making that somber face again.

16:32.430 --> 16:34.930
You know, at times like this,

16:34.930 --> 16:38.860
I think what you need is some delicious 
tea and pastries for a change of pace.

16:39.220 --> 16:41.480
Liz baked a cake!

16:41.480 --> 16:43.690
Liz's cakes are the best!

16:43.690 --> 16:46.340
You're sure to feel better 
when you have some!

16:47.930 --> 16:52.100
Prince Duke and Miss Liz really 
do look lovely together.

16:52.350 --> 16:54.020
With Miss Liz around,

16:54.020 --> 16:58.800
even Prince Duke will be able to forget 
how troublesome Alicia Williams is.

16:59.900 --> 17:05.900
I poured my heart into making a cake in 
the hopes that it would make you smile.

17:05.900 --> 17:08.340
I really hope you like it.

17:08.340 --> 17:11.250
Sorry, but I'm not in the mood right now.

17:15.550 --> 17:16.630
Duke...

17:17.140 --> 17:19.970
Liz! Don't worry about it!

17:19.970 --> 17:22.600
He just isn't in the mood for 
sweets right now, that's all!

17:22.600 --> 17:24.000
Eric...

17:24.000 --> 17:25.670
Or maybe...

17:25.920 --> 17:30.360
he's still on edge because 
of my stupid sister.

17:30.670 --> 17:32.000
I'm sorry, Liz.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.800
No, no! It's nothing you 
need to apologize for.

17:35.800 --> 17:37.520
If I just try harder,

17:37.870 --> 17:40.670
I'm sure I can bring Duke's smile back.

17:41.040 --> 17:42.690
I truly believe that!

17:43.820 --> 17:45.560
There's no doubt if you say so!

17:45.560 --> 17:46.340
Yeah!

17:47.210 --> 17:50.740
So is it really Alicia Williams's 
fault that nothing has changed

17:50.740 --> 17:53.250
between Miss Liz and Prince Duke?

17:53.250 --> 17:55.260
Yeah! It must be!

17:55.260 --> 17:57.830
That girl is just infuriating!

18:04.400 --> 18:06.310
Interesting, isn't it?

18:10.300 --> 18:12.240
When you say "interesting,"

18:12.580 --> 18:15.650
are you referring to the nasty 
rumors going around about Alicia?

18:15.650 --> 18:20.580
No. What I'm curious about is those girls.

18:20.580 --> 18:25.000
They used to hate Liz's guts, you know.

18:25.350 --> 18:28.170
They even bullied her all the time.

18:28.440 --> 18:33.080
But at some point, suddenly they 
started being all, "I love Miss Liz!"

18:33.570 --> 18:37.260
Do you think people's feelings 
change that easily?

18:42.060 --> 18:43.800
Thanks for the backup.

18:44.120 --> 18:46.720
I'm not sure how long I'll 
be able to do it, though.

18:46.720 --> 18:49.890
The student council has gotten 
awfully prickly, too.

18:50.470 --> 18:53.150
So long as that young lady is absent,

18:53.150 --> 18:56.180
I guess it'll be tough to 
have a healthy school life.

18:56.180 --> 18:59.680
And when she does come back, 
that'll be just as interesting!

19:00.360 --> 19:02.610
I can't believe you're able to enjoy this.

19:03.040 --> 19:05.250
You amaze me, you know that?

19:08.880 --> 19:11.780
Mel, there's something
 I want you to look into.

19:11.780 --> 19:16.050
<i>Could it be... the Saint?</i>

19:16.050 --> 19:20.470
There may be some mechanism behind her 
ability to make everyone love her.

19:20.790 --> 19:23.430
<i>Wow! That sounds fascinating!</i>

19:23.430 --> 19:25.210
<i>I'm on it!</i>

19:25.210 --> 19:30.830
Also, Father has officially given me full 
authority over the matter with Roana.

19:30.830 --> 19:32.770
Get me more detailed information.

19:32.770 --> 19:34.770
<i>Ooh! At last?</i>

19:34.770 --> 19:39.320
<i>You-know-who doesn't seem so excited 
about that whole thing, though...</i>

19:39.320 --> 19:40.810
That's true...

19:42.610 --> 19:45.480
But I don't intend to force anything.

19:45.480 --> 19:49.650
<i>Hmm... I bet this would've gone 
more quickly if she were here.</i>

19:51.670 --> 19:56.550
<i>Hey, Master! Would you like me 
to check in on Miss Alicia, too?</i>

19:56.550 --> 19:57.260
No.

19:57.260 --> 20:00.520
<i>Why not? You're curious, aren't you?</i>

20:00.520 --> 20:04.170
I don't want anyone who isn't 
me learning more about her.

20:05.360 --> 20:09.760
<i>I never thought I'd see 
the day when you envied me!</i>

20:09.760 --> 20:13.630
<i>Well, this was fun to see. 
I'll go do my job now!</i>

20:16.280 --> 20:20.100
I wish I were the only one 
who really knew you...

20:21.650 --> 20:26.490
<b>Two Years Later</b>

20:22.340 --> 20:26.490
Here. Using your brain makes 
you want sweets, right?

20:28.180 --> 20:29.200
Thanks.

20:30.670 --> 20:36.660
Come to think of it, Alicia said she 
eats macarons to improve her focus.

20:36.660 --> 20:40.890
That's probably just because 
macarons are her favorite treat.

20:40.890 --> 20:43.350
I wonder how much longer she'll keep this up

20:43.350 --> 20:46.070
when she can't even have macarons.

20:46.070 --> 20:46.970
Yeah...

20:46.970 --> 20:50.570
<i>It's been two years now since 
Alicia started her training.</i>

20:50.990 --> 20:54.640
<i>There's less than a year left 
before Liz Cather graduates.</i>

20:54.640 --> 20:56.990
<i>This was too easy!</i>

20:54.650 --> 21:09.490
<b>This was too easy!</b>

20:55.270 --> 20:58.180
To be honest, knowing Alicia,

20:58.180 --> 21:04.890
I thought she'd fulfill her father's 
conditions with superhuman speed.

21:04.890 --> 21:07.150
Well, she's going for level 90.

21:07.150 --> 21:09.200
It won't be that easy.

21:10.070 --> 21:12.610
When Ali turned fifteen,

21:12.610 --> 21:16.150
Father approached her about 
going back to the academy,

21:16.550 --> 21:20.050
but she turned him away, saying, 
"I'm just getting to the good part."

21:20.430 --> 21:23.060
Have to wonder what "the good part" is.

21:23.060 --> 21:26.100
Well, we know for sure that 
Alicia hasn't given up.

21:26.480 --> 21:28.730
So I can't give up, either.

21:29.190 --> 21:30.920
Gill! I justâ€”

21:30.920 --> 21:34.100
Oh, Master Henri. Do forgive me.

21:34.100 --> 21:35.980
It's all right. What's going on?

21:35.980 --> 21:39.990
I just heard that Miss Alicia 
has completed her training!

21:49.040 --> 21:50.750
The barrier's gone!

21:51.130 --> 21:52.250
Alicia!

21:53.960 --> 21:55.110
Gill?

21:58.860 --> 22:00.780
You've gotten taller.

22:07.260 --> 22:08.890
I didn't recognize you.
