WEBVTT

00:06.530 --> 00:07.360
Mel.

00:07.620 --> 00:09.380
<i>That's my master for you!</i>

00:09.380 --> 00:12.280
<i>I concealed my presence, and 
you still found me right away.</i>

00:12.640 --> 00:13.530
How'd it go?

00:13.830 --> 00:17.990
<i>I relayed your request 
to the one you specified.</i>

00:18.540 --> 00:22.040
<i>But is there really any point in this?</i>

00:24.760 --> 00:26.040
Who can say?

00:34.780 --> 00:41.760
I'll Become a <b>Villainess</b>
Who Goes Down in History

01:57.070 --> 02:01.970
<b>A Kiss with a Witch</b>

02:05.590 --> 02:06.980
<i>The village of Loana.</i>

02:07.750 --> 02:10.450
<i>I could get there through the 
forest behind the mansion.</i>

02:11.300 --> 02:15.720
<i>The king said people there can't 
even afford bread for tomorrow,</i>

02:15.720 --> 02:17.930
<i>but this is all just 
knowledge found in a book.</i>

02:18.610 --> 02:22.680
<i>A true villainess should 
go and see for herself!</i>

02:23.160 --> 02:27.390
<i>The only problem is that there's 
no way I'll get permission.</i>

02:23.160 --> 02:27.390
<i>Nope! Absolutely not!
Not happening! Not a chance!</i>

02:23.180 --> 02:28.490
<b>You mustn't!!</b>

02:23.180 --> 02:28.490
<b>Impossible</b>

02:23.180 --> 02:28.490
<b>It's dangerous</b>

02:23.180 --> 02:28.490
<b>Absolutely not!!</b>

02:28.950 --> 02:31.290
Which means I'll just have to sneak out!

02:41.440 --> 02:42.600
That was scary...

02:42.920 --> 02:45.100
No! I'm a villainess!

02:45.420 --> 02:48.270
I can't let a simple forest 
at night frighten me!

02:51.490 --> 02:55.830
<i>Loana used to be enclosed 
by a magical barrier</i>

02:55.830 --> 02:58.300
<i>meant to keep heinous 
criminals from getting out.</i>

02:58.970 --> 03:04.020
<i>But since I have magic, I'll be 
able to pass through it... right?</i>

03:05.390 --> 03:06.800
Is that it?

03:11.560 --> 03:12.500
So this is...

03:13.380 --> 03:14.170
It stinks!

03:20.180 --> 03:21.840
<i>They haven't passed out.</i>

03:22.280 --> 03:24.820
<i>People without homes are 
just sleeping on the ground.</i>

03:25.420 --> 03:27.560
<i>I had no idea it was this bad.</i>

03:30.520 --> 03:32.690
<i>I'll be killed if they find out I'm a noble!</i>

03:32.690 --> 03:33.820
Young lady.

03:35.770 --> 03:38.050
<i>This man's eyes...</i>

03:39.300 --> 03:41.000
You needn't be afraid.

03:41.250 --> 03:43.680
And you'd be wise not to draw your sword.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.990
If you carelessly flaunt such things here,

03:45.990 --> 03:47.810
you'll only draw attention to yourself.

03:48.930 --> 03:51.230
You're from outside, aren't you?

03:51.230 --> 03:52.840
Why have you come here?

03:53.310 --> 03:56.530
I had to see it with my own eyes.

03:58.570 --> 04:00.000
Come with me.

04:09.560 --> 04:12.430
Now, what is it you want to know?

04:12.730 --> 04:15.210
Um... Who are you, exactly?

04:15.600 --> 04:17.300
My name is Will.

04:17.750 --> 04:21.190
Just Will and nothing more, young noble lady.

04:21.840 --> 04:23.740
How could you tell?

04:23.740 --> 04:26.740
You can't even... Oh, I'm so sorry.

04:26.970 --> 04:28.390
It's all right.

04:28.390 --> 04:31.250
I may be blind, but there's 
still plenty I can ascertain.

04:31.250 --> 04:32.660
Sounds, for example.

04:33.030 --> 04:36.830
There was a slight difference in your 
footsteps between your left and right feet.

04:37.280 --> 04:40.200
That means you are not centrally balanced,

04:40.480 --> 04:42.350
from which I inferred that you carry a sword.

04:43.290 --> 04:46.260
The rustling of your clothes 
told me that you were a woman,

04:46.260 --> 04:50.010
and the scent about you is too 
clean to be found around here.

04:50.470 --> 04:53.010
And the fact that you entered 
this village from outside

04:53.010 --> 04:55.790
confirms you are a noble who possesses magic.

04:56.860 --> 04:58.990
Back when I had my sight,

04:58.990 --> 05:02.350
I was surrounded by your kind all the time.

05:02.960 --> 05:06.050
Your presence was not unfamiliar to 
me, and that also served as a clue.

05:06.690 --> 05:08.320
You were a noble?

05:08.970 --> 05:11.390
I worked at the castle,

05:11.390 --> 05:14.970
but I spoke defiantly to someone far 
above my station and earned their ire.

05:15.480 --> 05:18.330
I lost my sight and was 
banished to this village.

05:18.820 --> 05:20.420
It all happened long ago.

05:20.420 --> 05:21.890
That's awful.

05:21.890 --> 05:23.620
What in the world did you say?

05:23.620 --> 05:26.590
Well... What is your name?

05:27.040 --> 05:28.080
Alicia.

05:28.330 --> 05:29.600
A fine name.

05:30.180 --> 05:34.790
A tradition that's been upheld for 
a long time doesn't make it right today.

05:34.790 --> 05:36.390
Let's leave it at that.

05:36.860 --> 05:39.660
Why do you think we learn history?

05:40.090 --> 05:42.380
To make the present better.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.930
No matter how much you may learn from books,

05:45.930 --> 05:48.410
it's meaningless if you don't 
utilize it for the future.

05:49.950 --> 05:53.690
<i>I can't believe such a remarkable 
man was banished from the castle.</i>

05:54.440 --> 05:56.140
Do you detest the nobility?

05:56.380 --> 05:58.760
I would be lying if I said I didn't.

05:58.760 --> 05:59.670
But...

06:00.100 --> 06:04.310
I know the day will come when 
someone will understand what I did.

06:05.700 --> 06:08.730
Why don't you tell me your story next?

06:08.730 --> 06:11.890
What made you wish to see 
this place for yourself?

06:12.070 --> 06:14.380
I... I...

06:15.010 --> 06:16.550
<i>Before I knew it,</i>

06:16.900 --> 06:21.290
<i>I was telling him everything, even 
my dream of becoming a villainess.</i>

06:22.140 --> 06:26.100
<i>He retained his calm expression 
while listening to my every word.</i>

06:27.410 --> 06:29.860
I will most certainly come again.

06:29.860 --> 06:32.440
You mustn't. It's dangerous here.

06:32.970 --> 06:34.550
It's no use trying to stop me.

06:35.910 --> 06:37.820
<i>I know I'm making 
things difficult for him,</i>

06:37.820 --> 06:39.750
<i>but I don't want this to be the end of it.</i>

06:40.020 --> 06:42.420
<i>There's no one else like him anywhere.</i>

06:42.650 --> 06:45.660
If you insist on coming 
again, do so at night.

06:56.990 --> 06:57.980
<i>And then...</i>

06:59.050 --> 07:00.510
<i>a year passed.</i>

07:02.000 --> 07:06.960
I'll Become a <b>Villainess</b>
Who Goes Down in History

07:02.750 --> 07:05.720
<i>Growing up certainly isn't easy...</i>

07:06.960 --> 07:11.970
I'll Become a <b>Villainess</b>
Who Goes Down in History

07:07.700 --> 07:11.990
<i>Oh, I'm a genius! A little genius!</i>

07:12.690 --> 07:15.910
<i>For the past two years, I've 
continued to read books,</i>

07:16.210 --> 07:17.490
<i>learn swordsmanship,</i>

07:17.910 --> 07:20.170
<i>and visit Grandpa Will periodically.</i>

07:21.020 --> 07:22.580
<i>If anything has changed, it's...</i>

07:23.360 --> 07:25.910
<i>When my brother Albert turned fifteen,</i>

07:25.910 --> 07:29.020
<i>he entered the Magic Academy, 
where the game takes place.</i>

07:29.670 --> 07:32.750
<i>I'm sure Prince Duke and the 
heroine have met by now.</i>

07:33.120 --> 07:35.130
<i>They may even be attracted 
to each other already.</i>

07:35.830 --> 07:39.310
I can't wait for the day I get to 
confront them as the villainess!

07:40.230 --> 07:41.340
Alicia.

07:41.990 --> 07:43.850
Want to go into town today?

07:44.100 --> 07:46.960
Master Eric! I would love to!

07:46.960 --> 07:49.760
Hang on! The two of you can't go alone!

07:49.760 --> 07:50.820
I'm going, too!

07:50.820 --> 07:52.450
So is Alan coming as well?

07:52.730 --> 07:54.620
He's still studying.

07:54.860 --> 07:58.280
Oh? Even twins go their 
separate ways sometimes, huh?

08:01.580 --> 08:03.190
Are there any places you'd like to see?

08:05.620 --> 08:09.080
Oh, a friend of mine runs that shop.

08:09.960 --> 08:10.970
Hello!

08:11.350 --> 08:12.590
Welcome.

08:12.830 --> 08:14.740
Oh, hi, Eric and Henry.

08:14.740 --> 08:16.950
Oh? And who's the young lady?

08:17.300 --> 08:18.430
I'm Alicia.

08:18.650 --> 08:21.220
Ah, Henry's younger sister, right?

08:21.480 --> 08:24.980
I'm Paul. Welcome to my shop. 
I sell all kinds of plants.

08:25.480 --> 08:27.730
Well, it's mainly medicinal herbs, I suppose.

08:28.370 --> 08:30.690
My family specializes in green magic.

08:31.060 --> 08:32.440
You're a noble?

08:33.650 --> 08:35.740
Just a happy-go-lucky, low-ranking one.

08:36.540 --> 08:38.280
Plants are amazing.

08:38.280 --> 08:41.340
They have the power to cure 
illness and heal the soul.

08:41.920 --> 08:44.750
I was born into an environment that 
made it easy to learn about them.

08:45.480 --> 08:48.290
I wanted to use that to 
help people in some way,

08:48.540 --> 08:50.120
and that's why I opened this store.

08:50.460 --> 08:53.840
<i>That's precisely what it means 
to make use of what you know.</i>

08:54.080 --> 08:55.900
Take this, for example.

08:55.900 --> 08:57.080
Josia!

08:57.420 --> 08:59.540
One spoonful of a josia infusion

08:59.540 --> 09:01.860
will bring down any fever instantly!

09:01.860 --> 09:03.700
That's a priceless herb!

09:03.700 --> 09:05.000
You know your stuff.

09:05.390 --> 09:07.100
Are you into plants?

09:07.100 --> 09:09.350
That's just common knowledge!

09:09.350 --> 09:12.030
Anyone who doesn't know that 
just hasn't studied enough!

09:13.540 --> 09:16.660
<i>Spoken like a true villainess!</i>

09:16.660 --> 09:19.930
I'd never say, "I knew that 
because I've read lots of books."

09:19.930 --> 09:22.850
That's how a heroine would 
try to talk herself up!

09:26.120 --> 09:27.880
Oh, it's common knowledge, huh?

09:28.160 --> 09:32.770
<i>Uh... I guess I still need to 
study up on how villainesses act.</i>

09:33.400 --> 09:35.380
You're a very clever young lady.

09:35.740 --> 09:39.140
Eric, you'd better not drag your feet. 
You'll soon have lots more rivals.

09:39.140 --> 09:39.770
Huh?

09:39.770 --> 09:43.180
WhaâNo way! I'll never let you have my sister!

09:43.890 --> 09:45.840
You three went to town together, eh?

09:45.840 --> 09:47.390
Did you have fun, Ali?

09:47.390 --> 09:48.350
Yes!

09:48.350 --> 09:49.310
Lucky you.

09:49.570 --> 09:51.130
A date with Ali...

09:52.400 --> 09:53.860
Why are you glaring at me?!

09:54.040 --> 09:56.980
Say, you should go out with me next time.

09:58.140 --> 10:01.120
Is there anywhere you want to 
go, or anything you want to do?

10:01.350 --> 10:02.880
Anything I want to do?

10:03.340 --> 10:07.080
There is. I want to take 
the swordsmanship test.

10:07.080 --> 10:08.000
The sword?

10:08.000 --> 10:08.830
Alicia!

10:10.280 --> 10:12.710
I want to see where my 
training has brought me,

10:12.710 --> 10:16.220
but my father and brothers insist 
that it is out of the question.

10:16.640 --> 10:17.920
I ask you, is that fair?

10:18.300 --> 10:20.890
You're only ten. And you're a girl.

10:20.890 --> 10:24.740
All three of you had taken the 
test by the time you were my age.

10:24.740 --> 10:26.310
And no rule bars girls from it.

10:26.580 --> 10:28.270
We said no, and that means no!

10:28.520 --> 10:31.980
If you insist on refusing, give 
me a convincing reason why.

10:32.650 --> 10:34.190
That's enough!

10:37.140 --> 10:38.290
I'm sorry...

10:41.870 --> 10:43.670
I will not back down!

10:44.020 --> 10:45.700
I don't agree with this!

10:52.030 --> 10:55.300
<i>That was a pretty villainous 
reaction, wasn't it?</i>

11:05.190 --> 11:07.470
She'll never understand if 
we just keep telling her no.

11:08.670 --> 11:11.160
But we can't just tell her the real reason...

11:13.160 --> 11:14.440
Tell me!

11:15.200 --> 11:16.280
Alicia?!

11:17.170 --> 11:19.490
Stop treating me like a child!

11:20.280 --> 11:23.530
Alicia, you <i>are</i> still a child.

11:23.850 --> 11:28.450
Can't you just let your father 
worry for his beloved daughter?

11:29.370 --> 11:30.370
But...

11:30.470 --> 11:32.250
Then I'll promise you this.

11:32.250 --> 11:37.800
When you turn fifteen and enter 
the Magic Academy, we'll discuss it.

11:38.070 --> 11:39.240
How's that?

11:40.650 --> 11:43.090
Very well. It's a promise.

11:47.790 --> 11:51.980
I know I'm only buying us some time, but...

11:53.900 --> 11:57.660
Her swordsmanship already exceeds 
the capacity of a child.

11:58.220 --> 12:00.190
If I let her take the official test,

12:00.190 --> 12:02.820
she'll draw a lot of attention, 
both good and bad.

12:03.030 --> 12:04.240
Yes, but...

12:04.870 --> 12:09.550
Surely the Five Great Noble Families already 
know about what happened back then.

12:10.510 --> 12:13.200
I don't think we can keep it
 hidden for much longer.

12:13.820 --> 12:17.100
Still... while she's young, at least,

12:17.100 --> 12:19.890
I want her to live as a normal child.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.500
<i>Oh, darn it!</i>

12:22.500 --> 12:24.180
<i>They keep calling me a child!</i>

12:24.180 --> 12:27.010
<i>I know that! A ten-year-old <i>is</i> just a child!</i>

12:27.600 --> 12:29.690
<i>But if I want to be the 
greatest villainess ever,</i>

12:29.690 --> 12:32.180
<i>I can't afford to waste any time.</i>

12:32.760 --> 12:35.340
<i>I'll go talk to Grandpa Will.</i>

12:36.230 --> 12:38.110
<i>Maybe it'll help me sort things out.</i>

12:42.060 --> 12:44.490
<i>This is the first time I've 
visited him during the day.</i>

12:44.800 --> 12:47.070
<i>I wonder if he'll even be at home.</i>

12:47.070 --> 12:48.920
Don't you give me that shit!

12:54.900 --> 12:58.370
<i>So this is the true face of Loana...</i>

13:00.360 --> 13:02.610
<i>I didn't see it when I came at night.</i>

13:04.180 --> 13:06.590
Oh, come on! Done already?!

13:10.680 --> 13:12.380
Hey, he's not moving.

13:12.380 --> 13:14.100
Guess he's dead.

13:14.100 --> 13:15.860
Don't you fall asleep!

13:15.860 --> 13:17.300
Oh, he's gonna die now!

13:16.570 --> 13:17.640
Alicia!

13:18.280 --> 13:19.940
Why did you come here at this hour?!

13:20.130 --> 13:23.090
B-But... that small child is being...

13:24.020 --> 13:25.810
And what exactly do you intend to do?!

13:25.810 --> 13:27.900
You're a child yourself!

13:35.760 --> 13:37.120
Can he be saved?

13:37.570 --> 13:40.460
I doubt he has the strength to pull through.

13:40.460 --> 13:41.820
Oh, no...

13:41.820 --> 13:44.880
This is not a rare occurrence in Loana.

13:45.350 --> 13:47.590
There are no good medicines here.

13:48.490 --> 13:53.720
I gather the children together to 
teach them writing and arithmetic.

13:53.970 --> 13:57.020
This boy, Jill, is an orphan,

13:57.210 --> 13:59.270
and even though he's only six years old,

13:59.270 --> 14:02.740
he possesses an intelligence that 
astonishes even an old man like me.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.860
Had he received a proper education,

14:05.860 --> 14:08.580
he could have grown to be a remarkable man.

14:09.560 --> 14:13.860
But even children born in this 
village-turned-penal colony

14:13.860 --> 14:16.870
are branded as criminals 
for their entire lives.

14:16.870 --> 14:19.750
As much as I hate it, there's 
nothing I can do to change it.

14:20.080 --> 14:21.310
Alicia,

14:21.310 --> 14:23.320
you mustn't blame yourself.

14:24.730 --> 14:26.800
<i>I've wanted for nothing all my life.</i>

14:27.020 --> 14:30.720
<i>I've had the best learning 
environment and a kind family.</i>

14:31.150 --> 14:34.160
<i>Just being born in different places 
creates such disparity between us.</i>

14:34.930 --> 14:37.190
<i>Even living in such blessed circumstances,</i>

14:37.190 --> 14:39.890
<i>I'm still sheltered just 
like any other little girl.</i>

14:40.450 --> 14:41.860
<i>It's so disgraceful.</i>

14:42.390 --> 14:44.220
<i>It's not that I want to help people.</i>

14:44.640 --> 14:46.490
<i>That's not something a villainess does.</i>

14:46.870 --> 14:47.780
<i>But...</i>

14:48.250 --> 14:50.200
<i>I'm sure the heroine would've saved him.</i>

14:51.140 --> 14:55.420
<i>And being unable to do something 
the heroine can do is humiliating.</i>

14:56.700 --> 14:58.960
<i>I can't make excuses about being 
too young or too powerless.</i>

15:00.210 --> 15:02.790
<i>After all, what I want to be is...</i>

15:03.950 --> 15:05.890
Greetings, Mr. Paul!

15:06.830 --> 15:09.260
Would you mind sharing your josia with me?

15:09.510 --> 15:11.200
Do you need an antipyretic?

15:11.600 --> 15:13.430
Is someone sick or injured?

15:13.630 --> 15:16.970
In LoâI mean... um...

15:19.000 --> 15:20.740
Here's your josia.

15:21.040 --> 15:22.940
Dissolve it in water and have them drink it.

15:23.220 --> 15:25.990
Wha... Th-Thank you so much!

15:26.380 --> 15:28.200
Um, how much is it?

15:28.200 --> 15:29.220
Don't worry.

15:29.860 --> 15:31.860
It's on the house today.

15:32.190 --> 15:36.290
In return, just continue to 
patronize this shop, okay?

15:36.560 --> 15:39.020
I will! Thank you very much!

15:41.460 --> 15:43.830
This hasn't healed his wounds,

15:43.830 --> 15:46.070
but it will keep him alive.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.760
Thank you, Alicia.

15:48.640 --> 15:50.050
Grandpa Will...

15:50.570 --> 15:52.260
I am powerless.

15:52.570 --> 15:56.680
I thought I was doing all I could to 
become the greatest villainess ever.

15:56.900 --> 16:00.660
But if I can't take action when 
it counts, there's no point.

16:01.090 --> 16:03.870
From now on, I'll dedicate 
all I have to my studies,

16:03.870 --> 16:07.530
and work even harder to be a 
villainess who goes down in history!

16:08.430 --> 16:09.680
<i>A villainess...?</i>

16:10.570 --> 16:13.430
Today, I'm going to find a grimoire.

16:13.960 --> 16:17.270
Mastering my magic will make 
me the greatest villainess!

16:20.120 --> 16:20.910
Huh?

16:22.680 --> 16:24.830
Was this section here before?

16:27.040 --> 16:28.120
This is...

16:29.040 --> 16:30.540
A book of magic!

16:31.140 --> 16:32.680
This whole section...

16:33.210 --> 16:35.370
is nothing but grimoires!

16:35.370 --> 16:37.640
I can't believe I missed it before!

16:37.900 --> 16:41.060
All right, time to race up the 
stairway to villainess-hood!

16:44.270 --> 16:46.460
<i>Magic has different levels.</i>

16:46.850 --> 16:50.740
<i>Levels 50 and up require the mana 
of the Five Great Noble Families.</i>

16:50.740 --> 16:53.320
<i>The highest recorded level is 100,</i>

16:53.770 --> 16:58.870
<i>but in one part of the game, the heroine 
and Prince Duke exceed level 100.</i>

16:59.570 --> 17:04.380
<i>As the villainess, I might be designed 
to always fall short of the heroine.</i>

17:04.660 --> 17:08.250
<i>But that's no reason not to work hard.</i>

17:08.980 --> 17:10.870
<i>I won't know until I try!</i>

17:13.780 --> 17:17.050
I'll start with Level 1 magic 
to make an object float.

17:17.290 --> 17:19.660
Focus on the mana within my body

17:19.660 --> 17:21.350
and gather it in my fingertips.

17:21.810 --> 17:24.430
<i>It seems a bit abstract since 
there's no incantation.</i>

17:25.560 --> 17:26.740
<i>Float!</i>

17:30.320 --> 17:31.530
It's floating!

17:32.450 --> 17:35.040
I really used magic!

17:35.040 --> 17:36.340
This is great!

17:38.160 --> 17:41.280
L-Looks like I need more 
practice to master it.

17:41.690 --> 17:43.750
All right! I'm getting fired up now!

17:43.750 --> 17:46.260
I'm gonna keep learning more and more!

17:46.690 --> 17:48.570
<b>A Few Days Later</b>

17:46.690 --> 17:48.570
<b>A Few Days Later</b>

18:00.270 --> 18:01.760
I did it!

18:01.760 --> 18:04.560
Level 5 magic: moving objects around!

18:04.930 --> 18:08.770
If I can move all these, I think 
it's safe to say I've mastered it!

18:11.380 --> 18:14.210
<i>I think all the sleep I gave up 
to practice is getting to me.</i>

18:14.530 --> 18:16.160
<i>I feel so heavy.</i>

18:16.160 --> 18:18.200
<i>And this headache just won't go away.</i>

18:18.450 --> 18:20.560
I must not have enough stamina.

18:21.010 --> 18:23.120
Maybe I should do more physical training.

18:24.690 --> 18:28.250
<i>I'll take a five-minute break 
before starting on the next level.</i>

18:28.250 --> 18:29.920
Alicia!

18:30.670 --> 18:33.030
The king is here to see me?

18:33.450 --> 18:35.840
Yes. I know this came out of nowhere,

18:35.840 --> 18:38.000
but he says he wants to talk to you.

18:36.460 --> 18:39.440
<i>My first villainess trial in two years!</i>

18:38.410 --> 18:39.970
But you're just a child...

18:40.140 --> 18:42.890
Why do you wish to see Alicia?

18:43.240 --> 18:45.840
I want to hear her stories 
again. It's been so long.

18:46.400 --> 18:47.690
Is that all?

18:47.840 --> 18:52.110
You accompanied me because
 you doubt, did you not?

18:54.400 --> 18:58.570
It is an honor to see 
you again, Your Majesty.

18:58.830 --> 19:01.740
Ah, Alicia. You seem well.

19:02.330 --> 19:04.610
<i>The heads of the Five Great 
Noble Families together...</i>

19:04.900 --> 19:07.130
<i>Am I already so well-known as a villainess?</i>

19:07.680 --> 19:09.460
Let's get right to the point, Alicia.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.580
Do you love this kingdom?

19:12.690 --> 19:14.000
<i>What does that mean?</i>

19:14.310 --> 19:17.210
<i>I can never understand what's 
behind the king's questions...</i>

19:17.440 --> 19:19.350
Let me phrase that a different way.

19:19.350 --> 19:22.140
What do you think of the 
way this kingdom operates?

19:22.410 --> 19:25.950
<i>What would be the right answer 
for a villainess to give?</i>

19:29.060 --> 19:31.770
I despise its systematic, 
preferential treatment of nobles.

19:33.230 --> 19:34.940
You despise it, eh?

19:35.130 --> 19:37.350
Yes, I absolutely detest it.

19:37.350 --> 19:40.610
After all, merely 
proclaiming oneself a noble

19:40.610 --> 19:43.870
places even the most incompetent 
individuals at the top, does it not?

19:43.870 --> 19:46.290
Are you insulting us?!

19:46.410 --> 19:48.660
It matters not. Continue.

19:48.660 --> 19:49.710
Your Majesty!

19:49.880 --> 19:51.280
Forgive me.

19:51.280 --> 19:53.630
I did not mean to say this 
is true of all nobles.

19:53.800 --> 19:57.490
But to be a noble, one only 
needs to possess mana.

19:57.490 --> 20:00.090
Mana and political prowess are 
two very different things.

20:00.580 --> 20:02.840
No matter how talented they are,

20:02.840 --> 20:05.420
commoners are never even 
granted any opportunities.

20:05.700 --> 20:10.100
Just how much talent is going to waste 
in this magic-based class system?

20:11.010 --> 20:14.690
It's so foolish, it gives me a headache.

20:16.230 --> 20:18.710
That is enough! Watch your tongue!

20:18.710 --> 20:20.440
Now, no need to shout.

20:20.710 --> 20:23.070
She's just a young girl.

20:23.280 --> 20:26.140
<i>I do wish you'd keep your voices down.</i>

20:26.140 --> 20:28.700
<i>The part about the headache was true.</i>

20:30.510 --> 20:32.820
Father, we should...

20:32.820 --> 20:36.590
Then let me ask one final question, Alicia.

20:36.880 --> 20:40.210
Do you understand that what you 
said applies to you, as well?

20:40.780 --> 20:44.030
Or would you not mind being ousted from your 
place in the Five Great Noble Families?

20:44.030 --> 20:45.970
Yes, of course I'm aware.

20:47.450 --> 20:50.430
I was born into this family 
through good fortune alone.

20:50.430 --> 20:55.580
To want my status guaranteed at the 
expense of more talented individuals

20:55.580 --> 20:57.440
would be most uncouth.

20:57.440 --> 20:59.860
You truly are an unusual child.

21:02.760 --> 21:04.500
<i>It's finally over...</i>

21:05.260 --> 21:08.890
<i>I don't know if I gave the 
right answers for a villainess.</i>

21:09.410 --> 21:12.070
<i>I need to get some rest for today...</i>

21:16.690 --> 21:17.750
Alicia?!

21:18.270 --> 21:19.290
Alicia!

21:20.250 --> 21:22.210
<i>Prince... Duke?</i>

21:20.250 --> 21:22.210
She has a fever!

21:23.810 --> 21:24.840
Duke...

21:25.530 --> 21:26.530
Ali?!

21:26.530 --> 21:27.960
She just collapsed.

21:27.960 --> 21:30.100
She's been unwell this whole time.

21:31.170 --> 21:33.220
L-Let's get her to her room for now.

21:34.600 --> 21:35.840
I'll carry her.

21:43.680 --> 21:45.650
Prince... Duke?

21:45.650 --> 21:46.730
Alicia!

21:48.100 --> 21:49.410
Have you come to?

21:49.820 --> 21:51.830
If you're awake, take this medicine.

21:52.670 --> 21:53.660
Can you drink this?

21:55.780 --> 21:58.380
Alicia, please take the medicine.

21:58.690 --> 21:59.630
I'm begging you.

22:02.160 --> 22:03.050
Forgive me.

22:03.050 --> 22:05.050
