WEBVTT

00:04.630 --> 00:06.550
Who are you?

00:08.340 --> 00:10.770
Gill, is this a friend of yours?

00:10.770 --> 00:13.150
What are you talking about, Duke?

00:13.150 --> 00:14.560
This is Alicia!

00:14.560 --> 00:15.960
Alicia?

00:16.420 --> 00:18.230
Never heard that name before.

00:23.370 --> 00:26.150
<i>Prince Duke... What in the world...?</i>

00:34.760 --> 00:41.770
I'll Become a <b>Villainess</b>
Who Goes Down in History

01:57.050 --> 02:02.010
<b>The Villainess and the Prince</b>

02:03.270 --> 02:06.770
It's been a long time since 
we had tea with you, Alicia.

02:06.770 --> 02:08.400
Yes, it has.

02:08.400 --> 02:11.270
Duke usually keeps you 
to himself, after all.

02:11.610 --> 02:13.940
Did something happen between you two?

02:15.720 --> 02:19.480
Did you and Alicia have some 
kind of lovers' quarrel?

02:19.760 --> 02:22.900
Alicia? Who's that?

02:22.900 --> 02:23.940
Huh?!

02:23.940 --> 02:25.840
What are you talking about?

02:25.840 --> 02:29.470
That's my line. Who are you talking about?

02:29.470 --> 02:32.500
Wait, wait, wait! What 
happened to you, Duke?

02:32.500 --> 02:34.450
Why don't you remember Alicia?

02:34.450 --> 02:39.540
It's not appropriate to talk about 
people you don't know during tea.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.920
Ali, what's going on?

02:45.150 --> 02:46.880
I'm not really sure,

02:47.180 --> 02:51.810
but it seems like Duke has 
forgotten who she is.

02:52.340 --> 02:54.100
What could have happened?

02:54.830 --> 02:56.990
But you know, I'd forgotten, too...

02:57.980 --> 03:00.900
how icy Duke's eyes could be.

03:04.980 --> 03:06.880
What is this about?!

03:06.880 --> 03:09.230
Alicia has to report to 
the castle to stand trial?!

03:09.230 --> 03:14.530
Why should Alicia be under suspicion 
because Duke forgot her?!

03:14.820 --> 03:17.020
I have no idea either,

03:17.020 --> 03:21.720
but those were the words of 
His Highness Duke himself.

03:21.720 --> 03:23.760
Why would Duke do this?

03:24.040 --> 03:27.050
I understand. I'll go to the castle.

03:27.050 --> 03:28.200
Alicia!

03:28.550 --> 03:32.200
I'll prove my innocence myself.

03:34.030 --> 03:35.760
It's going to be rough.

03:36.040 --> 03:36.820
I know.

03:38.840 --> 03:40.520
I'll go with you.

03:41.130 --> 03:43.220
I'll speak to His Majesty in person.

03:54.270 --> 03:56.480
This way, Miss Williams.

03:56.480 --> 03:58.150
His Majesty awaits.

03:58.150 --> 03:59.500
Alicia...

03:59.500 --> 04:01.900
It's all right, Father.

04:04.700 --> 04:08.860
<i>Having so much going on has 
actually calmed me down.</i>

04:09.350 --> 04:15.090
<i>Who benefits from setting a trap 
like this and throwing me into it?</i>

04:15.650 --> 04:19.940
<i>And involving Prince Duke, 
the next king, in all this...</i>

04:20.260 --> 04:21.230
Arnold...

04:21.230 --> 04:23.950
<i>This isn't something Liz 
or her followers could do.</i>

04:24.960 --> 04:29.120
<i>It's too elaborate to be 
someone just bullying me.</i>

04:29.490 --> 04:31.840
<i>I'll face capital punishment at this rate.</i>

04:32.280 --> 04:34.250
<i>I won't be allowed to exist in this kingdom.</i>

04:35.010 --> 04:37.830
<i>But you know what? Too bad for you.</i>

04:38.210 --> 04:42.170
<i>Being exiled from this kingdom 
is just what I want!</i>

04:44.060 --> 04:48.380
I bet whoever set this trap for me

04:48.380 --> 04:52.490
had no idea that I actually 
wanted to be exiled.

04:56.680 --> 05:00.030
We've been waiting for you, Alicia Williams.

05:00.430 --> 05:03.160
With His Highness Duke present as witness,

05:03.160 --> 05:05.360
we will now begin your trial.

05:05.770 --> 05:08.230
Answer all questions honestly.

05:08.230 --> 05:09.000
I will.

05:09.350 --> 05:11.770
Still, even though this is my chance,

05:11.770 --> 05:15.080
it bugs me to just play into 
the hands of whoever did this.

05:15.310 --> 05:21.370
You are under suspicion of casting 
memory-erasing magic on Prince Duke.

05:21.370 --> 05:22.870
Oh, I get it.

05:22.870 --> 05:27.290
It's magic. That's why he only forgot me.

05:27.290 --> 05:29.130
Wait, magic?

05:29.360 --> 05:30.800
We have evidence.

05:31.020 --> 05:31.760
Mel.

05:32.780 --> 05:34.320
<i>Why Mel?</i>

05:34.320 --> 05:35.810
My research revealed

05:36.130 --> 05:41.310
that there is high-level dark magic 
that can control people's minds,

05:41.310 --> 05:46.030
and that Alicia Williams is 
the only one who has reached

05:46.030 --> 05:48.780
a level high enough to use it.

05:49.570 --> 05:51.450
It is also known

05:51.780 --> 05:56.590
that she was with Prince Duke 
at the castle last night.

05:57.120 --> 06:01.170
I believe that is when she cast the spell.

06:01.170 --> 06:03.680
This question is for you, Alicia Williams.

06:03.990 --> 06:08.080
What were you doing with 
the prince last night?

06:08.080 --> 06:10.000
I can't tell him about that!

06:10.470 --> 06:15.520
Grandpa Will's situation is to be kept secret 
until the king makes an announcement!

06:16.030 --> 06:18.560
<i>I know Mel is aware of that.</i>

06:18.870 --> 06:20.190
<i>So, why...</i>

06:27.800 --> 06:30.540
<i>Oh. I get it.</i>

06:30.810 --> 06:33.150
It would seem you have no excuses to give.

06:33.520 --> 06:36.150
Go ahead and exile me from this kingdom.

06:37.060 --> 06:42.450
I can tell that you desperately 
want to make me the villain here.

06:42.730 --> 06:45.190
If you are so suspicious of me,

06:45.190 --> 06:47.580
go ahead and punish me as you see fit.

06:47.880 --> 06:49.840
Watch your tongue!

06:49.840 --> 06:52.690
Do you have any idea what you're saying?

06:52.690 --> 06:53.510
I do.

06:55.840 --> 06:57.520
What's this about?

06:57.520 --> 06:59.500
I'm returning that.

07:00.070 --> 07:02.700
Good day to you, Prince Duke.

07:03.140 --> 07:05.280
I am deeply grateful to you.

07:07.940 --> 07:10.060
Alicia Williams,

07:10.340 --> 07:13.030
you are hereby exiled from this kingdom.

07:13.990 --> 07:19.000
I'll Become a <b>Villainess
</b>Who Goes Down in History

07:14.000 --> 07:15.930
<i>It's the last one, huh?</i>

07:15.930 --> 07:18.710
<i>Isn't it too soon for that? 
Like, </i>way<i> too soon?!</i>

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
I'll Become a <b>Villainess
</b>Who Goes Down in History

07:20.470 --> 07:22.470
<i>I want to see more of the story...</i>

07:22.470 --> 07:24.000
<i>Like, </i>really<i> want to!</i>

07:24.980 --> 07:26.460
Did you hear?

07:26.460 --> 07:27.660
Of course I did!

07:27.660 --> 07:30.050
She's being exiled!

07:30.500 --> 07:34.060
I knew she'd do something 
terrible sooner or later.

07:34.610 --> 07:37.170
It'll be a relief to have her gone.

07:39.050 --> 07:44.480
I know Miss Alicia wouldn't hurt 
anyone without a good reason.

07:44.480 --> 07:45.370
True.

07:46.220 --> 07:50.020
But she's good at keeping 
her true intentions hidden.

07:53.750 --> 07:56.840
So even though Ali's been exiled,

07:56.840 --> 07:59.610
the Williams family isn't being punished.

07:59.610 --> 08:00.510
Yeah.

08:00.820 --> 08:03.930
Considering all the Williams 
family's achievements thus far,

08:03.930 --> 08:07.110
they're having her bear all 
the responsibility herself.

08:07.730 --> 08:10.640
Should we consider that generous?

08:10.640 --> 08:13.970
I get why Albert and his brothers 
haven't come to school,

08:14.330 --> 08:16.790
but Liz has been absent 
this whole time, too.

08:16.790 --> 08:18.000
Did something happen?

08:18.000 --> 08:19.510
A lot of things.

08:19.960 --> 08:22.510
Duke hasn't been coming to school, either.

08:22.510 --> 08:25.440
I heard that's because of 
the liberation of Roana.

08:25.440 --> 08:26.450
Yeah.

08:26.840 --> 08:30.010
Removing the barrier surrounding the village

08:30.010 --> 08:32.870
requires very high level water magic.

08:33.270 --> 08:36.200
Duke is the only one capable of that,

08:36.200 --> 08:38.980
so he's probably fine-tuning 
his mana right now.

08:39.290 --> 08:41.740
Duke's memories being erased,

08:41.740 --> 08:44.300
Alicia being exiled,

08:44.300 --> 08:46.220
Liz going into hiding,

08:46.220 --> 08:48.820
the liberation of Roana...

08:48.820 --> 08:51.000
So much is going on,

08:51.260 --> 08:54.290
I'm worried we might be missing something.

08:56.790 --> 08:58.970
So that's what happened to Alicia?

08:59.300 --> 09:03.280
Isn't there some kind of 
plant that boosts mana?

09:03.280 --> 09:07.370
Huh? Well... no, there really isn't.

09:07.370 --> 09:08.440
Why?

09:08.750 --> 09:11.600
I feel bad now.

09:12.040 --> 09:14.540
If I had boosted my mana a little more,

09:14.540 --> 09:17.080
I wouldn't have fallen under Liz's spell,

09:17.440 --> 09:21.110
and I could have faced both 
Liz and Alicia properly.

09:22.070 --> 09:24.880
There's no plant that increases one's mana,

09:24.880 --> 09:28.290
but flowers have the 
ability to soothe hearts.

09:29.020 --> 09:32.340
If you feel bad, why not apologize to her?

09:32.980 --> 09:33.960
Yeah.

09:35.150 --> 09:36.180
What?

09:36.610 --> 09:40.270
Why does Alicia have to be 
exiled from the kingdom?

09:40.680 --> 09:45.310
We've made so much progress toward 
setting Roana free because of her.

09:45.310 --> 09:50.220
Why does she have to be exiled 
the very day of its liberation?

09:50.220 --> 09:53.280
I don't understand any of it, either.

09:53.550 --> 09:57.170
I asked her to at least take me with her,

09:57.170 --> 09:58.830
but she refused.

09:59.300 --> 10:00.450
Gill...

10:00.450 --> 10:03.230
Grandpa Will, can't we 
do anything about this?

10:03.230 --> 10:07.100
It was the prince's decision. 
We can't overturn it.

10:07.990 --> 10:12.050
But that fact itself makes other things clear.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.590
Liz?

10:17.590 --> 10:19.390
What are you doing here?

10:19.390 --> 10:21.390
You know perfectly well what.

10:21.390 --> 10:26.710
I can't bear to see my rival walking 
into a trap without even resisting!

10:29.160 --> 10:32.040
I was shocked when Eric 
told me about it today.

10:32.310 --> 10:37.180
Ever since that day, I've been practicing 
how to control my Charm magic.

10:37.490 --> 10:42.070
And while I'm in the middle of that, you 
get exiled? What's the meaning of this?!

10:42.580 --> 10:46.880
Just wait! I'll find the one who did this!

10:46.880 --> 10:49.790
I won't let anyone get away 
with casting a spell on Duke!

10:49.790 --> 10:53.380
I've mastered Charm magic now, 
so making someone confess is—

10:53.380 --> 10:55.750
Liz, please calm down.

10:55.750 --> 10:57.800
I know who's behind all this.

10:57.800 --> 10:59.930
Who?! Who is it?!

11:00.770 --> 11:02.190
Prince Duke.

11:02.190 --> 11:03.130
Huh?

11:04.850 --> 11:06.760
What?!

11:08.530 --> 11:09.940
Grandpa Will...

11:09.940 --> 11:12.490
What does that mean?

11:12.490 --> 11:14.610
Just think about it, and you'll understand.

11:14.610 --> 11:19.400
It's not even possible for anyone 
to cast a spell on Prince Duke.

11:19.400 --> 11:21.570
Huh? Oh!

11:21.810 --> 11:26.230
Duke has the greatest magical capacity 
of anyone in the kingdom right now.

11:26.620 --> 11:30.950
There's no one capable of casting a spell 
on him that could give him amnesia.

11:31.390 --> 11:36.510
In other words, Duke is just 
pretending he's lost his memories.

11:36.510 --> 11:38.750
Wh-Why would he do that?

11:38.750 --> 11:41.480
So he could exile me, probably.

11:41.480 --> 11:43.190
But why?!

11:43.500 --> 11:48.710
I think he realized that I wanted 
to be sent away from this kingdom.

11:49.080 --> 11:53.690
My nephew has always been soft on Alicia.

11:54.130 --> 11:57.190
Even the very first time she came to Roana,

11:57.190 --> 12:01.870
he came to me in advance and 
asked me to keep her safe.

12:01.870 --> 12:06.360
He's clearing the path that 
Alicia wants to follow.

12:06.360 --> 12:08.780
That's why he's doing what he's doing.

12:09.230 --> 12:14.290
He certainly did drag a lot of 
people into it this time, though.

12:14.290 --> 12:16.710
Does Alicia know that?

12:16.950 --> 12:18.880
I'm sure she's caught on,

12:18.880 --> 12:22.660
though she might not fully understand it.

12:23.250 --> 12:27.080
I have nothing but gratitude 
for Prince Duke.

12:27.480 --> 12:31.010
When I get to Laval, I can figure 
out why that wolf came here.

12:31.010 --> 12:32.980
Wait, wait, wait!

12:32.980 --> 12:36.680
So, you're saying Duke exiled 
you from this kingdom

12:36.680 --> 12:38.660
out of love for you?

12:40.610 --> 12:45.270
Alicia, Duke confessed his feelings 
for you recently, didn't he?

12:45.270 --> 12:47.040
Did you answer him?

12:47.040 --> 12:48.120
I...

12:48.120 --> 12:50.540
Why do you run away from his love?

12:50.540 --> 12:52.200
I'm not running away!

12:52.200 --> 12:55.910
Being loved is such a 
nice feeling, isn't it?

12:55.910 --> 12:58.380
I'm sure it's easier to 
keep your answer vague.

12:58.760 --> 13:00.900
I know because I took it for granted, too.

13:01.300 --> 13:04.720
But taking his feelings for 
granted is hurting him.

13:05.280 --> 13:07.640
No matter how long he says he'll wait,

13:07.640 --> 13:12.740
withholding a clear answer when he 
loves you enough to exile you...

13:13.390 --> 13:16.560
Only a villainess would do that!

13:16.960 --> 13:18.060
A villainess?

13:18.900 --> 13:23.180
<i>What Liz is talking about isn't 
the kind of villainess I want to be.</i>

13:28.890 --> 13:32.360
Yes, as you've all said,

13:32.360 --> 13:36.990
this was Prince Duke's idea, 
but the king knows about it.

13:36.990 --> 13:38.750
Even the king knows?!

13:39.180 --> 13:43.960
The state of affairs in Laval has 
always been a concern for him,

13:44.250 --> 13:46.730
but choosing someone to deal 
with it was difficult.

13:47.130 --> 13:49.390
It would mean being exiled from here.

13:49.390 --> 13:52.290
But still, why Alicia?

13:52.290 --> 13:53.930
Precisely because she's Alicia.

13:53.930 --> 13:54.560
Huh?

13:54.950 --> 13:56.100
Where is Alicia?

13:56.460 --> 13:58.010
With Gill.

13:59.490 --> 14:01.690
Would you give this to Prince Duke for me?

14:02.100 --> 14:03.190
What is it?

14:03.190 --> 14:08.300
A letter to thank him and tell him 
that I can't return his feelings.

14:08.780 --> 14:10.700
You're shooting him down?!

14:10.700 --> 14:13.460
But he granted your wish for you!

14:13.460 --> 14:15.690
Yes, and I'm grateful.

14:15.690 --> 14:19.600
But I want to make my dream come true.

14:19.950 --> 14:23.700
<i>And these feelings stand 
in the way of that.</i>

14:28.790 --> 14:31.470
So I have to get rid of them.

14:31.470 --> 14:32.830
Are you getting rid of me, too?

14:33.730 --> 14:37.800
You don't need me in order to 
make your dream come true?

14:37.800 --> 14:39.390
I'll work harder!

14:39.670 --> 14:41.570
Please don't leave me alone!

14:42.250 --> 14:44.610
Gill, don't worry.

14:45.010 --> 14:48.060
We're both working toward the same place.

14:48.310 --> 14:50.790
So I know we'll meet again.

14:51.650 --> 14:53.440
The same place?

14:53.750 --> 14:54.870
The top!

14:56.950 --> 14:58.050
Okay.

14:58.550 --> 15:01.740
I'll show everyone that commoners 
are just as good as nobles!

15:01.740 --> 15:03.400
That's the spirit!

15:03.400 --> 15:07.190
I know you'll be on the path I need to take.

15:07.190 --> 15:08.920
Yeah! Wait for me!

15:09.130 --> 15:12.330
And keep an eye on Liz, too.

15:12.330 --> 15:16.340
I'm taking a break as her 
watcher, but I'm still worried.

15:16.340 --> 15:17.190
Okay.

15:17.800 --> 15:21.610
I'll make her worthy of being your rival.

15:21.610 --> 15:23.760
Well, I look forward to that!

15:23.760 --> 15:26.450
So make sure you come back alive.

15:27.080 --> 15:27.920
I will.

15:46.210 --> 15:48.320
You don't need to be bound under my watch.

15:48.320 --> 15:49.910
Huh? But...

15:50.250 --> 15:55.270
His Highness has ordered me to 
transport you with utmost care.

15:55.270 --> 15:56.350
I see.

16:00.010 --> 16:01.240
I'll begin now.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.770
Alicia, there's still time.

16:09.770 --> 16:11.840
You don't have to go to Laval.

16:12.190 --> 16:16.210
You can hide in some quiet 
corner of our domain.

16:16.480 --> 16:19.380
I'm sorry for causing you such concern.

16:20.010 --> 16:22.760
But this is who I am.

16:26.460 --> 16:30.430
I know you'll be fine. Your 
mother believes in you.

16:31.120 --> 16:34.270
Thank you, Mother.

16:43.370 --> 16:44.640
The fog...

16:46.530 --> 16:48.200
Look! The sky!

17:04.630 --> 17:06.490
So this is sunlight...

17:06.490 --> 17:08.720
Roana is free.

17:10.670 --> 17:12.080
Hey, Prince!

17:12.080 --> 17:14.920
Forget about us! Shouldn't 
you go to Alicia?!

17:23.280 --> 17:25.050
We're almost at the border.

17:25.510 --> 17:28.430
<i>I wonder if Roana is free yet.</i>

17:35.230 --> 17:36.780
What happened?

17:37.620 --> 17:38.360
Du—

17:42.710 --> 17:44.280
You're...

17:44.490 --> 17:46.270
My name is Liz.

17:46.270 --> 17:50.210
I can use water magic, 
so I helped the prince.

17:50.210 --> 17:52.620
What? Where's the prince, then?

17:52.620 --> 17:55.380
He took off instantly with 
teleportation magic.

17:55.640 --> 18:00.560
I wanted to see her one last time, 
too, but he told me to hold it in!

18:00.910 --> 18:03.760
He fulfilled his duty as prince.

18:03.760 --> 18:07.400
For a man in love, he endured well.

18:07.400 --> 18:08.700
Brother.

18:09.250 --> 18:10.480
Luke...

18:17.060 --> 18:19.600
Alicia, I'm sorry.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.940
This was the only way I could 
think of to get you to Laval.

18:25.940 --> 18:26.780
But...

18:27.360 --> 18:31.550
there will never come a day 
when I forget about you.

18:33.630 --> 18:35.830
<i>I've been chasing my dream all this time.</i>

18:36.660 --> 18:39.200
<i>I poured all my time into it.</i>

18:39.890 --> 18:43.100
<i>If I hadn't, my dream would never come true.</i>

18:43.940 --> 18:47.210
<i>So I don't have time for love right now.</i>

18:47.550 --> 18:50.930
<i>No one can survive on love 
or romance alone, anyway.</i>

18:51.390 --> 18:54.130
<i>Still... it's just too unfair,</i>

18:54.950 --> 19:00.130
<i>using force to teach me that no one survives 
on dreams and ambitions alone, either.</i>

19:00.830 --> 19:02.060
Alicia?

19:02.700 --> 19:05.300
You don't need to apologize.

19:05.300 --> 19:08.490
You've given me the gift 
of a prince's favor.

19:12.890 --> 19:16.100
Wait for me. The next time we meet,

19:16.520 --> 19:20.920
I'll be a villainess capable 
of charming you even more.

19:21.640 --> 19:24.140
Why only Alicia?

19:24.380 --> 19:27.300
That is her fate.

19:28.440 --> 19:29.680
It can't be...

19:29.960 --> 19:32.900
The one that governs this kingdom's fate?!

19:32.900 --> 19:36.800
It bloomed for just one night 
when Alicia was seven,

19:37.600 --> 19:40.370
and I took care to preserve it.

19:40.370 --> 19:44.840
She has matured drastically since then.

19:44.840 --> 19:47.020
Don't you think it must be fate?

19:47.670 --> 19:50.690
Why didn't you tell me about this before?!

19:50.690 --> 19:55.210
If you knew, would you have been able 
to support her without restraint?

19:55.210 --> 19:57.580
Er... well, I...

19:57.840 --> 20:00.230
If all I could do was cheer her on,

20:00.230 --> 20:04.630
I felt the least I could 
do was respect her wishes.

20:12.350 --> 20:14.400
I swear I'll come for you.

20:14.400 --> 20:16.300
Can you hold out until then?

20:16.300 --> 20:17.850
This is me you're talking to.

20:18.790 --> 20:20.270
Good point.

20:22.810 --> 20:25.870
This will be my first 
letter from you, right?

20:25.870 --> 20:27.330
I'm going to frame it.

20:27.330 --> 20:31.920
No, no! Just throw it away 
after Gill gives it to you!

20:32.140 --> 20:33.360
Nope.

20:37.180 --> 20:39.630
Beyond here is the nation of Laval.

20:39.920 --> 20:41.310
Be careful.

20:41.310 --> 20:46.550
<i>Come to think of it, Alicia 
gets exiled in her true route.</i>

20:46.900 --> 20:49.970
<i>So in a way, this is still 
following the script?</i>

20:58.000 --> 20:59.100
<i>Still...</i>

20:59.390 --> 21:01.750
<i>I'll take on any hardships 
that may await me.</i>

21:08.990 --> 21:11.050
If you wait for me like a good boy,

21:11.050 --> 21:13.580
you might just get a reward.

21:14.830 --> 21:16.550
You're such an evil woman.

21:16.550 --> 21:19.830
Oh, you didn't realize?

21:22.810 --> 21:24.250
After all, I'm going to be...

21:25.050 --> 21:27.300
a villainess who goes down in history!

22:05.840 --> 22:10.010
I'll Become a <b>Villainess</b> Who Goes Down in History
