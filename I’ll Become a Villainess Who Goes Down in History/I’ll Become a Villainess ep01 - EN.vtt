00:02.480 --> 00:06.480
Kindness and compassion are 
the most important things?

00:06.520 --> 00:10.360
The most important thing is discipline.

00:10.400 --> 00:15.450
What more is there to say to
a commoner who fails to uphold that?

00:16.780 --> 00:20.240
Alicia
The most important thing is discipline. What more is there to say to a commoner who fails to uphold that?

00:17.570 --> 00:19.280
<b>This is Alicia.</b>

00:20.240 --> 00:23.710
Alicia 
I've had enough of your lip service.

00:20.290 --> 00:23.330
<b>She's the villainess in 
my favorite otome game.</b>

00:24.040 --> 00:26.380
<b>She's an evil girl who torments the heroine,</b>

00:26.710 --> 00:30.630
<b>but I admired her fortitude</b>

00:30.630 --> 00:32.970
<b>and sympathized with her 
ruthless verbal abuse.</b>

00:33.970 --> 00:37.890
<b>I just can't bring myself to 
like the heroine, after all.</b>

00:38.760 --> 00:41.930
<b>The Magic Academy is for nobles only, 
but they made an exception for her,</b>

00:41.930 --> 00:43.390
<b>even though she's a commoner.</b>

00:44.270 --> 00:46.730
<b>She's a goody-two-shoes who's 
always spouting lip service.</b>

00:47.190 --> 00:49.690
<b>She uses her innocent, angelic smile</b>

00:50.820 --> 00:53.320
<b>to toy with the prince's emotions.</b>

00:54.740 --> 00:59.200
<b>My friends all say they'd want to be the 
heroine so everyone would love them,</b>

00:59.530 --> 01:03.580
<b>but personally, if I could be reborn,</b>

01:01.790 --> 01:03.750
I've had enough of your lip service.

01:03.580 --> 01:06.670
<b>I'd much rather be the villainess!</b>

01:03.790 --> 01:05.710
Everyone knows hard work is never rewarded.

01:05.750 --> 01:09.790
Hard work only gives you 
a little more confidence.

01:11.500 --> 01:16.090
<b><i>And... I just now remembered 
having those thoughts.</i></b>

01:16.880 --> 01:20.010
<b><i>My name is Alicia, and I'm seven years old.</i></b>

01:25.020 --> 01:28.270
<b><i>I'm the eldest daughter of the 
high-ranking Williams family.</i></b>

01:28.270 --> 01:32.650
<b><i>My kind brothers are the 
conquerable routes in the game.</i></b>

01:33.280 --> 01:36.360
<b><i>Up until yesterday, I didn't even question it,</i></b>

01:34.900 --> 01:39.660
Albert 
It's a big school, after all. Don't worry.
I'll show you the way to the building.

01:36.360 --> 01:39.660
<b><i>but this is definitely 
the world of that game.</i></b>

01:40.660 --> 01:42.450
<b><i>So in other words...</i></b>

01:42.790 --> 01:45.830
<b>I've reincarnated as the villainess!</b>

01:46.410 --> 01:49.040
<b><i>I can't pass up this opportunity!</i></b>

01:49.040 --> 01:52.380
<b><i>I'll work hard to be the greatest 
villainess in the world—</i></b>

01:52.380 --> 01:56.300
<b><i>no, I'll become a villainess 
who goes down in history!</i></b>

01:56.300 --> 01:57.050


03:27.010 --> 03:31.980
The Villainess and Working Out

03:34.230 --> 03:36.900
<b>It was blooming just last night...</b>

03:36.900 --> 03:39.820
<b>No matter. My healing magic can—</b>

03:40.530 --> 03:43.360
<b>Good morning, Mother, Rose!</b>

03:43.360 --> 03:45.660
<b>G-Good morning...</b>

03:47.990 --> 03:50.040
<b>She's actually up early?</b>

03:50.040 --> 03:52.790
<b>She even greeted us...</b>

03:55.040 --> 03:58.460
<b><i>Farewell to the undisciplined 
child I was yesterday!</i></b>

03:58.840 --> 04:02.880
<b><i>I can't waste time if I want to be a 
villainess who goes down in history!</i></b>

04:03.680 --> 04:05.180
<b><i>And the first step is...</i></b>

04:12.270 --> 04:14.100
<b>Brother Albert!</b>

04:15.770 --> 04:19.190
<b>Ali? It's unusual to see you up so early.</b>

04:19.190 --> 04:21.860
<b>Please teach me how to use a sword, too!</b>

04:21.860 --> 04:22.610
<b>Huh?</b>

04:23.400 --> 04:25.410
<b>What brought this on?</b>

04:25.410 --> 04:27.030
<b>I want to get stronger!</b>

04:27.030 --> 04:28.490
<b>Liar.</b>

04:29.030 --> 04:31.580
<b>It's just a whim, 
like everything else you ask for.</b>

04:31.580 --> 04:34.210
<b>It is not, Brother Henry!</b>

04:34.210 --> 04:36.000
<b>You're still Alicia, after all.</b>

04:36.000 --> 04:37.880
<b>Not you too, Brother Alan!</b>

04:38.590 --> 04:40.130
<b>Now, now...</b>

04:40.710 --> 04:42.840
<b>I'll teach you. But...</b>

04:42.840 --> 04:45.800
<b>You need to build up strength 
in order to wield a sword.</b>

04:46.180 --> 04:48.100
<b>You'll do 100 sit-ups a day,</b>

04:48.100 --> 04:50.010
<b>as well as 50 push-ups.</b>

04:50.470 --> 04:52.600
<b>When you can keep that up 
for a week, I'll teach you.</b>

04:52.980 --> 04:53.980
<b>Okay!</b>

04:54.390 --> 04:56.770
<b>I doubt you'll be able to, though.</b>

04:57.730 --> 04:59.900
<b>Please don't make light of me!</b>

05:00.520 --> 05:03.400
<b>Look forward to next week!</b>

05:10.910 --> 05:13.410
<b><i>I'll do my strength 
training in the evening...</i></b>

05:13.410 --> 05:15.910
<b><i>and start by studying magic.</i></b>

05:16.330 --> 05:19.290
<b><i>Magic exists in this world.</i></b>

05:19.630 --> 05:23.340
<b><i>Only nobles possess the mana 
that enables the use of magic.</i></b>

05:23.710 --> 05:26.340
<b><i>There are several magic attributes,</i></b>

05:26.340 --> 05:28.260
<b><i>and the most basic ones are...</i></b>

05:29.010 --> 05:34.770
<b><i>dark, fire, light, wind, and water.</i></b>

05:35.350 --> 05:38.150
<b><i>The nobles who excel 
in these top five attributes</i></b>

05:38.150 --> 05:40.020
<b><i>are known as the Five Great Noble Families.</i></b>

05:40.020 --> 05:43.820
<b><i>They serve the king directly and 
function as the pillars of the kingdom.</i></b>

05:44.570 --> 05:48.490
<b><i>The Williams family, which excels 
in dark magic, is one of them.</i></b>

05:48.780 --> 05:51.410
<b><i>But even if I was blessed 
with natural talent,</i></b>

05:51.410 --> 05:54.290
<b><i>I can't master any magic without training.</i></b>

05:54.290 --> 05:57.960
<b><i>Could it be that it's too early 
for me to start studying magic?</i></b>

06:04.130 --> 06:06.800
<b><i>There isn't a single book on magic!</i></b>

06:07.340 --> 06:10.340
<b><i>Is this place just so big 
that I can't find them?</i></b>

06:12.680 --> 06:16.140
<b>For today, I'll just read 
some books about plants.</b>

06:16.140 --> 06:18.890
<b>I need to be educated 
on more than just magic!</b>

06:20.270 --> 06:22.610
<b>Herbs for bringing down a fever...</b>

06:23.480 --> 06:25.320
<b>Flowers that glow...</b>

06:25.820 --> 06:27.530
<b>Flying trees?!</b>

06:29.910 --> 06:31.490
<b>It's already so late!</b>

06:31.910 --> 06:34.700
<b>I got too absorbed in reading 
about all these things</b>

06:34.700 --> 06:36.950
<b>that didn't exist in my old world.</b>

06:37.410 --> 06:40.330
<b><i>I can't believe I read all these in one day.</i></b>

06:40.330 --> 06:43.290
<b><i>Is Alicia actually incredibly gifted?</i></b>

06:43.290 --> 06:45.210
<b><i>I have such a promising future!</i></b>

06:45.710 --> 06:49.840
<b>Forty... eight...</b>

06:49.840 --> 06:53.550
<b>Forty... nine...</b>

06:54.220 --> 06:57.470
<b>Fifty...</b>

06:59.690 --> 07:01.100
<b><i>This is so hard!</i></b>

07:01.100 --> 07:05.230
<b><i>Alicia's so weak! She has no muscle at all!</i></b>

07:05.520 --> 07:08.650
<b><i>But this is all for the sake of my ambition.</i></b>

07:16.040 --> 07:19.710
<b>Forty-eight... forty-nine...</b>

07:19.710 --> 07:21.210
<b>Fifty!</b>

07:23.250 --> 07:27.420
<b><i>It was so hard yesterday, 
but I did it with no problem today.</i></b>

07:28.210 --> 07:32.300
<b>Well, that's fine. After breakfast, 
I'll head to the library</b>

07:33.680 --> 07:35.550
<b>and continue my reading!</b>

07:46.980 --> 07:50.400
<b><i>So, after seven days of 
reading and training...</i></b>

07:51.200 --> 07:54.660
<b><i>I made a phenomenal amount of progress!</i></b>

07:57.530 --> 07:59.290
<b><i>If I can do 500 sit-ups</i></b>

07:59.700 --> 08:04.000
<b><i>and 300 push-ups, Brother Albert 
should have no reason to complain.</i></b>

08:08.340 --> 08:11.590
<b>Alicia, what's come over you of late?</b>

08:11.590 --> 08:13.630
<b>You've been waking up so early.</b>

08:13.630 --> 08:16.800
<b>Nothing at all, Father.</b>

08:16.800 --> 08:19.310
<b>Where have you been going during the day?</b>

08:19.310 --> 08:22.100
<b>You always just lazed around 
in your room before.</b>

08:22.100 --> 08:23.600
<b>That's a secret!</b>

08:24.560 --> 08:27.900
<b><i>I'm definitely giving off the vibe 
that I'm plotting something, right?</i></b>

08:27.900 --> 08:29.820
<b><i>I really am a villain!</i></b>

08:29.820 --> 08:35.030
<b><i>And it's not like they'd believe me if 
I told them I recalled my previous life.</i></b>

08:35.030 --> 08:38.700
<b>Come to think of it, Albert, 
you're going out today, aren't you?</b>

08:38.700 --> 08:44.370
<b>Yes. Paul is taking us all on 
a tour of the Magic Academy.</b>

08:44.370 --> 08:46.380
<b>Time truly flies.</b>

08:46.380 --> 08:48.340
<b>You're twelve already.</b>

08:48.340 --> 08:51.130
<b>Another three years, 
and you'll be enrolling.</b>

08:51.420 --> 08:55.680
<b><i>Which means my sword training will 
have to wait until he comes home.</i></b>

09:08.980 --> 09:09.980
<b>Are you ready?</b>

09:09.980 --> 09:10.900
<b>Yeah!</b>

09:12.860 --> 09:16.910
<b><i>They're the conquerable routes in the game!</i></b>

09:17.700 --> 09:22.370
<b><i>Master Eric of the Hudson family. 
He uses fire magic.</i></b>

09:23.620 --> 09:27.710
<b><i>Master Finn of the Smith family. 
He uses light magic.</i></b>

09:28.830 --> 09:32.670
<b><i>Master Gale of the Evans family. 
He uses wind magic.</i></b>

09:33.510 --> 09:37.010
<b><i>Master Curtis of the Kenwood family. 
He uses green magic.</i></b>

09:37.510 --> 09:40.680
<b><i>He's not from any of the 
Five Great Noble Families.</i></b>

09:41.470 --> 09:42.770
<b><i>And...</i></b>

09:43.470 --> 09:47.980
<b><i>The king's only son, Prince Duke Seeker.</i></b>

09:47.980 --> 09:49.360
<b><i>He uses water magic.</i></b>

09:49.810 --> 09:54.190
<b><i>He ends up with the heroine 
in the game's good ending.</i></b>

09:54.820 --> 09:57.610
<b><i>He's actually the one I'm most into...</i></b>

09:57.950 --> 10:00.030
<b><i>but I'll leave the romance to the heroine.</i></b>

10:00.410 --> 10:03.950
<b><i>I need an early start at making 
an impression as a villainess!</i></b>

10:04.750 --> 10:05.620
<b>Ali.</b>

10:07.210 --> 10:10.790
<b>This is your first time 
meeting these guys, isn't it?</b>

10:11.420 --> 10:13.460
<b>Wait, this is your little sister?</b>

10:13.460 --> 10:14.800
<b>What a cutie!</b>

10:14.800 --> 10:18.010
<b>She's seven, right? She's so little.</b>

10:18.010 --> 10:20.260
<b><i>They all have way above average looks...</i></b>

10:20.260 --> 10:21.930
<b><i>But this is a crucial moment!</i></b>

10:22.470 --> 10:27.850
<b><i>The world's greatest villainess can't 
be seen as a child with no manners.</i></b>

10:28.480 --> 10:30.440
<b>My name is Alicia.</b>

10:30.940 --> 10:34.530
<b>She's not quite like her 
brothers made her seem.</b>

10:34.530 --> 10:36.690
<b>For one so young, 
she's really got it together.</b>

10:38.070 --> 10:41.910
<b>You and Alan were going to show us 
your skills with the sword, right?</b>

10:41.910 --> 10:44.240
<b>Y-Yes, by all means!</b>

10:44.240 --> 10:47.250
<b>If you're doing sword practice, 
please teach me, too!</b>

10:48.290 --> 10:50.960
<b>You promised to start 
teaching me today, remember?</b>

10:51.250 --> 10:55.420
<b>I said I'd only do it if you could do all 
those sit-ups and push-ups every day.</b>

10:55.420 --> 10:56.760
<b>But I did!</b>

10:56.760 --> 10:58.170
<b>Yeah, sure.</b>

10:58.170 --> 11:00.510
<b>Alan, let's start with you.</b>

11:06.220 --> 11:09.310
<b><i>He doesn't believe me! In that case...</i></b>

11:10.140 --> 11:11.850
<b>Alicia?!</b>

11:15.070 --> 11:17.150
<b><i>Please work!</i></b>

11:22.780 --> 11:26.080
<b>I believe I told you not to make light of me.</b>

11:28.120 --> 11:30.660
<b>You're... serious?</b>

11:30.660 --> 11:32.330
<b>Of course I am.</b>

11:35.170 --> 11:36.170
<b>All right.</b>

11:36.170 --> 11:38.090
<b>Thank you so much!</b>

11:38.090 --> 11:40.090
<b>I'll go change right away!</b>

11:48.930 --> 11:53.940
I'll Become a Villainess 
Who Goes Down in History

11:49.430 --> 11:53.940
<b><i>Alicia! Eight years old! Super cu—</i></b>

11:53.940 --> 11:55.940


11:53.940 --> 11:58.940
I'll Become a Villainess 
Who Goes Down in History

11:55.150 --> 11:57.860
<b><i>There's so much I need to be careful of...</i></b>

12:03.570 --> 12:07.280
<b><i>A year after my brother started 
teaching me how to use a sword...</i></b>

12:08.910 --> 12:11.370
<b><i>I'm still just doing 
practice swings every day.</i></b>

12:11.790 --> 12:16.250
<b><i>He says training is useless if I can't 
hold a sword for several hours at a time.</i></b>

12:16.630 --> 12:19.340
<b><i>If I wasn't trying to become the 
world's greatest villainess,</i></b>

12:19.340 --> 12:21.010
<b><i>I'd be sick of this by now.</i></b>

12:24.430 --> 12:26.470
<b><i>And over this past year...</i></b>

12:26.800 --> 12:29.890
<b><i>Prince Duke has been visiting 
our house frequently...</i></b>

12:29.890 --> 12:31.600
<b><i>At least, it seems that way.</i></b>

12:40.690 --> 12:42.240
<b>Finished for the day?</b>

12:42.240 --> 12:44.820
<b>N-No, I'm just taking a break.</b>

12:45.240 --> 12:47.370
<b><i>This is the first time he's spoken to me.</i></b>

12:47.620 --> 12:50.290
<b>Why work so hard to learn swordsmanship?</b>

12:50.290 --> 12:51.620
<b>A vil—</b>

12:51.620 --> 12:52.790
<b>Vil...?</b>

12:53.210 --> 12:55.870
<b>A villainously powerful grip! 
That's what I want!</b>

12:57.790 --> 12:59.500
<b>Well, I look forward to that.</b>

13:02.720 --> 13:03.760
<b>Du—</b>

13:06.970 --> 13:09.140
<b>Sorry for interrupting you.</b>

13:19.900 --> 13:21.530
<b>Say, Duke...</b>

13:21.900 --> 13:24.610
<b>Why have you been 
coming over so frequently?</b>

13:24.900 --> 13:27.070
<b>I thought it was for the books, but...</b>

13:27.070 --> 13:28.780
<b>Could it be that...</b>

13:31.540 --> 13:33.540
<b>I wonder why.</b>

13:33.540 --> 13:36.330
<b>I also wish I knew.</b>

13:40.090 --> 13:43.130
<b>Next, regarding the village of Loana...</b>

13:44.340 --> 13:49.760
<b>Living conditions have degraded more and 
more every year, leaving it uninhabitable.</b>

13:49.760 --> 13:54.680
<b>But if we are too hasty in sending 
aid, the people will be displeased.</b>

13:54.680 --> 13:56.770
<b>It's a village of criminals, after all.</b>

13:56.770 --> 14:01.440
<b>Shouldn't the Golden Rose 
be our first priority?</b>

14:01.440 --> 14:05.280
<b>Our kingdom, and our people, do need hope.</b>

14:06.570 --> 14:09.660
<b>Your Majesty, we of the 
Five Great Noble Families</b>

14:09.660 --> 14:12.450
<b>feel that a break is in order.</b>

14:12.740 --> 14:14.240
<b>Let us do that.</b>

14:16.040 --> 14:21.840
<b>Arnold, Finn has said he would like 
to invite Miss Alicia to our house.</b>

14:22.210 --> 14:24.420
<b>Yes, so I've heard.</b>

14:24.420 --> 14:27.720
<b>I've told her to avoid causing any trouble.</b>

14:27.720 --> 14:32.300
<b>My son, Eric, told me that 
she's a very polite girl.</b>

14:32.300 --> 14:33.760
<b>Gale has said the same.</b>

14:33.760 --> 14:36.480
<b>She used to be much more selfish.</b>

14:36.480 --> 14:41.400
<b>About a year ago, she suddenly started 
spending much of her time in the library.</b>

14:41.400 --> 14:43.820
<b>I still don't understand why.</b>

14:43.820 --> 14:45.190
<b>Ah...</b>

14:48.860 --> 14:51.780
<b>Alicia! Thanks for coming over!</b>

14:52.370 --> 14:55.200
<b>Thank you for the invitation.</b>

14:55.580 --> 14:58.160
<b>Let's have a tea party 
in the garden out back.</b>

14:58.160 --> 14:59.580
<b>Okay!</b>

15:00.290 --> 15:03.540
<b>Master Albert, the king 
is due to visit today.</b>

15:04.000 --> 15:07.720
<b>We have other guests over today, though.</b>

15:10.180 --> 15:11.970
<b>Heya.</b>

15:12.720 --> 15:13.930
<b>Hello!</b>

15:13.930 --> 15:16.640
<b><i>What? Why are they all here together?</i></b>

15:16.640 --> 15:18.730
<b>He hasn't arrived yet?</b>

15:18.730 --> 15:20.810
<b>He should be here soon.</b>

15:23.230 --> 15:24.730
<b><i>A map?</i></b>

15:24.730 --> 15:28.610
<b><i>At the end of the game, 
Alicia is exiled to a foreign country.</i></b>

15:28.610 --> 15:30.450
<b><i>Are we already at the ending?!</i></b>

15:30.450 --> 15:33.160
<b><i>That was quick! This story moved too fast!</i></b>

15:42.290 --> 15:46.050
<b><i>The king? Why is he here?</i></b>

15:46.960 --> 15:50.260
<b>I hope the day finds you well, Your Majesty.</b>

15:50.260 --> 15:51.720
<b>Raise your head.</b>

15:52.720 --> 15:57.140
<b>I've heard about you, 
and I wanted to speak with you.</b>

15:57.640 --> 15:59.100
<b>That's why I stopped by.</b>

15:59.930 --> 16:02.940
<b>Now, Alicia, If I may get 
right to the point...</b>

16:02.940 --> 16:07.780
<b>How do you feel about this position 
our Kingdom of Durkis is in?</b>

16:08.650 --> 16:10.940
<b><i>I don't get the point of his question!</i></b>

16:11.320 --> 16:13.740
<b><i>He's talking politics with an eight-year-old?</i></b>

16:14.320 --> 16:16.660
<b><i>Is this some kind of test?</i></b>

16:16.660 --> 16:18.120
<b><i>I get it now!</i></b>

16:18.240 --> 16:20.290
<b><i>It's a villainess test!</i></b>

16:20.290 --> 16:24.960
<b><i>God has set this task to determine 
whether I can be a great villainess!</i></b>

16:25.250 --> 16:27.340
<b><i>So the answer has to be...</i></b>

16:27.340 --> 16:31.760
<b>If I may say so, while the 
Kingdom of Durkis is a major power,</b>

16:31.760 --> 16:34.010
<b>I cannot call it a good nation.</b>

16:34.300 --> 16:35.680
<b><i>How's that?</i></b>

16:35.680 --> 16:38.060
<b><i>I'm the textbook villainess, right?</i></b>

16:39.260 --> 16:41.350
<b>We may have a strong economy,</b>

16:41.350 --> 16:44.400
<b>the majority of the money 
lies with the nobility,</b>

16:44.400 --> 16:46.440
<b>creating a serious wealth gap.</b>

16:46.770 --> 16:48.690
<b>In Loana, a village on the outskirts,</b>

16:48.690 --> 16:52.360
<b>life is so difficult that many don't know 
if they can afford bread for tomorrow.</b>

16:53.400 --> 16:56.120
<b>Discontent toward the 
nobility grows ever greater.</b>

16:56.120 --> 16:58.280
<b>An uprising could break out at any time.</b>

16:58.280 --> 17:01.040
<b>So we need to improve our economic strength?</b>

17:01.040 --> 17:03.460
<b>Then tell me how you would fix it.</b>

17:03.710 --> 17:05.670
<b><i>He expects that much from me?</i></b>

17:05.670 --> 17:07.630
<b><i>But a true villainess would...</i></b>

17:07.630 --> 17:12.050
<b>Why not take advantage of our neighbor, 
Calvera, and its gold mines?</b>

17:12.050 --> 17:15.630
<b>Calvera is ruled by Laval. 
You think we should take it from them?</b>

17:15.630 --> 17:20.060
<b>No, we should fund Calvera's independence.</b>

17:20.510 --> 17:23.600
<b>It would be best to avoid 
conflict with Laval.</b>

17:24.100 --> 17:28.610
<b>We maintain our relationship on the surface 
while trading with Calvera, and...</b>

17:28.610 --> 17:31.530
<b>Yes. We make them owe us a debt.</b>

17:31.900 --> 17:33.940
<b>And once they've gained independence,</b>

17:33.940 --> 17:36.910
<b>we'll have an advantage in trading with them.</b>

17:38.320 --> 17:41.580
<b>So we build a relationship with 
Calvera that gives us superiority,</b>

17:41.580 --> 17:43.750
<b>and make a profit by trading with them?</b>

17:43.750 --> 17:44.910
<b>I see.</b>

17:44.910 --> 17:48.040
<b><i>Using others in order to make a profit</i></b>

17:48.040 --> 17:50.840
<b><i>is something that goody-two-shoes 
heroine would never do.</i></b>

17:51.210 --> 17:55.470
<b><i>If I keep this up, I'll come into 
conflict with the heroine eventually.</i></b>

17:55.470 --> 18:00.180
<b><i>I'm now on track to become 
the greatest villainess ever!</i></b>

18:02.970 --> 18:06.810
<b>Alicia, it has been delightful 
to speak with you today.</b>

18:07.390 --> 18:09.020
<b>You honor me.</b>

18:16.820 --> 18:18.280
<b>Were you nervous?</b>

18:18.280 --> 18:19.530
<b>N-No.</b>

18:19.870 --> 18:20.990
<b>Really?</b>

18:20.990 --> 18:23.700
<b><i>He really is quite attractive...</i></b>

18:24.500 --> 18:27.120
<b>That was truly intriguing.</b>

18:27.410 --> 18:29.460
<b>I'm glad to hear that.</b>

18:29.460 --> 18:33.050
<b>Forgive me, but there's a matter 
I would like us all to discuss.</b>

18:33.460 --> 18:36.220
<b>The Golden Rose has been found.</b>

18:37.510 --> 18:38.590
<b>All right.</b>

18:40.970 --> 18:43.140
<b>So, you must be tired now, right?</b>

18:43.140 --> 18:45.100
<b>You can eat as much as you'd like!</b>

18:45.100 --> 18:49.440
<b><i>No way! 
These are all my favorite desserts!</i></b>

18:50.230 --> 18:51.940
<b>I gratefully accept!</b>

18:53.270 --> 18:55.110
<b>Delicious!</b>

19:02.660 --> 19:06.540
<b>They used to call him the "Ice Prince."</b>

19:06.540 --> 19:09.210
<b>I guess an unexpected 
spring breeze came along.</b>

19:19.720 --> 19:21.260
<b>Alicia.</b>

19:21.890 --> 19:22.890
<b>Yes?</b>

19:22.890 --> 19:24.050
<b>Do you have a moment?</b>

19:24.760 --> 19:26.220
<b>This is for you.</b>

19:26.560 --> 19:29.890
<b>I'm a bit late, but... happy birthday.</b>

19:30.390 --> 19:32.150
<b>Thank you!</b>

19:33.480 --> 19:34.820
<b>May I open it?</b>

19:34.820 --> 19:35.980
<b>Of course.</b>

19:38.780 --> 19:41.320
<b>U-Um... what is it?</b>

19:41.320 --> 19:43.820
<b>A diamond. Does it displease you?</b>

19:43.820 --> 19:46.790
<b>C-Certainly not! I will treasure it!</b>

19:46.790 --> 19:49.000
<b>Good. I'm glad.</b>

19:49.000 --> 19:50.750
<b>Well, I'll be going now.</b>

19:50.750 --> 19:52.250
<b>All right...</b>

19:52.750 --> 19:54.840
<b>Goodbye.</b>

19:55.670 --> 20:01.340
<b><i>D-Diamonds are far more valuable in this 
world than they were in my old world!</i></b>

20:01.970 --> 20:05.760
<b><i>Why? Why did he give me this?</i></b>

20:10.850 --> 20:13.690
<b>There's no question. It is the Golden Rose.</b>

20:13.690 --> 20:15.310
<b>Who is its owner?</b>

20:15.310 --> 20:17.110
<b>A baker in the castle town.</b>

20:17.110 --> 20:18.280
<b>What?!</b>

20:18.280 --> 20:20.320
<b>When his only daughter was born,</b>

20:20.320 --> 20:23.860
<b>this unusual rose bloomed, so he kept it.</b>

20:23.860 --> 20:27.160
<b>Then that daughter is... the Saint.</b>

20:28.290 --> 20:30.790
<b>The girl who will join the kingdom's ruler</b>

20:30.790 --> 20:34.880
<b>to guide the people to 
peace and save the world.</b>

20:34.880 --> 20:38.460
<b>When one who will control 
the kingdom's fate is born,</b>

20:38.460 --> 20:40.800
<b>a special rose blooms.</b>

20:40.800 --> 20:43.430
<b>This was proven when 
the Blue Rose bloomed.</b>

20:43.760 --> 20:46.640
<b>It seems safe to assume the gold 
color is reserved for the Saint.</b>

20:46.640 --> 20:51.730
<b>Yes, now we have the ones who govern 
the Blue Rose and the Golden Rose.</b>

20:52.140 --> 20:54.650
<b>Duke, for whom the Blue Rose bloomed,</b>

20:54.650 --> 20:57.190
<b>and the girl for whom 
the Golden Rose bloomed.</b>

20:57.900 --> 21:00.480
<b>With the two of them leading the way,</b>

21:00.480 --> 21:03.700
<b>this kingdom is certain to flourish.</b>

21:03.700 --> 21:07.910
<b>But such a transformation 
always comes at a price.</b>

21:07.910 --> 21:10.910
<b>And the bigger the transformation...</b>

21:11.410 --> 21:14.330
<b>Troubled times most certainly await.</b>

21:21.960 --> 21:25.340
<b>Your Majesty, the legend 
of the Saint tells us</b>

21:25.720 --> 21:30.470
<b>that when the Saint unites with a 
member of the ruling royal family...</b>

21:37.940 --> 21:40.400
<b>We must accept our fate.</b>

21:43.820 --> 21:46.160
<b><i>This isn't bad at all!</i></b>

21:47.030 --> 21:48.450
<b><i>It's on the small side,</i></b>

21:49.410 --> 21:51.370
<b><i>so it doesn't get in my way!</i></b>

21:52.200 --> 21:55.710
<b><i>Even if Duke falls for the heroine 
one day and demands its return,</i></b>

21:55.710 --> 21:57.580
<b><i>I'm not giving it back!</i></b>

21:57.580 --> 22:01.130
<b><i>I'll look him dead in the eye and 
refuse, like a true villainess!</i></b>

22:01.130 --> 22:03.880
<b><i>Just you wait, world!</i></b>

22:03.880 --> 22:08.550
<b><i>The debut of the villainess who goes 
down in history is coming soon!</i></b>
