00:05.530 --> 00:07.820
<i>My fever seems to be down.</i>

00:07.940 --> 00:10.780
<b>Full Recovery</b>

00:08.530 --> 00:10.780
<i>It's all thanks to Prince Duke's medicine!</i>

00:12.620 --> 00:15.740
<i>That was a life-saving measure! Nothing more!</i>

00:15.740 --> 00:19.940
<i>To Prince Duke, I'm like 
a little sister at most.</i>

00:19.940 --> 00:21.290
<i>Don't think about it!</i>

00:21.620 --> 00:22.810
<i>More importantly...</i>

00:24.010 --> 00:27.360
<i>As a villainess, there's someone 
else I should be thinking about.</i>

00:27.360 --> 00:28.370
<i>And that's...</i>

00:29.120 --> 00:30.510
<i>the heroine.</i>

00:32.370 --> 00:36.650
<i>I'm gonna infiltrate the Magic 
Academy to investigate!</i>

00:44.770 --> 00:51.780
I'll Become a <b>Villainess</b>
Who Goes Down in History

02:07.020 --> 02:11.980
<b>The Villainess and Trespassing</b>

02:17.290 --> 02:18.550
Well, clearly...

02:18.700 --> 02:20.530
<b><b>Lost</b></b>

02:19.120 --> 02:20.520
I'm lost!

02:20.520 --> 02:23.150
This campus is just too big!

02:26.360 --> 02:29.630
<i>I want to ask someone how to 
get to the school building,</i>

02:29.970 --> 02:34.520
<i>but if they knew a child like me found their way in here, I'd get thrown out.</i>

02:35.110 --> 02:36.210
Excuse me...

02:37.720 --> 02:39.330
Are you all right?

02:39.330 --> 02:41.210
Are you lost, perhaps?

02:41.210 --> 02:44.560
Um, I...

02:45.390 --> 02:48.370
I'm Liz. Liz Cather.

02:48.890 --> 02:50.030
Cather?

02:50.400 --> 02:52.550
<i>I've never heard that surname before.</i>

02:52.550 --> 02:55.650
Oh! I'm a commoner, you see.

02:55.650 --> 02:58.090
My family owns the town bakery.

02:58.090 --> 02:58.520
Huh?

02:58.530 --> 03:02.700
<b>Commoner</b>

02:59.180 --> 03:02.690
<i>A commoner who entered the Magic Academy?</i>

03:02.690 --> 03:04.360
<i>She's the heroine!</i>

03:04.770 --> 03:07.950
<i>She didn't have a name or 
any visuals in the game,</i>

03:07.950 --> 03:09.480
<i>so I didn't recognize her!</i>

03:09.960 --> 03:12.590
Um, so...

03:12.590 --> 03:15.240
Would you tell me your name, too?

03:15.500 --> 03:19.240
I'm Alicia. Alicia Williams.

03:21.170 --> 03:25.640
Alicia, is it? So where are you 
trying to go, Alicia dear?

03:25.640 --> 03:28.160
Uh... The school building.

03:28.160 --> 03:32.100
Oh, I see! Well, then, 
you want to go this way.

03:32.100 --> 03:33.550
W-Wait!

03:34.060 --> 03:36.130
<i>She's being so friendly!</i>

03:36.130 --> 03:38.940
<i>She ought to know her place...</i>

03:38.940 --> 03:40.990
<i>I guess I can't say that, though.</i>

03:41.740 --> 03:46.600
<i>She was chosen to get into this school 
on a scholarship based on her merits.</i>

03:47.530 --> 03:51.310
<i>I'm sure she's been treated 
unfairly due to her status.</i>

03:51.660 --> 03:53.980
<i>She's still far ahead of me.</i>

03:53.980 --> 03:57.080
<i>But I'll become her equal one day!</i>

03:57.080 --> 04:00.590
Come to think of it, isn't "Williams"...

04:00.590 --> 04:02.150
Miss Liz!

04:02.630 --> 04:04.040
Everyone!

04:04.290 --> 04:08.400
I just found this little lost girl...

04:08.980 --> 04:09.830
Huh?

04:11.160 --> 04:12.820
Alicia?

04:15.150 --> 04:18.570
<i>I was almost spotted by other students.</i>

04:18.570 --> 04:21.300
<i>And now I owe a debt to the heroine.</i>

04:21.300 --> 04:23.360
<i>I'm a failure as a villainess.</i>

04:24.640 --> 04:25.840
<i>That's...</i>

04:26.270 --> 04:27.590
<i>Prince Duke!</i>

04:28.760 --> 04:30.410
Duke!

04:30.780 --> 04:31.510
Liz.

04:31.510 --> 04:35.400
I just found a cute little 
girl a few moments ago!

04:34.760 --> 04:38.370
Miss Liz and Prince Duke 
look so right together.

04:35.400 --> 04:39.480
I thought she must have been lost, 
but then she suddenly disappeared.

04:38.370 --> 04:43.120
I know! A commoner and a prince... 
A love that defies class!

04:39.480 --> 04:41.100
You haven't seen her, have you?

04:41.100 --> 04:43.460
If you do see her, let me know.

04:43.460 --> 04:49.030
Oh! Also, I'm thinking of having 
a tea party after school today.

04:43.840 --> 04:48.440
I heard that when someone hid Miss Liz's 
textbooks, Prince Duke found them.

04:48.440 --> 04:51.350
I'm rooting for their romance!

04:49.030 --> 04:52.500
Would you like to come? 
Or are you too busy?

04:51.350 --> 04:52.500
Me too!

04:53.020 --> 04:55.430
<i>If things go the way they did in the game,</i>

04:55.430 --> 04:58.280
<i>Liz Cather will end up with Prince Duke.</i>

04:59.060 --> 05:01.820
<i>Maybe it's only natural 
that they're so close.</i>

05:09.120 --> 05:11.330
Classes are in session now,

05:11.330 --> 05:14.210
so no one will spot me if I go inside!

05:14.710 --> 05:18.050
As long as I'm here, I might 
as well scope out the school!

05:20.700 --> 05:23.410
<i>Now I </i>know<i> I'm in the Magic Academy!</i>

05:23.410 --> 05:26.620
<i>It has so many books about magic!</i>

05:26.940 --> 05:29.570
<i>I can't wait to start attending here!</i>

05:32.500 --> 05:34.410
<i>There's something written there.</i>

05:36.340 --> 05:37.910
Listen to this!

05:37.910 --> 05:40.940
There's this amazing little 
girl in the reference room!

05:40.940 --> 05:44.690
A little girl? This isn't 
a visitation day, though.

05:44.980 --> 05:49.330
You know how there's a new task posted 
on the blackboard in there every week?

05:49.650 --> 05:53.170
She was writing an answer 
at breakneck speed!

05:53.170 --> 05:57.580
What? But those tasks are always super hard.

05:57.580 --> 05:59.410
I think the current one was...

05:59.410 --> 06:04.130
"Explain how Laval might be brought 
under this country's jurisdiction."

06:04.500 --> 06:06.760
If she can answer a question like that,

06:06.760 --> 06:09.260
she must be the daughter 
of some noble family.

06:09.260 --> 06:10.640
Yeah, maybe!

06:10.640 --> 06:13.690
She looked about ten years 
old and had black hair.

06:13.690 --> 06:15.220
Please don't tell me...

06:15.220 --> 06:17.060
It's exactly what you think, I'm sure.

06:21.020 --> 06:24.200
<i>"Use the economic collapse 
of Duran to isolate Laval.</i>

06:24.450 --> 06:32.110
<i>Once Laval is impoverished, we pretend 
to help them, then stake our claim," huh?</i>

06:32.110 --> 06:34.860
<i>What ten-year-old girl 
would come up with that?</i>

06:36.900 --> 06:40.110
Looks like a pretty 
villainess-worthy answer to me.

06:42.600 --> 06:43.650
A...

06:44.140 --> 06:47.070
Alicia!

06:51.240 --> 06:55.890
I really don't think Albert needed 
to scold me for <i>that</i> long.

06:56.240 --> 06:57.560
A Divergent?!

06:59.090 --> 07:00.820
That was Father's voice.

07:03.070 --> 07:05.230
Are you saying she's dangerous?

07:05.230 --> 07:07.900
I'm saying caution is necessary.

07:05.230 --> 07:07.900
<i>That man he's with is Lord Joan.</i>

07:07.900 --> 07:10.820
Her abilities are far outside the norm.

07:08.350 --> 07:10.820
<i>He said "Divergent." Did he mean...</i>

07:11.170 --> 07:13.240
It's highly likely that she's a Divergent.

07:14.250 --> 07:15.150
Who's there?!

07:17.340 --> 07:18.620
Alicia...

07:18.850 --> 07:20.400
How much did you hear?

07:21.340 --> 07:24.600
We have no choice. I'll erase her memories.

07:24.600 --> 07:26.520
Understand, Arnold?

07:26.520 --> 07:28.380
I-I...

07:28.700 --> 07:30.960
I'll keep quiet!

07:30.960 --> 07:33.860
I won't tell anyone that 
Liz Cather is a Divergent!

07:37.600 --> 07:39.390
Liz Cather?

07:39.660 --> 07:44.430
<i>In the game, the heroine's exceptional 
talents are regarded as dangerous.</i>

07:45.020 --> 07:50.220
Um... Then you'll pretend you never 
heard any of this conversation?

07:50.220 --> 07:51.690
Yes, but...

07:52.340 --> 07:56.280
She didn't seem like someone who 
would bring harm to the kingdom,

07:56.280 --> 07:58.410
so I don't think we need to worry.

07:58.610 --> 07:59.820
I see...

07:59.820 --> 08:02.590
Wait, you've met her?

08:02.590 --> 08:05.760
Uh... It's just a feeling I get!

08:06.120 --> 08:09.200
I-It's quite late, so I 
should retire to bed now.

08:09.200 --> 08:10.700
Please excuse me.

08:11.420 --> 08:14.280
<i>The Five Great Noble Families 
have their eye on her now?</i>

08:14.280 --> 08:16.590
<i>I hate to admit it, but well done, heroine.</i>

08:17.100 --> 08:19.010
<i>I can't fall too far behind!</i>

08:19.970 --> 08:24.980
I'll Become a <b>Villainess</b>
Who Goes Down in History

08:20.890 --> 08:23.840
<i>That sounds awful, Alicia dear!</i>

08:24.980 --> 08:29.980
I'll Become a <b>Villainess
</b>Who Goes Down in History

08:26.450 --> 08:28.580
<i>You wouldn't understand.</i>

08:34.390 --> 08:37.170
Clean Dirty Items.

08:37.460 --> 08:41.580
Good. I've mastered dark 
magic up to level 10.

08:41.990 --> 08:47.640
I was hoping to learn a spell that 
would purify Roana's drinking water,

08:47.640 --> 08:49.850
but that one's level 25.

08:50.130 --> 08:54.380
I guess I could just go ahead 
and try a level 25 one.

08:55.460 --> 08:57.920
Alicia, do you have a moment?

08:57.920 --> 08:59.140
Come in.

08:59.750 --> 09:01.630
Everyone's here to visit.

09:02.110 --> 09:03.850
Want to join us for tea?

09:04.400 --> 09:05.890
Alicia dear!

09:06.250 --> 09:07.560
Liz...

09:08.240 --> 09:11.490
So you really are Al's little sister!

09:11.490 --> 09:14.550
Liz, you know my sister?

09:14.550 --> 09:18.170
Yes! I helped her find her way 
at the academy the other day.

09:18.520 --> 09:22.400
You helped me on the day 
of the entrance ceremony,

09:22.400 --> 09:26.460
and then I got to help little 
Alicia in the same way!

09:26.460 --> 09:29.530
Do you think it's fate?

09:29.530 --> 09:31.600
F-Fate?

09:31.930 --> 09:35.110
<i>Could you not use me as 
flirting fodder, please?</i>

09:31.930 --> 09:37.800
I hope I'll get to spend lots more time 
with you and little Alicia just like this!

09:35.710 --> 09:38.660
<i>It sure took her no time 
to conquer my brother.</i>

09:38.960 --> 09:42.180
Alicia, come have a seat.

09:42.180 --> 09:44.530
I will. Thank you very much.

09:44.530 --> 09:48.300
We met up to decide what our class 
will do for the upcoming school fair.

09:48.550 --> 09:52.160
Oh, then I'll only be in your way if I stay.

09:52.160 --> 09:55.960
No, people from outside the school 
will be attending, as well.

09:56.480 --> 09:59.330
If you have any ideas, 
we'd love to hear them.

09:59.330 --> 10:02.490
<i>The school fair? Isn't that...</i>

10:03.960 --> 10:09.090
It's the event in the game where Prince 
Duke and Liz rapidly grow closer!

10:09.420 --> 10:14.050
As the villainess, I can't simply 
stand by and let it happen, but...

10:14.050 --> 10:19.090
What if we were to slap Liz 
with a challenge as her rival?

10:19.090 --> 10:20.320
A challenge?!

10:20.320 --> 10:24.170
Go up to the two of them when they're 
getting all lovey-dovey and say:

10:24.690 --> 10:28.430
"A commoner like you has some nerve 
getting cozy with Prince Duke!

10:28.430 --> 10:29.840
Know your place!"

10:30.090 --> 10:30.780
Like that.

10:30.780 --> 10:32.380
Sounds like fun!

10:32.380 --> 10:35.170
It's unfair to use your class against her.

10:36.320 --> 10:38.270
That's true...

10:38.270 --> 10:41.140
One's class is determined at birth,

10:41.140 --> 10:43.530
and one's lineage doesn't mean a thing.

10:43.530 --> 10:45.410
If I want to insult the heroine,

10:46.130 --> 10:50.770
I must face her fair and square, and 
remember my dignity as a villainess!

10:51.700 --> 10:56.860
Clearly declare that the 
best match for Prince Duke

10:56.860 --> 10:58.930
is you yourself, not Liz.

10:58.930 --> 11:01.720
That could work! It's 
definitely villainess-like!

11:02.010 --> 11:04.980
Um, but wouldn't that be...

11:04.980 --> 11:08.040
the same as confessing 
your love to Prince Duke?

11:08.330 --> 11:09.470
Oh.

11:10.790 --> 11:14.710
You're doing your best to 
help us think of ideas!

11:14.710 --> 11:16.120
I love that!

11:16.890 --> 11:18.740
<i>Shoot! I'm giving her a good impression?!</i>

11:18.740 --> 11:20.220
<i>I have to do something!</i>

11:20.220 --> 11:21.440
So, Liz...

11:21.670 --> 11:24.700
I've heard that you can 
use all magical elements.

11:24.700 --> 11:25.610
Yes...

11:25.890 --> 11:30.730
How about you give a performance 
on the stage using your magic?

11:30.730 --> 11:32.410
Using magic?

11:32.410 --> 11:34.830
<i>How's that? A humble heroine</i>

11:35.150 --> 11:38.170
<i>would hate the idea of showing 
off her power like that, right?</i>

11:38.700 --> 11:40.380
That sounds lovely!

11:40.380 --> 11:41.060
Huh?!

11:41.060 --> 11:42.780
Good idea.

11:42.780 --> 11:44.600
I bet people would go nuts for that!

11:44.930 --> 11:48.350
<i>Don't just instantly accept a 
random suggestion like that!</i>

11:48.630 --> 11:52.280
Say, Alicia dear, would you 
like to go on stage with me?

11:52.280 --> 11:55.130
N-No, I'll pass.

11:55.130 --> 11:57.900
I'm not a student of the academy.

11:57.900 --> 12:01.960
Oh, don't worry! We can take care of that!

12:01.960 --> 12:06.450
<i>If you're the heroine, you should get 
a clue that I don't want to do this!</i>

12:06.450 --> 12:10.240
I know it'll be fun! Let's 
make a happy memory together!

12:07.860 --> 12:10.240
Hey, you shouldn't push her.

12:10.240 --> 12:14.200
I have absolutely no interest 
in going on stage with you!

12:14.200 --> 12:15.230
Huh?

12:15.230 --> 12:19.500
A-Alicia! You didn't have to go that far!

12:19.500 --> 12:25.680
Have I... done something 
to make you dislike me?

12:25.980 --> 12:29.660
Everyone has people they just 
aren't a good match with.

12:29.660 --> 12:32.560
There's no need for us to force 
ourselves to act friendly.

12:32.560 --> 12:34.720
Well, then, there's nothing to worry about!

12:35.030 --> 12:39.760
If we talk with each other lots 
and lots, we'll become friends.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.130
I'm sure of it.

12:41.500 --> 12:43.070
So don't worry.

12:44.040 --> 12:45.770
Liz is right.

12:46.340 --> 12:50.340
You can't decide someone isn't a good 
match if you don't even know them.

12:50.700 --> 12:53.790
Why don't you try talking 
with Liz some more?

12:54.920 --> 12:58.440
Very well, as long as I don't 
have to go on stage with her.

12:58.440 --> 12:59.760
I'm so glad!

13:01.570 --> 13:04.180
<i>Talking to her a bit might not be so bad...</i>

13:04.180 --> 13:06.670
<i>But it was a mistake to even think that.</i>

13:06.980 --> 13:09.450
What's your favorite flower, Alicia dear?

13:09.450 --> 13:11.010
Lily of the valley.

13:11.010 --> 13:14.530
Behind their beauty lies 
a very potent poison.

13:14.530 --> 13:16.690
I like marguerite daisies.

13:17.050 --> 13:19.580
What's your favorite sweet treat?

13:19.580 --> 13:20.870
Macarons.

13:22.270 --> 13:26.160
<i>Liz has been questioning me for hours!</i>

13:26.160 --> 13:29.690
<i>And can't she ask any more 
meaningful questions?</i>

13:29.960 --> 13:33.340
Okay, and what's something you like to do?

13:33.340 --> 13:34.860
<i>I can't take it anymore.</i>

13:41.620 --> 13:43.040
This.

13:44.160 --> 13:46.760
Is that... magic?!

13:46.760 --> 13:49.790
Here you go. Marguerite daisies.

13:49.790 --> 13:53.670
They're the perfect flower for 
a goody-two-shoes like you.

13:53.670 --> 13:55.630
D-Don't tell me...

13:55.630 --> 13:58.250
Isn't Ali only...

13:58.250 --> 14:00.150
She's only ten, yes.

14:00.150 --> 14:04.470
I didn't know she could use magic, either.

14:05.110 --> 14:07.450
<i>What is this atmosphere?</i>

14:07.450 --> 14:08.610
A Divergent.

14:09.550 --> 14:12.790
Alicia, go back to your room.

14:12.790 --> 14:16.360
All of you, I'm sorry, but 
would you leave for today?

14:16.620 --> 14:18.710
<i>What? What's going on?</i>

14:18.710 --> 14:22.030
<i>Divergent? Wasn't that 
supposed to be about Liz?</i>

14:23.970 --> 14:27.960
You don't need to worry 
about a thing, Alicia dear.

14:27.960 --> 14:30.510
Albert will do something about this.

14:31.980 --> 14:35.160
Thank you for the beautiful 
marguerite daisies.

14:35.730 --> 14:37.940
I love their flower language.

14:39.950 --> 14:41.320
I see.

14:41.960 --> 14:44.990
So you can use magic, eh?

14:44.990 --> 14:48.320
Yes, but only on a beginner level.

14:48.320 --> 14:52.780
Most people can only use magic 
after turning thirteen.

14:52.780 --> 14:54.060
Huh?

14:54.060 --> 14:59.950
I once knew someone myself who could use 
magic at a very young age, like you.

15:00.190 --> 15:03.060
They were praised by everyone 
for their talents,

15:03.060 --> 15:06.390
and they increased their 
magic ability to level 80.

15:06.820 --> 15:09.470
And what happened to them?

15:10.120 --> 15:11.390
They came to ruin.

15:11.690 --> 15:12.480
What?

15:12.720 --> 15:15.150
They overestimated their own abilities

15:15.150 --> 15:19.650
and tried to use level 100 
magic. As a result...

15:19.650 --> 15:24.520
their mana raged out of control, and they 
were unable to ever use magic again.

15:24.520 --> 15:25.850
No...

15:25.850 --> 15:28.830
Alicia, remember this.

15:28.830 --> 15:32.780
Magic must be learned in order by level.

15:32.780 --> 15:35.030
I-I understand.

15:41.490 --> 15:44.650
Gill. Did we wake you?

15:45.830 --> 15:48.480
Oh, this is Alicia.

15:48.480 --> 15:51.210
Look, she's prepared medicine for you.

15:52.050 --> 15:55.690
Pleased to meet you, Gill. I'm 
relieved to see you're all right.

15:57.300 --> 15:59.590
I'm sorry, Alicia.

15:59.590 --> 16:03.980
His circumstances have driven 
him to shut others out.

16:04.210 --> 16:05.690
<i>I can't blame him.</i>

16:06.240 --> 16:09.080
<i>What would Liz Cather do right now?</i>

16:09.830 --> 16:13.660
<i>In flower language, the marguerite 
daisy represents sincerity and trust.</i>

16:14.400 --> 16:16.340
<i>That's perfect for a heroine,</i>

16:16.340 --> 16:19.070
<i>and the exact opposite of me, 
since I want to be a villainess.</i>

16:19.640 --> 16:24.880
<i>I'm sure her kind words 
would open up his heart.</i>

16:26.340 --> 16:31.150
<i>Wait... Does that mean there's something 
the heroine can do that I can't?</i>

16:31.150 --> 16:33.690
<i>Me, the greatest villainess in history?</i>

16:34.790 --> 16:36.130
Hey, Gill.

16:36.590 --> 16:40.940
Maybe you should just 
die right here and now.

16:41.550 --> 16:42.480
What?

16:42.480 --> 16:46.890
As long as you're alive, you 
can't avoid contact with people.

16:47.320 --> 16:51.490
Do you think you can keep running 
away from what scares you forever?

16:52.060 --> 16:57.500
In fact, maybe you'd be better off if you'd 
never taken that medicine and just died.

16:58.160 --> 17:02.620
No one asked you to help me, and 
now you're running your mouth?

17:02.860 --> 17:05.540
Like a noble has any idea how I feel!

17:05.540 --> 17:08.440
That's right. I have no idea.

17:08.440 --> 17:10.740
We've grown up in different worlds.

17:11.760 --> 17:16.750
But you're right that I need to take 
responsibility for giving you that medicine.

17:17.020 --> 17:20.680
So if you're truly certain 
that you don't want to live,

17:22.090 --> 17:24.620
I would be happy to kill you.

17:25.940 --> 17:28.850
Decide. Will you live or die?

17:29.140 --> 17:30.610
It's your choice.

17:32.010 --> 17:33.200
Dark magic.

17:39.500 --> 17:40.360
Huh?

17:40.660 --> 17:43.130
Well, look at that, Gill. You <i>can</i> fight.

17:43.130 --> 17:47.290
O-Of course I can! I'm not 
just gonna let you kill me!

17:47.290 --> 17:48.650
And that's good.

17:48.650 --> 17:49.250
Huh?

17:49.500 --> 17:52.190
So long as you hold on to that feeling,

17:52.190 --> 17:55.180
I'll do everything in my 
power to keep you alive.

17:55.450 --> 17:58.470
I'll be your support.

17:58.470 --> 18:01.600
If you want to leave here, 
I'll take you with me.

18:02.110 --> 18:04.080
Why would you do that for me?

18:04.080 --> 18:05.820
Don't get the wrong idea.

18:05.820 --> 18:07.770
It's so I can use you.

18:08.140 --> 18:12.760
I heard you were clever, so I thought 
you might prove an excellent resource.

18:13.570 --> 18:16.660
I <i>am</i> a villainess, after all!

18:17.100 --> 18:18.970
What is she talking about?

18:18.970 --> 18:22.470
She's a bit strange, but 
she's a good girl at heart.

18:22.470 --> 18:24.800
I am <i>not</i>! I'm a villainess!

18:25.430 --> 18:29.440
You're nothing like what I imagined 
when I heard you were nobility.

18:30.340 --> 18:33.910
Fine. I'll be an "excellent 
resource" for you.

18:34.210 --> 18:37.580
I don't want anyone thinking 
I'm ungrateful, after all.

18:40.090 --> 18:44.470
Thanks for the medicine, 
Alicia. Glad to know you.

18:44.740 --> 18:45.760
Oh, my!

18:46.150 --> 18:49.630
You're actually quite the cutie 
when you smile, aren't you?

18:49.630 --> 18:51.380
Huh?! I am not!

18:54.360 --> 18:56.030
A Divergent, eh?

18:56.490 --> 19:00.160
I had no idea she could use magic.

19:00.160 --> 19:03.450
Is it possible Alicia could be the Saint?

19:03.690 --> 19:07.610
No, the Saint is most certainly Liz Cather.

19:08.090 --> 19:13.370
No one has ever heard of a commoner 
who could use all magical elements.

19:13.750 --> 19:18.290
Alicia is also exceptional for having 
the ability to use magic at age ten,

19:18.790 --> 19:22.130
but she was born of noble blood.

19:22.130 --> 19:23.970
It isn't a hard thing to imagine.

19:23.970 --> 19:27.510
Yes, and as far as Liz Cather 
goes, there's also the rose.

19:28.170 --> 19:31.180
Only the one who made the 
Golden Rose bloom can be

19:31.180 --> 19:33.610
the Saint who shoulders 
this kingdom's destiny.

19:33.610 --> 19:35.850
Yes, you're right.

19:35.850 --> 19:38.210
Joan, Arnold.

19:38.630 --> 19:43.770
One who can use magic at such a young age is 
in danger of losing control of their mana.

19:44.380 --> 19:49.700
Observe Alicia and train her to ensure 
that she can maintain control.

19:49.700 --> 19:50.770
Of course.

19:50.770 --> 19:52.000
Understood.

19:52.790 --> 19:54.510
Her mana went out of control?!

19:54.510 --> 20:00.430
Yes. Remember the magic 
performance you suggested?

20:01.050 --> 20:03.120
Liz was practicing for that when...

20:03.510 --> 20:08.050
And... is Liz no longer able to use magic?

20:08.420 --> 20:10.980
It doesn't look like that'll happen.

20:10.980 --> 20:15.030
Duke and the teachers were able to 
bring her mana back under control.

20:15.260 --> 20:16.790
<i>Thank goodness.</i>

20:16.790 --> 20:21.260
<i>I need Liz to be my rival, after all.</i>

20:21.260 --> 20:22.530
Alicia...

20:23.200 --> 20:27.110
You didn't know that this 
would happen, did you?

20:27.110 --> 20:30.820
Of course not! I'll beat 
her fair and square!

20:30.820 --> 20:33.500
Uh, no, you don't need to beat anyone.

20:34.370 --> 20:36.990
But yeah, I guess not.

20:36.990 --> 20:39.670
There's no way you could've known.

20:46.780 --> 20:50.010
Ah, that was excellent control.

20:50.240 --> 20:53.710
Alicia, the king has suggested

20:53.710 --> 20:59.090
that we accelerate your entry 
into the Magic Academy.

20:59.090 --> 21:00.470
Really?!

21:00.470 --> 21:05.990
Yes. As a special exception, you'll be 
permitted to enroll at age thirteen.

21:06.500 --> 21:08.000
Keep working hard.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.110
I will!

21:09.730 --> 21:13.270
<i>I continued my training after that.</i>

21:16.930 --> 21:20.290
<i>And then, three years passed.</i>

21:17.000 --> 21:20.880
<b></b>And then, three years passed.

21:22.600 --> 21:25.010
Alicia. A pleasure to see you again.

21:25.290 --> 21:28.530
Yes. It has been three years.

21:29.900 --> 21:32.100
You certainly have matured.

21:32.330 --> 21:35.250
I've been checking in on her periodically,

21:35.250 --> 21:39.400
and she has not lost control of 
her mana in the past three years.

21:39.400 --> 21:42.950
I see. What level of magic have you reached?

21:43.240 --> 21:44.980
Level 80.

21:45.240 --> 21:47.040
Level 80?!

21:47.040 --> 21:50.020
Well, now... That's more than I expected.

21:50.020 --> 21:53.210
I approve of your enrollment 
in the Magic Academy.

21:53.730 --> 21:56.730
Also, I have a favor to ask of you.

21:57.850 --> 22:03.190
Alicia, would you agree to 
serve as Liz Cather's watcher?

22:04.050 --> 22:07.590
<i>Liz Cather's... watcher?</i>
