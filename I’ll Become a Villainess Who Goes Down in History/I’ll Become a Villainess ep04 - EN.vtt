WEBVTT

00:00.360 --> 00:05.570
Alicia, would you agree to 
serve as Liz Cather's watcher?

00:06.130 --> 00:07.810
What does that mean?

00:07.810 --> 00:10.290
Are you familiar with 
the legend of the Saint?

00:10.290 --> 00:11.400
Yes...

00:11.400 --> 00:15.360
Someday, a girl beloved 
by the gods will appear.

00:15.360 --> 00:17.590
The Saint will work with the royal family

00:17.590 --> 00:20.190
to bring prosperity to the nation of Durkis.

00:20.770 --> 00:22.160
You are well-informed.

00:22.390 --> 00:24.380
I read about it in a book.

00:24.380 --> 00:26.260
<i>It was in the game!</i>

00:26.630 --> 00:31.160
We believe that Liz Cather is the Saint.

00:31.160 --> 00:33.830
I've heard that you and Liz have met.

00:33.830 --> 00:36.830
What did she seem like in your eyes?

00:37.110 --> 00:40.360
Her head is quite the lovely field of flowers.

00:40.360 --> 00:42.150
You <i>are</i> ruthless.

00:42.150 --> 00:43.960
But I can't deny that.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.600
Joan, bring it.

00:50.320 --> 00:53.810
It's an essay about the village of Roana.

00:56.780 --> 01:00.700
<i>Yikes! What kind of wild rambling is this?</i>

01:00.700 --> 01:04.070
If she is to be involved in 
our government as the Saint,

01:04.070 --> 01:06.720
she must be capable of making 
realistic judgments.

01:06.720 --> 01:12.300
So, Alicia, I want you to guide Liz 
toward becoming a respectable Saint.

01:13.450 --> 01:17.860
<i>Wouldn't that make me the best person 
there is, not the villainess?</i>

01:18.420 --> 01:20.280
I'm against this!

01:20.280 --> 01:22.160
Given the current state of the Academy,

01:22.160 --> 01:24.100
saddling her with such a task would be...

01:25.370 --> 01:28.340
She is deeply loved by many people.

01:28.340 --> 01:31.310
However, that love has gone 
beyond simple affection,

01:31.310 --> 01:34.190
and begun to verge on widespread worship.

01:34.710 --> 01:39.780
There is essentially no one left at the 
Academy who would speak out against her.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.800
<i>Is that what they call "plot armor"?</i>

01:43.150 --> 01:46.950
Do you know what happens 
to people who confute her

01:46.950 --> 01:49.930
or criticize her in front of 
her overzealous supporters?

01:49.930 --> 01:52.700
They may find themselves 
hated and ostracized.

01:52.900 --> 01:54.100
<i>Hated?</i>

01:54.100 --> 01:56.730
You can refuse him, Alicia.

01:56.730 --> 01:59.480
You don't have to take on 
the role of the bad guy.

01:59.480 --> 02:01.550
I gladly accept.

02:02.550 --> 02:07.410
I, Alicia Williams, will become 
the greatest villainess of all time!

02:15.730 --> 02:22.740
I'll Become a <b>Villainess</b>
Who Goes Down in History

03:38.030 --> 03:42.990
<b>The Villainess and the Flower Field</b>

03:43.320 --> 03:46.920
What are the people at that castle thinking?

03:46.920 --> 03:49.220
What do you even get out of this?

03:49.470 --> 03:53.170
I didn't agree to it for free, of course.

03:53.170 --> 03:56.330
I made the king accept my conditions.

03:56.330 --> 03:59.010
Gill, you're going to leave 
this town and come with me.

03:59.010 --> 03:59.850
Huh?!

04:03.210 --> 04:05.390
Goodness, that was quite a shock.

04:05.390 --> 04:07.560
And so were the conditions she set.

04:08.020 --> 04:13.680
I want to bring a boy named Gill 
from Roana to the Academy with me.

04:13.680 --> 04:15.390
From Roana, you say?

04:15.390 --> 04:19.980
Alicia... You're not saying you 
went to that village, are you?

04:20.240 --> 04:22.540
I've been going there for years now.

04:26.170 --> 04:28.320
When I met Gill, he was six.

04:28.690 --> 04:31.030
His parents had already been killed,

04:31.030 --> 04:33.410
and he was on the verge of death himself.

04:33.650 --> 04:38.670
What sin does he bear for simply 
being the son of criminals?

04:38.670 --> 04:43.180
There are people in Roana whose 
talents are going to waste there.

04:43.390 --> 04:46.530
If they could just have a 
chance to get an education...

04:47.400 --> 04:50.480
There could be no one better 
suited for the job.

04:51.380 --> 04:53.560
I get to leave the village?

04:53.950 --> 04:57.600
You'll be doing so as my servant, though.

04:57.600 --> 05:02.600
B-But don't people who work for nobles 
need to be of good breeding, as well?

05:02.600 --> 05:04.700
Oh my, so you <i>don't</i> want to go?

05:04.700 --> 05:06.310
I do!

05:06.310 --> 05:10.430
You're plenty good enough. This 
villainess discovered you, after all.

05:10.430 --> 05:13.350
You need to be greedy enough to grab 
any chance that comes your way.

05:15.340 --> 05:17.410
This is unprecedented.

05:17.410 --> 05:20.130
No resident of this village ever leaves it.

05:20.130 --> 05:22.560
I'm only getting started.

05:22.560 --> 05:25.210
The Saint has her eye on this village.

05:25.210 --> 05:26.200
What?

05:26.200 --> 05:29.590
The rest of the world will soon 
take an interest in it, as well.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.360
Change is coming to this place.

05:33.830 --> 05:38.350
Grandpa Will, do you have any 
desire to return to the castle?

05:39.520 --> 05:44.750
I'm thinking of asking the king
 to help you, as well.

05:44.750 --> 05:46.990
I appreciate the thought, but...

05:47.440 --> 05:49.830
I'm a criminal.

05:49.830 --> 05:53.090
I accepted my fate the moment 
I came to this village.

05:55.680 --> 05:57.950
<i>I put him on the spot, didn't I?</i>

05:58.360 --> 05:59.660
<i>Still...</i>

05:59.930 --> 06:04.100
<i>I can't believe I have to guide the 
author of that shiny, happy fairy tale.</i>

06:08.000 --> 06:10.790
<i>She's wounded all over!</i>

06:11.280 --> 06:13.100
Help... me...

06:14.410 --> 06:18.010
<i>Stay calm. Villainesses 
don't act on emotion.</i>

06:18.010 --> 06:19.630
<i>They act on logic.</i>

06:28.360 --> 06:30.690
<i>I can't use this to treat her!</i>

06:34.030 --> 06:36.130
<i>I'll attract attention, but...</i>

06:36.900 --> 06:41.730
<i>Casually saving a feeble 
life or two on a whim?</i>

06:41.730 --> 06:43.290
<i>That's the villainess way!</i>

06:46.500 --> 06:48.290
The water is shining...

06:48.290 --> 06:49.710
Is it magic?

06:55.560 --> 06:57.720
Alicia! What are you doing?!

06:58.040 --> 07:01.400
She asked me for help.

07:01.400 --> 07:03.440
What is a noble doing here?

07:07.810 --> 07:09.800
Barrier magic?

07:09.800 --> 07:11.950
You can't use that here!

07:13.290 --> 07:16.810
<i>Extensive burns... and some are infected.</i>

07:18.790 --> 07:21.000
<i>Her right leg is necrotic 
from the knee down.</i>

07:21.280 --> 07:23.740
<i>Can </i>any<i> magic restore this?</i>

07:23.740 --> 07:26.290
She can't be saved.

07:27.090 --> 07:29.530
I think she's from a house that burned down.

07:29.980 --> 07:32.940
In this village, once you're 
hurt bad, you're doomed to die.

07:33.260 --> 07:36.420
<i>I was being arrogant again.</i>

07:37.450 --> 07:39.520
<i>I learned both magic and 
the sword so quickly</i>

07:40.260 --> 07:42.980
<i>that I was convinced I could do anything.</i>

07:44.220 --> 07:47.110
<i>But this is the world of a video game,</i>

07:47.110 --> 07:51.980
<i>and just being the rival of its 
protagonist doesn't make me omnipotent.</i>

07:52.340 --> 07:54.200
<i>There are some things I can't fix.</i>

07:54.660 --> 07:57.650
In her state, she will soon die.

07:58.620 --> 08:01.530
Is the greatest villainess 
of the same opinion?

08:02.510 --> 08:05.960
A villainess isn't a doctor... That's...

08:05.960 --> 08:12.970
Why don't you tell me what a "villainess 
who goes down in history" is?

08:13.860 --> 08:16.170
The villainess I strive to be...

08:16.510 --> 08:20.280
is ambitious and hates lip service,

08:20.280 --> 08:22.550
and always remains calm and prudent.

08:22.550 --> 08:26.220
She's a strong woman to her very core!

08:27.520 --> 08:28.600
I see.

08:29.300 --> 08:33.310
<i>That's right. A true villainess 
doesn't give up until the very end.</i>

08:33.870 --> 08:36.690
<i>Dark magic includes lots of healing spells,</i>

08:37.170 --> 08:42.520
<i>but the ones I know only soothe cystic 
acne inflammation and rough skin...</i>

08:43.600 --> 08:44.870
<i>Inflammation!</i>

08:49.370 --> 08:52.550
If an ordinary user can 
heal rough skin with it,

08:52.550 --> 08:54.640
I need to be able to heal this much,

08:54.640 --> 08:57.800
or I can't call myself the greatest 
villainess in the world!

09:05.560 --> 09:09.100
Enhance output! More! More!

09:09.390 --> 09:11.530
What incredible magic power...

09:11.530 --> 09:13.040
K-Keep it up!

09:22.200 --> 09:23.170
Did you do it?

09:23.470 --> 09:25.550
Her treatment isn't complete.

09:26.790 --> 09:27.910
You're not gonna—

09:27.910 --> 09:31.100
Bite down on that cloth. 
I'll do this in one stroke.

09:41.520 --> 09:42.660
I...

09:44.090 --> 09:45.890
Don't get up too quickly.

09:48.010 --> 09:50.770
My leg! Where'd it go?!

09:50.770 --> 09:52.640
It was necrotic.

09:52.640 --> 09:55.830
If left alone, it would 
have endangered your life.

09:55.830 --> 09:57.110
But...

09:58.930 --> 10:02.610
You survived your ordeal. You did well.

10:07.890 --> 10:12.550
If I'd sought help from 
anyone but you, I'd be...

10:13.340 --> 10:14.680
Thank you so m—

10:15.300 --> 10:17.390
Don't thank me.

10:17.390 --> 10:20.330
I don't help people out of 
the goodness of my heart.

10:20.330 --> 10:22.420
I expect to be repaid in kind.

10:24.230 --> 10:27.410
My name is Alicia. Yours?

10:27.410 --> 10:29.630
It's... Rebecca.

10:29.630 --> 10:33.980
Rebecca, you're going to 
be my personal informant.

10:33.980 --> 10:35.120
Huh?

10:39.790 --> 10:41.660
Behold!

10:41.660 --> 10:45.580
This woman, brought back from
 the brink of death, is a true miracle!

10:45.580 --> 10:48.300
She's the savior who will guide 
your village: Lady Rebecca!

10:48.300 --> 10:50.950
Huh? Wh-What are you talking about?

10:52.400 --> 10:56.060
I want you to gather up 
the voices of the villagers,

10:56.060 --> 10:58.120
as their provisional savior.

10:58.380 --> 11:01.790
That's your price? But what for?

11:02.310 --> 11:05.290
So I can use the Saint as a 
pretext to become a villainess!

11:05.550 --> 11:08.470
Use the Saint as a pretext? 
What does that mean?

11:08.730 --> 11:11.750
I told you about Liz Cather's essay, right?

11:11.750 --> 11:14.310
In order to make that fairy tale a reality,

11:14.310 --> 11:18.470
I, as her watcher, need to 
get to know Roana better.

11:19.900 --> 11:23.900
Do you think you can change Roana?

11:23.900 --> 11:26.930
I'll just be the mastermind pulling 
the strings behind the scenes.

11:27.300 --> 11:30.450
It'll be the residents of the 
village who actually change it.

11:30.450 --> 11:33.930
I still have no intention 
of leaving the village.

11:34.380 --> 11:35.850
Grandpa Will?

11:35.850 --> 11:42.640
Hearing what you said made me want to stay 
until the end and see how Roana changes.

11:42.640 --> 11:45.150
Not that I can literally <i>see</i> it, of course.

11:46.820 --> 11:48.130
Grandpa Will...

11:54.180 --> 11:57.020
That'll temporarily allow you 
to pass through the barrier.

11:58.110 --> 12:00.170
Take care of yourselves, now.

12:00.170 --> 12:01.460
You too.

12:16.770 --> 12:19.530
How can it be so <i>different</i>?

12:19.530 --> 12:22.280
Did I do something that bad?

12:22.630 --> 12:24.370
Oh, so you did?

12:24.760 --> 12:25.880
No!

12:26.230 --> 12:29.310
Then you can carry yourself with pride.

12:31.980 --> 12:36.980
I'll Become a <b>Villainess</b>
Who Goes Down in History

12:33.070 --> 12:34.980
<i>Being little is my weapon!</i>

12:36.980 --> 12:41.990
I'll Become a <b>Villainess
</b>Who Goes Down in History

12:37.900 --> 12:40.940
<i>My neck always feels so stiff in the morning.</i>

12:46.070 --> 12:48.910
Well, Father, I'll be off now.

12:48.910 --> 12:52.120
Alicia... You aren't regretting 
your decision, are you?

12:52.120 --> 12:53.570
Not one bit!

12:53.570 --> 12:58.010
By the way, you promised you'd tell 
me when I entered the Academy...

12:58.010 --> 13:01.710
Why I wasn't allowed to 
take the swordsmanship test?

13:02.000 --> 13:04.790
Because you're just too incredible.

13:06.430 --> 13:10.000
Well, I'll take that as a compliment.

13:10.420 --> 13:12.180
<i>It's finally time!</i>

13:12.450 --> 13:15.850
<i>Saint versus villainess! It all starts here!</i>

13:16.190 --> 13:18.950
Hey, that's Miss Alicia, isn't it?

13:18.950 --> 13:20.410
The one who got a special exception?

13:20.740 --> 13:23.950
I heard her servant is an orphaned commoner.

13:24.350 --> 13:26.770
Are you Miss Alicia?

13:28.030 --> 13:30.350
Miss Liz told me all about you.

13:30.350 --> 13:32.510
You're Master Albert's little sister, right?

13:32.510 --> 13:37.030
Oh, but she looks more like 
Master Alan and Master Henri.

13:37.030 --> 13:41.740
You're right! I wonder if Master 
Henri's hair is this silky, too!

13:41.970 --> 13:45.380
Aren't you being rather 
rude? How unpleasant.

13:45.380 --> 13:47.920
That's so mean! We were just—

13:47.920 --> 13:50.250
Alicia, dear! Good morning!

13:50.950 --> 13:53.630
<i>And here comes the Saint.</i>

13:53.630 --> 13:56.480
I've been so excited to see you!

13:56.480 --> 13:57.880
Miss Liz!

13:57.880 --> 14:02.160
She suddenly struck us and 
said we were unpleasant!

14:02.160 --> 14:04.770
What? Is that true, Alicia?

14:04.770 --> 14:07.530
We only just met. They 
were being too friendly.

14:10.390 --> 14:13.620
But that's no reason to hurt someone.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.920
Be brave and apologize, okay?

14:18.920 --> 14:21.830
Don't worry. I know they'll forgive you.

14:22.750 --> 14:24.410
No, thank you.

14:30.780 --> 14:34.560
Was it a good idea to disagree 
in front of so many people?

14:36.030 --> 14:39.150
It was the perfect introduction 
for a villainess!

14:39.150 --> 14:41.020
This couldn't have gone better!

14:41.570 --> 14:43.800
I gotta keep it together...

14:44.110 --> 14:46.140
What sort of evil deed shall—

14:48.710 --> 14:50.030
Alicia?

14:57.270 --> 14:59.340
You appear well, Alicia.

14:59.340 --> 15:04.250
Prince Duke! Bringing me here with 
transport magic is tyrannic—

15:05.310 --> 15:08.670
Why didn't you refuse the king's request?

15:08.960 --> 15:12.040
<i>He knew about the watcher thing?</i>

15:12.040 --> 15:14.250
That's supposed to be top secret.

15:14.810 --> 15:16.470
I'm a prince, remember?

15:18.250 --> 15:23.460
<i>The Saint works with the royal family 
to bring prosperity to Durkis.</i>

15:23.970 --> 15:27.720
<i>In the game, Prince Duke was already 
in love with the heroine by now.</i>

15:27.720 --> 15:31.020
<i>He's suspicious of me, the villainess!</i>

15:31.450 --> 15:34.280
Because it means I can say 
whatever I want to the Saint.

15:34.690 --> 15:39.200
If it's His Majesty's orders, I can't
 be punished for doing evil.

15:49.440 --> 15:51.000
<i>Is he going to tear it off?</i>

15:51.620 --> 15:53.920
<i>That'd be a scene befitting a villainess.</i>

15:58.060 --> 15:59.980
You're still wearing it, I see.

16:01.520 --> 16:02.640
I'm glad.

16:04.680 --> 16:05.980
You're adorable.

16:06.390 --> 16:10.300
What kind of evil is a girl who 
turns red over that going to do?

16:11.740 --> 16:14.640
Even for a prince, this 
is a breach of etiquette!

16:20.820 --> 16:22.600
<i>What a shock!</i>

16:22.600 --> 16:26.790
<i>Prince Duke is the type who'd do that to 
someone who isn't the woman he loves?!</i>

16:26.790 --> 16:27.700
Alicia!

16:29.880 --> 16:31.540
You startled me!

16:31.540 --> 16:33.630
That's quite the look you have on your face.

16:34.470 --> 16:36.050
It's nothing!

16:36.740 --> 16:39.420
<i>This is a blunder unbecoming 
of a villainess!</i>

16:39.420 --> 16:41.500
<i>I have to switch gears!</i>

16:47.100 --> 16:49.010
Alicia, dear!

16:49.010 --> 16:51.310
This is quite the large tea party.

16:51.560 --> 16:53.530
Would you like to join us?

16:54.660 --> 16:57.830
<i>Well, well. Her whole fan club's here.</i>

16:58.120 --> 17:01.800
<i>It looks like the stage is set. 
I guess it's time to begin.</i>

17:02.520 --> 17:05.170
As much as I appreciate your kind offer...

17:05.170 --> 17:08.380
Would you mind sharing your 
thoughts with me today?

17:08.380 --> 17:09.790
That's...

17:10.240 --> 17:12.440
It's your essay.

17:12.440 --> 17:16.900
It was so well-received that
 the teacher made a copy for me.

17:17.220 --> 17:18.250
Oh, my!

17:18.250 --> 17:22.770
So, you believe that all 
people are equal, yes?

17:23.180 --> 17:27.070
And that the hierarchy assigned to 
them by this nation is a problem.

17:27.070 --> 17:30.720
Yes, which is why I think 
they should get rid of

17:30.720 --> 17:34.190
the wall around Roana, 
as it symbolizes poverty.

17:34.830 --> 17:38.330
Once freed, the people can 
live happy, abundant lives,

17:38.330 --> 17:41.640
and our citizens will be pleased to have 
more neighbors who enjoy good fortune.

17:41.640 --> 17:45.590
If everyone is happy, there 
will be no more inequality!

17:48.960 --> 17:52.010
It's far too shallow and unrealistic,

17:52.010 --> 17:55.680
not to mention so boring that 
I struggled to read it to the end.

17:57.010 --> 17:58.460
How could you?!

17:58.460 --> 18:01.090
<i>That was the model villainess move.</i>

18:01.540 --> 18:04.690
<i>Now it's your turn, heroine.</i>

18:04.690 --> 18:11.070
Alicia, dear... Could you tell me 
why you find it unrealistic, then?

18:11.070 --> 18:14.250
It's impossible for all people to be equal.

18:14.620 --> 18:16.890
Your essay is nothing more than a fairy tale.

18:16.890 --> 18:21.280
But if we give up on pursuing that 
ideal, that will be the end if it!

18:21.280 --> 18:34.210
<b></b>Academy - Rose Garden

18:21.560 --> 18:24.080
<i>Right. In the game,</i>

18:24.080 --> 18:28.230
<i>the heroine gives her dauntless rebuttal,
 the conquerable boys' affection for her rises,</i>

18:28.230 --> 18:30.760
<i>and that's when the villainess leaves.</i>

18:31.290 --> 18:33.770
<i>But I wanted her to put up more of a fight!</i>

18:34.210 --> 18:38.200
You think destroying the wall will 
eliminate inequality based on birth,

18:38.200 --> 18:40.350
but is it really that simple?

18:40.810 --> 18:43.150
If it's done without proper 
measures in place,

18:43.150 --> 18:44.900
public order will only deteriorate.

18:45.140 --> 18:48.020
How can you speak so badly 
of those villagers?

18:48.020 --> 18:50.800
Are you assuming the rescued 
villagers won't be grateful,

18:50.800 --> 18:52.760
and will instead run around
 and cause trouble?

18:52.760 --> 18:55.060
Would it not be arrogant for a third party

18:55.060 --> 18:58.900
to claim they cleared away the resentment 
they felt from being oppressed?

18:58.900 --> 19:02.690
Alicia, dear, nothing good comes 
from clinging to resentment.

19:02.690 --> 19:05.580
Forgiveness will bring 
about an age of peace.

19:05.580 --> 19:08.500
Idealistic arguments won't change anything.

19:08.500 --> 19:11.360
You need to arrive at a calm 
recognition of reality,

19:11.360 --> 19:14.290
and then do all the things that 
must be done, one at a time.

19:14.290 --> 19:17.710
That approach is what's 
missing in your essay.

19:25.310 --> 19:27.180
I've heard just about enough!

19:27.450 --> 19:30.630
I was only pointing out 
the flaws in her essay.

19:30.630 --> 19:34.460
In fact, I'm surprised no one 
brought them up sooner.

19:34.460 --> 19:36.020
Everyone's too busy fawning over her.

19:36.280 --> 19:38.600
Don't you <i>dare</i> insult the bond we have!

19:40.070 --> 19:43.610
I guess blind acceptance is how 
you show your love for her.

19:43.610 --> 19:46.190
With so many people here,

19:46.190 --> 19:48.900
how can every single one 
of you be so useless?

19:49.150 --> 19:51.360
I don't mind if you disavow me,

19:51.360 --> 19:53.420
but don't speak ill of my friends!

19:53.750 --> 19:54.800
Liz...

19:56.120 --> 19:59.070
A cheerful disposition that 
makes everyone love you,

19:59.070 --> 20:02.500
lovely looks, an incomparable 
amount of mana,

20:02.500 --> 20:05.510
and unprecedented proficiency 
in every magical element.

20:05.510 --> 20:07.540
You certainly are <i>blessed</i>.

20:07.540 --> 20:11.400
As I see it, you yourself are 
the symbol of inequality.

20:11.400 --> 20:12.220
Huh?

20:12.220 --> 20:14.600
Oh, don't take it the wrong way.

20:14.600 --> 20:18.480
I don't believe there's any need 
for all people to be equal.

20:18.850 --> 20:21.380
Environment, family, looks, and talents...

20:21.380 --> 20:24.900
no matter how much the disparities 
shrink, no two will be the same.

20:24.900 --> 20:31.100
But that's what makes people competitive 
and ambitious enough to train and grow.

20:31.100 --> 20:35.430
The hierarchy that results 
from that is a healthy thing.

20:35.860 --> 20:40.420
If people are no longer praised for their 
strengths in the name of equality,

20:40.420 --> 20:42.490
would that not be unfair in itself?

20:43.160 --> 20:45.470
I... wouldn't say that...

20:45.470 --> 20:48.630
Then what <i>is</i> your idea of equality?

20:50.690 --> 20:53.070
As someone so powerful and blessed,

20:53.070 --> 20:59.150
you don't realize how influential your 
thoughtless lip service really is.

20:59.150 --> 21:01.560
And when lip service isn't enough anymore,

21:01.560 --> 21:04.990
the weaker areas are left 
to take up the burden.

21:04.990 --> 21:06.230
Alicia...

21:06.610 --> 21:08.860
Liz! Such sophistry can't—

21:08.860 --> 21:12.150
You're right that I didn't 
think it through enough.

21:12.950 --> 21:17.900
But I still think it's wrong to 
give up on pursuing our ideals.

21:17.900 --> 21:21.000
I want to strive for a world 
where everyone can be happy!

21:21.670 --> 21:23.400
<i>That's the way.</i>

21:23.400 --> 21:27.270
<i>No one would trust a heroine 
who gave in to evil so easily.</i>

21:27.270 --> 21:30.840
I was hoping for a more constructive debate.

21:30.840 --> 21:32.460
I see I wasted my time.

21:39.280 --> 21:42.560
Miss Liz, please don't mind her.

21:42.560 --> 21:46.780
No, Alicia said all that for my benefit.

21:50.890 --> 21:53.040
<i>Alicia Williams!</i>

21:55.440 --> 21:58.730
My battle against the Saint 
didn't go too badly, I'd say!

21:59.290 --> 22:01.740
<i>Next time she spouts 
goody-two-shoes lines like that,</i>

22:01.740 --> 22:03.980
<i>I'll cut her off on the spot.</i>

22:03.980 --> 22:05.220
<i>After all, I'm...</i>

22:05.720 --> 22:07.780
the villainess in this story!
