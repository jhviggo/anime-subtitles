WEBVTT

00:12.041 --> 00:13.125
Where am I?

00:15.041 --> 00:16.166
A storage shed?

00:22.083 --> 00:25.000
<i>I was knocked out and kidnapped!</i>

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
<i>The villainess was never</i>
<i>kidnapped in the game...</i>

00:30.000 --> 00:32.041
Oh, you're awake?

00:34.166 --> 00:35.166
Gill!

00:39.166 --> 00:41.166
Let the child go...

00:41.166 --> 00:43.125
if you don't want to die!

00:45.125 --> 00:47.083
<i>I can't use my magic!</i>

00:48.125 --> 00:51.000
<i>This collar is suppressing it...</i>

00:57.125 --> 01:01.041
If <i>I</i> don't want to die... what, now?!

01:04.000 --> 01:05.041
Alicia!

01:05.208 --> 01:08.125
You'd better watch your mouth!

01:08.125 --> 01:11.208
Alicia, run! This is the
north side of the schoo—

01:12.125 --> 01:13.166
Shut up!

01:16.125 --> 01:19.083
This trash won't get us any money.

01:20.041 --> 01:21.208
Should we just kill him now?

01:25.000 --> 01:27.041
Kill him, you say?

01:27.208 --> 01:29.041
The real trash...

01:29.208 --> 01:31.125
is you.

01:40.166 --> 01:47.166
I'LL BECOME A VILLAINESS
WHO GOES DOWN IN HISTORY

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
THE VILLAINESS AND SLEEPING SIDE BY SIDE

03:12.166 --> 03:14.083
Gill, we have to run!

03:15.125 --> 03:17.166
Sorry... My leg's broken.

03:20.041 --> 03:22.083
Y-You little...

03:22.083 --> 03:27.041
Taken down by a brat whose magic
was sealed? You're pathetic.

03:27.041 --> 03:28.166
Hold her down!

03:29.000 --> 03:31.166
<i>This may be the world of a game...</i>

03:34.083 --> 03:35.125
Little brat!

03:35.125 --> 03:38.041
<i>But what's happening right now is real!</i>

03:38.125 --> 03:39.083
Damn it!

03:40.041 --> 03:42.125
<i>I refuse to let Gill die.</i>

03:43.000 --> 03:44.083
<i>So...</i>

03:44.083 --> 03:46.000
<i>I can't die, either!</i>

03:46.166 --> 03:48.083
I'll kill you!

03:52.208 --> 03:54.083
<i>She didn't kill him...</i>

03:55.083 --> 03:56.125
Why, you—

04:03.166 --> 04:08.208
<i>Even in this situation, Alicia holds on</i>
<i>to reason and doesn't cross that line.</i>

04:12.125 --> 04:14.125
They're just cowards.

04:21.125 --> 04:22.125
You're kidding me!

04:43.041 --> 04:44.083
That's enough!

04:51.166 --> 04:54.166
<i>I'm being restrained... with magic?!</i>

04:55.000 --> 04:58.083
Alicia, dear! How could you
do something so awful?!

04:58.083 --> 05:01.125
Stop it, Liz! That guy's the enemy here!

05:01.125 --> 05:04.125
I saw Alicia attack him!

05:10.166 --> 05:12.041
Die!

05:12.125 --> 05:14.000
Stop!

05:23.208 --> 05:26.208
There should be two others!
Don't let any of them escape!

05:26.208 --> 05:27.166
Right!

05:27.166 --> 05:29.125
Sorry I'm late.

05:29.125 --> 05:31.125
Prince Duke, your arm!

05:31.125 --> 05:32.166
It's fine.

05:34.083 --> 05:37.208
They were about to kill Gill... and I...

05:39.166 --> 05:42.166
You're going to be fine.
We'll treat you right away.

05:43.041 --> 05:44.041
Henri...

05:45.125 --> 05:47.000
Thank goodness.

05:54.083 --> 05:56.083
Liz! Are you all right?!

05:57.166 --> 06:00.125
Alicia! You're all beat up!

06:00.208 --> 06:02.166
Brother Albert...

06:02.166 --> 06:05.041
The guards took the kidnappers into custody.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.041
Are you okay?

06:08.041 --> 06:09.083
Albert!

06:09.166 --> 06:13.083
Alicia tried to kill a man
who wasn't resisting!

06:14.041 --> 06:15.041
What?!

06:15.041 --> 06:17.208
<i>They're</i> the ones who
tried to kill her first!

06:17.208 --> 06:20.083
Alicia was protecting me!

06:21.166 --> 06:25.000
Even so, if you tried to
sincerely talk to them,

06:25.000 --> 06:27.083
you wouldn't have had to resort to violence.

06:28.166 --> 06:34.083
Would you not draw your sword if a member
of your family was about to be killed?

06:36.125 --> 06:37.166
I wouldn't, no.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.125
So you've forgotten your pride as a knight.

06:42.125 --> 06:45.000
Why don't you understand?

06:45.000 --> 06:48.041
Violence only breeds further hatred!

06:48.041 --> 06:52.000
That's just lip service.
I was literally about to die!

06:54.083 --> 06:57.125
But... you're not dead, are you?

06:58.166 --> 06:59.125
What?

07:00.041 --> 07:04.125
If you'd just had faith and waited
for me, I would've come to save you.

07:04.125 --> 07:07.041
<i>I</i> had faith, after all...

07:07.041 --> 07:09.041
in my bond with my friend.

07:10.125 --> 07:13.208
<i>What in the world is she talking about?</i>

07:14.083 --> 07:17.041
<i>Is this what heroines are like?</i>

07:17.041 --> 07:21.000
And Duke came running to the
rescue because I had faith...

07:25.083 --> 07:26.125
Ice?!

07:30.041 --> 07:32.083
I didn't do it for you!

07:32.083 --> 07:34.041
Don't be so full of yourself!

07:34.125 --> 07:36.166
What's the matter, Duke?!

07:37.000 --> 07:41.125
If Alicia hadn't fought back,
that boy would've been killed!

07:41.166 --> 07:45.166
How could anyone ever call
someone like you a Saint?!

07:45.166 --> 07:48.041
Listen to me! I—

07:49.041 --> 07:51.041
Stop! Stop!

07:51.166 --> 07:53.166
That's enough, both of you!

07:53.166 --> 07:56.166
What comes first right
now is patching up Ali.

08:03.041 --> 08:04.208
Thank you very muth.

08:05.125 --> 08:06.125
Muth?

08:10.208 --> 08:13.000
It must have broken when he hit me...

08:13.000 --> 08:15.166
TOOTH
- No wonder I was having trouble speaking.

08:15.166 --> 08:17.041
TOOTH
- What?

08:17.041 --> 08:20.000
Oh, no! I'll take care of you right away!

08:20.000 --> 08:21.041
No need.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.125
I've already arranged for her treatment.

08:24.125 --> 08:26.125
Duke, you misunderstand.

08:26.125 --> 08:30.000
I would never think it didn't matter
if the two of them had died!

08:30.000 --> 08:31.125
I know that.

08:32.208 --> 08:36.083
You would never tolerate
someone else's death.

08:36.125 --> 08:41.041
But would you mind looking the person
you're talking to in the eye?

08:42.166 --> 08:46.125
If I ended up in that same situation
again, I'd draw my blade.

08:46.125 --> 08:48.125
It's better than being killed.

08:49.041 --> 08:50.166
That's reality.

08:50.166 --> 08:53.041
But... But that's...

08:53.041 --> 08:54.125
Let's stop this, Liz.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.125
She just doesn't understand
what's really important yet.

08:59.208 --> 09:02.125
Alicia will understand someday.

09:03.208 --> 09:05.000
Everyone...

09:06.125 --> 09:08.166
Are you all done talking?

09:08.166 --> 09:10.083
Break it up, then.

09:11.166 --> 09:14.208
Hey! Don't treat me like a child!

09:14.208 --> 09:16.041
Quit flailing.

09:17.208 --> 09:20.208
Does Duke have feelings for...

09:21.041 --> 09:23.208
I think he sees her as a little sister.

09:23.208 --> 09:25.083
I'm so glad.

09:25.208 --> 09:30.041
I was worried about Alicia since she
seems to have trouble making friends.

09:31.041 --> 09:35.125
But if Duke is also concerned
about her... I'm glad.

09:40.125 --> 09:42.166
I can walk on my own!

09:42.166 --> 09:44.083
Look at Gill.

09:44.083 --> 09:47.083
You want to make him the servant
who lets only his master walk?

09:48.000 --> 09:50.083
I'm hurt less seriously than he is!

09:50.083 --> 09:53.083
You're just being overprotective,
Prince Duke!

09:58.125 --> 10:02.125
You're free to act however you please.

10:03.041 --> 10:06.208
But don't do things that endanger your life.

10:07.083 --> 10:08.166
I mean that.

10:09.166 --> 10:11.166
I felt like I'd died...

10:13.208 --> 10:17.083
<i>Does Prince Duke actually...</i>

10:18.000 --> 10:21.041
<i>really... significantly...</i>

10:22.083 --> 10:23.166
<i>like me?</i>

10:25.000 --> 10:25.208
<i>But...</i>

10:26.166 --> 10:29.125
<i>The prince ends up with the heroine.</i>

10:29.125 --> 10:32.083
<i>So why is it playing out like this?</i>

10:32.166 --> 10:37.000
<i>Oh, darn it! My heartbeat is too loud!</i>

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
<i>I don't know what's happening to me!</i>

10:39.166 --> 10:42.166
<i>Why... do I feel so...</i>

10:44.166 --> 10:47.000
<i>relieved... now...</i>

10:58.166 --> 11:02.000
Wh-What?!

11:04.000 --> 11:04.208
I'LL BECOME A VILLAINESS
WHO GOES DOWN IN HISTORY

11:04.208 --> 11:06.208
<i>- I will protect Alicia!</i>
I'LL BECOME A VILLAINESS
WHO GOES DOWN IN HISTORY

11:06.208 --> 11:09.166
I'LL BECOME A VILLAINESS
WHO GOES DOWN IN HISTORY

11:09.166 --> 11:13.000
<i>- Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah!</i>
I'LL BECOME A VILLAINESS
WHO GOES DOWN IN HISTORY

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
I'LL BECOME A VILLAINESS
WHO GOES DOWN IN HISTORY

11:15.125 --> 11:18.083
<i>What's going on?! Where am I?!</i>

11:18.083 --> 11:19.208
<i>Why is this...</i>

11:20.041 --> 11:22.083
<i>Take it easy, Alicia.</i>

11:22.083 --> 11:24.125
<i>Just keep calm and think.</i>

11:27.125 --> 11:30.083
I can't keep calm at all!

11:30.083 --> 11:32.166
This is your chance!

11:32.166 --> 11:35.083
You can seduce the prince and
get ahead of the heroine,

11:35.083 --> 11:38.166
and come up with the perfect fait accompli!

11:39.041 --> 11:40.208
No, you mustn't!

11:40.208 --> 11:43.125
Misconstruing the prince's consideration

11:43.125 --> 11:46.083
is something a villainess with
integrity would never do!

11:46.083 --> 11:48.125
That's such a naïve opinion!

11:48.125 --> 11:49.166
Quiet, you!

11:51.083 --> 11:53.083
I <i>do</i> want to be a villainess,

11:53.083 --> 11:55.166
but that doesn't mean I want
to be an immoral woman!

11:55.166 --> 11:59.166
But a "villainess with integrity"
doesn't make much sense, either!

12:00.000 --> 12:03.208
I'll show you by force,
in true villainess style!

12:04.208 --> 12:08.083
As a villainess, I'll accept
your challenge head-on!

12:10.166 --> 12:12.041
No hiding!

12:12.041 --> 12:13.208
Same goes for you!

12:13.208 --> 12:16.166
- Decide already!
- Ow, ow, ow! It feels all prickly!

12:16.166 --> 12:19.125
- Hot! Hot! Hot! That burns!
- Why won't you listen?!

12:19.125 --> 12:23.000
Darn it! What am I supposed to do?!

12:27.125 --> 12:31.125
<i>F-For now, I should just withdraw</i>
<i>and regain my bearings.</i>

12:31.125 --> 12:32.125
The pendant.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.083
It was stolen. I found it in one
of the kidnappers' pockets.

12:40.125 --> 12:43.083
Oh... really?

12:43.166 --> 12:46.083
Come here. I'll put it on you.

12:46.083 --> 12:47.083
Okay...

12:51.208 --> 12:53.125
<i>This is so awkward...</i>

12:56.166 --> 12:57.208
Alicia...

12:58.125 --> 12:59.166
It can't be...

13:01.166 --> 13:03.083
Alicia! You awake?

13:03.166 --> 13:05.000
Wait, what happened?

13:06.125 --> 13:10.000
I-I was just surprised because
I didn't recognize this room!

13:10.083 --> 13:11.166
Duke...

13:11.166 --> 13:15.041
I'm not opposed to you having that
kind of relationship with my sister,

13:15.041 --> 13:16.208
but did you get her consent?

13:17.125 --> 13:19.125
I didn't touch her.

13:21.166 --> 13:24.125
So... why aren't you wearing a shirt?

13:27.041 --> 13:30.083
I was worried when you didn't wake up.

13:30.083 --> 13:33.000
You were hurt much worse than I was.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.083
Are you okay now?

13:34.083 --> 13:36.000
Yeah, Henri healed me.

13:36.083 --> 13:38.041
And you, and Duke's injury, too.

13:38.041 --> 13:41.125
It seemed like Ali was the
most exhausted of us all.

13:41.125 --> 13:44.208
I'm glad she woke up before
anything serious happened.

13:46.083 --> 13:48.000
<i>Um...</i>

13:48.000 --> 13:49.083
Oh, yeah. Here.

13:50.041 --> 13:53.125
My tooth? I guess I dropped it.

13:53.125 --> 13:55.041
Can it be fixed with magic?

13:55.041 --> 13:59.083
Well, not easily, so... not to worry.

13:59.083 --> 14:01.125
Do you mind if I keep it, then?

14:01.125 --> 14:02.125
Huh?

14:03.041 --> 14:06.208
I once heard that teeth carry memories.

14:06.208 --> 14:10.083
I... don't want to forget
what happened today.

14:11.083 --> 14:12.125
It was so frustrating.

14:13.000 --> 14:17.083
I'm your pupil, but I couldn't
be of any use to you.

14:18.125 --> 14:21.041
I'm the one they were after.

14:21.041 --> 14:23.208
You just got caught up in it
and ended up a victim.

14:24.041 --> 14:26.000
That doesn't make any difference.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
I want to get stronger.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.083
I want to get stronger so I can protect you!

14:32.166 --> 14:36.166
All right. In that case, you can keep it.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.166
Okay.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.083
Gill's going to be a fine man one day.

14:40.083 --> 14:41.041
Yeah.

14:41.041 --> 14:44.208
So who was behind this whole incident?

14:44.208 --> 14:46.208
It was a student at the academy.

14:47.041 --> 14:49.041
Neil, of the Johnson family.

14:50.083 --> 14:52.083
I haven't formally met him.

14:52.166 --> 14:54.208
He's an ardent follower of Liz's.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.041
At the tea party in the rose garden,

14:58.041 --> 15:00.125
he was giving you incredibly angry looks.

15:02.125 --> 15:07.083
Well, good for him. He managed
to trick Alicia Williams.

15:07.083 --> 15:09.208
I won't let him get away
with this, of course.

15:09.208 --> 15:12.208
Now, how shall I repay him?

15:14.083 --> 15:19.000
Last time I saw him, he was
half-dead at Duke's hand...

15:19.125 --> 15:23.125
The royal family has already
punished the Johnson household.

15:23.125 --> 15:24.083
Huh?

15:24.083 --> 15:27.125
It's forbidden to take the magic-sealing
collar from where it's stored.

15:27.125 --> 15:32.208
On top of that, he brought in outsiders
to put another student's life in danger.

15:33.083 --> 15:36.041
I... I see...

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
<i>There's nothing left for me to do, then.</i>

15:40.000 --> 15:41.166
<i>Even though I'm the villainess!</i>

15:42.083 --> 15:46.083
I suspect my father had
a part in this incident.

15:47.041 --> 15:48.125
The king?!

15:48.166 --> 15:50.166
You mean the king ordered it?

15:50.166 --> 15:53.125
No, I don't think that's what happened.

15:53.166 --> 15:58.000
It was probably a perfect training
opportunity for the Saint.

16:01.000 --> 16:05.041
While I tracked down the mastermind
and forced him to talk,

16:06.000 --> 16:11.041
an observer arranged by
my father told Liz where Alicia was.

16:12.083 --> 16:14.208
I think he wanted Liz to resolve the matter

16:14.208 --> 16:17.083
so that she could grow as the Saint.

16:18.041 --> 16:21.208
What the heck?! Is the Saint
really that important?!

16:21.208 --> 16:23.041
Yes, she is.

16:23.041 --> 16:26.208
The Saint spoken of in legends
saves the kingdom, after all.

16:28.083 --> 16:34.166
And I'm the perfect choice to
stand in her way as a test.

16:35.208 --> 16:38.125
You sound awfully proud of that.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.125
I'm sorry, Alicia.

16:41.208 --> 16:46.125
It seems like my father has nothing
on his mind but the Saint of legend.

16:46.125 --> 16:50.166
But as the prince, you're going to
end up marrying Liz Cather, right?

16:52.041 --> 16:54.125
Alicia told me.

16:54.125 --> 16:58.041
She said the Saint of legend marries
the prince for a happy ending.

16:58.041 --> 17:00.041
You're destined to be with her, right?

17:03.000 --> 17:04.208
<i>Of course that's how it has to be.</i>

17:05.166 --> 17:09.208
<i>Even if he really does</i>
<i>have feelings for me...</i>

17:11.125 --> 17:14.083
<i>he's destined to be with the heroine.</i>

17:15.083 --> 17:19.083
<i>And that's fine. What I'm after is...</i>

17:20.041 --> 17:23.000
Destiny, huh? Well...

17:24.083 --> 17:27.041
I have no intention of
playing along with that.

17:27.041 --> 17:30.083
I've already chosen my own destiny.

17:33.125 --> 17:37.208
A happy ending is something you take
hold of for yourself, is it not?

17:39.083 --> 17:41.166
I'm sorry for acting out of line!

17:42.083 --> 17:44.083
I was suspicious of you.

17:44.083 --> 17:49.125
I didn't get why you'd make passes at
Alicia when you're supposed to marry Liz.

17:50.041 --> 17:51.083
Gill...

17:52.041 --> 17:53.208
Have I won your favor now?

17:54.125 --> 17:55.125
Yeah.

17:55.125 --> 17:58.125
Um... I'm a commoner,

17:58.125 --> 18:02.041
so I'll be punished for speaking rudely
to a member of the royal family, right?

18:05.125 --> 18:07.166
Status doesn't mean anything.

18:07.166 --> 18:10.208
You and I both just want to protect Alicia.

18:10.208 --> 18:12.083
We feel the same, right?

18:13.166 --> 18:16.083
Thank you for saving Alicia.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.125
Of course.

18:21.125 --> 18:25.083
<i>What kind of face should I be</i>
<i>making as I listen to this?</i>

18:28.041 --> 18:33.041
<i>In any case, I need to get stronger so</i>
<i>I don't get caught off-guard again.</i>

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
<i>Recent incidents, plus</i>
<i>the way people are acting</i>

18:36.000 --> 18:38.041
<i>are deviating too much</i>
<i>from the game's story.</i>

18:38.125 --> 18:42.041
<i>It's an unknown route...</i>
<i>but it's also my reality.</i>

18:51.041 --> 18:52.125
Not going well, huh?

18:52.125 --> 18:56.000
I just can't make any
progress beyond level 80.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.125
I must be in a slump.

18:57.125 --> 19:01.208
Getting to level 80 at your
age is already incredible.

19:01.208 --> 19:05.208
Grandpa Will said you shouldn't
rush things too much, anyway.

19:05.208 --> 19:07.083
I know that.

19:07.083 --> 19:11.041
But if I want to be a villainess,
I can't be satisfied with this.

19:12.166 --> 19:17.083
Instead of a villainess, why not make
a name for yourself as the prince's wife?

19:17.083 --> 19:19.000
That's what he wants, too.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.166
No! There's nothing interesting about
being remembered as someone's wife!

19:24.166 --> 19:27.208
I want to engrave my name in
history as my own person!

19:29.000 --> 19:33.125
And to do that, what I should strive to be is
the villainess who stands in the Saint's way!

19:33.125 --> 19:35.041
That's the only way to go!

19:36.125 --> 19:39.125
I'm starting to feel sorry for the prince...

19:40.041 --> 19:42.000
Miss Alicia.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
The master wishes to see you.

19:46.041 --> 19:47.208
What's this about?

19:48.208 --> 19:50.208
I don't agree with this!

19:51.125 --> 19:53.083
It's already been decided.

19:53.083 --> 19:56.000
You will no longer act
as Liz Cather's watcher.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.125
This is tyrannical!

19:57.125 --> 20:01.083
Besides, wasn't being her watcher the special
condition that got me into the academy?

20:01.083 --> 20:05.000
You'll be able to enroll normally
once you turn fifteen.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
There's no need to go to
such trouble to get in now.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.208
Your magic has already surpassed Albert's.

20:11.208 --> 20:15.041
I accepted that role because I wanted to!

20:15.041 --> 20:19.041
And you gave your approval,
yet now you're...

20:19.041 --> 20:23.000
I wouldn't have approved if I had
known it would endanger your life!

20:25.083 --> 20:28.166
I was a fool to think that
being the most hated student

20:28.166 --> 20:32.125
would mean, at most, getting into
a few squabbles with other students.

20:32.125 --> 20:37.166
You are exceptionally brilliant, but
you're still a thirteen-year-old girl.

20:37.166 --> 20:41.125
<i>Father is sincerely worried about me.</i>

20:42.166 --> 20:43.125
<i>But...</i>

20:43.208 --> 20:46.000
I won't quit!

20:46.000 --> 20:47.208
Please give me another chance!

20:47.208 --> 20:51.166
No. I don't want to see you in danger again.

20:51.166 --> 20:53.166
Why can't you understand that?

20:54.041 --> 20:57.000
I acknowledge that I was
too slow to act this time,

20:57.000 --> 20:59.166
but my magic puts me at the highest
level in the whole school.

21:00.041 --> 21:01.208
So long as I remain alert...

21:02.083 --> 21:06.208
Liz Cather is above
level 80 in all elements.

21:06.208 --> 21:11.166
You are well above average, too,
but you can't compete with that.

21:11.166 --> 21:14.000
I'll train even more!

21:15.208 --> 21:19.125
Fine. Then I'll set some conditions.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.125
If you can reach level 90, you
can continue to be her watcher.

21:25.125 --> 21:31.125
But... you yourself told me that
that's not realistic at my age...

21:32.125 --> 21:35.041
<i>He thinks I'll give up.</i>

21:36.083 --> 21:38.041
<i>But that won't happen.</i>

21:38.166 --> 21:40.041
Very well.

21:40.041 --> 21:44.083
But please, make this the last time you
set conditions at the last minute.

21:44.083 --> 21:46.000
Wha—

21:58.208 --> 22:01.000
Are you sure about this?

22:01.000 --> 22:03.166
Yes. I don't want anyone coming near me.

22:05.125 --> 22:09.083
<i>Whatever it takes, I </i>will
<i>reach level 90! Just watch!</i>
