00:00.540 --> 00:04.480
I think it's about time I told all of you...

00:04.480 --> 00:09.780
about Roana's future, and 
about my own boring past.

00:10.180 --> 00:14.730
I am the older brother of the 
current king, Luke Seeker...

00:15.170 --> 00:17.030
Will Seeker.

00:17.030 --> 00:17.960
What?!

00:20.660 --> 00:21.730
<i>So that man...</i>

00:22.560 --> 00:24.510
<i>was Grandpa Will?</i>

00:25.790 --> 00:27.840
So you're going to tell us

00:28.380 --> 00:32.090
what the king's older brother 
is doing here in Roana?

00:32.350 --> 00:35.580
Of course. I intend to.

00:43.770 --> 00:50.770
I'll Become a <b>Villainess</b>
Who Goes Down in History

02:06.020 --> 02:10.980
<b>The Villainess and the Past</b>

02:13.020 --> 02:18.440
I was born as the first 
son of the previous king.

02:18.440 --> 02:22.360
My mother died shortly 
after giving birth to me.

02:23.050 --> 02:26.400
Most children my age would be 
spending time with their mothers,

02:26.400 --> 02:29.130
but I was devoting myself
to the study of magic,

02:29.130 --> 02:32.960
and by the age of ten, I'd reached level 80.

02:42.480 --> 02:46.800
My! Your Highness is truly a prodigy!

02:46.800 --> 02:51.850
No. Those charged with leading a country 
are expected to possess even greater power.

02:59.430 --> 03:01.320
<i>I can do this!</i>

03:06.750 --> 03:09.510
That's... a level 100 spell?!

03:12.950 --> 03:14.980
Yes! That's it!

03:21.320 --> 03:22.290
Oh, no!

03:22.290 --> 03:24.760
I-I can't control it!

03:39.510 --> 03:44.190
<i>My life was spared, but my 
capacity to use magic was not.</i>

03:45.480 --> 03:49.910
<i>One year after that, Luke was born.</i>

03:54.740 --> 04:00.710
Is it acceptable for a low-ranking noble who 
isn't even married to give birth in the castle?

04:00.710 --> 04:04.050
Apparently, it was a special exception 
in order to produce an heir.

04:04.050 --> 04:06.940
Given that Prince Will is... you know...

04:06.940 --> 04:11.900
Yes, he can't be the next 
king if he can't use magic.

04:19.600 --> 04:23.490
I congratulate you on your 
coronation, Your Majesty.

04:23.840 --> 04:25.910
Don't talk like that, my brother.

04:26.830 --> 04:32.320
Father has told me that it is my 
job to support you at all times.

04:32.590 --> 04:35.860
I can confidently say that I have 
studied sufficiently to do so.

04:36.770 --> 04:40.290
There's no one as wise as you anywhere.

04:40.290 --> 04:41.750
I'll be counting on you.

04:43.710 --> 04:45.750
Now, let us begin.

04:45.750 --> 04:48.180
Please assist me in making policy,

04:48.580 --> 04:52.010
my three most trusted sages.

04:53.940 --> 04:57.060
<i>My friends and I did the 
thinking about the government,</i>

04:57.060 --> 04:58.860
<i>and Luke would give his approval.</i>

04:59.250 --> 05:03.330
<i>For a while, it was all going very well.</i>

05:03.730 --> 05:05.250
Brother, a moment.

05:10.400 --> 05:13.440
Brother, about these documents...

05:13.700 --> 05:16.190
Oh, you read them?

05:16.190 --> 05:18.650
In order to advance our kingdom further,

05:18.650 --> 05:21.970
rulership should be divided between 
the Five Great Noble Families.

05:21.970 --> 05:24.300
If you read that, then you 
understand everything.

05:24.650 --> 05:27.550
Yes... but I can't approve this.

05:27.860 --> 05:28.750
Huh?

05:29.000 --> 05:32.150
The negative effects of such a division 
of power would be too great.

05:32.150 --> 05:34.170
That's what my mother said,

05:34.930 --> 05:36.430
and I agree with her.

05:36.770 --> 05:40.740
All right. I'll work some 
more on the policy and—

05:40.740 --> 05:41.640
Just stop!

05:41.640 --> 05:43.580
Wh-What's the matter?

05:44.190 --> 05:46.770
I've made up my mind that 
I won't approve this!

05:46.770 --> 05:49.340
I don't want you telling me 
what's right and wrong anymore!

05:49.340 --> 05:51.120
You're not even the king!

05:56.950 --> 06:02.510
That was the last time I ever saw Luke.

06:07.430 --> 06:08.660
Will Seeker!

06:08.660 --> 06:12.600
You are to be exiled immediately 
for plotting to kill the king!

06:12.600 --> 06:14.770
That can't be! I'd never do such a thing!

06:24.240 --> 06:25.100
Rain?

06:29.740 --> 06:32.950
Hey, man, what'd you do?

06:34.030 --> 06:38.870
Where am I? I-Is there no light at all?

06:39.140 --> 06:42.160
Looks like you had your eyes gouged out.

06:42.160 --> 06:45.830
If they tossed you out 
here in Roana like that,

06:45.830 --> 06:48.460
you must've done something pretty bad.

06:58.670 --> 07:00.720
You told me once before

07:01.220 --> 07:05.240
about someone who overestimated 
their own magic and came to ruin.

07:06.080 --> 07:09.150
It was my own foolish conceit.

07:09.360 --> 07:12.700
That doesn't mean you deserved to be framed!

07:12.700 --> 07:17.380
But wait... would anyone really just 
kick the king's brother out like that?

07:17.770 --> 07:21.270
There is no existing 
record of my banishment.

07:21.270 --> 07:23.550
The official story is that I went missing.

07:24.000 --> 07:29.720
Only Luke's mother, who planned it all, 
and a handful of others know the truth.

07:29.720 --> 07:31.600
Why would they do that?

07:31.600 --> 07:35.350
Luke's mother doted on him in extremes.

07:35.740 --> 07:38.400
I must have been no more 
than an annoyance to her.

07:38.710 --> 07:41.060
Does the king know about all this?

07:41.290 --> 07:45.480
No, I believe Luke thinks I went missing.

07:45.480 --> 07:47.780
If he did, wouldn't he try to find you?

07:48.010 --> 07:52.520
Luke probably already hated me by then.

07:52.520 --> 07:55.690
He adored his mother, 
as well, so even more so.

07:56.030 --> 07:58.910
No one came looking for you at all?

07:58.910 --> 08:02.130
The three nobles that I worked with...

08:02.380 --> 08:05.610
They would have searched 
for me if they could have,

08:05.610 --> 08:09.070
but I heard they were banished to Laval.

08:09.550 --> 08:12.790
The fact that you've told us about your past

08:12.790 --> 08:16.230
means you're ready to talk to 
the king in person, doesn't it?

08:18.310 --> 08:22.680
Precisely. I must see Luke.

08:23.010 --> 08:25.040
A criminal from Roana?!

08:25.730 --> 08:26.990
It'll never work!

08:27.220 --> 08:29.720
There's no record of him 
committing any crime.

08:29.720 --> 08:32.790
No one can argue if he asserts 
that it was a false charge.

08:33.050 --> 08:37.600
Forcing innocent people to 
live here all their lives

08:37.600 --> 08:42.210
just because they happened 
to be born here is wrong.

08:42.490 --> 08:46.030
I will tell Luke that it should be set free.

08:46.510 --> 08:49.330
Set this village... free?

08:49.330 --> 08:51.190
Yes.

08:51.190 --> 08:55.750
But if I do see Luke, the first 
thing I want to do is apologize.

08:55.750 --> 08:58.260
To someone who didn't even try to find you?

08:58.620 --> 09:02.680
I failed to respect his pride as king.

09:03.060 --> 09:08.180
I thought I was giving my all for the kingdom, 
but once again, I was just being conceited.

09:08.410 --> 09:12.020
The king may be wishing he 
could apologize to you, too.

09:12.270 --> 09:14.370
Well, that would be nice.

09:14.370 --> 09:17.450
First, there is someone I must contact.

09:18.030 --> 09:19.500
Who?

09:19.500 --> 09:20.570
Alicia...

09:20.570 --> 09:21.360
Yes?

09:21.360 --> 09:26.200
It's thanks to you that I was 
able to feel this way.

09:26.200 --> 09:27.290
I'm grateful.

09:30.300 --> 09:32.090
There's no need for that.

09:32.090 --> 09:37.210
I might just be seducing you so I can 
take over this village, you know.

09:41.010 --> 09:43.800
I wouldn't even mind it if you were.

09:48.370 --> 09:50.920
I was really surprised to hear his story.

09:51.490 --> 09:53.520
Why tell us now, though?

09:53.520 --> 09:58.490
I think he's resolved himself to face 
his past so he can set Roana free.

09:59.040 --> 10:04.410
That's why he told us all about the part 
of his past that he'd kept hidden.

10:05.010 --> 10:06.000
Resolved...

10:07.110 --> 10:09.310
The reformation of the village 
is moving ahead, isn't it?

10:09.310 --> 10:10.810
Like the vigilante corps.

10:10.810 --> 10:13.750
Yeah. It's totally different 
from when I lived there.

10:14.520 --> 10:18.430
Because all the villagers 
trust Grandpa Will.

10:18.890 --> 10:23.680
He's trying to live up to their 
trust by opening a new path.

10:23.920 --> 10:26.830
He's amazing. And so are all the others, too.

10:26.830 --> 10:28.630
That's right, they are.

10:28.630 --> 10:30.300
I should learn from them.

10:30.740 --> 10:32.220
Miss Alicia!

10:35.550 --> 10:37.180
Can I help you?

10:37.430 --> 10:41.090
Well, you see, we really like you...

10:41.090 --> 10:42.980
And we hate Liz!

10:43.580 --> 10:44.790
She's a mere commoner,

10:44.790 --> 10:47.330
but batting her eyelashes got her
 onto the student council.

10:47.330 --> 10:48.910
Is she some kind of temptress?

10:49.410 --> 10:52.140
You agree, don't you, Miss Alicia?

10:52.140 --> 10:55.030
I don't like that you're goading 
me into agreeing with you.

10:55.840 --> 10:59.550
She got into the student council 
because of her exceptional talent.

10:59.550 --> 11:03.480
B-But, you're always arguing 
against Liz's opinions...

11:03.800 --> 11:06.480
Because her ideas and 
mine aren't compatible.

11:06.480 --> 11:09.380
I willingly acknowledge
her talents, however.

11:09.380 --> 11:12.440
I-Isn't her goody-two-shoes 
act so annoying, though?

11:12.440 --> 11:16.240
It's infuriating how everyone fawns 
over her even though she's a commoner!

11:16.240 --> 11:19.820
If you have a problem with her, why 
don't you complain to <i>her</i> about it?

11:20.690 --> 11:22.180
And one other thing.

11:22.180 --> 11:25.870
The boy at my side is a commoner as well, 
but he's more brilliant than you three.

11:26.270 --> 11:30.300
I like clever commoners much 
more than stupid nobles.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.660
All I did was smile at 
them, and they ran away!

11:37.660 --> 11:40.410
My villainess points just went up again!

11:43.010 --> 11:48.010
I'll Become a <b>Villainess
</b>Who Goes Down in History

11:43.210 --> 11:45.870
<i>Make us look more appealing!</i>

11:45.870 --> 11:47.620
<i>Get serious!</i>

11:48.660 --> 11:51.100
<i>We're pretty good-looking, aren't we?</i>

11:51.100 --> 11:53.010
<i>No wonder the girls won't leave us alone.</i>

11:57.370 --> 11:59.150
Classes are over!

11:59.150 --> 12:00.860
Liz, wanna go out for tea or something?

12:00.860 --> 12:02.020
Sure.

12:03.040 --> 12:04.270
Miss Liz...

12:07.720 --> 12:09.130
What are <i>you</i> doing here?

12:09.430 --> 12:10.540
Um...

12:10.540 --> 12:16.550
I hadn't apologized to Miss Liz yet for 
the trouble I caused the other day...

12:16.550 --> 12:19.360
An apology made of empty 
words is meaningless!

12:19.360 --> 12:20.350
Wait.

12:21.100 --> 12:23.190
I'm the one who should apologize.

12:23.190 --> 12:25.210
Jane, I'm sorry.

12:26.640 --> 12:30.150
It's my fault you did what you did.

12:30.150 --> 12:32.750
If only I'd had my act together...

12:32.750 --> 12:34.770
You're too kind, Miss Liz.

12:34.770 --> 12:36.430
I'm really not.

12:36.430 --> 12:39.110
That's why I want all of you 
to stop condemning Jane.

12:40.150 --> 12:41.920
If you say so, Liz.

12:41.920 --> 12:43.980
We'll get back on track with tea time.

12:43.980 --> 12:46.150
Yes, let's do that.

12:46.150 --> 12:47.860
Would you like to join us, Jane?

12:48.920 --> 12:50.200
Miss Liz...

12:55.250 --> 12:57.340
Don't take advantage of Liz's kindness.

12:57.880 --> 13:01.330
If you want to make it up to her, 
never associate yourself with her again.

13:13.810 --> 13:15.070
What are you looking at?!

13:22.600 --> 13:25.910
We have something to tell you, Miss Liz.

13:31.210 --> 13:32.350
Alicia!

13:33.120 --> 13:34.660
There you are!

13:34.660 --> 13:36.900
Well, well. Shall we head home together?

13:36.900 --> 13:38.320
We don't have time for that!

13:38.550 --> 13:40.700
We've got a mess on our hands again.

13:41.260 --> 13:42.510
A mess?!

13:42.510 --> 13:44.540
Just come with me.

13:44.540 --> 13:46.900
Trouble is exactly what I want!

13:46.900 --> 13:49.420
Ali-Ali's about to show us what she can do!

13:49.960 --> 13:51.460
How long have you been there?!

13:51.460 --> 13:54.100
The whole time, but that 
doesn't even matter!

13:54.100 --> 13:57.160
I can't miss seeing Ali-Ali 
be her badass self!

13:57.160 --> 13:58.390
I'll go get my master, too!

13:58.390 --> 14:02.030
No, wait! He can't keep 
his cool when Ali is...

14:04.270 --> 14:07.200
She's a slippery one, for sure.

14:07.200 --> 14:09.490
Well, let's go.

14:17.860 --> 14:20.380
That's not the direction 
they take home, is it?

14:20.380 --> 14:23.070
Is there some kind of 
quarrel going on again?

14:23.670 --> 14:25.060
You're going?

14:25.730 --> 14:28.510
Should be a lot more entertaining 
than playing catch.

14:35.920 --> 14:38.100
Well, I'm here. Be grateful.

14:42.900 --> 14:44.370
Alicia, dear...

14:44.810 --> 14:45.850
Yes?

14:46.120 --> 14:51.680
These girls told me that you were 
saying mean things about me.

14:51.680 --> 14:52.790
Excuse me?

14:52.790 --> 14:57.270
But there's no proof, so
 I wanted to ask you in person.

14:57.270 --> 14:58.700
I had Henri bring you here.

15:00.120 --> 15:03.660
We know what we heard! <i>That's</i> the proof!

15:03.660 --> 15:05.410
Yeah, that's right!

15:06.330 --> 15:08.300
Could you be any more rude?!

15:08.550 --> 15:10.710
If you're trying to set me up,

15:10.710 --> 15:15.480
at least use something like that 
Earth Magic again, not just lies.

15:15.480 --> 15:17.980
There's nothing fun about this otherwise.

15:17.980 --> 15:19.630
Alicia, dear...

15:19.630 --> 15:23.270
Can I take that to mean you weren't 
saying mean things about me?

15:24.230 --> 15:25.190
Yes.

15:25.190 --> 15:29.330
Okay. I believe what you say.

15:29.870 --> 15:33.440
Miss Liz! You don't believe us?!

15:33.440 --> 15:37.490
She was insulting you with 
the most utterly foul language!

15:39.050 --> 15:42.810
<i>Oh, dear. I almost feel sorry for her.</i>

15:42.810 --> 15:44.130
So, hey...

15:44.580 --> 15:47.990
Are you sure you three weren't 
the ones saying nasty stuff?

15:48.730 --> 15:51.680
Master Finn! Where in 
the world is this coming from?

15:51.680 --> 15:54.770
Finn, explain that so I can understand.

15:55.060 --> 15:59.300
Okay, well... to keep it super brief,

15:59.300 --> 16:02.620
those three were saying mean 
things about Liz to Alicia,

16:02.620 --> 16:04.560
and Alicia didn't give them the time of day.

16:04.980 --> 16:07.270
That's all I saw with my own eyes.

16:07.870 --> 16:10.470
The rest of this is just speculation,

16:10.820 --> 16:15.920
but I think they got mad when Alicia called 
them out, so they tried to trap her.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.900
Those insults were probably 
their genuine opinions.

16:20.160 --> 16:24.950
In other words, I think they 
were using Liz to set up Alicia.

16:24.950 --> 16:27.830
They're dumb <i>and</i> rotten to the core!

16:28.120 --> 16:29.660
Don't point at people.

16:29.660 --> 16:31.060
'Kay!

16:31.060 --> 16:32.500
Talk about boring, though.

16:32.500 --> 16:35.630
I came to see Ali-Ali be badass, 
but they lost all on their own.

16:35.630 --> 16:37.840
They can't even pull off victimhood right!

16:38.140 --> 16:39.930
That's enough.

16:41.610 --> 16:46.810
<i>As the villainess, I should do 
something to move things along.</i>

16:47.320 --> 16:49.900
Hey, you stupid girls.

16:50.220 --> 16:54.150
Do you think someone will come 
to your rescue if you cry?

16:54.150 --> 16:59.200
To do something so vulgar and cowardly 
without being prepared to suffer for it...

16:59.200 --> 17:00.450
You're less than trash.

17:02.850 --> 17:04.870
Did you just say "trash"?

17:06.530 --> 17:09.690
Yes, maybe these girls did something wrong,

17:09.690 --> 17:11.410
but calling them trash is too much!

17:11.670 --> 17:13.840
Oh, how very moving.

17:14.190 --> 17:15.930
Are you making fun of me?

17:16.390 --> 17:18.560
No, I'm impressed!

17:18.560 --> 17:23.910
I wouldn't have it in me to defend some 
less-than-trash girls who insulted me!

17:23.910 --> 17:25.280
That's enough!

17:25.980 --> 17:29.450
Can't you comprehend Liz's 
kindness and strength at all?!

17:29.710 --> 17:31.930
Now, what brought this on?

17:31.930 --> 17:35.600
Liz is trying to protect these girls!

17:35.920 --> 17:40.790
Trying to protect nobles, even though 
they dislike her, is what Liz does!

17:40.790 --> 17:43.320
How do you protect someone with just words?

17:43.320 --> 17:44.550
It's not just words!

17:44.550 --> 17:47.580
That time when a wild wolf 
showed up at the academy,

17:47.990 --> 17:50.300
Liz protected us all, even 
though she was trembling!

17:50.300 --> 17:52.580
She has the courage to conquer fear!

17:52.580 --> 17:54.860
Huh? A wild wolf?

17:54.860 --> 17:56.540
Yeah! What of it?

17:57.720 --> 18:03.310
How does an animal that doesn't even 
live in Durkis show up at this academy?

18:03.310 --> 18:05.670
What difference does that make right now?!

18:07.600 --> 18:09.280
I've lost interest.

18:10.590 --> 18:11.990
You're running away?!

18:11.990 --> 18:12.930
Eric.

18:13.490 --> 18:15.910
You went and said too much.

18:22.270 --> 18:25.660
<i>Alicia... I guess you and 
I really can't be...</i>

18:31.750 --> 18:34.680
Commoners are so useless.

18:34.680 --> 18:39.670
I agree. From now on, I'm putting 
my trust in Liz the Saint.

18:40.050 --> 18:42.310
You two are exactly right.

18:45.020 --> 18:48.310
They don't even realize they're 
contradicting themselves?

18:48.760 --> 18:51.140
That's definitely weird.

18:51.910 --> 18:53.600
Good grief.

18:53.950 --> 18:56.720
I was wrong to expect 
a more compelling quarrel.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.140
Oh, by the way, Alicia...

19:00.140 --> 19:00.860
What is it?

19:01.140 --> 19:03.710
The story about the wolf is true.

19:03.710 --> 19:06.190
It happened while you were in that shed.

19:06.190 --> 19:10.370
What? Even though wolves only live in Laval?

19:11.620 --> 19:15.110
I know it sounds crazy, but it's true.

19:15.110 --> 19:19.540
Which means there's a chance 
it was planted by Laval.

19:19.540 --> 19:23.210
Why would they do that? We have no 
diplomatic relations with them.

19:28.310 --> 19:31.860
What if they were probing the Saint?

19:31.860 --> 19:35.240
If she's true to the legend, 
she could be a threat to them.

19:35.240 --> 19:38.100
Well, I guess it's possible...

19:38.100 --> 19:40.170
but isn't that kind of a big leap?

19:40.490 --> 19:44.740
Sending a wolf is a pretty evil thing to do.

19:44.740 --> 19:48.070
I could use that as a reference for 
how to be a better villainess!

19:51.790 --> 19:54.340
Why get any better than you already are?

19:54.340 --> 19:57.710
I want to face Liz on a much higher level.

19:57.710 --> 20:00.580
Even what happened today was 
no different from usual.

20:01.360 --> 20:03.810
<i>The villainess I admired 
before I reincarnated here</i>

20:04.380 --> 20:09.230
<i>was a noble, strong-minded woman 
who always stayed true to herself.</i>

20:06.220 --> 20:09.220
<b><b>Alicia
The most important thing is discipline. What more is there to say to a commoner who fails to uphold that?</b></b>

20:09.220 --> 20:11.480
<b><b>Alicia
I've had enough of your lip service.</b></b>

20:09.230 --> 20:11.480
<i>I think I've gotten closer to that,</i>

20:11.800 --> 20:15.400
<i>but I'm still far from a villainess 
who'll go down in history.</i>

20:15.970 --> 20:20.120
<i>And yet Grandpa Will has steeled his 
resolve to take a step forward...</i>

20:22.010 --> 20:24.160
I need to move forward, too.

20:25.580 --> 20:27.320
I'm borrowing Alicia.

20:27.320 --> 20:28.130
Huh?

20:34.540 --> 20:36.580
Wh-What is this place?

20:36.880 --> 20:39.910
It's my personal hideout within the academy.

20:39.910 --> 20:41.990
<i>Well, that's a prince for you.</i>

20:41.990 --> 20:44.980
<i>He has his own private room in the academy.</i>

20:44.980 --> 20:49.930
Alicia, leave my uncle—leave 
Will Seeker to me.

20:49.930 --> 20:52.260
Huh? How do you...

20:52.260 --> 20:55.730
I've tried to go to Roana, too.

20:55.730 --> 20:57.680
Even before you did.

20:58.930 --> 21:03.010
That village's circumstances 
really should be rectified.

21:03.010 --> 21:06.350
I kept occasional contact with 
my uncle for that purpose.

21:06.350 --> 21:09.160
I... had no idea...

21:09.160 --> 21:13.920
In that case, Prince Duke, do you know about 
Grandpa Will's friends from long ago?

21:15.100 --> 21:16.800
W-Wall slam?!

21:17.010 --> 21:19.690
You don't need to know about all this.

21:19.690 --> 21:22.170
Don't waste your time thinking about Laval.

21:22.170 --> 21:24.170
What? But...

21:24.390 --> 21:28.350
I want you to think only about me.

21:29.840 --> 21:31.170
U-Um...

21:31.910 --> 21:33.220
I want to lock you up.

21:38.480 --> 21:40.770
I am my only master.

21:40.770 --> 21:43.230
I won't let anyone take away my freedom.

21:49.490 --> 21:52.500
So you won't be a bird in a cage, eh?

21:53.730 --> 21:56.410
Just how obsessed with you 
do you want me to be?

22:02.400 --> 22:03.340
Th...

22:04.790 --> 22:07.370
That was way too close!
