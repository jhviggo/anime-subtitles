WEBVTT

00:12.090 --> 00:13.980
What are you thinking about?

00:14.410 --> 00:16.490
About being Liz's watcher.

00:16.800 --> 00:19.920
Liar. I know you're thinking about Laval.

00:19.920 --> 00:21.440
I'm not lying.

00:21.440 --> 00:24.740
Both are necessary if I want 
to be a true villainess.

00:24.740 --> 00:26.520
Ali-Ali!

00:27.580 --> 00:29.920
You smell so nice again today!

00:29.920 --> 00:31.180
M-Mel...

00:31.180 --> 00:33.680
Hands off Alicia.

00:33.680 --> 00:35.670
Just get to the point.

00:35.670 --> 00:37.240
'Kay!

00:37.240 --> 00:39.010
In that case...

00:40.110 --> 00:42.270
I found out the Saint's secret.

00:42.270 --> 00:44.170
Her secret?

00:52.780 --> 00:59.780
I'll Become a <b>Villainess</b>
Who Goes Down in History

02:15.030 --> 02:19.990
<b>The Villainess and the Saint</b>

02:20.180 --> 02:23.770
I've been looking into Liz Cather's 
abnormal popularity for a while now

02:23.770 --> 02:25.710
on my master's orders.

02:25.710 --> 02:28.160
And I finally discovered

02:28.390 --> 02:32.080
that there's a type of magic called 
"Charm" that only the Saint can use.

02:32.080 --> 02:35.480
Charm magic? I've never heard of that.

02:35.480 --> 02:40.210
We finally found mention of it in an old 
book written in the ancient language.

02:41.650 --> 02:43.460
According to the book,

02:43.870 --> 02:48.710
Charm magic is a special power 
that only the Saint can possess.

02:49.400 --> 02:54.050
That's why you hear... legends? 
Memoirs? About the Saint

02:54.050 --> 02:58.470
that say she brings happiness to 
everyone's lives just by being present.

02:59.110 --> 03:02.190
It's such a dumb story, right?

03:02.190 --> 03:05.810
So in other words, Liz has 
been using that magic?

03:05.810 --> 03:08.120
Most likely, though not consciously.

03:08.120 --> 03:09.320
What the heck?

03:09.590 --> 03:14.250
People can resist the spell if they 
have strong mana and willpower,

03:14.250 --> 03:17.460
but if they don't, they fall for it easily.

03:20.970 --> 03:25.270
So that's why I felt sympathy for 
Liz Cather in that moment...

03:25.540 --> 03:28.750
Alicia and I have powerful 
mana, so when you're near us,

03:28.750 --> 03:30.690
we can protect you together.

03:30.910 --> 03:33.080
Just don't approach her alone.

03:33.720 --> 03:35.430
But wouldn't that mean

03:35.710 --> 03:40.410
the girls who were badmouthing 
Liz have strong mana?

03:40.410 --> 03:42.870
They didn't seem that way...

03:42.870 --> 03:45.530
Oh, those dumb girls?

03:45.530 --> 03:49.370
Yeah, their mana isn't even 
all that strong. It's weird.

03:50.240 --> 03:54.260
Come to think of it, they supported Liz

03:54.260 --> 03:56.520
while Alicia was away from the academy.

03:57.020 --> 04:01.350
But, apparently, when Liz first 
enrolled here, they hated her.

04:01.350 --> 04:05.010
Really? So they just keep switching sides?

04:05.010 --> 04:06.630
They've gotta be unstable...

04:06.630 --> 04:09.270
Speaking of unstable, there's Jane, too.

04:09.510 --> 04:12.190
I know she's an ardent Liz follower,

04:12.190 --> 04:17.180
but setting traps and cutting other 
people's hair because she doesn't like them?

04:17.180 --> 04:20.530
She didn't used to be the type 
to have ideas like that.

04:20.900 --> 04:24.480
So Liz's magic is working <i>too</i> well 
and driving her out of control?

04:26.360 --> 04:29.920
Maybe Liz is the one who's out of control.

04:32.320 --> 04:36.330
Maybe her Charm was affecting 
everyone evenly up until now,

04:36.920 --> 04:39.880
but then something threw it off-balance.

04:41.600 --> 04:44.220
That would explain what's been going on.

04:44.220 --> 04:45.500
That's true.

04:45.500 --> 04:48.940
So... can this magic be stopped?

04:49.190 --> 04:50.450
I don't know...

04:50.810 --> 04:53.330
But if she's using it unconsciously...

04:53.730 --> 04:56.580
There was nothing in the 
book about how to stop it.

04:59.550 --> 05:02.770
Maybe someone just has to develop 
some doubts about Liz?

05:02.770 --> 05:03.720
Huh?

05:03.720 --> 05:06.100
That's what set me free from it.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.620
Liz's reasoning is all over the place.

05:10.380 --> 05:14.150
When I explained things to everyone 
in the right order, they...

05:19.380 --> 05:20.690
They...

05:21.790 --> 05:24.390
wouldn't listen at all.

05:24.390 --> 05:27.170
I guess there's no way it'd be that easy.

05:27.450 --> 05:29.760
Maybe we should just tie everyone to chairs,

05:29.760 --> 05:31.980
and hold them prisoner until 
the spell wears off?

05:31.980 --> 05:33.180
That sounds fun!

05:33.180 --> 05:34.320
In what way?!

05:36.770 --> 05:39.750
I wouldn't mind being held prisoner 
if you were the one doing it.

05:39.750 --> 05:41.280
Wha—Why?!

05:41.690 --> 05:43.870
Didn't I tell you? It'd make me honest.

05:45.810 --> 05:49.060
Ali-Ali's so easy when it's my 
master she's dealing with!

05:49.320 --> 05:53.070
Now I think I might know why 
Liz's magic turned unstable.

05:54.490 --> 05:57.530
Yeah, I get it. After seeing this...

05:59.030 --> 06:00.000
Ahem!

06:00.420 --> 06:04.220
In that case, we should talk to 
Liz and make her aware of this.

06:05.980 --> 06:07.670
What? You too?

06:07.670 --> 06:08.810
Yeah.

06:08.810 --> 06:12.840
Duke asked me, "Doesn't anything 
Liz says make you question her?"

06:13.450 --> 06:15.020
Even Duke?

06:15.260 --> 06:18.360
He told us, "Don't let Liz deceive you."

06:18.360 --> 06:21.470
But I'm not deceiving anyone!

06:21.960 --> 06:23.310
Why would he...

06:27.240 --> 06:29.070
It's Alicia's fault!

06:29.070 --> 06:33.530
She's spreading a baseless rumor because 
she knows she can never beat you!

06:33.810 --> 06:37.090
Relax, Liz! You've done nothing wrong!

06:38.140 --> 06:40.310
Thank you all.

06:40.660 --> 06:43.460
But why would Alicia...

06:43.790 --> 06:47.560
Do you think I should try 
talking to her more?

06:47.890 --> 06:50.850
You should keep your distance 
from her right now.

06:50.850 --> 06:52.460
I'll talk to her.

06:52.730 --> 06:54.550
Don't worry, Liz.

06:55.510 --> 06:56.870
Thank you.

07:09.950 --> 07:11.240
Liz...

07:12.630 --> 07:14.950
Alicia, we need to talk.

07:14.950 --> 07:18.440
Stop spreading these 
baseless lies about Liz.

07:18.440 --> 07:19.340
Excuse me?

07:19.620 --> 07:21.760
I know what you're up to.

07:22.010 --> 07:24.810
You're trying to use lies 
to make us leave Liz

07:24.810 --> 07:27.420
so she'll end up isolated, aren't you?

07:27.420 --> 07:31.040
But the bond we have won't 
break that easily.

07:31.040 --> 07:32.090
Give it up.

07:32.320 --> 07:36.500
What, now? How did it come to this?

07:36.850 --> 07:40.540
Brother Albert, it might do 
me no good to tell you this,

07:40.540 --> 07:42.070
but you're mistaken.

07:42.380 --> 07:44.940
I came here to talk to Liz.

07:44.940 --> 07:48.780
No. I can't let you have anything 
further to do with Liz.

07:48.780 --> 07:52.620
Liz has been so bravely thinking about 
whether she should talk to you,

07:52.620 --> 07:56.200
but we won't permit her to 
be hurt any further!

07:58.600 --> 08:00.560
Well, they're hopeless.

08:00.560 --> 08:03.820
They're getting the full effect 
of the Saint's spell.

08:04.180 --> 08:08.040
All to protect Liz... That means...

08:08.490 --> 08:10.360
Why don't we just leave them be?

08:10.360 --> 08:13.500
The magic might just wear 
off on its own somehow.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.730
No, we can't wait that long.

08:16.030 --> 08:20.130
We need to do something about this 
before Liz Cather graduates.

08:20.130 --> 08:21.900
That's true too...

08:22.620 --> 08:23.910
But I want to hurry.

08:23.910 --> 08:25.060
Alicia?

08:26.960 --> 08:28.610
I'll take care of it.

08:29.980 --> 08:34.990
I'll Become a <b>Villainess
</b>Who Goes Down in History

08:30.430 --> 08:32.930
<i>We hotties will be the 
ones to deal with you!</i>

08:32.930 --> 08:34.550
<i>We love Liz!</i>

08:34.990 --> 08:39.990
I'll Become a <b>Villainess
</b>Who Goes Down in History

08:35.230 --> 08:37.280
<i>The Ali-Ali and Mel-Mel pairing</i>

08:37.280 --> 08:39.990
<i>would be so jiggly and 
bouncy and hot and—</i>

08:41.010 --> 08:43.830
And that's how we got rid of the problem.

08:43.830 --> 08:45.450
Sure was weird.

08:55.640 --> 08:56.920
Duke...

08:57.890 --> 08:59.750
Liz, mind if I join you?

08:59.750 --> 09:02.820
Huh? Yes, of course you can!

09:06.600 --> 09:08.720
You can sit here, Duke.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.310
Um... just you, Duke?

09:14.730 --> 09:16.740
Where are Alicia and Henri?

09:17.210 --> 09:21.360
I don't want to hear you say 
another man's name right now.

09:22.410 --> 09:24.530
O-Okay...

09:31.460 --> 09:33.330
Is this really gonna work?

09:33.740 --> 09:36.340
Duke using his wiles on her?

09:36.340 --> 09:37.530
It'll be fine.

09:41.550 --> 09:45.590
I've seen those smooth lines of 
Duke's over and over in the game.

09:45.990 --> 09:47.620
Right now, I bet he's saying...

09:48.200 --> 09:50.420
You always try to treat everyone equally.

09:50.420 --> 09:53.890
So is it a crime if I want 
to have you all to myself?

09:54.620 --> 09:57.280
...or something like that to her!

09:57.280 --> 09:59.670
I would've liked to see it in person...

09:59.670 --> 10:01.510
Huh? What was that?

10:02.070 --> 10:04.280
Nothing. Forget about it.

10:07.610 --> 10:10.730
What do you think those two 
are gonna talk about?

10:10.730 --> 10:11.880
Curious?

10:16.790 --> 10:19.670
Oh! This is your...

10:22.200 --> 10:23.680
Alicia.

10:27.970 --> 10:30.200
I'm sorry for tricking you.

10:30.200 --> 10:34.350
I figured it was the only way to get you 
to have a proper talk with Alicia.

10:36.490 --> 10:37.550
I see.

10:38.660 --> 10:41.290
What did you want to talk 
about, Alicia, dear?

10:41.290 --> 10:45.110
Liz, I want you to stop using your spell.

10:45.410 --> 10:48.950
The Charm spell that you're 
using without realizing it.

10:49.980 --> 10:54.090
What are you talking about? 
I'm not using a spell.

10:54.090 --> 10:56.200
As I said, you don't realize it.

10:56.830 --> 11:01.240
It's described here as magic 
only the Saint can possess.

11:06.370 --> 11:09.800
You can't prove that I've been 
using a spell like this!

11:09.800 --> 11:14.440
Liz, you didn't want to see me in 
the cafeteria today, did you?

11:14.830 --> 11:18.750
That's why you had Albert 
stall me while you ran away.

11:18.750 --> 11:22.590
I didn't run away! I wanted to talk to you!

11:22.590 --> 11:27.660
But Albert and the others said I should 
keep my distance from you right now.

11:27.660 --> 11:31.080
Maybe that was what you <i>really</i> wanted.

11:31.980 --> 11:33.380
What do you mean?

11:33.380 --> 11:36.630
Liz, didn't you say before

11:37.210 --> 11:39.470
that you're a very lucky girl?

11:40.080 --> 11:43.850
That's only because the 
people under your spell

11:43.850 --> 11:46.600
were working to make your wishes come true.

11:46.990 --> 11:50.290
You became "lucky" as a result.

11:50.700 --> 11:52.080
Am I wrong?

11:52.080 --> 11:53.010
You are!

11:53.230 --> 11:54.710
Am I really?

11:54.710 --> 11:58.750
Do you think it's normal for no one 
around you to tell you their opinions?

11:58.750 --> 12:00.710
Stop speaking ill of them!

12:00.980 --> 12:05.360
I became friends with Albert and the others 
because we got to know each other!

12:05.360 --> 12:08.530
But the way Albert thinks about you

12:08.530 --> 12:11.190
is not the same as the 
way you think about him.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.380
You've realized that, haven't you?

12:28.500 --> 12:30.440
And it's not just Albert.

12:31.310 --> 12:36.500
Have you really never questioned the ardent 
devotion so many people have for you?

12:46.420 --> 12:50.280
Then... why don't you like me, Duke?

12:50.640 --> 12:54.300
If I was using such ridiculous 
magic, you'd like me too!

12:59.300 --> 13:01.640
Duke, I like you.

13:02.110 --> 13:03.380
I love you!

13:05.800 --> 13:08.620
Why must you look at me that way?

13:13.390 --> 13:16.440
I didn't obtain the powers of 
the Saint because I wanted to.

13:17.520 --> 13:18.620
And yet...

13:19.570 --> 13:22.570
When I was suddenly enrolled 
in a school for nobles,

13:22.840 --> 13:25.140
it was such a different world 
for me. I was so scared.

13:28.520 --> 13:31.320
But then I met you.

13:34.120 --> 13:36.390
I've tried so hard all this time

13:36.390 --> 13:38.350
to be the Saint everyone wanted.

13:38.350 --> 13:45.450
Someone worthy of this power—
worthy of being with you.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.790
So why...

13:48.040 --> 13:51.670
<i>Even she knew she was just playing 
the part of the ideal Saint.</i>

13:52.050 --> 13:56.350
<i>All the strange things she said and did 
were purely in pursuit of that ideal.</i>

13:56.690 --> 13:59.170
<i>Who she is inside never matched it.</i>

14:03.800 --> 14:08.800
I care about you more than Alicia does.

14:09.880 --> 14:14.280
If I'd met you before Alicia did,

14:15.140 --> 14:17.200
would you have loved me?

14:20.030 --> 14:23.390
I still would have loved Alicia.

14:24.570 --> 14:25.790
I see.

14:30.520 --> 14:34.590
<i>Did Prince Duke just make such a major 
proclamation like it was nothing?</i>

14:34.590 --> 14:35.760
I hate you.

14:36.190 --> 14:39.730
You're always so confident, you 
know how to take initiative...

14:40.300 --> 14:42.750
and above all, Duke loves you.

14:43.680 --> 14:47.110
I've thought so many times that 
if only you weren't around—

14:47.110 --> 14:48.940
Stay away from my sister!

14:52.060 --> 14:54.610
Everyone... Why...

14:54.610 --> 14:59.620
My respect for you was my own 
conscious decision... I think.

15:00.060 --> 15:03.660
But right now, I care more about 
protecting my sister than about you.

15:03.940 --> 15:05.590
The spell wore off?

15:06.360 --> 15:08.500
I don't know how I feel.

15:09.130 --> 15:11.590
Were you really using Charm magic?

15:11.920 --> 15:14.940
That's how you see me, too?

15:15.660 --> 15:17.510
I've tried so hard all this time...

15:17.760 --> 15:19.700
but the one I love doesn't love me,

15:19.700 --> 15:23.680
and all the people I thought loved 
me were only under a spell?

15:23.680 --> 15:26.020
All of that is your own fault!

15:26.020 --> 15:28.450
What else was I supposed to do?!

15:28.450 --> 15:32.160
No one ever taught me anything 
about being the Saint,

15:32.160 --> 15:34.410
yet everyone just keeps 
calling me the Saint!

15:34.410 --> 15:36.880
Don't make me bear all that alone!

15:37.970 --> 15:39.910
<i>If this was the game,</i>

15:40.320 --> 15:44.870
<i>as long as the heroine had love, 
she'd get the happy ending.</i>

15:45.640 --> 15:48.420
<i>But this is reality.</i>

15:48.970 --> 15:51.490
<i>It takes more than love 
and romance to survive.</i>

15:53.830 --> 15:55.180
Don't act like a spoiled child.

15:55.420 --> 15:57.590
The ideal Saint that everyone wanted?

15:57.990 --> 15:59.270
You're wrong.

15:59.670 --> 16:02.610
There's no point if you don't 
pursue your <i>own</i> ideals.

16:03.870 --> 16:07.220
Whether you're the Saint 
or not, you're still you.

16:07.220 --> 16:09.570
All you need to think about 
is your own happiness.

16:09.820 --> 16:13.480
Don't even pay attention to 
the masses who want a Saint!

16:16.390 --> 16:18.750
But still, I...

16:19.500 --> 16:21.600
<i>Thanks, Liz.</i>

16:21.600 --> 16:23.430
<i>Thank you, Liz!</i>

16:23.430 --> 16:25.870
<i>Miss Liz, thank you so much!</i>

16:30.740 --> 16:33.670
Even if they're fake right now,

16:34.230 --> 16:38.280
I want to see everyone 
smiling for real one day.

16:39.930 --> 16:42.150
And that's your real self.

16:42.550 --> 16:44.890
This is why I saw you as a worthy rival.

16:45.350 --> 16:47.600
I could never be like you.

16:47.960 --> 16:49.310
Alicia, dear...

16:50.130 --> 16:52.340
Time won't wait.

16:52.340 --> 16:54.820
Hurry up and become
 the Saint you want to be

16:54.820 --> 16:57.200
so you can get back at me.

17:01.870 --> 17:03.130
You're right.

17:04.540 --> 17:07.050
Sorry if you find the 
Saint I become annoying.

17:07.050 --> 17:08.780
Bring it on.

17:13.690 --> 17:18.230
Jeez! I've loved you all this time, 
and that all died in a heartbeat.

17:18.660 --> 17:21.390
I wanted my profession of 
love to be more romantic.

17:21.760 --> 17:23.820
Sorry, Liz,

17:24.270 --> 17:26.250
but Alicia is the one I...

17:28.030 --> 17:31.320
<i>He really was just casually 
proclaiming his love for me?!</i>

17:31.320 --> 17:35.690
I've known all along that you 
only had eyes for Alicia.

17:36.160 --> 17:39.720
But you were just too 
charming to give up on.

17:43.120 --> 17:45.200
I'll be borrowing this book.

17:46.070 --> 17:47.120
Can you read it?

17:47.120 --> 17:50.210
Of course. Academics are 
my thing, you know.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.960
Since I don't have anyone 
to enjoy tea with anymore,

17:55.280 --> 17:57.060
I'll use the time to improve myself.

17:59.400 --> 18:02.050
Is that the real Liz Cather?

18:02.320 --> 18:05.140
I like this version of her a lot more.

18:05.980 --> 18:07.110
Alicia.

18:07.740 --> 18:08.940
Yes?

18:09.300 --> 18:11.850
About that other matter. 
Is tonight all right?

18:12.900 --> 18:14.060
Yes.

18:18.640 --> 18:21.710
Duke. What did you want 
to discuss at this hour?

18:22.260 --> 18:24.700
There's someone here who wishes to see you.

18:36.500 --> 18:39.920
B-Brother... It can't be...

18:40.220 --> 18:43.680
You would still call me your brother?

18:43.930 --> 18:47.210
Where have you been all this 
time? And your eye...

18:59.240 --> 19:02.110
I thought the king hated Grandpa Will.

19:02.320 --> 19:05.110
He may have at one time,

19:05.110 --> 19:06.620
but things are different now.

19:07.240 --> 19:11.660
He wouldn't have that painting 
of him on the wall otherwise.

19:11.950 --> 19:14.990
There was a clear mark where 
it had been taken down once.

19:14.990 --> 19:17.650
I think something probably happened

19:18.590 --> 19:22.220
between the king and his mother.

19:22.530 --> 19:25.430
So I doubt Grandpa Will 
is in any danger now,

19:25.430 --> 19:28.140
even after returning to the castle.

19:28.140 --> 19:31.310
I can guarantee my uncle's safety.

19:31.830 --> 19:34.610
And if we can prove the charges 
against him were false,

19:34.610 --> 19:37.160
we'll be able to set Roana free in no time.

19:37.160 --> 19:38.150
Huh?

19:38.150 --> 19:40.470
I had Rebecca look into it,

19:40.470 --> 19:45.520
and there's currently no one in 
Roana who was exiled for crimes.

19:45.520 --> 19:47.820
I had no idea you'd looked 
that far into it.

19:48.160 --> 19:50.820
There's no reason to keep the 
village isolated anymore.

19:51.290 --> 19:52.580
It'll be free soon.

19:56.400 --> 19:57.510
That's great...

19:57.510 --> 19:59.760
That's great! Thank you, Alicia!

19:59.760 --> 20:01.900
I didn't do anything.

20:01.900 --> 20:05.180
That's not true. My father's 
grateful to you, too.

20:05.180 --> 20:08.490
For what you've done... and for the eye.

20:10.010 --> 20:13.310
I'm sure he'll reward you. 
What would you like?

20:13.310 --> 20:15.090
A reward from the king?!

20:17.870 --> 20:18.800
Then...

20:19.080 --> 20:23.480
I'd like to take a break from 
being Liz's watcher for a while.

20:23.480 --> 20:25.270
Huh? Why?

20:25.270 --> 20:31.040
The instability in Liz's charisma at school 
will likely correct itself in time.

20:31.560 --> 20:35.460
Once that happens, she'll be able 
to learn from others besides me.

20:35.760 --> 20:39.720
Having faith and watching over 
her will help her grow, too.

20:40.090 --> 20:44.110
Therefore, I'd like to distance 
myself from her for a while.

20:44.110 --> 20:45.230
Alicia...

20:45.890 --> 20:49.040
All right. I'll inform my father.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.980
Thank you.

20:53.400 --> 20:54.650
And...

20:55.210 --> 20:57.680
when can I expect your 
response to my confession?

20:59.670 --> 21:02.630
I don't care what anyone else thinks.

21:02.630 --> 21:05.030
But when it's you...

21:05.410 --> 21:08.360
I... You...

21:11.760 --> 21:15.720
I don't need an answer right now. 
But tell me someday, all right?

21:35.950 --> 21:38.760
Couldn't sleep? Because of Duke?

21:38.760 --> 21:40.180
Th-That's not...

21:40.560 --> 21:42.610
I mean, you're not wrong...

21:42.610 --> 21:43.370
Is that honesty?

21:44.060 --> 21:48.440
<i>It's pretty obvious to me 
what my feelings are.</i>

21:48.440 --> 21:49.810
<i>But, I...</i>

21:57.710 --> 21:58.820
Duke?

22:01.470 --> 22:02.860
Prince Duke?

22:03.710 --> 22:05.640
Who are you?
