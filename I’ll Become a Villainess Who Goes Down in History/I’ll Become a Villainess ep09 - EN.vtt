00:00.530 --> 00:02.630
Y-You're bothering me.

00:03.130 --> 00:06.460
I don't remember ever asking 
you to watch over me!

00:06.460 --> 00:08.070
Don't force that on me!

00:17.120 --> 00:19.720
Want to skip class today?

00:19.720 --> 00:20.580
No, I'm going.

00:21.220 --> 00:23.050
Skipping would make it all go to waste.

00:25.240 --> 00:27.870
Good day, everyone.

00:28.100 --> 00:29.490
Alicia, dear?

00:29.490 --> 00:31.750
What the hell are you doing here?

00:32.670 --> 00:35.990
I've transferred to this class as of today.

00:36.630 --> 00:40.360
The classes in the lower grades were 
so easy, I was bored out of my mind...

00:40.930 --> 00:45.280
But I presume the highest grade level 
will be good for some amusement!

00:45.570 --> 00:47.030
<i>All lies.</i>

00:47.030 --> 00:49.930
<i>I studied my butt off to catch up to them.</i>

00:50.200 --> 00:53.790
That condescending tone... 
You're such a vulgar woman.

00:54.060 --> 00:55.780
Everyone, stop!

00:56.150 --> 00:59.230
Yes, her phrasing may have been a bit harsh,

00:59.230 --> 01:02.450
but it's not right to alienate her.

01:03.170 --> 01:06.860
Alicia, dear, I'm so happy 
we're classmates now.

01:27.730 --> 01:34.740
I'll Become a <b>Villainess</b>
Who Goes Down in History

02:50.060 --> 02:55.020
<b>The Villainess and the Dramatic Chin Lift</b>

03:03.390 --> 03:04.800
Alicia, dear!

03:05.160 --> 03:07.570
Would you like to have lunch together?

03:12.980 --> 03:14.430
No, thank you.

03:14.860 --> 03:17.890
I have no intention of 
being friends with you.

03:18.370 --> 03:21.300
I'd like us to be closer.

03:21.300 --> 03:23.010
Do you never learn?

03:23.010 --> 03:27.530
Up until now, everything I've 
wanted always came to be,

03:27.530 --> 03:31.800
so I was convinced that you and 
I would become friends, too.

03:32.520 --> 03:35.200
After what you said, I thought things over.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.350
And I came to a realization...

03:37.650 --> 03:43.220
It was rude of me to assume 
everyone would automatically like me.

03:43.560 --> 03:46.420
So now I want to start over,

03:46.420 --> 03:50.500
and talk about all kinds of things 
so we can become friends.

03:51.160 --> 03:54.510
Must it always come back 
to being friends? Iâ€”

03:54.510 --> 03:58.670
Whether we can be friends or not is one 
of the things I want to talk about.

03:58.670 --> 04:00.830
I want to know more about you.

04:01.180 --> 04:03.750
<i>What, she doesn't hate me?</i>

04:04.040 --> 04:07.180
<i>That's a heroine for you. 
My least favorite type.</i>

04:08.190 --> 04:10.100
<i>It's people like her who are loved.</i>

04:11.180 --> 04:13.220
<i>And the best match for the prince is...</i>

04:14.960 --> 04:16.350
Alicia, dear?

04:17.520 --> 04:21.410
I'll pass on lunch. I'm not in the mood.

04:29.540 --> 04:32.570
<i>It's crazy to compare myself to the heroine.</i>

04:33.110 --> 04:35.390
<i>I'm the </i>villainess<i> here!</i>

04:37.010 --> 04:40.330
I guess even you hesitate and 
worry about things sometimes.

04:40.330 --> 04:44.440
Maybe Prince Duke is actually special to me.

04:44.440 --> 04:45.590
You say this <i>now</i>?

04:45.590 --> 04:49.660
Why can't I be a proper 
villainess in front of him?

04:50.590 --> 04:52.900
Maybe you should stay away 
from him for a while?

04:54.700 --> 05:00.070
Then you might be able to figure out 
what Prince Duke means to you.

05:00.070 --> 05:01.660
I can't do that!

05:01.660 --> 05:03.840
It would look like I was running away...

05:03.840 --> 05:05.450
and that's not a villainess thing to do!

05:05.450 --> 05:06.610
Oh. Okay.

05:06.870 --> 05:10.540
<i>Yes, that's right. Running 
would just be pitiful.</i>

05:10.540 --> 05:13.390
<i>I'm far from being the ideal 
villainess right now.</i>

05:14.470 --> 05:15.870
Did you get your answer?

05:16.200 --> 05:17.610
I don't know.

05:17.610 --> 05:21.120
But for the sake of being 
true to myself... I'm going.

05:29.960 --> 05:31.760
Thank you for the meal.

05:38.870 --> 05:39.890
What is it?

05:41.180 --> 05:42.440
Alicia?

05:49.330 --> 05:51.660
You look surprisingly unbothered.

05:52.040 --> 05:55.430
And here I came to see you hurt and sulking.

05:55.430 --> 05:58.820
Too bad. Is that all you wanted?

05:59.050 --> 06:03.000
No. I wanted to tell you 
that I never asked for your help

06:03.290 --> 06:05.390
but appreciate it regardless.

06:05.390 --> 06:06.010
Huh?!

06:07.920 --> 06:11.670
I was genuinely happy to know 
that you were worried about me.

06:12.900 --> 06:15.990
And I apologize for taking 
such a harsh attitude.

06:16.660 --> 06:18.020
I am sorry.

06:21.390 --> 06:22.360
However...

06:22.870 --> 06:25.850
if you must watch over me, why 
not just come out and tell me?

06:28.050 --> 06:31.990
Expecting someone to understand when you 
don't say anything is presumptuous.

06:32.520 --> 06:36.190
So I'm going to say this loud and clear:

06:36.190 --> 06:39.850
I would never just watch 
over someone from afar.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.620
I'd protect them out in the open, 
with my own two hands.

06:46.440 --> 06:49.260
<i>I'm not a heroine. I'm a villainess.</i>

06:49.710 --> 06:54.000
<i>And I'll respond to the prince 
the way a villainess would.</i>

06:59.660 --> 07:03.430
Okay, I get it. I won't hold back anymore.

07:03.430 --> 07:04.550
You'd best be ready.

07:20.920 --> 07:22.340
Duke!

07:22.340 --> 07:27.910
We can't make a decision about 
the music festival without your input.

07:28.400 --> 07:31.040
Let's talk it over together, okay?

07:31.040 --> 07:34.230
Wait, have you been ditching the meetings?

07:34.510 --> 07:36.930
So he <i>was</i> sulking, in his own way.

07:37.860 --> 07:40.330
Sorry, Alicia, but I need to go.

07:49.860 --> 07:52.540
Alicia, dear, see you later, okay?

07:54.320 --> 07:56.160
Yes, later.

08:00.060 --> 08:02.290
<i>She sees me as a rival now!</i>

08:03.060 --> 08:05.870
Our hard work is finally paying off!

08:07.820 --> 08:12.280
I was upset with the game for making the 
villainess five years younger than the heroine,

08:12.280 --> 08:13.640
but we finally did it!

08:14.750 --> 08:16.170
Ow!

08:16.940 --> 08:19.190
It's still too soon to celebrate!

08:19.190 --> 08:23.110
We're only on Liz's radar 
as a romantic rival now!

08:23.110 --> 08:24.950
That's true!

08:24.950 --> 08:27.670
<i>Yes. My only goal is to be</i>

08:27.670 --> 08:30.630
<i>the greatest villainess, one who can 
genuinely compare with the heroine.</i>

08:31.220 --> 08:33.260
<i>I want her to see me as a rival 
in terms of ability, too.</i>

08:33.780 --> 08:37.030
<i>And I want to be a villainess 
who goes down in history!</i>

08:38.910 --> 08:40.950
Um, Miss Alicia...

08:41.430 --> 08:43.380
I have a favor to ask.

08:43.380 --> 08:47.210
A favor? We've never even 
met. What's your name?

08:47.210 --> 08:50.120
Um... I'd like you to come with me.

08:50.420 --> 08:51.590
Why?

08:51.590 --> 08:53.400
Just for a moment!

08:54.610 --> 08:56.850
I'm begging you! Please...

08:57.170 --> 09:00.270
If you won't explain what's 
going on, I refuse.

09:00.500 --> 09:04.940
Do you think I'm stupid enough to 
follow anyone without being told why?

09:04.940 --> 09:07.070
P-Please forgive me!

09:08.490 --> 09:10.970
Class is about to start.

09:10.970 --> 09:12.800
I'm in a hurry.

09:13.780 --> 09:16.390
W-Wait! Miss Alicia!

09:18.820 --> 09:21.770
I'm sorry... I'm sorry!

09:25.860 --> 09:28.680
You should always treat books well.

09:28.680 --> 09:30.380
Now, good day to you.

09:32.910 --> 09:34.290
What was that all about?

09:34.290 --> 09:35.120
No idea.

09:36.110 --> 09:38.040
That was good enough, right?

09:45.050 --> 09:47.700
<i>Can't you give poor, 
unfortunate me some love?</i>

09:45.050 --> 09:49.790
I'll Become a <b>Villainess
</b>Who Goes Down in History

09:47.700 --> 09:48.470
<i>Uh, no.</i>

09:48.470 --> 09:49.790
<i>No, wait!</i>

09:50.560 --> 09:53.010
<i>Yeah, right! Just kidding!</i>

09:53.010 --> 09:55.060
<i>No way, no way! Not a chance!</i>

10:02.460 --> 10:03.640
Alicia?

10:07.490 --> 10:09.410
Ah, dear brother.

10:09.410 --> 10:13.630
That is not a look I'd expect you
 to give your baby sister.

10:13.630 --> 10:14.830
What do you want?

10:15.470 --> 10:16.980
Albert!

10:16.980 --> 10:19.630
Alicia, dear, I'm glad you came.

10:20.300 --> 10:22.960
I received an invitation, after all.

10:22.960 --> 10:26.520
An anonymous order to come to 
the rose garden after school.

10:26.520 --> 10:28.580
Was that a friend of yours?

10:28.580 --> 10:29.320
Huh?

10:29.320 --> 10:31.890
I'm the one who wrote that letter.

10:34.250 --> 10:36.490
<i>Oh, it's that girl.</i>

10:37.060 --> 10:38.710
<i>I think her name was...</i>

10:39.200 --> 10:40.920
Why, Jane!

10:40.920 --> 10:43.610
Thank you so much for the invitation.

10:43.610 --> 10:47.460
Did you wish to discuss appearances again?

10:48.060 --> 10:53.880
I'm here to hold you accountable for 
bullying my dear friend Marika.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.160
<i>It's that dodgy girl.</i>

10:56.160 --> 10:57.800
<i>So this </i>was<i> a setup.</i>

10:58.000 --> 11:01.040
<i>Right. This means I've 
gotten them to hate me.</i>

11:01.040 --> 11:03.730
<i>As a villainess, of course 
I'll face this head-on.</i>

11:04.000 --> 11:06.120
As you all know,

11:06.120 --> 11:11.020
this girl, in her jealousy, has repeatedly 
and despicably harassed Miss Liz.

11:11.400 --> 11:14.050
And because she's no match 
for the virtuous Miss Liz,

11:14.050 --> 11:16.680
she's been beaten at her 
own game every time.

11:16.680 --> 11:21.730
And she took out her pent-up 
resentment on Marika!

11:22.190 --> 11:25.140
But kind, sweet Marika quickly gave up

11:25.140 --> 11:27.410
and came to me for help.

11:27.410 --> 11:29.890
I have no memory of this.

11:29.890 --> 11:33.370
I've only ever spoken to this girl once.

11:33.610 --> 11:36.400
She wouldn't even tell me her name.

11:36.400 --> 11:39.640
Feigning innocence won't help you.

11:39.640 --> 11:40.610
Marika.

11:40.610 --> 11:41.730
R-Right.

11:42.050 --> 11:45.580
I gave her some advice to 
ensure there'd be proof.

11:46.050 --> 11:48.300
<i>I'm begging you! Please...</i>

11:48.300 --> 11:49.860
<i>I refuse.</i>

11:49.860 --> 11:52.280
<i>Do you think I'm stupid?</i>

11:52.280 --> 11:55.090
<i>It's the conversation we had...</i>

11:55.090 --> 11:58.110
<i>No, it's not. Something feels off.</i>

11:59.550 --> 12:01.720
<i>P-Please forgive me!</i>

12:01.720 --> 12:03.850
<i>I'm sorry... I'm sorry!</i>

12:03.850 --> 12:05.790
<i>I'm in a hurry.</i>

12:06.250 --> 12:07.990
<i>Now, good day to you.</i>

12:10.980 --> 12:16.550
She calls Marika out at every turn 
to do these mean things to her!

12:16.550 --> 12:19.150
That sound in the middle... Was that...

12:19.150 --> 12:20.990
She got violent with her?

12:20.990 --> 12:22.350
Talk about scum.

12:22.660 --> 12:24.710
It's not true! That recording isâ€”

12:26.920 --> 12:28.910
<i>So she edited it.</i>

12:28.910 --> 12:31.550
<i>Earth magic isn't really my specialty,</i>

12:31.950 --> 12:34.470
<i>but I'm pretty sure that's 
a high-level spell.</i>

12:38.300 --> 12:41.490
<i>Not bad! She'd make a decent villainess!</i>

12:41.490 --> 12:44.230
Alicia, dear, what is the meaning of this?

12:44.670 --> 12:47.270
Marika is a kind, reserved girl.

12:47.540 --> 12:50.210
Being so mean to her will only wither her!

12:51.040 --> 12:52.590
A kind girl?

12:54.400 --> 12:56.990
You're such a poor judge of character, Liz.

12:56.990 --> 12:57.670
Huh?

12:58.220 --> 12:59.900
That's enough out of you!

12:59.900 --> 13:01.380
What impudence!

13:01.380 --> 13:03.520
You can't talk your way out of this!

13:03.520 --> 13:06.420
Have some shame! Own up to what you've done!

13:06.420 --> 13:07.900
We have the proof!

13:07.900 --> 13:09.300
Apologize to Miss Marika!

13:11.220 --> 13:14.560
You'd best apologize, Alicia Williams!

13:14.560 --> 13:17.240
<i>I've been unanimously 
cast as the villainess.</i>

13:17.240 --> 13:19.080
<i>I amaze myself!</i>

13:19.080 --> 13:20.660
<i>Now, what shall Iâ€”</i>

13:20.660 --> 13:22.480
P-Please, wait!

13:28.390 --> 13:30.370
This isn't right!

13:30.370 --> 13:33.580
Alicia says she has no recollection of this,

13:33.580 --> 13:36.020
but you're barely even listening to her.

13:36.020 --> 13:39.760
It's as if you just want to make 
her out to be the bad guy!

13:40.250 --> 13:42.630
<i>I've never met her before.</i>

13:42.630 --> 13:45.100
<i>Why would she cover for me right now?</i>

13:45.100 --> 13:47.990
Carol, what are you implying?

13:47.990 --> 13:50.810
It took a lot of courage for 
Marika to tell us this,

13:50.810 --> 13:52.390
and you're doubting <i>her</i>?

13:52.390 --> 13:56.090
Th-That conversation alone 
isn't enough to judge.

13:56.090 --> 13:58.060
We need to hear both sides.

13:58.060 --> 14:00.850
Are you saying Marika's playing some trick?!

14:00.850 --> 14:02.450
No!

14:02.450 --> 14:04.600
<i>She's actually trembling.</i>

14:04.600 --> 14:08.330
<i>I'd like to tell her I 
didn't ask for her help,</i>

14:08.330 --> 14:11.030
<i>but I don't want to be a villainess 
who knows no gratitude.</i>

14:11.030 --> 14:13.970
If you're going to say 
all that, show us proof!

14:13.970 --> 14:14.920
Now, lookâ€”

14:14.920 --> 14:16.950
If it's proof you want, I've got some.

14:23.150 --> 14:24.380
Mel...

14:27.110 --> 14:29.710
<i>Um, Miss Alicia...</i>

14:29.710 --> 14:31.510
<i>I have a favor to ask.</i>

14:31.970 --> 14:35.550
<i>A favor? We've never even 
met. What's your name?</i>

14:36.680 --> 14:39.990
<i>Um... I'd like you to come with me.</i>

14:39.990 --> 14:40.900
<i>Why?</i>

14:40.900 --> 14:42.620
<i>Just for a moment!</i>

14:42.620 --> 14:45.020
<i>I'm begging you! Please...</i>

14:42.910 --> 14:46.000
This sounds like that 
recording from before...

14:45.020 --> 14:48.020
<i>If you won't explain what's 
going on, I refuse.</i>

14:46.000 --> 14:48.020
But it's... different?

14:48.020 --> 14:52.500
<i>Do you think I'm stupid enough to 
follow anyone without being told why?</i>

14:52.500 --> 14:54.850
<i>P-Please forgive me!</i>

14:56.200 --> 14:58.790
<i>Class is about to start.</i>

14:58.790 --> 15:00.260
<i>I'm in a hurry.</i>

14:59.100 --> 15:01.030
What is the meaning of this?

15:01.110 --> 15:03.830
<i>W-Wait! Miss Alicia!</i>

15:03.240 --> 15:04.640
W-Well...

15:06.190 --> 15:08.900
<i>I'm sorry... I'm sorry!</i>

15:12.540 --> 15:15.140
<i>You should always treat books well.</i>

15:15.740 --> 15:19.310
Why are there two recordings 
that sound so similar?

15:19.560 --> 15:22.860
Oh. One of them must be a lie.

15:23.170 --> 15:26.910
You think a teacher with earth 
magic could work it out for us?

15:27.620 --> 15:30.270
Jane ordered me to do it!

15:30.270 --> 15:31.040
Hey!

15:31.740 --> 15:34.750
She said she wanted pretext to 
turn everyone against Alicia!

15:35.030 --> 15:37.270
I was so scared, I couldn't say no!

15:39.730 --> 15:40.860
Jane?

15:41.340 --> 15:44.130
Alicia might be a mean girl,

15:44.130 --> 15:46.830
but that doesn't mean we'll condone 
false accusations against her.

15:46.830 --> 15:50.630
You ruined Liz's tea party just for this?

15:50.980 --> 15:52.920
B-But...

15:53.230 --> 15:56.350
But she's blatantly insulting Miss Liz!

15:56.640 --> 15:59.110
Because Miss Liz is so kind and strong,

15:59.110 --> 16:02.190
she ends up accepting all 
the rude things she says!

16:02.410 --> 16:05.100
Didn't you all say you 
couldn't stand for that?!

16:05.450 --> 16:08.870
That's why I felt like I needed 
to punish her instead!

16:08.870 --> 16:09.990
And you'reâ€”

16:13.380 --> 16:15.450
Alicia, dear, I'm sorry.

16:16.330 --> 16:18.040
This is my fault.

16:18.760 --> 16:21.120
Did you put her up to this?

16:21.120 --> 16:25.040
If not, then it's between me and them.

16:25.040 --> 16:27.050
I need no apology from you.

16:27.440 --> 16:30.380
Jane said she did it for my sake.

16:30.380 --> 16:32.500
Even if I didn't ask her to,

16:32.500 --> 16:35.800
I don't want to be the type that 
can turn a blind eye so easily.

16:36.360 --> 16:39.120
Now, that's reasoning I can understand.

16:39.120 --> 16:41.720
I don't accept your apology, 
but I won't refute it.

16:41.720 --> 16:42.970
Thank you.

16:43.970 --> 16:45.900
Is this little farce over now?

16:46.570 --> 16:48.660
Let's go, Ali-Ali!

16:48.660 --> 16:49.480
"Ali-Ali"?!

16:49.790 --> 16:52.650
Well, there's so much 
I want to talk to you about!

16:53.220 --> 16:56.790
I have questions for you, as well.

16:57.180 --> 17:01.530
Oh, gosh! What's she gonna ask me?

17:11.000 --> 17:12.140
So...

17:12.480 --> 17:14.600
Just who are you?

17:14.850 --> 17:17.510
You couldn't have made that 
recording at the perfect time

17:17.510 --> 17:20.250
if you didn't know what was going to happen.

17:20.690 --> 17:23.660
In fact, I'm certain you weren't even there.

17:23.660 --> 17:25.490
Why did you do this?

17:25.920 --> 17:28.970
Wow, that's a lot of questions.

17:28.970 --> 17:31.930
First of all, as for who I am...

17:31.930 --> 17:34.870
I'm your biggest fan, Ali-Ali!

17:34.130 --> 17:34.870
Hey!

17:36.420 --> 17:40.280
That silky black hair, 
that pale, glassy skin,

17:40.280 --> 17:43.580
the sharp words that pour 
out of your lovely lips...

17:43.580 --> 17:47.440
And those strong-willed golden 
eyes are just the best!

17:47.440 --> 17:48.530
So overbearing!

17:49.960 --> 17:53.040
Also... I absolutely hate Liz Cather.

17:54.830 --> 18:00.530
She just shoves her nose right into 
everyone's business, no matter who,

18:00.530 --> 18:03.190
thinking she understands 
them better than anyone.

18:03.190 --> 18:06.780
Most people would be annoyed by that,

18:06.780 --> 18:09.930
but everyone just ends up becoming 
yet another one of her followers.

18:10.290 --> 18:12.650
Yet there's no sign she's 
used any spells or magic tools

18:12.650 --> 18:14.370
to mess with people's minds.

18:14.620 --> 18:17.340
It's just so utterly creepy.

18:20.700 --> 18:23.360
There are some students 
who aren't her followers,

18:23.980 --> 18:27.380
but most are keeping quiet because 
they just want to get by in peace.

18:27.900 --> 18:31.000
<i>I guess her Saint qualities 
don't affect everyone.</i>

18:32.130 --> 18:36.170
Remember when you so boldly argued against 
her essay in the rose garden before?

18:36.170 --> 18:39.630
You handled that with such 
finesse! It felt great to waâ€”

18:40.200 --> 18:42.050
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

18:42.050 --> 18:43.240
Prince Duke?!

18:43.240 --> 18:46.010
I'm sorry for the trouble 
my subordinate caused you.

18:46.010 --> 18:47.080
Subordinate?

18:47.080 --> 18:50.680
This is Mel, my personal spy.

18:51.280 --> 18:52.850
<i>A spy?!</i>

18:52.850 --> 18:54.850
<i>No way! That's such 
a villain thing to have!</i>

18:55.080 --> 18:59.790
Ali-Ali, check to make sure 
my skull isn't cracked!

18:59.790 --> 19:04.240
She's eccentric, but she's a genius 
when it comes to earth magic.

19:04.240 --> 19:06.950
She acts as my eyes and ears.

19:07.180 --> 19:11.920
See, with earth magic, you can 
record sound, as you saw earlier,

19:11.920 --> 19:14.750
and it also allows you to hide 
and conceal your presence!

19:14.750 --> 19:18.000
So <i>that's</i> how you were able 
to record that conversation.

19:18.950 --> 19:22.350
I learned of their little 
scheme while on duty.

19:22.350 --> 19:23.890
On duty?

19:23.890 --> 19:26.800
I had ordered her to keep an eye on you.

19:28.760 --> 19:32.220
Oh, but it's not as if I was 
watching you around the clock!

19:32.220 --> 19:36.080
I stay in my own class 
when school's in session.

19:36.080 --> 19:38.230
I didn't tell you sooner

19:38.530 --> 19:41.560
because I didn't want it 
to lessen your freedom.

19:41.920 --> 19:45.830
I like you when you're being who 
you are, vibrant and lively.

19:46.080 --> 19:49.470
I thought that if you knew, 
you'd find it restrictive.

19:49.470 --> 19:53.160
But hearing what you said 
made me rethink things.

19:53.410 --> 19:56.260
That's why he decided 
to come clean about me.

19:56.260 --> 20:00.730
And I'm so happy I'm allowed 
to talk to you now!

20:00.730 --> 20:03.800
I want to protect you with 
my own two hands, too.

20:04.680 --> 20:05.850
Prince Duke...

20:06.970 --> 20:09.360
Don't go off into your own world, you two.

20:10.450 --> 20:14.990
Then... you also knew that I was 
playing the villainess role

20:14.990 --> 20:17.980
because you heard it from her?

20:17.980 --> 20:20.080
I think it was pretty obvious.

20:20.080 --> 20:22.360
Well, that's fine. I mean...

20:22.780 --> 20:26.070
It makes me feel like a co-conspirator, 
and that's not so bad.

20:27.250 --> 20:29.250
That makes you happy...

20:29.250 --> 20:30.770
when it's the guy you like?

20:30.770 --> 20:32.430
Hey! Whaâ€”

20:36.320 --> 20:38.050
U-Um...

20:38.300 --> 20:41.960
I just remembered I have 
something to do! Goodbye!

20:41.960 --> 20:44.390
Hang on, Alicia!

20:50.100 --> 20:51.290
You ran away.

20:51.290 --> 20:53.090
Shut up!

20:53.090 --> 20:56.030
It's not a lie that I promised 
to meet with Grandpa Will!

20:56.810 --> 20:59.690
That wasn't villainess-like 
of me at all, though.

21:00.050 --> 21:03.300
I just want to be a woman who can 
make Prince Duke's heart race...

21:04.440 --> 21:07.000
I think... it probably is racing.

21:12.300 --> 21:13.990
Alicia! Gill!

21:14.290 --> 21:16.410
What's with the big crowd?

21:16.800 --> 21:19.170
Grandpa called us all here.

21:19.480 --> 21:20.470
Are they...

21:20.770 --> 21:22.180
Our vigilante corps.

21:22.180 --> 21:24.680
Master Will put them together.

21:25.160 --> 21:26.380
I'm the leader.

21:26.740 --> 21:28.830
Since you gave him an eye,

21:28.830 --> 21:31.680
he's been throwing all his energy 
into changing this village.

21:31.680 --> 21:34.190
It's like he gets younger with every minute!

21:34.190 --> 21:35.700
Grandpa Will...

21:35.700 --> 21:37.600
I see you're all here.

21:41.700 --> 21:44.270
Thanks for coming, Alicia and Gill.

21:45.160 --> 21:48.840
I thought it was about 
time I told all of you...

21:49.210 --> 21:54.200
about Roana's future, and 
about my own boring past.

21:55.520 --> 22:00.630
I am the older brother of the 
current king, Luke Seeker...

22:01.080 --> 22:02.930
Will Seeker.

22:02.930 --> 22:03.980
What?!
