00:00.290 --> 00:01.510
Alicia!

00:03.330 --> 00:04.280
Gill?

00:07.760 --> 00:09.570
You've gotten taller.

00:13.050 --> 00:14.820
I didn't recognize you.

00:14.820 --> 00:16.740
Uh... yeah...

00:17.010 --> 00:18.160
What is it?

00:19.580 --> 00:24.490
Um... It's just been so long, 
I don't know what to say.

00:25.020 --> 00:27.230
I feel the same way, Gill.

00:27.890 --> 00:29.160
But, let me see...

00:30.960 --> 00:33.250
First, let's head over to Roana!

00:33.250 --> 00:34.700
O-Okay.

00:35.210 --> 00:36.170
Huh?!

00:37.420 --> 00:41.080
Hey, are you sure you don't 
want to go back home first?

00:41.080 --> 00:44.170
Everyone there's dying to see 
you and know you're doing okay.

00:44.990 --> 00:47.520
I want to get to the village 
as soon as possible.

00:47.520 --> 00:49.760
Well, the way the village is now,

00:49.760 --> 00:52.690
it should be okay to visit 
at this time of day...

00:52.690 --> 00:54.450
But why are you in such a hurry?

00:55.140 --> 00:57.230
I finally learned what I needed.

00:59.330 --> 01:01.440
It's my first visit to Roana in two years!

01:13.710 --> 01:20.720
I'll Become a <b>Villainess</b>
Who Goes Down in History

02:36.050 --> 02:41.010
<b>The Villainess and the Return</b>

02:49.190 --> 02:51.480
This... is Roana?

02:51.480 --> 02:53.050
Amazing, isn't it?

02:53.050 --> 02:55.140
All the villagers have 
been working together,

02:55.140 --> 02:58.270
with Rebecca at their center, 
and it's come this far.

02:58.270 --> 03:01.260
It has a completely different feel 
compared to when I was last here.

03:01.260 --> 03:02.900
So, you're Alicia?

03:03.820 --> 03:04.870
Nate.

03:05.950 --> 03:08.410
He's working as the village's guard.

03:08.410 --> 03:10.250
You know about me?

03:10.250 --> 03:13.290
Yeah. Rebecca filled me in.

03:13.290 --> 03:16.110
You're the reason this village has 
improved so much, aren't you?

03:16.780 --> 03:20.410
I didn't have to watch any kids 
starve to death this year.

03:20.410 --> 03:22.240
I'm grateful for that.

03:22.660 --> 03:23.860
But still...

03:23.860 --> 03:26.630
Frankly, I don't trust you.

03:27.480 --> 03:29.060
That's only natural.

03:29.060 --> 03:32.390
I'd be more concerned if you 
just blindly trusted me.

03:32.650 --> 03:36.650
We heard nothing from you for so long,
 and now suddenly you're here?

03:36.650 --> 03:38.150
What are you after?

03:38.710 --> 03:42.370
If you're here to toy with Rebecca and 
everyone else as some kind of noble's game...

03:43.020 --> 03:47.150
Nate! I told you why Alicia 
didn't come back earlier!

03:47.150 --> 03:48.930
All right. I understand.

03:49.330 --> 03:52.260
Draw your sword. We'll have a test of skill.

03:52.260 --> 03:54.920
Huh? Why should I do that?

03:54.920 --> 03:59.700
You can't judge me because you 
don't know me well enough, right?

03:59.700 --> 04:02.150
I don't know you, either.

04:02.150 --> 04:04.460
Seeing what you can do is 
the best way to find out.

04:04.460 --> 04:08.760
I haven't sunk so low that I have to 
beat up a weak-looking girl like you.

04:08.760 --> 04:09.830
Oh?

04:09.830 --> 04:13.810
If you're not confident in your skills, 
we can compete in some other way.

04:14.530 --> 04:16.010
You think you can mock me?

04:16.010 --> 04:18.240
Don't blame me when you get hurt!

04:21.570 --> 04:24.730
There seems to be some kind 
of commotion going on.

04:25.190 --> 04:27.070
Hey! What's going on?!

04:32.300 --> 04:33.460
Alicia!

04:33.460 --> 04:36.350
He says he can't trust me,

04:36.350 --> 04:38.870
so I showed him which one of us is stronger.

04:38.870 --> 04:41.750
I can't believe it! How could Nate lose?

04:41.750 --> 04:43.570
I know! It was magic!

04:43.570 --> 04:45.950
The bitch must have cheated!

04:45.950 --> 04:46.760
Shut up!

04:47.060 --> 04:49.460
Her talent is the real deal.

04:49.460 --> 04:51.480
She didn't use any magic.

04:52.870 --> 04:55.830
Let me tell you why I won.

04:55.830 --> 04:59.500
It's because I'm the daughter of a nobleman.

04:59.500 --> 05:00.390
What?

05:00.690 --> 05:02.780
I can spend all day doing 
nothing but training

05:02.780 --> 05:05.580
because everything I need 
in life is provided for me.

05:06.060 --> 05:09.820
I can even learn from my older 
brothers, who are skilled swordsmen.

05:10.090 --> 05:14.470
Had you learned swordsmanship in 
the same circumstances as I have,

05:14.470 --> 05:17.070
the outcome might have been very different.

05:17.700 --> 05:21.250
What does any of that matter?! 
Are you being snide on purpose?!

05:21.250 --> 05:24.130
I'm suggesting that you use me.

05:24.130 --> 05:26.190
If I'm just a noble putting 
on a charitable front,

05:26.190 --> 05:28.070
why not use me to your advantage?

05:28.880 --> 05:31.570
Show me that you have at 
least that much backbone.

05:31.570 --> 05:33.960
Rebecca is important to you, isn't she?

05:35.490 --> 05:36.730
A-Alicia!

05:38.180 --> 05:39.760
My goodness.

05:41.810 --> 05:45.750
I see you're as reckless as ever, Alicia.

05:46.360 --> 05:47.910
Grandpa Will!

05:51.310 --> 05:53.130
It's been a long time.

05:53.130 --> 05:57.960
Grandpa, I've acquired dark 
magic up to level 91!

05:57.960 --> 06:00.680
Well, that is quite an achievement.

06:00.680 --> 06:02.950
That's why I came here 
in such a hurry today.

06:04.900 --> 06:07.100
Ra, ra, rah...

06:08.030 --> 06:10.110
Vatahk des sikzhar.

06:11.490 --> 06:15.010
Vamiit fahvendon zeila.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.680
That's the ancient language of Durkis!

06:17.680 --> 06:20.600
The door to darkness is now open.

06:21.050 --> 06:23.520
Spun, fastened, connected,

06:23.520 --> 06:26.610
the contract is now forged in 
the name of Alicia Williams.

06:27.140 --> 06:29.530
Stop this, Alicia...

06:29.780 --> 06:32.840
Anfang finistenis!

06:34.350 --> 06:35.660
What just...

06:35.660 --> 06:37.080
What the hell are you doing?!

06:43.970 --> 06:46.880
A spell that transfers a part 
of my body to another's.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.260
I can see... My eyes...

07:00.280 --> 07:04.070
Alicia! Do you have any 
idea what you've done?!

07:04.070 --> 07:07.870
Yes. I transplanted one of my eyes into you.

07:07.870 --> 07:09.630
I never asked you to—

07:09.630 --> 07:10.970
I realize that.

07:11.430 --> 07:16.300
I realize that you would never 
ask someone to give you an eye.

07:16.700 --> 07:20.250
But I wanted you to be able to see.

07:20.620 --> 07:22.130
Alicia...

07:24.460 --> 07:25.600
Grandpa...

07:26.140 --> 07:29.660
Gill! So that's what you look like!

07:29.660 --> 07:30.650
Yeah.

07:31.690 --> 07:34.270
I can see all the villagers' faces...

07:34.270 --> 07:37.470
You're welcome to praise me a little.

07:37.470 --> 07:41.190
I worked hard to learn the ancient 
language just for this spell.

07:41.580 --> 07:42.540
Yes...

07:42.900 --> 07:46.470
Honestly, what a curious villainess you are.

07:49.160 --> 07:50.980
Is your eye okay?

07:52.320 --> 07:57.250
Yes... It feels a bit strange, 
but it doesn't hurt.

07:57.250 --> 07:58.960
Magic sure is something.

07:58.960 --> 08:00.070
I see...

08:00.350 --> 08:04.910
But won't everyone worry when 
they learn you've lost an eye?

08:04.910 --> 08:07.000
Especially your father.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.500
He's been so worried about 
you these past two years.

08:11.140 --> 08:14.080
Yes, he does tend to be 
rather overprotective.

08:14.500 --> 08:17.430
What if he starts crying on me?

08:18.780 --> 08:20.350
Father?!

08:20.350 --> 08:24.510
A-Alicia's... eye...

08:25.780 --> 08:28.730
This is way worse than crying.

08:28.730 --> 08:31.670
H-H-H-How in the world did this happen?!

08:31.670 --> 08:34.030
Did you have some kind of 
accident while training?!

08:34.380 --> 08:36.460
It wasn't an accident.

08:36.460 --> 08:39.950
I gave someone else my eye 
just now, of my own will.

08:43.290 --> 08:44.660
Father?!

08:45.360 --> 08:49.100
I knew you were the kind of 
child who never listens,

08:49.100 --> 08:52.290
but I never imagined you'd 
come home missing an eye...

08:52.290 --> 08:57.350
I suppose I'm not the good little 
rich girl that you wanted me to be.

08:57.350 --> 08:59.350
Then couldn't you be a bit more...

08:59.350 --> 09:01.700
I know I'm not a dutiful daughter,

09:01.700 --> 09:06.070
but I'm going to continue to live 
the life I feel is right for me.

09:06.500 --> 09:08.270
That's the one thing I won't compromise on.

09:09.840 --> 09:13.950
Nor will I ever compromise 
on my concern for you,

09:13.950 --> 09:16.800
no matter how much it may annoy you.

09:17.120 --> 09:18.440
I'm your father, after all.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.470
Father...

09:20.870 --> 09:24.790
Congratulations on acquiring 
magic surpassing level 90.

09:25.170 --> 09:27.680
You've worked hard these past two years.

09:28.110 --> 09:29.950
I'm a man of my word.

09:29.950 --> 09:33.300
You may continue to act 
as Liz Cather's watcher.

09:37.120 --> 09:39.040
Alicia, here.

09:39.850 --> 09:40.940
What's this?

09:40.940 --> 09:43.390
I thought you should have 
something to cover your eye,

09:43.390 --> 09:44.870
so I made this.

09:44.870 --> 09:47.130
You're very good with 
your hands, aren't you?

09:49.560 --> 09:50.460
Okay!

09:50.460 --> 09:54.120
Now that I have this eyepatch, I'll 
come up with an outfit to match it!

09:54.120 --> 09:57.120
Huh? An outfit? What kind?

09:57.340 --> 09:59.050
Isn't it obvious?

09:59.050 --> 10:01.440
I'm going back to the academy 
after two years away.

10:01.440 --> 10:04.240
They'll be audience to 
the return of a villainess!

10:09.460 --> 10:11.480
Say, is she...

10:11.480 --> 10:13.710
Don't tell me, after all this time...

10:13.710 --> 10:15.580
Alicia Williams?!

10:17.350 --> 10:20.790
A good day to you, ladies.

10:22.010 --> 10:24.470
<i>Here's your savior again!</i>

10:22.010 --> 10:27.020
I'll Become a <b>Villainess
</b>Who Goes Down in History

10:24.470 --> 10:27.010
<i>Oh, I get to continue from 
last week? That's rar—</i>

10:27.020 --> 10:32.020
I'll Become a <b>Villainess
</b>Who Goes Down in History

10:27.380 --> 10:31.060
<i>If I were to marry Miss Liz, which 
one of us would be the husband?</i>

10:31.060 --> 10:32.010
<i>Probably me!</i>

10:35.860 --> 10:39.330
Alicia, you're... pretty conspicuous.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.760
Just what I wanted.

10:42.760 --> 10:47.460
The return of a villainess needs 
a good visual presentation, too.

10:47.460 --> 10:48.780
Miss Alicia.

10:50.990 --> 10:54.090
I thought you wouldn't be 
coming back to school.

10:55.510 --> 10:56.840
Who are you?

10:56.840 --> 10:59.830
Hmph! I have no business with a commoner.

10:59.830 --> 11:02.630
I dont know why you're here,

11:02.630 --> 11:06.270
but wouldn't it be best for you 
to leave this school right now?

11:07.330 --> 11:10.340
I'll be returning to the 
academy as of next week.

11:10.340 --> 11:13.010
I've come today to pay my respects.

11:13.450 --> 11:17.440
You're one of Liz's more ardent 
companions, aren't you?

11:17.710 --> 11:20.620
Well, well. I'm impressed you knew that.

11:20.950 --> 11:23.580
<i>I sense obvious hostility from her.</i>

11:24.000 --> 11:28.190
<i>It makes the most sense to assume 
she's one of Liz's followers.</i>

11:28.570 --> 11:33.290
You seem to have unilaterally 
designated Miss Liz as your rival,

11:33.290 --> 11:35.570
but I suggest you recognize 
your own shallowness,

11:35.570 --> 11:38.880
before you embarrass yourself any further.

11:39.280 --> 11:43.100
Oh, dear! Just what is it about me
 that you've deemed shallow?

11:43.100 --> 11:47.110
Just one glimpse of that garish outfit 
you're wearing makes it painfully clear.

11:47.110 --> 11:48.960
You're nothing like Miss Liz.

11:49.250 --> 11:52.270
Who the hell would want 
to be like Liz Cather?

11:52.640 --> 11:56.500
Miss Liz never prioritizes 
outer appearances.

11:56.500 --> 12:00.400
She looks at who everyone is on 
the inside, equally and fairly.

12:00.400 --> 12:02.820
You're no match for her at all.

12:03.160 --> 12:05.880
What's inside is more important 
than what's outside.

12:05.880 --> 12:08.420
That's an admirable statement 
befitting of Liz.

12:08.730 --> 12:13.780
However, the reality is that most people 
judge others based on their looks.

12:14.050 --> 12:18.170
In fact, you yourself just criticized me
 based on my appearance, did you not?

12:18.170 --> 12:20.510
Th-That was...

12:20.510 --> 12:23.970
because your filthy inner self 
was showing on the outside!

12:25.570 --> 12:29.020
Your hair is quite unkempt 
and full of split ends.

12:30.100 --> 12:34.130
And wearing your skirt at that 
length makes your legs look fat.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.560
Your ribbon is slightly crooked, as well.

12:36.830 --> 12:41.370
It's as if your slovenly inner 
self is showing on the outside!

12:41.370 --> 12:44.150
H-How rude could you possibly be?!

12:44.150 --> 12:47.630
I don't feel any need 
to keep up appearances!

12:47.630 --> 12:51.400
Miss Liz said that I'm perfectly 
lovely just the way I am!

12:51.610 --> 12:54.440
Hmm... How strange.

12:55.630 --> 12:59.540
Why do you wear your hair so that 
it unnaturally covers your eyes?

12:59.540 --> 13:01.670
Why not present yourself with confidence?

13:02.070 --> 13:06.440
Liz never said that your 
freckles were lovely.

13:07.390 --> 13:09.220
<i>This bitch...</i>

13:10.720 --> 13:11.820
Jane?

13:13.190 --> 13:14.390
What's the matter?

13:14.670 --> 13:15.980
Miss Liz!

13:16.320 --> 13:17.720
Alicia, dear!

13:19.280 --> 13:22.580
She was just insulting my appearance!

13:22.580 --> 13:23.690
It was awful!

13:23.690 --> 13:26.150
You are a lovely girl, Jane.

13:26.150 --> 13:28.120
I guarantee that.

13:28.120 --> 13:30.900
How nice to see you again, Liz.

13:31.510 --> 13:33.620
It's been two years, hasn't it?

13:33.620 --> 13:35.550
There's a lot I'd like to talk about,

13:35.550 --> 13:38.500
but for now, can you tell me 
what happened with Jane?

13:38.500 --> 13:42.290
Miss Liz! You don't believe me?

13:42.290 --> 13:46.710
Of course I do. But I haven't 
heard Alicia's side yet.

13:47.020 --> 13:49.630
It was exactly as she said!

13:49.630 --> 13:52.890
I simply pointed out how 
shameful her appearance was.

13:52.890 --> 13:57.550
You are aware that I am an 
unscrupulous woman, are you not?

13:57.550 --> 13:59.100
That doesn't matter.

13:59.100 --> 14:03.790
Even if you were, it wouldn't be a reason not to 
listen to your explanation of this event.

14:03.790 --> 14:06.850
I want to look into the eyes of those 
involved before I pass judgment.

14:08.150 --> 14:10.820
Do you remember what happened two years ago?

14:11.390 --> 14:16.230
I restrained you because of 
my own preconceived notion.

14:17.300 --> 14:20.410
You stopped coming to school 
after that, didn't you?

14:20.410 --> 14:24.210
If I'd made more of an effort 
to meet you where you were...

14:24.210 --> 14:29.000
Oh, please. I didn't stop coming 
to school because I felt hurt.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.820
I don't need your sympathy.

14:30.820 --> 14:33.800
It's not sympathy. I regret it!

14:34.680 --> 14:36.510
It's only an excuse,

14:36.510 --> 14:39.820
but I knew at the time 
that you would be fine.

14:40.930 --> 14:44.520
Because I believed that I would save you.

14:44.520 --> 14:46.600
I'd made up my mind that I was going to.

14:48.180 --> 14:52.030
Ever since I was little,
 I've been a very lucky girl.

14:52.030 --> 14:54.800
Everything I believed would 
happen always came to be,

14:54.800 --> 14:56.630
and it made everyone happy.

14:57.180 --> 14:59.070
Thank you, Liz!

14:59.500 --> 15:01.320
Thanks, Liz!

15:01.900 --> 15:04.570
Thank you, Miss Liz!

15:05.340 --> 15:09.750
I'm certain that I have a duty
 to make people happy.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.490
<i>Maybe when you've lived 
the opportunist heroine's life,</i>

15:13.490 --> 15:16.640
<i>you gain an awareness of 
your own peculiarities.</i>

15:17.390 --> 15:21.280
I hope to be someone who 
can save everyone someday.

15:21.280 --> 15:23.830
I'll save you, too, of course!

15:23.830 --> 15:26.400
So please, believe in me.

15:26.400 --> 15:29.440
If you do that, I'm sure 
we'll have a happy ending!

15:29.440 --> 15:32.360
That's right! Let's believe in Miss Liz!

15:36.230 --> 15:37.580
This is stupid.

15:39.160 --> 15:42.080
Maybe things have just happened 
to work out for you thus far,

15:42.080 --> 15:44.360
but you can't be certain 
that they always will.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.370
Well... true, but...

15:48.280 --> 15:49.500
Besides...

15:49.920 --> 15:53.180
you hate me, don't you?

15:55.530 --> 15:59.210
Two years ago, when you saw me 
facing off with that ruffian,

15:59.210 --> 16:01.680
you immediately restrained me—and only me.

16:02.580 --> 16:07.350
Given your talents, I'm sure you were 
capable of restraining us both at once.

16:07.670 --> 16:09.950
Th-That's...

16:09.950 --> 16:13.440
There was most certainly 
malice behind that.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.290
Frankly, I was surprised.

16:15.810 --> 16:17.160
That's not true!

16:17.160 --> 16:20.820
I wouldn't... The Saint wouldn't 
harbor such feelings!

16:24.900 --> 16:27.950
Miss Liz... What did you just...

16:28.270 --> 16:31.160
<i>Looks like she didn't realize it, but...</i>

16:31.160 --> 16:35.230
Would it make you happy 
if I were the bad guy?

16:35.230 --> 16:36.270
The opposite.

16:37.120 --> 16:40.530
If you're a good girl, I want you 
to take being good seriously.

16:41.300 --> 16:43.570
All you did was spew lip service

16:43.570 --> 16:46.280
while never taking any specific action,

16:46.280 --> 16:49.370
but you managed a happy ending 
in true opportunist style.

16:49.750 --> 16:52.420
That always irritated me.

16:53.170 --> 16:56.130
If you've realized everything 
just <i>somehow</i> works out for you,

16:56.130 --> 16:59.520
have you tested the range 
and certainty of that effect?

16:59.980 --> 17:02.750
You said you want to save everyone someday,

17:02.750 --> 17:04.590
but do you have any kind of plan?

17:04.590 --> 17:07.070
W-Well...

17:07.460 --> 17:09.280
If you're going to preach your ideals,

17:09.280 --> 17:11.830
be serious about them, and take 
initiative to see them through.

17:15.100 --> 17:17.990
M-Miss Liz, are you all right?

17:18.390 --> 17:20.060
Alicia Williams!

17:20.060 --> 17:22.110
What have you done to Miss Liz?!

17:23.160 --> 17:28.030
I merely informed her that
 I don't want her to save me.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.730
Rather than being kept 
alive at another's mercy,

17:30.730 --> 17:35.550
my ideal is to stay true to myself, 
even if I die hated by everyone.

17:35.950 --> 17:37.650
Now, good day to you.

17:44.750 --> 17:46.500
<i>Hey, Master...</i>

17:47.170 --> 17:50.450
Mel? What is it?

17:50.450 --> 17:54.730
<i>Well, you see, things are playing 
out in a way I didn't quite expect.</i>

17:54.730 --> 17:56.650
<i>Listen up and try not to be shocked, okay?</i>

18:06.400 --> 18:08.150
You surprised me.

18:08.150 --> 18:13.220
At your academic level, you could be placed 
in the highest grade and do just fine.

18:14.040 --> 18:16.360
Thank you, Mr. John!

18:16.360 --> 18:19.230
You have learned well, indeed.

18:19.230 --> 18:21.800
Both you, Alicia, and you, her attendant.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.660
Th-Thank you!

18:26.400 --> 18:29.450
Given your academic level, I can't 
believe you're only eleven.

18:29.450 --> 18:33.080
The Williams household must have 
a fine tutor in their employ.

18:33.080 --> 18:36.110
No, he's done almost all of 
his studying independently.

18:36.110 --> 18:37.950
Is that so?

18:38.420 --> 18:42.380
Yes. He just keeps learning all on his own.

18:42.380 --> 18:44.260
I'm eager to see what his future holds.

18:44.260 --> 18:46.190
Well, now...

18:46.810 --> 18:49.820
It's a real shame he's a commoner.

18:49.820 --> 18:52.850
He could achieve so much if he had magic.

18:54.350 --> 18:58.540
That said, classes in the highest grade 
at this academy are very advanced.

18:58.540 --> 19:01.700
If you ever have any trouble, 
come talk to me at any time.

19:04.130 --> 19:05.670
Hey, Alicia...

19:05.670 --> 19:09.530
Is it true that there are limits to 
what commoners can do, after all?

19:10.080 --> 19:12.460
That is how things are currently.

19:12.710 --> 19:27.520
<b>Noble = Can Use Magic</b>

19:12.710 --> 19:27.520
<b>Noble = Can Use Magic</b>

19:14.790 --> 19:16.840
This kingdom is an aristocracy.

19:16.840 --> 19:18.700
Since commoners can't use magic,

19:18.700 --> 19:22.480
they're often turned away on sight from 
any educational or career opportunities.

19:22.930 --> 19:25.910
And it's not as if all jobs 
require magic, either.

19:25.910 --> 19:27.510
It's so inefficient!

19:27.740 --> 19:29.870
Well, I guess just being a noble

19:29.870 --> 19:33.290
guarantees that you've 
received a good education,

19:33.290 --> 19:37.790
so maybe no one feels the need to 
employ anyone who isn't a noble.

19:37.790 --> 19:39.600
That's the problem.

19:39.600 --> 19:42.310
We need to start by doing 
something about the aristocracy.

19:43.600 --> 19:44.710
What is this?!

19:46.640 --> 19:48.110
Prince Duke?!

19:49.790 --> 19:52.300
<i>Prince Duke is... angry?</i>

19:53.080 --> 19:54.890
What is this eyepatch for?!

19:55.220 --> 19:56.230
Ow!

19:58.060 --> 20:00.750
That's how you greet me after two years?

20:00.750 --> 20:04.630
I'd thank you to not appear out of nowhere 
with magic and try to intimidate me!

20:05.020 --> 20:07.650
I heard you gave your eye to someone else.

20:07.650 --> 20:09.020
Why would you do that?!

20:10.770 --> 20:13.290
It's no concern of yours.

20:13.720 --> 20:15.300
No concern of mine?!

20:15.550 --> 20:19.600
Do you have any idea how I've felt 
watching over you all these years?!

20:19.600 --> 20:21.550
<i>Prince Duke is angry...</i>

20:22.120 --> 20:24.170
<i>no, he's sad?</i>

20:24.670 --> 20:27.310
<i>What do I do? I have to say something!</i>

20:27.310 --> 20:31.190
I know you've been playing out some 
villainess role for fun since you were little.

20:31.950 --> 20:34.870
If it's what you truly want...

20:35.140 --> 20:36.030
I...

20:39.600 --> 20:41.910
Y-You're bothering me.

20:44.260 --> 20:47.760
I don't remember ever asking 
you to watch over me!

20:47.760 --> 20:49.420
Don't force that on me!

20:49.840 --> 20:51.870
<i>No... This isn't right.</i>

20:51.870 --> 20:54.130
<i>This isn't what I want to say at all!</i>

21:01.190 --> 21:02.490
Sorry.

21:02.870 --> 21:04.520
I'll go and cool my head.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.400
<i>I messed up...</i>

21:09.560 --> 21:12.830
That wasn't like you. What's going on?

21:14.040 --> 21:16.140
I felt like I had to say something...

21:16.140 --> 21:19.190
I mean, that's pretty 
villainess-like, isn't it?

21:19.190 --> 21:21.670
Making an enemy of the prince!

21:21.670 --> 21:24.050
I'm slowly but steadily leveling up!

21:24.530 --> 21:27.200
Is that what your idea of a villainess is?

21:27.910 --> 21:29.720
If it is, that's lame.

21:30.300 --> 21:34.920
<i>Having disputes with my rivals and 
ending up insulting them is fine.</i>

21:35.310 --> 21:36.500
<i>But...</i>

21:36.500 --> 21:40.030
<i>trampling all over the heart of someone 
who genuinely worries about me is wrong.</i>

21:40.560 --> 21:43.790
<i>And that's exactly what I just did.</i>

21:44.160 --> 21:46.400
<i>I was absolute scum.</i>

21:47.130 --> 21:49.180
<i>When he looks at me with those eyes,</i>

21:49.910 --> 21:53.570
<i>my head goes white, as if my 
blood's just started boiling.</i>

21:55.020 --> 21:57.790
<i>I didn't want to put that 
expression on his face.</i>

21:58.380 --> 22:02.730
<i>Why doesn't anything ever 
go right with Prince Duke?</i>

22:06.440 --> 22:08.830
What a clumsy villainess.
