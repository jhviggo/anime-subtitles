00:01.660 --> 00:06.210
There is an illness that has become 
quite a problem in recent years.

00:06.720 --> 00:08.690
Dotten sickness.

00:08.690 --> 00:11.660
Can anyone tell us what that is?

00:15.080 --> 00:18.780
Look. That servant needs 
to learn his place.

00:18.780 --> 00:21.390
Is he trying to show off 
how brilliant he is?

00:21.390 --> 00:23.730
His employer is just as bad.

00:23.730 --> 00:27.090
Imagine being from a background 
like hers and needing to hire

00:27.090 --> 00:29.240
a commoner to serve her.

00:32.750 --> 00:35.000
No talking amongst yourselves, please.

00:35.460 --> 00:36.830
All right, Gill.

00:37.100 --> 00:38.190
Yes, sir.

00:38.190 --> 00:42.070
Those with dotten sickness develop 
spots all over their body

00:42.070 --> 00:43.940
and then gradually waste away.

00:44.330 --> 00:48.260
It's said to be not a skin condition, 
but a visceral disease.

00:48.260 --> 00:51.210
Because it's mainly seen in people 
who live in the Degon River basin,

00:51.210 --> 00:53.860
it's believed to be caused 
by the river's water.

00:53.860 --> 00:58.790
Since those living near the river 
need to use its water to get by...

01:01.480 --> 01:04.500
You've grown quite a backbone, Gill.

01:04.500 --> 01:08.160
I can't waste time fretting 
over little things like that.

01:08.480 --> 01:10.860
That's a villainess's servant for you!

01:12.800 --> 01:17.050
Reviewing your lessons? What 
a diligent villainess.

01:17.050 --> 01:18.490
Prince Duke...

01:19.030 --> 01:22.600
That's what's so cute about Ali-Ali!

01:22.600 --> 01:24.520
Yes, true.

01:24.520 --> 01:28.910
A-Are you trying to ruin 
my villainess image?!

01:28.910 --> 01:31.600
You never know who might be 
listening from somewhere...

01:40.320 --> 01:42.480
You really are adorable.

02:05.770 --> 02:12.770
I'll Become a <b>Villainess</b>
Who Goes Down in History

03:28.020 --> 03:32.980
<b>The Villainess and the School Idol</b>

03:33.520 --> 03:36.070
So the poor water quality 
of the Degon River

03:36.070 --> 03:39.050
was caused by the rapid 
development of Laval.

03:39.050 --> 03:39.810
Yeah.

03:40.340 --> 03:44.540
And since Durkis lies downstream, 
we can't do much about it.

03:45.280 --> 03:48.210
Even if we wanted to come 
up with countermeasures,

03:48.210 --> 03:52.400
our relationship with Laval 
would make it difficult.

03:52.630 --> 03:59.850
We have been looking into ways to deal 
with dotten sickness here, but...

04:00.260 --> 04:04.250
They say some wonder drug 
for it exists in Laval.

04:04.740 --> 04:08.010
It's a rare herb called maddi.

04:08.470 --> 04:11.320
I remember reading about that in some book.

04:11.320 --> 04:16.120
It only grows on the steep, rocky 
precipices of northern Laval.

04:16.120 --> 04:18.230
You know a lot about this, Gill.

04:19.660 --> 04:24.820
They say the region of Durkis with the 
highest infection rate of dotten sickness

04:24.820 --> 04:26.650
is the village of Roana.

04:27.110 --> 04:31.840
The village does lie downstream 
of the Degon River, after all.

04:33.270 --> 04:36.630
Unlike the outside world, 
they have no doctors,

04:36.630 --> 04:38.460
and hygiene is poor.

04:38.910 --> 04:41.830
Most people who contract 
it die pretty quickly.

04:42.820 --> 04:45.970
I was looking into it in hopes 
of finding a way to help...

04:46.530 --> 04:50.670
<i>And the wonder drug is only found in Laval.</i>

04:54.390 --> 04:57.520
You sure you don't want to stop Ali-Ali?

04:57.740 --> 05:00.050
If you leave her to her own devices now...

05:00.340 --> 05:02.770
Speaking in terms of my own ego,

05:02.770 --> 05:05.240
I want Alicia to stay by my side.

05:05.650 --> 05:09.550
But if I were to cage her like a bird,

05:10.340 --> 05:13.100
she would no longer be the Alicia I know.

05:15.960 --> 05:18.500
It's when she's flying freely

05:20.010 --> 05:24.890
that she's the Alicia Williams I love.

05:25.410 --> 05:28.950
Aww! You're just overflowing with love!

05:34.380 --> 05:35.540
Oh...

05:35.540 --> 05:36.650
What is it?

05:37.090 --> 05:42.310
I think I left a book I meant to bring
 on one of the library desks.

05:42.650 --> 05:44.130
I'll go get it.

05:44.130 --> 05:45.030
Huh?

05:45.030 --> 05:46.970
I'm the villainess's servant, after all.

05:47.260 --> 05:50.400
Okay, if you don't mind. I appreciate it.

05:51.590 --> 05:52.700
I swear...

05:53.020 --> 05:55.220
She's such a study bug.

05:55.220 --> 05:56.420
Gill?

05:59.670 --> 06:01.430
Liz Cather...

06:01.430 --> 06:03.210
Do you have a moment?

06:03.650 --> 06:04.820
What do you want?

06:05.310 --> 06:10.170
Well... I'd like you to have 
a study session with me, too.

06:10.390 --> 06:11.350
Huh?

06:11.350 --> 06:16.390
You're... well... from the 
village of Roana, right?

06:17.800 --> 06:20.060
Albert told me.

06:20.460 --> 06:28.490
So I... erm... was hoping you 
could teach me more about Roana.

06:29.660 --> 06:33.280
Oh, that's right. You did 
write in your essay

06:33.800 --> 06:36.720
about how sorry you felt 
for poor, pitiful Roana.

06:37.890 --> 06:42.520
I hadn't given it enough 
thought at that time.

06:42.940 --> 06:45.600
I was only writing down my own ideals.

06:45.600 --> 06:50.040
That's... why Alicia said those 
things to me, isn't it?

06:52.810 --> 06:55.250
I need to study more.

06:55.740 --> 06:57.500
Like Alicia...

06:58.240 --> 07:02.020
Please teach me about the people of Roana!

07:02.020 --> 07:05.020
I want to know more! I want 
us to understand each other!

07:07.060 --> 07:12.060
The village is already working toward 
freedom on its own, though...

07:12.620 --> 07:15.490
Won't you please, Gill?

07:15.780 --> 07:19.550
Sorry, but I don't think it'll be that easy

07:19.550 --> 07:22.410
for outsiders and the villagers 
to understand each other.

07:23.710 --> 07:27.450
It may be difficult at first, 
but I'm sure we can.

07:28.190 --> 07:30.450
That's how it was for me, after all.

07:36.390 --> 07:41.620
Having been born a commoner makes 
me stand out in this academy.

07:42.390 --> 07:44.420
I didn't fit in at first.

07:44.920 --> 07:47.270
I was bullied, essentially.

07:47.650 --> 07:53.370
But then I tried approaching 
the bullies on my own.

07:53.940 --> 07:56.960
Avoiding them forever wouldn't 
bring us any closer, after all.

07:57.480 --> 08:00.640
And now, we're all friends!

08:01.750 --> 08:03.840
Liz...

08:04.110 --> 08:08.300
I want you to be my friend, too.

08:08.750 --> 08:13.850
I want to study with you and 
write a better essay next time.

08:14.160 --> 08:18.380
One that even Alicia and 
Duke will agree with.

08:19.910 --> 08:23.060
You can do it. I know you can.

08:23.060 --> 08:23.990
Gill!

08:26.290 --> 08:27.700
Duke...

08:29.000 --> 08:30.230
What did you do?

08:30.230 --> 08:32.480
Huh? What do you mean?

08:32.480 --> 08:35.900
We were only talking...

08:38.530 --> 08:39.400
Gill!

08:42.160 --> 08:43.110
Let's go.

08:43.110 --> 08:44.910
Huh? Okay...

08:44.910 --> 08:47.990
Wait! We need to finish talking—

08:49.100 --> 08:50.240
No need.

08:54.690 --> 08:55.940
Duke...

09:00.260 --> 09:02.820
Gill? That took a while.

09:02.820 --> 09:04.140
Prince Duke?

09:05.810 --> 09:08.240
Gill, did something happen?

09:08.240 --> 09:12.890
Um... I'm not sure myself, actually...

09:12.890 --> 09:16.410
He was acting weird, so I brought him back.

09:16.410 --> 09:18.360
Well, thank you...

09:19.930 --> 09:23.380
Gill, do you need to go home for the day?

09:23.380 --> 09:26.920
I'm okay. I don't feel sick or anything.

09:26.920 --> 09:28.530
Watch out for her.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.040
Alicia...

09:33.810 --> 09:34.840
See you later.

09:35.640 --> 09:38.820
Huh?! Wai... buh... What?!

09:38.120 --> 09:41.410
What did he mean by "be careful"?

09:38.820 --> 09:41.420
What just—Where did he...?

09:45.650 --> 09:49.170
Have you made progress on 
the investigation I requested?

09:49.170 --> 09:54.130
About whether the Saint is just 
some puppet that everyone loves?

09:54.130 --> 09:58.470
Progress isn't great, honestly...

09:58.470 --> 10:00.440
What about the text in 
the ancient language?

10:00.440 --> 10:03.570
Uh... Haven't touched that one yet.

10:03.570 --> 10:06.020
I can barely read any of it.

10:06.020 --> 10:08.770
I'll look into that, too.

10:36.480 --> 10:39.400
That... doesn't seem good...

10:52.670 --> 10:55.210
I swear, that Prince Duke...

11:03.720 --> 11:06.140
<i>All I'm finding is more questions.</i>

11:06.140 --> 11:07.620
<i>Laval...</i>

11:08.540 --> 11:10.850
<i>There's the stuff about dotten sickness,</i>

11:11.470 --> 11:15.440
<i>and there's the wolf they 
sent after Liz, too.</i>

11:16.350 --> 11:20.640
<i>It's all stuff I can't learn 
about without going to Laval.</i>

11:21.640 --> 11:22.780
<i>I want to know more.</i>

11:23.260 --> 11:27.150
<i>Even about the world outside 
the otome game's script.</i>

11:29.350 --> 11:33.040
After all, if I want to be a villainess 
who goes down in history,

11:33.040 --> 11:36.790
I need to have a solid 
understanding of this world!

11:37.030 --> 11:40.630
Exactly! And yet...

11:41.080 --> 11:45.630
<i>The only way to get to Laval is by 
being exiled from the kingdom!</i>

11:45.990 --> 11:50.630
Then why not just commit 
some really nasty crime?

11:50.630 --> 11:52.950
A villainess who goes down 
in criminal history?!

11:52.950 --> 11:58.170
There must be a more peaceful way 
to do it, like asking the king!

12:00.560 --> 12:02.360
Alicia—

12:05.390 --> 12:06.440
What's going on?!

12:06.440 --> 12:07.250
Let's go see!

12:19.130 --> 12:20.220
It's all...

12:20.610 --> 12:24.750
It's all your fault, Alicia Williams!

12:30.880 --> 12:32.130
You...

12:32.970 --> 12:34.470
Curtis, I think you've got this.

12:32.970 --> 12:37.760
Scissor... Scissor... Scissor...

12:34.470 --> 12:36.000
Think she'll be gentle with me?

12:36.000 --> 12:36.640
Yeah!

12:36.640 --> 12:37.740
Okay!

12:38.410 --> 12:39.530
This is way better!

12:38.410 --> 12:42.980
No style at all... No style at all...

12:39.530 --> 12:40.340
That seems unfair...

12:40.340 --> 12:41.700
You looked great with the scissors!

12:41.700 --> 12:42.450
Really?

12:42.450 --> 12:42.980
Yep!

12:47.110 --> 12:49.830
You look absolutely wretched.

12:49.830 --> 12:53.830
Jane, was this your doing?

12:53.830 --> 12:55.230
No!

12:55.230 --> 12:59.760
It's your fault Carol 
looks so pathetic now!

13:00.080 --> 13:02.410
That doesn't make any sense.

13:02.410 --> 13:06.610
After being by Miss Liz's side 
for so long, I know very well

13:06.950 --> 13:11.030
how she's been looking at you 
with such foolhardy abandon

13:11.030 --> 13:13.400
while you keep challenging Miss Liz.

13:15.260 --> 13:17.850
You looked up to her, didn't you?!

13:19.260 --> 13:22.740
Seeing you go starry-eyed over
 a misfit like her makes me cringe!

13:22.740 --> 13:25.940
What, did you want to be like her yourself?!

13:26.370 --> 13:30.010
Like the way she humiliated 
me in the past...

13:30.590 --> 13:34.190
Did you want to do something 
just like it for attention?!

13:34.190 --> 13:36.910
You both made a fool out of me!

13:36.910 --> 13:39.010
And that's why I—

13:40.120 --> 13:44.890
I see now that this is just 
resentment on your part,

13:44.890 --> 13:47.050
but why resort to violence?

13:47.050 --> 13:49.710
Because you know you'd never 
win with words alone?

13:49.710 --> 13:54.040
It's because just knowing that she 
admires you makes me sick!

13:54.910 --> 13:59.610
I'll bet you even grew out your 
hair so you'd look more like her!

13:59.610 --> 14:01.820
So much for that now!

14:01.820 --> 14:06.010
You'll <i>never</i> be Alicia Williams!

14:10.370 --> 14:11.700
This is too cruel.

14:11.970 --> 14:14.230
<i>She's</i> the cruel one!

14:14.230 --> 14:18.200
How can you stand there looking 
like you don't even care

14:18.200 --> 14:21.220
while someone who idolizes you 
is going through this?!

14:21.610 --> 14:24.640
Well, true. I really don't care.

14:24.640 --> 14:25.500
Huh?!

14:25.500 --> 14:31.130
Because if she really does look up to me—

14:31.130 --> 14:34.670
if we both aspire to be
 the same type of woman—

14:35.180 --> 14:37.820
then she wouldn't be bothered
 by a little spat like this.

14:39.730 --> 14:43.660
<i>Being hated is what makes 
a villainess a villainess.</i>

14:46.290 --> 14:48.100
Did you all hear that?!

14:48.100 --> 14:51.600
She doesn't care the least 
little bit about Carol!

14:51.600 --> 14:53.590
Even after this happened because of her!

14:53.590 --> 14:56.200
This is not Alicia's fault!

14:57.530 --> 15:00.950
The one who took those scissors 
to my hair was you!

15:01.330 --> 15:03.240
E-Excuse me?

15:08.710 --> 15:12.100
S-Stop looking at me that way...

15:12.100 --> 15:17.030
with those eyes that
 look just like Alicia's!

15:24.830 --> 15:26.350
Alicia...

15:29.640 --> 15:31.440
Wh-What are you trying to pull?!

15:37.150 --> 15:38.370
Alicia?!

15:49.860 --> 15:51.980
Oh, look. Now we match.

15:54.880 --> 15:59.700
Alicia, you never fail to surprise me...

16:00.620 --> 16:04.060
I'll take that as a compliment.

16:14.740 --> 16:17.240
It's so cute, it's infuriating.

16:17.240 --> 16:19.170
Uh... O-Okay...

16:20.210 --> 16:23.130
I wanted to be the first to see this!

16:23.130 --> 16:26.510
How many times have I heard that this week?

16:26.510 --> 16:29.230
Well, I just wanna say it over and over!

16:29.580 --> 16:33.330
Because it just looks so 
good on you, Ali-Ali!

16:31.150 --> 16:32.440
Mel...

16:34.370 --> 16:37.460
I finally get to replenish 
my Ali-Ali reserves!

16:37.460 --> 16:40.620
Master just kept giving me 
more jobs to do, you know!

16:40.620 --> 16:41.510
Mel!

16:45.530 --> 16:47.520
Ooh, glaring daggers...

16:47.520 --> 16:52.990
Anyway, I heard you let loose 
with another Ali-Ali line!

16:52.990 --> 16:55.040
Carol was so grateful!

16:55.040 --> 16:55.850
Huh?

16:55.850 --> 16:58.610
She's actually a relative of mine.

16:58.610 --> 17:01.870
She was so happy when you 
cleaned up her hair for her!

17:04.140 --> 17:05.300
<i>Snap!</i>

17:07.380 --> 17:08.540
I see.

17:15.140 --> 17:18.710
I've been seeing more and 
more girls with short hair.

17:18.710 --> 17:20.240
Appraising them all?

17:20.240 --> 17:21.960
No, I'm not.

17:21.960 --> 17:25.050
I'm just saying that's the effect Ali had.

17:25.050 --> 17:26.160
Even today...

17:34.270 --> 17:37.840
There were so many people who just 
hung all over Liz, and now...

17:38.260 --> 17:39.490
Good for her.

17:39.490 --> 17:41.510
Move it, you three!

17:42.560 --> 17:45.500
This place belongs to Miss Liz and us!

17:45.500 --> 17:48.600
If you're on Alicia's 
side now, you can leave!

17:49.310 --> 17:53.120
This rose garden is supposed 
to be open to everyone!

17:54.020 --> 17:58.470
Looks like there are still some 
extreme devotees, though.

18:01.500 --> 18:02.970
Now, now.

18:03.330 --> 18:07.500
All this tension is ruining 
your lovely faces.

18:07.500 --> 18:09.250
Master Curtis!

18:09.250 --> 18:13.030
Would you care to chat with me for a while?

18:13.030 --> 18:14.920
Master Curtis!

18:17.690 --> 18:19.230
No shame at all.

18:19.230 --> 18:23.160
Still, for someone who 
was so despised before

18:23.160 --> 18:25.470
to change people's opinions 
with raw talent...

18:31.180 --> 18:32.870
Look, it's Alicia!

18:34.710 --> 18:38.240
Even the people who were 
devoted followers of Liz

18:38.240 --> 18:41.380
seem to have started changing their minds.

18:41.380 --> 18:44.820
But even if cutting your hair did 
draw a lot of attention...

18:44.820 --> 18:46.180
doesn't it seem weird?

18:46.400 --> 18:51.190
Maybe I've started to develop 
some evil charisma?

18:52.640 --> 18:54.080
I was kidding.

18:54.080 --> 18:55.600
Were you, though?

18:55.970 --> 19:00.770
<i>He's right. Can people's minds 
really change so drastically?</i>

19:01.350 --> 19:03.040
<i>Something's strange here.</i>

19:03.610 --> 19:05.970
Where do you get off playing the victim?!

19:09.900 --> 19:14.580
Whose fault do you think it is that 
even I've been pegged as a liar?!

19:15.630 --> 19:21.220
Because of you, some people are 
even starting to doubt Miss Liz!

19:21.220 --> 19:26.310
You don't even have the right to 
breathe the same air as Miss Liz!

19:26.310 --> 19:27.690
Yeah!

19:31.600 --> 19:33.930
What? You're crying now?

19:33.930 --> 19:36.100
I know! Why don't you hide your tears

19:36.100 --> 19:39.120
behind those shamelessly 
long bangs of yours?

19:39.120 --> 19:42.660
Tears <i>and</i> mud? You're absolutely filthy!

19:43.260 --> 19:46.280
What a disgrace. Would you
 just go away already?

19:48.520 --> 19:49.750
My uniform!

19:49.750 --> 19:51.190
It's on my face!

19:51.190 --> 19:52.420
What a disgrace.

19:54.100 --> 19:56.340
Why don't you just go away already?

19:56.830 --> 19:59.850
You should really wash all that mud off.

19:59.850 --> 20:01.220
Alicia!

20:01.220 --> 20:02.650
What was that for?!

20:02.970 --> 20:06.640
If you don't leave,
 the next thing I send flying

20:06.640 --> 20:09.180
might just be you three.

20:15.330 --> 20:17.540
<i>What a great villainess line!</i>

20:17.540 --> 20:20.450
What's the idea? Were 
you trying to help me?

20:21.140 --> 20:24.570
It's all your fault this 
happened in the first place!

20:24.570 --> 20:27.150
What? You brought it upon yourself!

20:27.380 --> 20:28.690
Get out of here!

20:28.690 --> 20:31.080
Just get out of here, now!

20:36.840 --> 20:38.670
Stop it already!

20:38.960 --> 20:43.090
If you want to cry, I don't think 
there's any need to hold back.

20:43.600 --> 20:47.760
I-I'm not crying! Don't patronize me!

20:47.760 --> 20:52.690
Right. You think crying is 
an admission of defeat.

20:52.690 --> 20:55.630
But that's fine too, isn't it?

20:56.070 --> 21:00.300
Frustration is what makes people grow.

21:03.400 --> 21:06.600
Stay here until you feel ready to leave.

21:07.070 --> 21:09.380
No one else will come in until then.

21:27.270 --> 21:30.740
You're a pretty nice person, you know that?

21:30.740 --> 21:35.100
Descriptors like that should 
be saved for people like Liz.

21:35.390 --> 21:40.410
I just didn't want to see 
something so unpleasant.

21:40.700 --> 21:41.960
If you say so...

21:59.130 --> 22:00.460
This is...

22:02.050 --> 22:03.760
Jackpot!
