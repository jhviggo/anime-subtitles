00:01.080 --> 00:04.310
<i>Even after my stunning 
debut as a villainess...</i>

00:04.720 --> 00:07.740
<i>When she preached her 
endlessly flawed ideals,</i>

00:07.740 --> 00:09.560
<i>I promptly rained on her parade...</i>

00:14.120 --> 00:16.730
<i>and continually shot down her</i>

00:16.730 --> 00:19.970
<i>"all people should be friends" 
heroine benevolence, and...</i>

00:25.380 --> 00:27.280
That's Alicia Williams.

00:27.280 --> 00:30.000
The nasty girl who bullied Miss Liz.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.140
She took advantage of Miss Liz's kindness!

00:32.430 --> 00:37.050
<i>I'm now hated enough to cause unrest 
in our quiet, peaceful school.</i>

00:43.350 --> 00:46.810
Why does everyone take Liz Cather's side?

00:47.210 --> 00:49.630
All those grand ideals 
she was talking about,

00:49.630 --> 00:53.360
and she was just sitting around having 
a tea party and chatting about nothing!

00:53.360 --> 00:57.550
This just means it'll take more time 
to guide Liz to where she needs to be.

00:59.800 --> 01:03.470
In other words, my bad name 
will spread even further!

01:03.930 --> 01:06.470
I'm the greatest villainess ever!

01:06.750 --> 01:08.360
Uh, really?

01:08.360 --> 01:10.570
More importantly, we should hurry home.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.690
We're going to Roana tonight,

01:12.690 --> 01:15.430
so I need to get my homework 
and review out of the way.

01:16.090 --> 01:18.380
Such an industrious villainess.

01:27.770 --> 01:34.780
I'll Become a <b>Villainess</b>
Who Goes Down in History

02:50.060 --> 02:55.020
<b>The Villainess and the Villainess Test</b>

02:58.820 --> 03:02.440
Rebecca, have you assembled 
the villagers' stories?

03:03.240 --> 03:05.160
Yes, and, as expected,

03:05.450 --> 03:08.160
negative emotions are predominant.

03:08.160 --> 03:11.280
The most violent ones are even saying that

03:11.280 --> 03:15.080
if they ever get out of the village, 
they'll plunder everything in sight.

03:15.590 --> 03:16.740
Rebecca...

03:17.470 --> 03:20.290
Remember that your own safety comes first.

03:20.880 --> 03:24.750
With that leg, you can't run 
away if anything happens.

03:25.270 --> 03:26.810
I'll be fine.

03:26.810 --> 03:30.440
Everyone knows I've got you backing me.

03:30.440 --> 03:32.010
They won't try anything.

03:32.010 --> 03:34.730
<i>Wow, that makes me sound 
like a real villainess!</i>

03:35.390 --> 03:37.510
Besides, I realized that

03:37.510 --> 03:40.930
everyone in this village now was born here,

03:40.930 --> 03:44.700
so they all assumed changing 
it was impossible and gave up.

03:45.200 --> 03:49.320
But someone who would have died under 
normal circumstances is alive.

03:50.770 --> 03:54.470
And that person is now trying 
to get something started.

03:54.470 --> 03:59.480
That seems to be making them 
all think, "Just maybe..."

04:00.180 --> 04:03.060
I don't want to stop this turn of the tides.

04:03.060 --> 04:05.300
That's why I have to keep going.

04:05.590 --> 04:09.150
If anyone brings change, it'll be 
the villagers themselves, right?

04:09.150 --> 04:14.180
Oh, and none of them seem to 
believe that I'm their savior.

04:14.180 --> 04:17.720
<i>That's odd. I thought it was a nice setup.</i>

04:18.290 --> 04:21.660
Say... as someone looking from the outside,

04:21.660 --> 04:25.410
do you think there's a chance 
this village could be set free?

04:27.130 --> 04:30.000
Thanks to Liz and her strong influence,

04:30.000 --> 04:32.220
public interest in it has grown a bit.

04:32.220 --> 04:36.550
But we're not yet at the stage where 
we can take any specific action.

04:37.110 --> 04:40.670
Change like this doesn't happen overnight.

04:40.670 --> 04:42.920
Don't rush things, you two.

04:42.920 --> 04:44.010
All right.

04:44.010 --> 04:46.680
Alicia, I do have a favor to ask.

04:46.680 --> 04:47.610
What's that?

04:47.610 --> 04:52.870
I think the outside world must have 
crops that we could grow in Roana.

04:52.870 --> 04:55.510
Would you share some with us?

04:55.750 --> 04:56.850
No way.

04:56.850 --> 04:57.730
Huh?!

04:58.010 --> 05:01.160
Why should <i>I</i> have to do something like that?

05:01.160 --> 05:03.590
Villainesses don't give handouts.

05:03.590 --> 05:05.940
Maybe not, but...

05:05.940 --> 05:08.670
That said, it'd be interesting to see how

05:08.670 --> 05:11.990
the village population would 
change with more self-sufficiency.

05:11.990 --> 05:12.670
Huh?

05:13.130 --> 05:15.530
Rebecca, negotiate with her!

05:16.560 --> 05:18.470
I'll report that to you, too!

05:18.470 --> 05:20.910
Would... that work?

05:21.590 --> 05:23.000
Certainly.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.770
You're starting to understand!

05:30.150 --> 05:32.780
Are you writing about Roana?

05:33.480 --> 05:35.470
A written proposal, eh?

05:39.200 --> 05:41.370
You're going to a lot 
of trouble, aren't you?

05:45.390 --> 05:48.290
Brother Henri, are you here alone?

05:48.290 --> 05:53.990
I haven't seen you with Brother 
Alan very much lately.

05:54.700 --> 05:57.020
I've put some distance 
between myself and Alan.

05:58.520 --> 06:01.040
We've been together ever since we were born,

06:01.040 --> 06:04.880
so I was sure I knew him 
better than anyone else.

06:04.880 --> 06:07.550
But once we entered the Academy...

06:09.400 --> 06:12.510
No matter what we do, it's 
always "Liz" this, "Liz" that.

06:12.850 --> 06:14.900
I don't even know him anymore.

06:16.190 --> 06:17.810
And then Liz said...

06:21.770 --> 06:23.540
You're you.

06:23.540 --> 06:25.940
It's all right if you and Alan 
don't think the same way.

06:25.940 --> 06:28.380
All you need to do is be you.

06:28.380 --> 06:30.630
That alone makes you irreplaceable.

06:31.200 --> 06:34.100
It was like cool water coursing 
down my parched throat.

06:34.100 --> 06:35.930
I felt as if she'd saved me.

06:36.490 --> 06:41.310
Did you really come here just to 
ramble at me about how great Liz is?

06:41.310 --> 06:44.040
No, not at all. The opposite, actually.

06:44.040 --> 06:44.720
The opposite?

06:45.200 --> 06:47.750
When you and Liz debated her 
essay in the rose garden,

06:48.300 --> 06:51.320
I thought what you said 
was right on the money.

06:52.130 --> 06:56.600
But everyone else said you 
were just picking a fight.

06:58.640 --> 07:01.680
It's true that Liz's logic 
was naive, though.

07:07.120 --> 07:08.990
It made me feel like
 I didn't understand him,

07:08.990 --> 07:12.140
not just as my twin, but as a person.

07:13.110 --> 07:17.600
I haven't felt like hanging out with 
Liz and her following ever since.

07:18.280 --> 07:20.410
You came here to tell me that?

07:20.410 --> 07:24.200
Yep. I thought I should show my hand first.

07:25.040 --> 07:27.870
Alicia, what is it you're planning?

07:30.060 --> 07:35.140
You must have had a reason for going out 
of your way to clash with Liz like that.

07:36.700 --> 07:37.900
I assure you, it's nothing.

07:38.630 --> 07:40.720
Still won't tell me, huh?

07:40.720 --> 07:43.610
Okay, I'll give up on asking for today,

07:43.610 --> 07:45.800
but I'm not buying the "nothing" response.

07:46.620 --> 07:49.720
For now, here's an invitation

07:50.530 --> 07:53.210
to the king's next tea party. 
Liz will be there.

08:01.290 --> 08:03.320
Now, listen, Alicia.

08:03.870 --> 08:05.910
Don't say anything unnecessary.

08:06.220 --> 08:08.390
You worry too much.

08:12.550 --> 08:14.440
<i>A tea party with the king...</i>

08:14.820 --> 08:16.960
<i>This is no ordinary tea party.</i>

08:16.960 --> 08:19.180
<i>It's an event from the game...</i>

08:19.180 --> 08:21.420
<i>known as the Saint Test.</i>

08:19.180 --> 08:21.640
<b>"Deal with them prudently."</b>

08:19.180 --> 08:21.640
<b><b>"Help them right now."</b></b>

08:19.180 --> 08:26.360
<b></b>Options

08:19.180 --> 08:26.360
<b></b>Palace Room

08:19.180 --> 08:26.360
<b></b>What do to with the people of Roana?

08:21.640 --> 08:26.360
<b>"Deal with them prudently."</b>

08:21.640 --> 08:26.360
<b>"Help them right now."</b>

08:21.760 --> 08:24.270
<i>Choosing the correct answers</i>

08:24.270 --> 08:26.350
<i>earns you more Saint points.</i>

08:26.700 --> 08:30.570
<i>But in the game, the 
villainess didn't attend.</i>

08:31.020 --> 08:33.300
<i>And yet I was invited this time.</i>

08:39.540 --> 08:42.420
<i>So this is also a Villainess Test,</i>

08:42.790 --> 08:45.200
<i>and at the same time, a test of 
how I'm doing as her watcher!</i>

08:49.000 --> 08:54.010
I'll Become a <b>Villainess</b>
Who Goes Down in History

08:49.490 --> 08:50.400
<i>Henri!</i>

08:50.400 --> 08:51.100
<i>Alan!</i>

08:54.010 --> 08:59.010
I'll Become a <b>Villainess</b>
Who Goes Down in History

08:56.640 --> 08:57.390
<i>Alan.</i>

08:57.390 --> 08:58.220
<i>Henri.</i>

08:59.010 --> 09:02.430
Albert! Alan! Henri!

09:04.980 --> 09:06.100
Oh, my!

09:06.370 --> 09:08.690
Even little Alicia is with us today!

09:09.060 --> 09:10.060
Liz...

09:10.900 --> 09:13.470
Good day to you, Liz.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.650
How unfortunate for you that I'm here.

09:15.940 --> 09:18.560
Not at all! I'm delighted!

09:20.550 --> 09:23.840
Liz and Alicia are such a mystery.

09:23.840 --> 09:27.760
I can't tell if you're friends 
or enemies. It's so fascinating.

09:27.760 --> 09:29.820
Oh, we're great friends!

09:30.650 --> 09:33.010
We are not friends at all.

09:33.010 --> 09:35.800
Finn, don't talk to her!

09:35.800 --> 09:37.750
Ah, I see you're all here.

09:38.660 --> 09:39.730
Your Majesty!

09:41.340 --> 09:43.890
Thank you for inviting us here today.

09:44.490 --> 09:46.890
Now, no need for all that.

09:46.890 --> 09:48.420
This is simply a tea party.

09:49.250 --> 09:54.610
I want to express my gratitude to all 
of you for being Duke's friends.

09:55.010 --> 09:57.120
Just relax and make yourselves at home.

09:57.120 --> 10:00.530
<i>This has to be the least relaxing 
tea party in the kingdom.</i>

10:00.530 --> 10:02.390
Thank you, Your Majesty!

10:02.390 --> 10:04.380
<i>Smiling like that when she's 
seated closer to the king</i>

10:04.380 --> 10:06.450
<i>than the highest nobles and their sons...</i>

10:06.990 --> 10:09.910
<i>She does have a heroine's 
nerves of steel, I suppose.</i>

10:10.880 --> 10:17.390
In the game, you needed a high score in 
this Saint Test to unlock the true ending,

10:17.770 --> 10:20.580
but I could never identify with the 
goody-two-shoes "correct" answers,

10:20.580 --> 10:22.850
so I struggled to beat it.

10:24.250 --> 10:26.920
<i>Other than my attendance
as the villainess,</i>

10:26.920 --> 10:29.150
<i>it's playing out just like in the game.</i>

10:29.460 --> 10:32.690
All the conquerable 
characters are here, too.

10:33.390 --> 10:36.830
Making my brothers hate me is just 
like what happens in the game.

10:36.830 --> 10:39.980
It's a little sad, but I knew it was coming.

10:41.660 --> 10:45.450
The only one who's acting 
a little different is Henri.

10:46.350 --> 10:47.820
It's so weird.

10:48.320 --> 10:52.850
Master Gale and Master Eric have made 
their hatred for me quite clear.

10:53.330 --> 10:56.750
<i>Master Finn and Master Curtis are 
behaving as they did in the game:</i>

10:56.970 --> 11:01.170
<i>keeping both Liz and I at a safe 
distance and acting friendly.</i>

11:01.460 --> 11:02.520
<i>And...</i>

11:08.970 --> 11:11.710
<i>The one who's acting the 
weirdest is Prince Duke!</i>

11:12.170 --> 11:15.640
<i>In the game, the only one he 
smiles at is the heroine.</i>

11:15.640 --> 11:18.200
<i>He was consistently cold toward Alicia!</i>

11:18.810 --> 11:23.750
<i>And that fueled the villainess's 
hatred of the heroine!</i>

11:23.750 --> 11:26.700
<i>It's just slightly different 
from how it was in the game.</i>

11:27.310 --> 11:29.160
<i>This Saint Test is definitely...</i>

11:29.160 --> 11:31.390
...actually the Villainess Test!

11:31.390 --> 11:33.680
<i>It won't play out like it did in the game.</i>

11:33.680 --> 11:35.170
By the way, Alicia...

11:35.580 --> 11:40.430
Remember when you predicted the economic 
downfall of Duran three years ago?

11:40.690 --> 11:42.240
<i>The what?</i>

11:42.240 --> 11:43.760
<i>Three years ago...</i>

11:45.980 --> 11:48.600
<i>He's talking about when
 I snuck into the academy!</i>

11:49.100 --> 11:53.470
<i>So the king found out about 
what I wrote on the blackboard?</i>

11:53.740 --> 11:57.860
Things in Duran have been 
proceeding just as you foresaw.

11:57.860 --> 12:01.660
I was shocked that you were able to 
make such a judgment at that time.

12:01.660 --> 12:03.880
Duran has gone bankrupt?

12:03.880 --> 12:06.690
But their economic measures 
were working...

12:07.100 --> 12:10.680
Their productive capacity and buying 
capacity were in disagreement.

12:11.170 --> 12:15.310
The measures from four years ago 
that Liz speaks of were a stopgap.

12:15.760 --> 12:19.350
Anyone could have guessed three years 
ago that they would reach their limit.

12:19.350 --> 12:23.920
Assuming everything is resolved 
without even looking that far ahead

12:23.920 --> 12:26.180
is a weak point of yours, isn't it, Liz?

12:29.650 --> 12:32.470
<i>This is definitely a test 
for me as her watcher.</i>

12:32.760 --> 12:35.100
<i>It's a completely different 
topic than the one in the game.</i>

12:35.540 --> 12:36.890
<i>I'll show them!</i>

12:37.660 --> 12:40.040
If Duran has collapsed financially,

12:40.040 --> 12:43.620
we of Durkis cannot write 
it off as irrelevant.

12:43.980 --> 12:46.330
What is your opinion, Liz?

12:46.330 --> 12:48.870
I think we should form 
an alliance with them.

12:48.870 --> 12:52.990
With a bankrupt nation? What do 
we stand to gain from that?

12:52.990 --> 12:56.670
It's sad that all you can see 
is what we can gain or lose.

12:56.670 --> 13:00.430
Truly helping someone takes sincerity.

13:00.430 --> 13:04.700
If sincerity was enough to help, 
they wouldn't be bankrupt.

13:05.100 --> 13:06.420
Well...

13:06.420 --> 13:10.170
All you're doing is negating her!
 What's <i>your</i> opinion, then?

13:10.440 --> 13:12.350
Well, let's see...

13:13.380 --> 13:15.720
Now that Duran is weakened,

13:15.720 --> 13:18.140
I think we should make it a vassal state.

13:18.140 --> 13:21.410
You mean we should conquer it? How cruel!

13:24.610 --> 13:29.540
What our kingdom needs to be careful of 
now is not the small nation of Duran,

13:29.540 --> 13:32.970
but Laval, a larger country with whom 
we have a complicated relationship.

13:33.580 --> 13:37.370
Our nation would gain very little 
from taking over Duran,

13:37.370 --> 13:40.540
but we stand to lose a great 
deal if Laval takes it.

13:40.810 --> 13:42.120
That's true.

13:42.630 --> 13:48.250
My father was saying that anxiety is 
rising near our border with Laval.

13:48.980 --> 13:52.190
But what about how the people of Duran feel?

13:52.190 --> 13:54.880
Wishing for a neighboring nation's happiness

13:54.880 --> 13:57.600
is foolish in comparison to putting 
our own nation in danger.

13:57.600 --> 14:00.850
Still... is there nothing 
we can do for them?

14:00.850 --> 14:04.770
If you truly wish to do 
that, try using your head.

14:04.770 --> 14:10.090
What they need isn't temporary 
aid from another nation,

14:10.090 --> 14:13.030
but economic recovery 
within their own borders.

14:13.030 --> 14:17.990
For example, making a profit by 
exporting their local specialties.

14:18.960 --> 14:21.790
Duran is famous for its potatoes!

14:21.790 --> 14:25.310
But they're not the same type 
as the ones we eat here,

14:25.310 --> 14:27.800
so foreign demand for them is low...

14:28.240 --> 14:29.460
I know!

14:29.760 --> 14:33.580
Why couldn't they make modifications 
to add to their value?

14:33.580 --> 14:38.030
If the whole country produces them, 
the profits should be greater!

14:38.030 --> 14:40.720
That's a great idea, Liz!

14:40.720 --> 14:41.940
Liz has done it again!

14:41.940 --> 14:44.230
Thank you, everyone!

14:50.250 --> 14:55.510
As king, I couldn't he happier to have 
such brilliant youths among my subjects.

14:55.870 --> 15:01.450
<i>As her watcher, I think it's safe to 
say I passed the Villainess Test.</i>

15:09.230 --> 15:11.690
<i>What a tiring tea party that was.</i>

15:11.690 --> 15:13.260
<i>I just want to go home.</i>

15:13.870 --> 15:18.540
<i>The moment the king left, the 
whole party was all about Liz.</i>

15:18.860 --> 15:20.980
<i>I can't deal with that.</i>

15:24.440 --> 15:27.820
<i>Did I pass through this part 
of the castle when I arrived?</i>

15:29.650 --> 15:31.590
<i>Paintings of the royal family...</i>

15:35.020 --> 15:36.900
<i>Why is this space empty?</i>

15:38.790 --> 15:39.360
<i>Huh?</i>

15:40.160 --> 15:42.950
That looks just like Prince Duke 
around when I first met him.

15:43.570 --> 15:46.700
But his skin's a different 
color, so it can't be him.

15:47.230 --> 15:50.140
This man looks familiar, too...

15:50.140 --> 15:54.250
That's a painting of my father with 
his father from many years ago.

15:54.250 --> 15:55.750
Prince Duke...

15:56.680 --> 15:58.780
I must take after my father.

15:59.100 --> 16:02.360
All I got from my mother was my skin tone.

16:03.310 --> 16:05.580
<i>He had an older brother,</i>

16:05.580 --> 16:08.440
<i>but the younger brother 
is on the throne now.</i>

16:08.730 --> 16:11.500
<i>But that's not something I 
can ask about on a whim.</i>

16:12.260 --> 16:14.860
I know. I'll walk you to the exit.

16:15.620 --> 16:18.690
Are you sure you wouldn't 
rather stay with Liz?

16:18.690 --> 16:23.040
Ah, I'll bet you came to make 
sure I didn't do anything bad!

16:23.040 --> 16:24.970
No. You're lost, aren't you?

16:24.970 --> 16:26.630
The exit's this way.

16:38.750 --> 16:41.650
What's wrong? Am I walking too quickly?

16:41.960 --> 16:43.090
No...

16:44.550 --> 16:48.490
<i>In the game, the only one the 
prince smiles at is the heroine.</i>

16:53.210 --> 16:54.140
Here.

16:56.070 --> 17:01.680
<i>But... it doesn't seem 
like this smile is fake.</i>

17:18.810 --> 17:21.190
I don't know how she does it every morning.

17:22.760 --> 17:25.220
You're originally from Roana, right?

17:26.280 --> 17:27.860
What if I am?

17:27.860 --> 17:29.580
What? It's true?

17:29.580 --> 17:31.270
Huh?! Were you testing me?!

17:31.270 --> 17:32.520
Sort of.

17:32.520 --> 17:38.280
In the rose garden, you and Ali 
seemed strangely attached to Roana,

17:38.280 --> 17:39.940
so I thought you might be.

17:39.940 --> 17:41.490
You tricked me!

17:41.790 --> 17:44.220
Your name's... Gill, right?

17:44.650 --> 17:47.410
You're scared of everyone 
but Ali, aren't you?

17:47.410 --> 17:48.890
It's written all over your face.

17:48.890 --> 17:52.360
Shut up! It's none of your business!

17:52.760 --> 17:54.660
You'll end up being Ali's weakness.

17:55.690 --> 17:57.830
You want to stay with her, don't you?

17:57.830 --> 18:00.970
Then hide your emotions, or someone 
will take advantage of them.

18:01.750 --> 18:04.340
Why are you telling me this?

18:04.880 --> 18:09.890
My sister's bound to pick fights with 
Liz because she hates her so much.

18:10.380 --> 18:14.100
It's better if she has someone 
clever with her who can stop her.

18:15.620 --> 18:16.500
Okay.

18:16.500 --> 18:17.570
Hardly.

18:18.510 --> 18:21.450
It's not that I hate Liz.

18:21.450 --> 18:23.200
Why, then?

18:23.200 --> 18:25.910
<i>I can't tell him about the watcher thing.</i>

18:28.120 --> 18:30.820
I'll tell you why, dear brother.

18:30.820 --> 18:34.240
My dream has always been 
to become a villainess!

18:34.240 --> 18:40.090
Standing in the way of someone as perfect 
and popular as Liz makes me feel good!

18:40.870 --> 18:42.340
A... villainess?

18:42.340 --> 18:43.700
Yes!

18:44.590 --> 18:46.810
What's that look for?

18:49.570 --> 18:51.170
Don't laugh at me!

18:51.170 --> 18:53.490
I think it's a natural response.

18:59.810 --> 19:03.890
No one ever told me my own 
little sister was so funny!

19:03.890 --> 19:05.080
You should've said so sooner!

19:05.680 --> 19:07.970
I'm completely serious!

19:07.970 --> 19:12.880
Yeah, well, if you want to stand in 
someone's way, Liz is definitely the one.

19:13.310 --> 19:18.010
If this world was a fictional story, 
she'd be the protagonist for sure.

19:18.620 --> 19:20.300
She's special.

19:20.760 --> 19:24.560
Anything sounds special when 
she's the one saying it.

19:24.880 --> 19:28.280
The most obvious statements 
sound like words of salvation.

19:29.690 --> 19:33.730
I always thought nice girls 
like that weren't my type,

19:33.730 --> 19:36.000
yet I was totally into her.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.170
Say... is there any chance 
it could be magic?

19:40.120 --> 19:41.410
<i>That's true.</i>

19:41.410 --> 19:43.730
<i>Even with the reasoning 
that she's the Saint,</i>

19:43.730 --> 19:46.740
<i>the way everything turns in her favor 
looks unnatural from the outside.</i>

19:46.740 --> 19:48.850
You think she was manipulating my mind?

19:48.850 --> 19:50.900
Nah, no chance of that.

19:51.510 --> 19:55.100
There is magic that can temporarily 
manipulate a person's mind,

19:55.100 --> 19:59.550
but magic that can keep meddling with 
them long-term isn't realistic.

19:59.550 --> 20:00.830
It isn't?

20:01.280 --> 20:05.090
Even I don't know every kind 
of magic that exists...

20:05.090 --> 20:08.760
but it might be written 
in some ancient grimoire.

20:08.760 --> 20:12.340
I haven't read the ones that are 
written in ancient languages yet.

20:12.340 --> 20:15.570
Hang on, do you really suspect it's magic?

20:15.820 --> 20:17.980
I said she wasn't my type,

20:17.980 --> 20:20.790
but any guy would fall for 
a girl as pretty as her.

20:21.180 --> 20:23.900
Sorry. Did I say something I shouldn't have?

20:24.690 --> 20:26.830
No, it's all right.

20:34.970 --> 20:40.410
<i>Even I can't believe Liz is actually so 
wicked that she's manipulating people.</i>

20:40.650 --> 20:44.390
<i>Her superficial, innocent behavior 
is straight from the game,</i>

20:44.390 --> 20:47.590
<i>and it's only natural that people 
would love such a nice girl.</i>

20:48.270 --> 20:52.150
<i>Just how identical is she to 
the game's heroine, anyway?</i>

20:52.850 --> 20:57.940
<i>I'm farther from the game 
than anyone else, after all.</i>

20:58.680 --> 21:01.360
<i>Alicia picked on Liz as 
if she was some big shot,</i>

21:01.360 --> 21:05.780
<i>but when her own lack of talent 
was exposed, she was driven off.</i>

21:06.290 --> 21:09.360
<i>I wanted to be a much more 
powerful villainess.</i>

21:09.360 --> 21:11.350
<i>That's why I've polished 
my strength to this point.</i>

21:11.690 --> 21:15.890
<i>Henri and Alan were constantly 
together in the game, too.</i>

21:16.680 --> 21:19.400
<i>And Duke is only supposed 
to be nice to the heroine.</i>

21:19.810 --> 21:23.630
<i>Even Roana only appeared in name only.</i>

21:23.630 --> 21:26.950
<i>This is the world of the game, 
but so many things are different.</i>

21:27.290 --> 21:29.260
Alicia! Run!

21:29.900 --> 21:30.870
Let me go!

21:30.870 --> 21:32.650
Damn it! Hold still!

21:32.650 --> 21:33.820
Gill!

21:42.300 --> 21:43.570
Where am I?

21:45.290 --> 21:46.830
A storage shed?

21:52.510 --> 21:55.140
<i>I was knocked out and kidnapped!</i>

21:55.140 --> 21:59.140
<i>The villainess was never 
kidnapped in the game...</i>

22:00.090 --> 22:02.260
Oh, you're awake?

22:04.920 --> 22:05.800
Gill!
