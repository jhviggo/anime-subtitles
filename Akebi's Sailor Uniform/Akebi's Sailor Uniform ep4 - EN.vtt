00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.220
You're making a pamphlet 
for the photography club?

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.100
Yeah.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.850
I'm compiling photos taken 
by each of the club members.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.220
I really like your photos, Tanigawa-san!

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.810
Like the one you sent me the other day!

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.840
Y-You don't have to pull it up!

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.280
Really?

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.760
Thanks.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.880
But... are you sure you 
want me... to be your model?

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.260
Yeah. You were the first 
person to come to mind.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.670
That makes me happy.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.060
What do you think, Prez?

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.470
Sounds like it'll be good experience.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.140
As long as you're drawing attention.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.860
A wide range of experiences 
is crucial to acting.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.220
You should make use of anything 
that'll contribute to...

Tanigawa-san!

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.810
My club president said it's okay!

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:29.800
Really?

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.610
Yeah!

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.890
S-Sorry. I'm all sweaty, 
since I ran to find you.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.010
It's okay.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.040
But are you sure I should just wear this?

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.940
Yeah. I want to capture you 
in your natural state.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.290
Togano-san joined the basketball club?

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.220
Got it!

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.160
Wow, Kamimoku-san!

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.110
Wasn't everyone amazing?

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.210
All of those clubs looked so cool!

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.970
Yeah.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.660
I gotta work hard in mine, too!

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.060
Okay, we're here.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.620
It's so pretty.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.970
The tea ceremony club is on break today,

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.840
so they made an exception to let me use it.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.270
Can we go ahead and get started?

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.850
Sure.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:27.770
What do you think?

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.800
I look so stiff!

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.010
It might be because I'm 
not used to the settings.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.770
Is it okay to try a few different things?

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:39.760
Of course!

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.930
Try brushing your hair back a bit.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.040
Yeah, that's good.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:54.960
Yeah, nice.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.570
Now look this way.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.780

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.410
They look really good.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.550
But they don't quite look like 
the image of you in my mind.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.850
Th-The image of me in your mind?

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.080
How's this?

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.590
I think you're getting 
farther and farther away.

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.070

I'm sorry.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.480
I wasn't any help at all.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.400
No, I got lots of great pictures.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.740
I'll pick a few from these.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.210
Oh, Akebi-san, watch your step.

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.070
Heads up!

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.140

You're not hurt, are you?

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:17.880
Nah, I'm fine.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.590
Just startled me a little.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.220
Akebi-san, your uniform!

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.290
You're not okay at all!

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:29.040
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Oh, man, what do we do?

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.380
It'll come off. I'll just wash 
it as soon as I get home.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.880
Oh, I know!

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.400
The Mangetsu Dorm is close by, and it 
has washing machines! Let's go there!

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.710
Mangetsu Dorm?

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.070
It's the dorm we live in.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.070
Really? I wanna go!

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.820
Sure! We're almost done with practice.

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.340
Give me just a few minutes.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.990
Tanigawa-san, you're welcome to come, too!

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.340
Want to, Tanigawa-san?

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.940
I'll... ask my mom, just in case.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.440
Oh, yeah. I should do that, too.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.810
I've never gone anywhere but 
straight home after school.

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:07.640
Me neither.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:17.730
Something's making a lot of noise.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.430
It's all frogs.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.820
They're glad there's so 
much water in the fields.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.250
Huh...

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:25.800
Anyway, what were you two doing together?

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.940
Oh, uh... well...

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.800
I asked Akebi-san to model for some photos.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.490
Really? Cool! That sounds fun!

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:36.880
I wasn't a good model at all, though.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.470
That's not true.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:43.270
You seem like the perfect 
photo subject to me.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.700

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.990

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.900
Isn't that the one they used before 
switching to the current one?

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:20.300
I wore it, too. That takes me back.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.380

What was she like?

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.550
She was constantly breaking the rules.

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:38.170
But students and teachers 
alike still loved her.

fun story like that today.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:52.680
Yeah.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.700

By the way, in addition to Mangetsu,

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:04.250
Roubai also has the Soshin Dorm 
for high school students.

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:08.330
They wanted to use the name of a flower that 
blooms in a different season than the roubai.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.870
<i>Thank goodness. They haven't noticed.</i>

This is our room.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.940
And Kizaki-san's is next door.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:31.850
Kizaki-san! Should we say hi to her?

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:35.250
I think she's in charge of giving 
the dorm announcements today,

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.070
so she's probably not in her room.

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:38.860
Oh, okay.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.980

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:07.880
It'll be fine.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.350
All the noise in the 
world won't wake her up.

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.090
Really?

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:15.300
It's like the way she looked doing 
kyudo earlier was just an illusion.

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:18.760
She really is just like a cat,
 sleeping all the time.

Get changed and make yourselves comfortable.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:26.390
Ah, I didn't bring my PE 
clothes to change into.

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:29.790
Oh, no problem. I was gonna 
lend you mine, anyway.

Oh, I'm fine like this.

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:41.790
Then we'll just have to get 
Akebi-chan all dolled up.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:44.800
Really, anything's fine!

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.800
Ta-da! I had just the thing!

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:52.160
Okay, Akebi-chan, take all that stuff off.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.510
O-Okay...

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:56.210
I bought it on impulse after 
seeing it in a magazine,

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:59.120
but it doesn't really work on me,
 and it's too tight anyway.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.330
But I'm sure...

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:05.510
it'll look perfect on you!

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.830
There you go! Oh, you need socks, too.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.340
Wh-What do you think?

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.830
You've done it again. You look just 
as good as the magazine model.

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:33.820
Yeah, it looks great.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:37.330
It's so pretty, I'm afraid 
I'll get it dirty.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:44.650
If I were you, I might've 
gone to school in Tokyo.

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:45.240
Huh?

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:47.900
Nothing!

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:51.880

Thanks.

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:11.630
Okay. This'll handle the drying, too.

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:12.950
You're pretty good at that.

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:14.380
I'm used to it.

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.020

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:17.020
Yep.

Oh, I know!

Do you two like sweets?

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:36.740
I'll make us a snack. 
You guys can hang out and chat.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:40.350
What?! You can cook, too, Usagihara-san?

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.160
Only those of us in charge of the 
dorm's chores can use the kitchen.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.180
<i>That's not what I meant.</i>

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:49.380
<i>She's amazing.</i>

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:13.680
Smells good.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:14.690
Uh-huh!

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:16.080
Thanks for waiting.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.550
Here you go.

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:21.430
Wow! Did you make all of these yourself?

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:24.080
Well, yeah. Eat up!

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.070
Thanks, I will.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:26.430
Me, too!

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.510
It's so good!

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:34.780
Really? If anything doesn't suit 
your taste, just let me know.

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:36.310
Whoa!

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:39.000
Can you even talk with your 
cheeks that stuffed?!

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.550
Buh der fho nudd!

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.190
When did you start cooking, Usagihara-san?

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:47.930
Oh, well, I...

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:50.520
Come in.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:54.010
Usagihara-san, do you have snacks?

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:57.090
Hang on just a sec.

00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:00.540
Oh, Akebi-san and Tanigawa-san. Hello.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.560
Hi, Nawashiro-san!

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.790
We came to visit.

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:05.720
Make yourselves at home.

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:08.490
Here you go. Butter cookies today.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:10.360
Oh, they're so cute!

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:14.360
Hitomi-chan just finished practice, 
and she says she's starving.

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.920
Yeah, and there's still 
some time before dinner.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.130
Exactly.

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:19.570
<i>Washio-san lives here, too?</i>

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:21.740
See you at school on Monday.

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:25.760
Usagihara!

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.310
Yes, yes, I've got them.

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:28.930
Thanks for always sharing.

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:29.780
And she's from a different class.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:32.040
That's so cool.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.220
See ya.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:34.750
Later.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.130
Oh, Tougeguchi-san. Perfect timing.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.680
These are for you, if you want them.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.310
Th-Thanks.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.620
Hi, Tougeguchi-san!

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.490
Y'almost look like an idol.

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:51.010
Huh?!

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:52.160
Doesn't she?

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:55.580
<i>Usagihara-san's amazing.</i>

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.430
<i>She's already friends with 
so many people here.</i>

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:03.220
I gotta ask for more recipes 
before I run out of material.

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:04.200
Material?

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.080
My family runs a Western sweets shop.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.170
So that's why they taste 
professionally made!

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:12.520
Oh, please. You're quite 
the flatterer, Tanigawa-san.

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:15.520
It's not quite like that, though.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:16.210
Huh?

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:21.850
Weirdly enough, when I lived at home, 
I had zero interest in making sweets.

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:26.060
I only handled sales and, when my parents 
were there, cleaning up the shop.

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:27.720
So how do you know the recipes?

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:30.200
I call home and ask for them.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.720
I've screwed up half of the 
ones I've tried, though.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.480
When I introduced myself to the dorm,

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.350
I wore this and said, 
"I'm Usagihara!" And it fell flat.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.810
I was just trying to break the ice,
 and it totally backfired.

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:46.070
What? But why? It's cute!

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:51.150
Turns out the only thing that works is 
showing your underwear, like you did.

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:54.180
That was a huge mistake. 
Please forget about it.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.280
Sorry about that.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.800
So the idea I came up with 
to save my reputation was...

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.890
making sweets!

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:02.670
That was good thinking!

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:04.760
Dorm life comes with so many rules.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.920
If you want to buy anything, 
you have to put in a request.

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:11.410
So some of the girls were saying it'd be nice
 if we could at least be free to eat sweets.

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:14.960
Yeah, I guess it might suck 
having limits on that.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.330
Yeah. Everyone here felt the same way.

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:21.480
So, since I have the freedom to 
buy food and use the kitchen,

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.180
I stepped forward!

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:24.750
That kinda sounds like fun!

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:25.970
It really is!

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:29.200
They all give me their pocket 
change to buy ingredients with.

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:31.300
You're so lucky.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.530
If you guys asked, I'd make 
some and take them to school.

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:37.470
Th-That would make me really happy...

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:40.490
But what impresses me is that 
you can actually make sweets.

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:43.390
You don't make stuff like that yourself?

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:45.560
I'm not exactly great at cooking.

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:49.400
I help my mom make dinner 
sometimes, I guess.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.870
What a good daughter.

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:52.870
Wanna try it, then?

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.420
If even I can do it, 
you'll pick it up in no time.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.630
You're sure it's okay for me to make these?

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:02.840
Oh, pay no attention to me.

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:06.470
You don't get a great photo opportunity 
like this every day, huh?

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.470
I'll make sure this comes 
out super delicious!

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:12.650
You put the butter in?!

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.720
You don't need to stir so hard!

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:16.410
Which one should I use?

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:17.990
You can pick a plate later!

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.980
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop! Stop!

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:26.490
It's done.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.970
Let's eat.

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:33.010
How is it?

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.120
Is it, uh...

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:41.510
A cracker made of charcoal?

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.420
It's a crÃªpe.

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:47.510
I guess you really are bad at this, huh?

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:51.210
Yeah. Sorry it turned out like 
this after you helped me so much.

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:54.520
Nah, I wasn't a very good teacher, either.

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:58.570
Everything I've done today has gone wrong.

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:00.140
Well...

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.700
I feel kinda relieved, though.

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:03.430
Huh?

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:07.910
I thought you were this perfect 
girl who could do anything.

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:11.980
I'll teach you better next time, okay?

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:14.650
You mean I can come over again someâ€”

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.560
S-Sorry.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:23.340
Huh?

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:26.110
I ate two or three of them...

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:30.620
No way! You mean you ate all of them?!

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.680
I'm sorry!

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:34.370
No, I'm really happy!

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:36.010
Sorry if you gain weight, though!

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:42.320
Oh, Akebi-chan's burp woke up Neko-chan.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:46.330
D-Did not! It was you laughing so loud!

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:49.660
Good... morning?

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:51.700
Morning!

Thank goodness.

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:05.830
It's kinda warm, too! It feels so nice!

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:08.130
Wait, Akebi-san, where are your socks?

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:11.150
Come to think of it, 
they weren't in the wash.

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:14.930
Uh, yeah. They weren't...

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.700
I was too embarrassed to show you.

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:24.240
Still, I got to see so 
many sides of you today,

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.450
nothing you do is gonna surprise me anymore!

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:28.480
T-Tanigawa-san?

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:30.440
That's it! Right there!

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:32.990
D-Don't take pictures!

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.880
I'm still so embarrassed.

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:49.880
Thanks to Usagihara-san,

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:53.370
I think I have a better idea 
of what your image is now.

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:56.670
D-Does that mean I'm a slob?

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:58.110
No, no!

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:02.130
Though... you do have a 
bit of a clumsy side.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:05.230
The Akebi-san I see at school,

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:08.130
and the Akebi-san who tried 
so hard at cooking today...

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:12.370
They're both straightforward and 
honest, and always giving their all.

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:16.980
So I think these pictures 
depict that Akebi-san.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:23.110
You know how you always wave at 
the bus on the way to school?

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.910
Yeah!

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.310
Wait, huh?

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:29.210
I guess you can't see inside it after all.

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:31.630
That's the bus I take to school.

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:36.670
If you run that much every day,

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:39.190
it's no wonder you wear holes in your socks.

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.870
Komichi! Kao!

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.530
Coming!

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:05.380
