00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.740
Ready?

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.980
<b>Midterm Exam Results</b>

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.740

15th   Hayashi Tomoko 
16th   Nawashiro Yasuko</b>

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.180
You placed fifth in our year, Akebi-chan?!

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.990
<b>Episode Eight
I Want to Win Next Time</b>

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.020
The top two are from our class,

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.830
and Tanigawa-san pulled 
off a perfect score.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.460
Ugh, I don't wanna see where I placed.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.640
I couldn't believe it, either.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.130
Komichi-san, is this your first 
experience with exam score rankings?

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.260
Yeah, it is!

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.510
For our entrance exams, I felt like 
I had to study lots or I'd never pass,

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.780
so I worked really hard.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.240
I didn't actually find out 
what my rank was, though.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.550
That's so you.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.760
Hi, everyone. May I have a moment?

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.320
Okay...

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.820
<b>Regarding the Athletic Festival</b>

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.820
All of you who didn't score 
so well on the midterms,

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.370
there's no time to waste dwelling on it!

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.610
Here!

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.500
I think you're dwelling on it more 
than any of us, Tatsumori-san.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.280
Want your forehead to be 
five centimeters bigger?

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.370
Harsh!

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.300
Well, when the top scorer pulls off 
a perfect score, what can you do?

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.410
Don't feel bad!

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.760
Could you be any more condescending?!

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.220
Um, can we get to the point now?

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.480
Today, I'd like us to decide who'll compete in 
which events at this month's athletic festival.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.480
<b>Regarding the Athletic Festival</b>

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.230
Our goal is victory!

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.920
We'll start by looking at the events 
that each of you requested

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.560
and discussing what to do about the 
ones that got too many requests.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.480
You'd better not have requested 
anything just as a joke!

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.220
We've got the results of your 
physical exams here, you know!

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.790
It's possible for more than one 
student to play the same sport,

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.040
but each student should participate 
in at least one sport.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.540
So, first is...

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.300
<b>Table Tennis  2</b>

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.500
Our two table tennis participants will 
be Tougeguchi-san and Ohkuma-san.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.060
<b>Table Tennis  2</b>

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.060
<b>Ohkuma</b>

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.060
<b>Tougeguchi</b>

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.810
For badminton, we have 
Hiraiwa-san and Hebimori-san.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.060
<b>Tougeguchi</b>

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.110
<b>Ohkuma</b>

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.310
<b>Table Tennis  2</b>

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.730
<b>Badminton  2</b>

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.900
<b>Hebimori</b>

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.940
<b>Hiraiwa</b>

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:20.570
<b>Cheer Squad  4</b>

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.570
For the cheer squad...

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.070
Nawashiro-san,

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.570
Kamimoku-san,

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.250
Akebi-san, and...

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.300
Tanigawa-san. That's our four.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.350
And finally, for the swimming event,

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.030
we have Akebi Komichi-san...

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.770
Right!

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.010
Ohkuma Minoru-san...

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.770
Mm.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.060
Tatsumori Ai-san...

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:46.730
And...

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.550
Minakami Riri-san.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.350
Minakami-san, since you're in the 
swimming club, you'll be the anchor.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.220
Sure.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.550
<i>Oh, Minakami-san's in the swimming club?</i>

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.030
Can I say one thing?

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.200
Go ahead, Kizaki-san.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.460
Komichi-san is really good at swimming.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.380
Huh...

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.190
At freestyle, specifically, 
which is the anchor's event.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.960
Erika-chan...

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.170
Why didn't you tell us that sooner?!

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.600
I just swim for fun! I've never 
checked my time or anything.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.130
If the goal is to win,

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.320
shouldn't you decide the order 
after comparing their abilities?

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.880
That's a good point.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.840
What do you think, Minakami-san?

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.680
Fine by me.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.250
Keeping our upcoming practices in mind,

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.110
we should probably decide 
as soon as we can.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.160
I don't think the outdoor 
pool has been filled yet.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:55.100
Minakami-san, do you think we could borrow 
the swimming club's pool after school tomorrow?

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.910
I'll ask.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.780
Okay, see you tomorrow, Komichi-san.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.380
Yep, see you tomorrow.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.450
Oh, Minakami-san... I look forward 
to swimming with you tomorrow.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:17.500
Same here.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:24.030
I didn't know middle schools had 
athletic festivals, so I'm really excited.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.340
If I may ask, have you been 
swimming for a long time?

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.190
Don't be so polite.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.320
S-Sorry.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.770
And call me "Riri."

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.840
Riri...san.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.490
I'm good at swimming.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.370
I even went to the nationals 
in elementary school.

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.530
Nationals?!

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:47.900
I see... I might not have much 
of a chance, then, huh?

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.250
Hmm...

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:51.930
Huh?

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.610
I came to Roubai 'cause I liked the blazer,

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.440
but when I saw you in your sailor uniform,

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.570
it really got my heart pumpin'!

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.680
Hey, if I beat you tomorrow,

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.630
trade me your sailor uniform for my blazer.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:09.570
Huh?!

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.610
If you win, I'll do anything you want.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:16.860
Wait, hang on! The school wouldn't 
let us trade uniforms!

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:17.860
Wouldn't it?

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:22.120
The principal let you be the only 
one wearin' a sailor uniform.

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:24.030
So why not?

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.480
<i>She's right.</i>

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.830
Well, just think it over.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:34.960
I'm gonna take this seriously, 
even if you don't.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.080
What?

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:51.360
Even if you're confident in 
your swimming abilities,

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.480
should you have made that promise?

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.040
Were you snoopin'? That's a gross hobby.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.530
I-I wasn't!

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:01.620
I came back to get something 
I forgot, and I overheard you!

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:05.070
Hmm... Okay, we'll leave it at that, then.

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:08.550
I guess you're really...

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.410
the serious type, huh?

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:16.550
Havin' a bet goin' makes the 
contest more fun, right?

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:20.590
I don't like the way you 
were instigating things with her.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.030
Well, I don't really mind 
havin' people dislike me.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:28.810
And the way you're so serious?

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:30.360
I actually...

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.320
like it.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:39.750
I know! If I win, there's somethin' 
I'd like ya to do for me...

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:51.510
Mom!

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:52.780
Welcome home.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.830
Do you know where we put my swimsuit?!

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.580
Your swimsuit?

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:01.380
Didn't you wear it when Erika-chan 
came over the other day?

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.840
Are pool classes starting already?

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:14.810
Komichi, come here for a second.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:20.600
I see. She's in the swimming club 
and went to the nationals.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.080
I guess the size wouldn't be that much 
different from your spring uniform.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.830
Mom, is this...

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.670
It's your summer uniform.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:49.510
But I guess if you lose tomorrow, 
Riri-chan will be wearing it, huh?

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:51.910
I'll have to adjust the size.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.530
You're so mean, Mom!

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.550
<i>I want to wear this, too... but...</i>

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:01.610
Okay, arms up.

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:11.050
Just do your best.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.480
<i>I'll never trade my uniform!</i>

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:31.970
Well, are you ready, Komichi?

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:34.530
Yeah.

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.420
The rules are simple.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:08.010
The one who touches the wall first will 
be the anchor in the sports festival.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.470
We only have the pool for ten minutes,

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:12.310
so we'll start right away.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.080
The 100-meter freestyle, one heat only.

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:19.360
Who do you think will win, Kizaki-san?

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.140
It's hard to say.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:23.610
On your marks.

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:26.360
Set...

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.660
But...

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.140
I know that Komichi-san is a fast swimmer.

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:41.500
Who's gonna come up first?

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.810
It's Riri-san!

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:50.930
Akebi-san's fast, too!

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.610
Wow, she's catching up!

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.430
They're at the turn already!

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.050
The turn widened the gap!

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:27.070
Don't let her win, Komichi!

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.940
You can do it!

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.080
The winner is Minakami Riri!

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:59.430
<i>I... lost...</i>

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:02.790
Komichi! You're super fast!

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.920
I was goin' full throttle, too!

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.350
I can't believe I only edged 
you out on the wall touch!

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.430
But... my uniform...

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:19.500
Oh, sorry. That was a joke.

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:21.010
Huh?

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.980
You're smilin' all the time, y'know?

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.630
I just wanted to make sure 
you'd take this seriously.

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:32.180
I've never had this much 
fun swimmin' before!

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:35.530
Thanks! I mean it!

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:38.090
Me, too!

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:42.230
That's the first time I've ever 
competed so seriously with anyone!

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:45.410
I'll work hard to be a faster swimmer!

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.050
So... I want to win next time.

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:52.120
I want to win at the athletic festival!

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.880
I hear ya.

00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.670
Let's win, you and me!

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.790
Well done, both of you.

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:18.140
Tatsumori-san!

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:20.450
Ohkuma-san!

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:26.170
Let's make sure all four of us 
practice together a bunch!

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:27.710
Of course.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:34.190
Actually, about that...

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:41.280
If I don't pass my make-up exam,

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.030
I can't go to my club or any practices.

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:45.270
What?!

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:47.910
Our club president's pretty strict.

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:48.440
This—

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.850
Oh, hey, I know!

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:52.090
Have Tanigawa-san tutor you!

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:54.570
I failed one subject, too.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:57.230
Tanigawa-san's a really good teacher!

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:00.670
Oh, is she, now?

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.180
I guess you and Komichi are 
both pretty smart, huh?

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:06.660
Thing is...

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:08.730
I've already asked for help.

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:09.560
Wha—

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:13.430
If I beat Komichi, 
she's gotta help me study.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.640
Hey!

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:16.240
And I'm serious about this one. 'Kay?

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:18.010
Huh?!

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:21.790
That's why I'm so determined 
to beat Komichi.

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:25.240
You actually put notes together 
for me, though? I'm so...

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.590
There it is! One of Ai's 
hand-written textbooks!

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.550
Your handwriting's so nice!

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.110
Thank you.

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:34.880
I mean it!

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.380
No big deal. It was good 
for my own review, too.

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:44.940
Besides, the team can't practice 
if you're not there, right?

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:48.710
Just so you know, if you're doing this,
 you have to pass in one try!

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:51.110
Whoa, she's a tough teacher...

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:54.250
Ai! Me, too! Teach me, too!

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:56.820
You're getting help from 
Tanigawa-san, aren't you?

00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:00.040
But if I have both of you helping, 
that's twice the horsepower.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.510
Me, too! Me, too!

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:03.030
Do you even need help?!

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:23.840
The days are getting longer.

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:26.910
Feels like summer now.

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:44.970
All done.

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:51.720
It's so light! And it still feels warm!

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:55.680
The jacket is cute, too!

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:57.990
The navy blue fabric is summer wool.

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.780
The white parts are made 
with polyester broadcloth.

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:03.340
They're both lighter and more 
wrinkle-resistant than the fabrics

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:04.730
in your fall and winter uniforms.

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:06.500
Wow...

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.500
I made it all nice and pretty...

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:12.610
so don't get too crazy and mess it up 
because you love summer too much.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.680
I won't get a speck of dirt on it!

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.770
And wipe your sweat off frequently.

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:19.970
<i>I know that's never gonna happen, though.</i>

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.450
Isn't it time for you to go?

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:39.510
Komichi, you'd better hurry up and 
change before your dad leaves.

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:43.360
Okay!

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.310
Huh?

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:24.650
Mom! Come here a sec!

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:25.970
Coming.

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:28.840
I can't wait. How 'bout you, Dad?

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.630
Y-Yeah...

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:33.420
You know, when her sailor uniform was done,

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:37.900
she put off trying it on 'cause 
she wanted you to see it first.

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.100
I-Is that right?

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:44.040
Did you get the hook?

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:45.150
Huh?

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:49.480
Since you move around so much.

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:50.610
Yeah...

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:55.600
What? Are you still nervous?

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.570
Aren't you used to this by now?

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.990
It's a totally different level of cuteness!

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:03.120
The chest is more open, and the 
ribbon is such a cute color...

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.720
I'm not sure I should even be wearing this!

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:08.450
Oh, you're fine. Just go ahead.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.700
Thanks, Mom!

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:19.930
You're welcome.

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:26.490
Dad...

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:35.700
What do you think?

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.020
Looks good.

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:43.080
Onee-chan, do a spin!

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.930
Like Miki-chan!

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:46.320
Okay!

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:36.470
Oh, right. Your dad brought us a 
snack, so let's eat it later.

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:37.900
Ooh, what is it?

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:38.930
Cake.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.250
I told him how much you two loved 
it the last time, and he...

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:04.390
Mom!

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:06.770
The bath's not full yet!

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:07.990
Really?

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:12.440
Well, it'll be full soon. Just start 
getting ready for your bath.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.550
Okay.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:35.400
Kao, let's take our bath...

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:39.980
Onee-chan...

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:42.910
I...

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:46.620
don't look as cool as you.

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:54.730
Once you get a little bigger,

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:56.960
I think it'll look great on you.

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.310
Really?

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:00.950
Yep.

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:03.290
So for now...

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:15.490
There, all done.

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:18.190
Look.

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:27.300
Onee-chan!

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.600
Do I look cool?

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.970
Yep, very cool!

00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:37.280
Komichi, Kao! Take your bath!

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.940
Okay!
