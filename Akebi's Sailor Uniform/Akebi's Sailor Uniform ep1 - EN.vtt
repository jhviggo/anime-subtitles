00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.750
Hey!

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.740
Good morning!

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.690
If I can be like the idol, Miki-chan,

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.500
and be just as cool and successful

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:00.850
when I

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.400
start at my new school...

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.500
I can make lots...

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.580
and lots...

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.440
and lots...

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.270
of friends!

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.580
Yes!

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.730
I did it!

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.260
Wow, this water's cold.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.630
I wondered who I just saw fall down there.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.810
Hi, Taira-san!

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.080
Should've known it was you, Komichi.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.610
Oh, I was just, uh...

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.210
practicing swimming while fully clothed.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.150
I'll give you a lift home. Hop in the back.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.610
I hear you got into the middle
school you tested for.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.550
Yeah, Roubai Academy.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.600
It's a private school!

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.360
I heard it's a tough school.
Didn't your mother go there?

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.080
Yeah. That's why I'm so happy I got in!

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.820
Are you, now?

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.280
They say each class has more
than ten students in it!

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.420
I can't even imagine it!

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.700
Well, you were always the
only kid in your class

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.900
back at Futaba Elementary.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.940
Good for you!

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.740
Yeah!

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.000
Akebi's Sailor Uniform

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.380
Thank you!

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.580
Episode One
The Sailor Uniform I Always Wanted

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.330
I-I'm home.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.130
Mom, Onee-chan's home!

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:44.970
Hmm...

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.230
Her footsteps sound a bit fishy, don't they?

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.960
I'll go look!

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.560
You're such a tomboy!

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.510
Who did you take after, anyway?

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.280
Oh, right.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.160
Your dad sent a message to congratulate you.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.990
Really?

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.030
Great work!
Congratulations!

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.070
Great work!
Congratulations!

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.120
But if you fall asleep at your desk,
you'll catch a cold.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.160
But if you fall asleep at your desk,
you'll catch a cold.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.200
But if you fall asleep at your desk,
you'll catch a cold.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.490
But if you fall asleep at your desk,
you'll catch a cold.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.490
Huh?

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.740
How does Dad know about that? He didn't see me.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.140
Try scrolling up.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.420
\hSaved them all
Nice!

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.420

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.460

Nice!

\hSaved them all
Nice!

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.940
Huh?

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.820
Huh?!

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:18.620
Huh?!

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.380
\hSaved them all
Nice!

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.380
What?!

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.380
Read

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.190
My parents are taking sneak
shots of their daughter!

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.250
Yay!

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.840
I can't trust anyone anymore...

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.590
Hi, Dad?

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.550
Yeah. How was work?

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.460
Uh-huh...

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.230
Maybe so, but I wasn't
sleeping the <i>whole</i> time!

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.940
That's your complaint?

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.260
I was studying!

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.750
You'd better save some cuter
pictures of me next time.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.960
Oh...

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.210
I just thought of something...

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.970
but it's a secret for now.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.040
Uh-huh.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.640
Okay. Got it.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.910
Talk to you later, then.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.440
What'd he say?

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.780
That he'll do his best at work,
so he can be home by next month.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.020
Yay!

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.960
Well, then, ready for the thing
you've been waiting for?

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.570
Yay! Yay!

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:18.360
Yeah.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.400
I chose Roubai Academy because I've
always wanted to wear a sailor uniform!

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.740
I was really nervous at
my exam and interview,

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.160
but now I finally get to wear one!

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.050
I wonder if even someone like
me can look good in one.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.170
Stand up straight! She can't measure you!

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.320
Wh-What do you think?

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.420
Hmm...

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.420
You've gained weight.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:52.500
What?!

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.350
You did spend a lot of time
sitting down to study.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.680
No! No way! I'll drop the weight! I swear!

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.010
Get changed. It's time to go.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.090
Time to go!

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.820
Measure me again later!

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.170
I mean, you're going to all the
trouble of making it for me.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.160
I can't let it go to waste.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.850
Even in her sleep, all she's been
talking about is sailor uniforms.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:15.610
Kao!

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.560
She was yapping so much, I couldn't sleep.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.220
Well, wearing a sailor uniform
has always been your dream.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.420
Yeah!

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.170
So I really have to do a good job on it.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.650
What were the kids at Roubai
Academy like when you were there?

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.740
A lot of them were really interesting.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.320
There were a lot of rich, classy kids, too.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.230
The total opposite of me!

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.200
Will I even be able to talk to them?

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.200
I went in every day thinking,
"Time to flip the hierarchy!"

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.300
Like I was preparing for war.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.660
But I'm not as strong as you are, Mom.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.200
Fabrics Store Nihori

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.200
Just be who you are, Komichi.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.130
All you need is confidence and a smile.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.650
Okay, let's look for some fabric.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.460
There are so many bolts of fabric!

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.090
One of these is going to be my...

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.910
Here it is!

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.660
That was quick!

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.490
This is a type of fabric called "serge."

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.220
We'll make the sailor collar,
skirt, and cuffs from this.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.920
This is gonna become my sailor suit!

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.240
And this one is called "gabardine."

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.450
We'll use it for the body and sleeves.

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.870
There are a few different shades of white.

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.780
That's just a matter of preference.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.620
I like the bolder one on the left!

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.830
It's so shimmery and smooth!

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.520
Isn't fabric shopping fun, Mom?

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.660
Whoa...

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.260
I think the ribbon should
be on the larger side.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.130
It'll look cute.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:51.020
Uh-huh!

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.760
Onee-chan, do you need help?

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.810
Nah, I'm totally fine.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.990
It's the stripes that make a sailor uniform.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.540
Wait, wait!

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.040
Mom! I like this one!

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.650
You've been humming all day.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:08.550
Huh?

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.080
It's nice that you're happy,
but think about how I feel.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.310
Y-You're right.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.840
You had to be patient and wait
the whole time I was studying.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:18.820
I'll be more careful.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.980
You won't be able to go to
school with me anymore.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.430
Doesn't that make you sad?

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.330
Didn't you say you were
excited to go by yourself?

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:36.820
No.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.290
You did, though...

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.740
Well, it makes me kinda sad.

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:51.160
You'll be in third grade, huh?

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.200
And you'll be in your first year again!

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.950
Yep, that's right.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:00.690
You know what? I'm just
as nervous as I am happy.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.420
I don't know if I'll be
able to make friends.

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:06.460
A lot of kids from Tokyo go there.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.200
I can't help wondering if
I'll be able to keep up.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.220
You don't have to worry about that.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.230
'Cause you're really cool!

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.300
Thanks.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.260
Hey! You don't even believe me, do you?

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:23.270
Believe it!

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.180
Okay. I will.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.330
We'll both be on our own. Let's do our best.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:33.270
'Kay!

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:38.350
Komichi...

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:40.550
Got a minute?

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.290
It's done already?

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:44.550
Not yet.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.280
This is known as "tacking."

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.500
We use a different fabric to get all the
details set before making the real one.

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:52.740
I didn't know making a
uniform was so much work.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.300
Mom!

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:05.600
The laundry's done!

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.800
I'll do the cleaning, too!

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:11.130
Uh, thanks...

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.350
Mom, I'll do the dishes!

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.350
Mom, I'm almost done!

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.360
Mom!

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:23.800
Onee-chan, you're wasting water!

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:36.940
Komichi...

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.810
Come on over here.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.510
And now...

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:54.380
It's done.

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:57.880
Here, try it on.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.550
O-Okay.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:07.960
I'll be waiting downstairs.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.330
Hey, I like this one.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.000
Don't you think you're a little too young for that?

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.540
It's fine!

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:36.660
Onee-chan, you look so cool!

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:42.470
Komichi, does it fit okay?

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:44.650
Yeah...

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:49.460
Yeah.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:53.850
Thank you.

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:01.990
Roubai Academy Middle School
Entrance Ceremony

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:05.700
A few things have changed,
but it really brings back memories.

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:09.250
I'm so nervous.

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:12.930
I wonder if she's a new student... Wait...

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:15.070
Huh?

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:17.590
Blazers?

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:19.080
Komichi...

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.320
Is there some other event going on today?

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.180
N-No...

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:29.340
Allow me to congratulate you all on
your acceptance into this school.

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:33.640
As of today, you are all
students of Roubai Academy.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.350
Komichi!

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:38.350
For many years, this school has prepared
many excellent students for...

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.160
Mom!

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:43.920
We're back.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.820
Welcome home!

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.710
Onee-chan, how'd it go?

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:50.300
Sorry, not now.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.320
What's wrong with her?

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:57.140
I'm so sorry I didn't confirm
what the uniform was first!

00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:00.300
Well, the students did wear sailor
uniforms when you attended here.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.640
It's quite understandable.

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:08.400
Besides, we've known since the interview that
Komichi-san dreamed of wearing a sailor uniform.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:12.810
It's our fault for not
informing her at that time.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.870
I understand Yuwa-san made it for you?

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.850
Yes! We picked out the
fabrics together, and...

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:23.860
I see.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.310
My mother made my school uniform, too.

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:29.830
It made me so very happy.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.450
Considering the circumstances,

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:37.900
the school will permit Komichi-san
to wear her sailor uniform.

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.240
Principal?!

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.950
It is an accepted uniform of this school,
albeit one from the past.

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:45.100
We have no reason to forbid it.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:51.020
But I will leave the final decision
to Komichi-san and her family.

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:56.860
It'll only be me. That's just...

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:09.760
Your congratulatory dinner is ready.

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:12.600
You get two egg yolks.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:15.250
Kao, did you hear what happened?

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:16.100
Yep.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.060
Blazers are cute too, aren't they?

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.060
Ow!

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:26.850
Wh-What was that for?!

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:31.210
So now you hate the sailor
uniform Mom made for you?!

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:33.410
I never said that!

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:36.320
You're not cool anymore!

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.930
Stupid sister!

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:46.730
I swear, it's not like that!

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.530
I don't hate it. I love it.

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:56.070
But I don't want everyone
to think I'm weird.

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:59.070
'Cause you're really cool!

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.090
I want to be seen as cool.

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:08.520
And I want to make lots of friends.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:13.590
If I'm the only one in a sailor uniform,
I know I'll stand out.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:16.070
Maybe that'll be my chance?

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:37.780
Onee-chan?

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.610
You're leaving already?

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:52.280
Thanks.

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:55.800
Komichi... Are you sure?

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:59.660
Confidence and a smile, right?

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:02.880
Go get 'em!

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:06.070
Off I go!

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:20.660
Hup!

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:23.650
Whoa... I cut it kinda close.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:39.960
Hmm... I'm not sure...

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:40.670
But...

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.360
I think I've sobered up a little.

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.590
Okay!

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:48.180
Here I go!

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:55.850
Cherry blossoms!

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:17.760
Roubai
\hAcademy

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:23.980
I think... I got... a little too fired up.

00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:30.590
It's so big! It looks like a castle!

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:42.460
Am I the first one here?

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:45.460
New First-Years     Class List

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:45.460
Class 3

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:45.460
Seat Number

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:47.710
I've got seat number 1.

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:49.290
Class 3...

00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:57.990
Here it is.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:02.420
Someone's already here?!

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:05.840
What if she's really scary?!

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:08.350
Wow, what a weird outfit!

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:10.840
I-It's not weird!

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:13.740
We should try to get along!

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:14.490
Osu!

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.530
Why am I trying to fight them?!

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:46.770
Um...

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:49.050
Good morning.

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:52.540
Good... morning...

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:58.330
Please forget you ever saw that!

00:18:58.570 --> 00:18:59.320
Huh?

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.020
I mean... you saw me, didn't you?

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:06.030
When I was smelling my own
feet on the nail clippers.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.400
That's what she was doing?

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.830
Sure. I won't tell anyone.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:13.810
But... do your feet smell that much?

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:15.330
D-Don't question me about it!

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:17.070
I'm embarrassed enough!

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:18.830
I think I'm curious now, too.

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:21.840
Hey!

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:25.850
I ran here, so I think they
might smell a little sweaty.

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.810
I can see how you'd get into it, though!

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.520
You're kind of interesting.

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:35.890
No way! I did it, Kao!

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:38.570
She called your sister "interesting"!

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:42.860
Hey... Would you mind talking
with me a little more?

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:50.690
Oh... So you're going to wear
the sailor uniform from now on?

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:52.210
That's pretty gutsy.

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:57.120
You're Kizaki Erika-san,
and you're from T-Tokyo.

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.480
Th-That's amazing!

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.140
You're taking notes?

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.120
You're very diligent, Akebi-san.

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:08.900
Y-Your nail clippers are really cute.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.650
Do you carry them around all the time?

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:12.640
No, this is the first time.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:16.140
In my room at home,
when I get anxious or nervous,

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:18.650
I end up clipping my nails.

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:23.150
This clicking sound just...

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:25.150
relaxes me somehow.

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:31.290
Were you anxious just now?

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:31.970
Huh?

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.920
Well... with all the firsts
I'm experiencing today,

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:39.650
I couldn't sleep last night.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.740
I came to school early because
I couldn't just sit around any longer,

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.520
but I just kept getting more nervous.

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:53.190
Is it that funny?

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.750
No, it's not that.

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:59.850
I was just surprised someone as pretty
as you would stress like that.

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:01.640
O-Of course I do!

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.690
And my looks have nothing to do with it!

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:05.690
Y-Yeah, you're right.

00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.340
I was kinda scared, though.

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:11.470
I've never really talked to
someone my own age before.

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:16.190
I didn't know what I'd do if I didn't
think the way everyone else does.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:18.280
So I'm happy!

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.700
I felt the same way!

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:25.670
Oh, I guess everyone else
will be coming in soon.

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:28.520
I was just sitting at a random desk.

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:31.430
Number 1...

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:33.390
This one's mine.

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.570
The closest spot to greet
everyone coming in...

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:39.070
I'm number 5.

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.780
I think I've calmed down a little.

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:56.860
I'll be okay now.

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:04.040
Maybe I can do this, too.

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:08.090
Good morning!
