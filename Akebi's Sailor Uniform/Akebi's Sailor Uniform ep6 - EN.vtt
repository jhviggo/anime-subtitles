00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.720
<i>And she can play musical instruments.</i>

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.460
That was so good, Kizaki-san.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.960
I've been playing it my 
whole life. It better be.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:24.750
<i>She's so cool...</i>

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.010
<i>And she's my friend!</i>

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.430
Hey, Akebi-san...

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.000

There's No School Tomorrow, Right?

<i>The rain we've seen between 
the Kinki and Kanto regions</i>

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.770
<i>will start to let up tomorrow morning,</i>

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.920
<i>bringing sunny weather 
to most of the country.</i>

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.100
<i>However, an area of low 
pressure in northern Hokkaido</i>

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.380
Okay! I've made up my mind!

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.900
<i>may bring periods of less 
favorable weather for a time.</i>

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.490
Next weekend, I'm inviting my friend over!

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.040
<i>Now, let's take a look at temperatures.</i>

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.050
How many? How many?

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.050
One! I don't have the guts 
for any more than that yet!

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.050
<i>Temperatures in western Japan will be two 
to three degrees higher than today.</i>

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.710
Erika-chan, right? The one you knew 
was interesting at first glance?

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.820
<i>It might even be warm enough to break a 
little sweat in Kagoshima and Kumamoto.</i>

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.700
Yeah! I gotta go clean my room!

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.700
<i>Eastern Japan should also be quite warm, 
just right for doing the laundry.</i>

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.310
I'll help!

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.130
<i>Finally, the week-long forecast, 
from Nagoya to Naha.</i>

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.130
Wait, dinner's almost ready!

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.390

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.480
<i>Okinawa will see some very rough 
weather through the weekend.</i>

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.810

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.020

Hey, Akebi-san...

You've been looking at me a lot lately.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.150
Huh? N-N-No, I haven't!

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.980
Yes, you have. You just were.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.650
Is there something on your 
mind that's hard to say?

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.440
Well... There's no school tomorrow, 
since it's Saturday, right?

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.480
Uh, right... Wait, why so polite?

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.720
Oh, um... uh... well...

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.420
H-How do you feel about 
houses with leaky roofs?

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.460
Huh?

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.320
Well, obviously, I think 
they should be repaired.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.970
No one wants to get all 
wet when they're inside.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.320
Y-You're so right! Yeah! That's what
 I've been wanting to ask you!

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.150
Huh?

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.070
<i>Akebi-san's acting weird.</i>

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.600
<i>I gotta fix that leak before 
I can invite her over.</i>

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.290
Hey, Akebi-san...

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.600
I'm on my way to the school 
library next, so...

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.240
Want to come?

<i>She's still looking at me.</i>

<i>That clearly wasn't all she wanted to say.</i>

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.390
That looks like an interesting 
book you're reading.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.480
Have you ever gone fishing before?

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.570
Sure.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.270
You have?

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.950
Yeah, at the lake near my house.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.730
The way I do it isn't that cool, though.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.100
I use a nice, bendy stick and sewing thread,

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.870
and leftover squid legs for bait.

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.310
<i>Her gear's all homemade?!</i>

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.350
But all I catch is crayfish.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.010
I've never once caught an actual fish.

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.970
So when I go, sometimes I just 
wade into the water barefoot.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.410
<i>Barefoot?</i>

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.860
I corner them, and Kao takes the net, and...

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.400
That's amazing!

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.800
Huh?

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.550
That's the kind of thing I wanted to try!

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.770
I'm so jealous.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.750
Kizaki-san?

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.130
Um...

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.980
If... you wouldn't mind...

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.110
<i>I get it. I shouldn't just 
invite her to my house.</i>

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.570
Let's go together!

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:41.070
Huh?

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.410
Maybe... tomorrow?

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:44.440
Tomorrow?

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.730
There's no school tomorrow, 
since it's Saturday, right?

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.190
Wait, is the reason you've 
been looking at me so much...

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.340
Quiet, please.

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.620
<i>A promise to meet up over the weekend.</i>

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.680
<i>My first ever!</i>

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.870
I can't wait.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.200
I never knew there was a place like this!

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.100
What a gorgeous place to meet up!

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.630
I got here a whole hour early.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.830
The weather's so nice.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.210
<i>I wonder what Akebi-san will 
do when she sees this.</i>

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.970
Maybe I should try to get 
acclimated to the water.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.670
I don't want to look silly 
in front of Akebi-san.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.190
Mom would flip out if she saw me doing this.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.340
Oh, no... I can't stop myself.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.610
<i>It's my first time wearing 
this skirt Mom made for me!</i>

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:50.820
<i>I'm meeting Kizaki-san, after all!</i>

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.900
<i>I can't just show up in my usual sweats!</i>

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.440
I got here too early.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.570
Huh?

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:14.530
Kizaki-san!

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.060
Are you okay?

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.830
I'm fine... Akebi-san.

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:42.660
You're a good swimmer, huh?

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.990
Oh, I see now!

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:50.160
You wore stuff that you 
can wear into the water!

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.930
Not a swimsuit or anything, but yeah.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.240
Kizaki-san, thank you for coming 
to spend the day with me!

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.340
Same to you.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.420
I asked where the best spot 
to catch fish would be.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.980
It's a bit of a walk, though.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.990
Really? Let's go!

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.610
You look really cool, Kizaki-san.

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:12.110
I just bought this stuff.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:14.790
I never get any chances 
to go fishing, though.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.680
Today's my first time.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.610
So I'm really excited.

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:19.620
Same!

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.740
Well, the rod, too, but I was 
talking about the whole ensemble.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.460
R-Really? Thanks.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:45.600
<i>I hope Kizaki-san will 
catch a big fish today.</i>

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:51.030
We'll catch something here for sure!

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.740
Okay, I guess I'll get ready, too.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:02.070
Wait... Y-You're fishing with that?

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:03.560
No rod or anything?

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.040
Yep. It's rice. You can 
catch little fish with it.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.150
I'll try over here.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.790
Oh! I got one!

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:18.880
You're kidding!

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.330
I wonder what it's called.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.450
Hang on! I'll look it up!

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.270
A-Amur minnow...

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:27.940
Freshwater Fish of Japan

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:27.920
Minnow-chan! What a cool name!

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.760
<i>Akebi-san's amazing, catching 
a fish with a thing like that.</i>

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:35.880
<i>I can do it, too!</i>

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.120
<i>There are </i>fish<i> here.</i>

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.180
<i>That's for sure.</i>

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.660
Oh! Another Minnow-chan!

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:55.090
<i>And yet I...</i>

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.670
It'll be hard to catch any with 
that bait. They can't eat it.

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:06.220
This is the only lure I have, though.

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:08.910
How about the spot where that 
bird caught a fish earlier?

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:11.630
Yeah... but it's kinda far away.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.220
I feel like it's flying a little too high.

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.980
Ease up a little and... let it fly!

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:31.240
Wow! You nailed it!

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.780
I think it's stuck.

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:46.990
I'll swim out and get it.

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:49.380
You don't have to go to all that trouble.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.030
I'll see if I can't circle 
around to get it loose.

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:53.740
Oh... Okay.

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.840
<i>Why am I so impressed 
by something like this?</i>

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.380
<i>I'm so happy, though.</i>

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:23.760
What? Stuck again?

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:29.850
No... I got a bite!

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:33.920
You're kidding!

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:38.980
<i>I want to go back, but water's getting in...</i>

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:43.980
Kizaki-san?

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.530
Akebi-san! I got a bite!

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.020
I need help!

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:49.230
Kizaki-san!

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.270
I'm here!

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.260
Thanks!

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.100
Take over while I get these waders off.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.560
Huh? Okay!

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:13.570
Kizaki-san! What do I do?!

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:17.630
Okay, I'm back!

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:23.670
I didn't know fish were this strong.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:25.720
How do I reel it in?

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.790
Kizaki-san, I'll catch it in this!

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:33.500
<i>Almost there...</i>

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.240
<i>Almost there!</i>

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:58.460
We did it!

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:02.850
Okay, say cheese!

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:08.390
I can't believe it! A real fish!

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:11.670
Wow, so this is what they feel like.

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:11.020
<i>She's really having fun.</i>

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:14.570
<i>The speckles on its back are so pretty.</i>

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:17.830
<b>Video</b>

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:17.820
<i>But I feel sorry for it, keeping it in here.</i>

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:24.750
So long. Thank you.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.420
There it goes.

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:38.100
<b>Video</b>

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.240
<i>We're gonna play in the water now!</i>

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:57.550
Hey, Kizaki-san...

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.630
Did you have fun today?

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:09.810
Yes.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.550
A lot!

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.710
Kizaki-san, do you need fresh clothes?

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:21.310
I brought a set.

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:24.610
Is there a place I can change?
 And a bathroom?

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:27.520
No one'll see you over behind those trees.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.280
Huh?

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.040
Huh?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.700
J-Just kidding.

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:40.850
We're almost to my house!

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:42.190
Okay.

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:45.480
<i>I ended up heading to Akebi-san's house.</i>

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:48.510
<i>And it's just to change clothes 
and use the bathroom.</i>

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:50.020
Oh! Kao!

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:53.750
Kao! This is Kizaki-san!

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:55.090
<i>A tiny Akebi-san?!</i>

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.560
Mom!

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:04.260
Onee-chan brought her friend home!

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:15.910
The building with the red roof that I saw 
on my way to the lake was your house?!

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:18.640
Mom, look!

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.860
Wow, what a big butterbur leaf.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.840
Maybe I'll use it in a stew.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.420
It's not an umbrella?

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.470
Welcome. You must be the 
beautiful Kizaki-san.

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:32.590
You really are.

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:37.110
<i>Jeez, Akebi-san, don't describe me that way.</i>

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:38.620
Nice to meet you.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.370
Sorry to show up without noti—

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:41.900
Mom, it was amazing!

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.400
Kizaki-san caught a huge fish!

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.230
Wow, how pretty.

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:48.200
Is it a male char?

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.840
Right? I couldn't believe it, either!

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:51.280
I wanna see! I wanna see!

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.130
Uh...

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.180
That's very impressive.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:02.780
All right, you two, 
go get showered and clean.

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:06.080
It looks like you went a 
little nuts out there.

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.810
Erika-chan, the bathroom's over there.

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:10.430
Oh... Okay.

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:12.850
Kao, bring her a towel.

00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:15.860
Okay! Wait right here, Erika-chan!

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:20.060
Your mom is really nice.

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:23.350
Akebi-san?!

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:25.150
You can use this.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.110
Take your time.

00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.730
Thank you.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.230
This towel smells so nice.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:37.870
<i>I'm a little nervous about being 
naked in someone else's house.</i>

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:41.040
Uh, Akebi-san, you can go first.

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.900
They're both so unfair,

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:46.010
using your first name the 
minute they first meet you.

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:49.240
Is how they address me 
really that important?

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:53.480
Well... I hadn't given it 
that much thought before...

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:57.980
But when I heard them call 
you by your first name,

00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:59.360
I felt really...

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:05.830
<i>really</i> jealous!

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:08.400
<i>Akebi-san didn't even hesitate.</i>

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:14.070
Your skin is so pale, Kizaki-san.

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:15.650
You're so lucky.

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:17.740
It's not getting in your eyes, is it?

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:18.630
No.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.670
The sponge doesn't hurt, does it?

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:21.480
No.

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:23.890
I'll try not to make your skin all red.

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:25.290
Okay.

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:30.670
Thanks. I'll wash your back next.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:33.570
No, you can get out and put your clothes on.

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:35.810
I'll be out by the time you're done.

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.550
Okay... Thanks.

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:44.050
Kao! Show Kizaki-san to my room!

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:47.000
And have Mom bring up some snacks!

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:52.060
You can toss your towel in the washing 
machine when you're done with it.

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:53.020
Okay.

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:56.550
<i>Akebi-san's so good at looking after others.</i>

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:58.560
<i>Is she always like this at home?</i>

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:03.430
<i>She didn't even dry her own hair.</i>

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:04.860
Thanks.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.290
I'm used to it.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.310
<i>She wasn't kidding.</i>

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:13.410
You're lucky you get your hair dried 
so carefully every time, huh?

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:16.250
Uh-huh, but she doesn't use a brush with me.

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:18.160
She ruffles it up more.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.220
Onee-chan's not acting like usual right now.

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:21.110
Huh?

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:23.760
She's trying really hard.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.760
Kao! You don't have to be <i>that</i> honest!

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:34.260
Hey, Kao-chan, tell me what you like 
about Akebi-san... I mean, your sister.

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.780
<i>Aw, she even has the same 
mannerisms as Akebi-san.</i>

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:42.030
<i>Don't say anything weird! 
Don't say anything weird!</i>

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:45.100
Komichi, I brought drinks. 
Can you open the door?

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:46.960
C-Coming!

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:51.220
Here you go. Snacks and coffee.

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:52.950
Thanks, Mom!

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:54.380
Thank you.

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:59.130
Her butt makes a really good 
noise when you smack it.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:08.020
Kao! That's not the kind of 
thing Kizaki-san wants to hear!

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:10.390
You do it all the time, though.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.910
Why would you do that?

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.840
When Kao was born, she did 
it to make her laugh.

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.100
She's done all kinds of other 
embarrassing things, too.

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:21.140
Want to see?

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.750
Aw, Mom!

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:23.650
Look.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:27.630
And just look at this!

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:29.690
That's cute.

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:36.390
<i>I wanted to look cool for her!</i>

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:45.090
Sorry we couldn't offer 
much hospitality today.

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:48.690
No, the coffee you gave me was great.

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:51.810
And now you're driving me home. 
This is more than enough.

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:54.640
Come visit again sometime!

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:57.870
Sure!

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:06.690
Akebi-san, see you at school.

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:08.400
Yep, see you.

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:28.770
Komichi-san! Komichi-san!

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:32.880
Starting today, I'm gonna 
call you "Komichi-san"!

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:39.490
So... you can call me "Erika"!

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:46.620
Okay!

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:52.620
Komichi, if you're going to bed, 
keep warm, so you don't catch a cold.

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:54.510
I will.
