00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:09.990
Morning.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.620
Good morning, Komichi-san.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.320
Good morning, Erika-chan.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.880
By the way, I texted our pictures from 
the lake on Saturday to my dad.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.140
To your dad?

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.900
He said he wished he could 
have gone fishing with us!

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.460
He was surprised by the gear you had, too.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.390
H-He was? That's kind of embarrassing.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.270
Oh, and he said you have very pretty hands!

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.430
Huh?!

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.240
<i>H-He was even looking at that?</i>

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.830
Well, you always keep your 
nails nice and tidy, right?

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.120
So I told him...

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.210
It's because you're good at the violin!

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.750
It's so cool that you can 
play an instrument!

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.180
I wish I could do that!

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.500
I think it's far more amazing 
that you can dance.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.830
Really?!

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:13.690
Yes.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.850
You're making me blush...

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:24.680
Morning.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.630
Morning.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.410
Morning!

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.820
Okay, club time. Let's go.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.990
Episode Seven 
Please Let Me Hear It

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.340
It's been a long day.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.990
What're you changing into today?

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.030
Hey, nice!

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.010
Yeah, when we're done.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.850
Well, see you later, Hebimori-san.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.480
Uh... Yeah.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.910
See ya.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.880
Yeah, apparently.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.120
<i>Electric guitars sound so cool.</i>

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.410
Oh, come on!

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.240
No, seriously, that was awesome!

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.930
Just do it like that! It was great!

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.730
No way, I can't! It's too hard!

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.190
Oh, sure you can!

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.130
<i>But in the end, I chose 
not to join any clubs.</i>

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.200
<i>What? Ed ranked tenth? That makes no sense.</i>

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.510
<i>The next issue is a special feature 
on Fukumoto Miki's youth?</i>

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.900
<i>Enough about Miki already.</i>

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.340
<i>Oh, man, this Rara model's 
electric guitar is so cool.</i>

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.260
<i>If I had that, I could...</i>

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:10.820
Hebimori-san?

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.680
Hebimori-san.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.520
Hebimori-san!

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.770
Hello!

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.810
Those are pretty hardcore.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.940
A-Akebi-san... Sorry, 
I didn't notice you there.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.290
Hebimori-san, isn't that...

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.010
That's a magazine that people 
who make music read, right?

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.860
Huh?

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.140
I bought a copy once because 
Miki-chan was on the cover!

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.530
But when I got it home and opened it,

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.520
it was all sheet music inside.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.800
<i>I bought it because of the cover, 
so I didn't even notice.</i>

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.960
I had no idea what any of it said.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.820
But does that mean you can 
play an instrument, too?

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.890
Huh? Uh, not really.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.860
J-Just the guitar...

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.290
I guess.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.550
Wow...

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.570
I wanna hear it!

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:06.750
<i>Huh?</i>

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.420
I want to hear you play guitar!

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.250
Sure.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.910
<i>Testing, testing...</i>

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.690
<i>Uh... Paging Akebi Komichi of Class 1-3.</i>

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.420
That's the club president!

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.680
<i>Akebi Komichi, please report to 
your club room immediately.</i>

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.680
Sorry! I gotta get to my club!

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.120
Let me hear you play sometime, okay?

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.140
<i>Repeat: Akebi Komichi, 
Akebi Komichi, please reporâ€”</i>

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.280
<i>Well, now I've done it.</i>

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:37.140
<i>I can't read sheet music at all.</i>

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.650
<b>Mangetsu
 Dormitory</b>

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.040
<i>I brought my dad's old guitar with me 
from home for no particular reason,</i>

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.050
<i>though I haven't played it 
once since I moved here.</i>

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.450
<i>It's not electric, after all.</i>

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.170
Huh?

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.360
Chords?

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.730
Aren't music notes just "do, 
re, mi, fa," and so on?

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.730
Oh, here it is.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.580
First is... do...

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.310
Okay, next...

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:46.160
I did it!

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.300
Welcome back.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:57.750
Yeah.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.570
I always thought that was 
just for decoration.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.400
Well, it was, but...

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.790
Oh, sorry. I'll only play 
it when you're not here.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.120
No, it's fine. It doesn't bother me.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.290
Okay...

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.200
<i>Next, bend your knees, stretch 
your arms out wide,</i>

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.130
<i>and bring your hands 
together above your head.</i>

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.490
Above your head!

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.980
<i>Now slowly bring your left leg forward.</i>

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.420
<i>Hebimori-san said she can play the guitar!</i>

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:51.780
<b>Hebimori-san said she can play the guitar!</b>

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:51.900
<b>Does Hebimori-san play any instruments?</b>

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:52.990
<b>Hebimori-san said she can play the guitar!</b>

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:52.990
<b>Does Hebimori-san play any instruments?</b>

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.240
<i>Why don't you try playing 
an instrument, too?</i>

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.250
<b>Does Hebimori-san play any instruments?</b>

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.250
<b>Hebimori-san said she can play the guitar!</b>

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.250
<b>Why don't you try playing an instrument, too?</b>

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.550
<i>Now extend your legs broadly to each side,</i>

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:02.680
<i>and lean your upper body forward.</i>

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.370
Music, huh?

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:06.340
That could be fun, too!

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.640
Onee-chan! Focus!

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.540
<i>Next, raise yourself up and...</i>

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:13.470
Next.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.550
Next.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:30.020
A, e, i, u, e, o, a, o!

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:34.370
A, e, i, u, e, o, a, o!

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:35.820
Louder!

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.030
A, e, i, u...

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.420
Good job today.

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.370
Good job.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:41.350
Good job.

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:42.760
Good job to you, too.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:45.870
Good job.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:49.630
U, e, o, a, o!

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:52.930
Okay.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.110
That's it for today.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.840
Okay... Thank you very much.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.140
Wipe off all that sweat before you go home.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:05.470
You've been working hard.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.230
T-Togano-san.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.070
You're in the drama club, right?

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.650
Do you always practice out here?

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.500
No, it's usually in the lesson room,

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.980
but I've been trying the courtyard 
and other places lately.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:22.900
Our club president said,

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.170
"The first thing you need to get good at 
is using your voice in front of people."

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.550
That sounded like her.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.800
This is my first time acting in a play,

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.710
so she says I need lots of 
practice in the basics.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:41.390
I've been working on building 
up my... trunk? At home, too.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:45.100
I think it's taking all I've got 
to keep up with my seniors, too.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.910
Really?

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:51.240
But it's fun when you slowly learn to do 
something that you couldn't before, huh?

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:53.620
Yeah.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:10:00.200
By the way, you live in the same 
dorm room as Hebimori-san, right?

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:00.970
That's right.

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:06.380
Then I bet you've heard her 
play her guitar, right?

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.370
G chord... uh...

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.600
First string, third fret...

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:21.190
Fifth string, second fret...

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:24.810
Sixth string, third fret...

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:26.460
Man, this is hard.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.720
Am I doing this right?

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:34.450
Well, whatever. Next is... C.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.780
Second string, first fret...

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.990
Fourth string, second fret...

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.240
Fifth string, third fret...

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.740
And sixth string... mute.

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:47.240
Mute?

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.040
Just how many of these 
chords are there, anyway?

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:07.280

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.950
Welcome back.

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:21.650
Thanks.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:25.820
You said a while ago that you 
liked this game, right?

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:31.590
I saw Akebi-san after club practice today.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:33.440
Y-Yeah?

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:37.740
She said she can't wait 
to hear you play guitar.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:40.500
You're not going to play it today?

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:45.550
You know, apparently, there are a lot 
of different ways to play a guitar.

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:51.050
And a lot of it uses letters of 
the alphabet, like C and E.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:54.170
I'm having enough trouble 
just keeping up in class.

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:56.730
There's no way I can play guitar.

00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:00.330
Then shouldn't you tell Akebi-san 
that sooner rather than later?

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:07.380
I turned some screw-looking thing,
 and the string snapped.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.320
Well, the strings were pretty rusty.

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:11.700
Yeah.

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:15.660
But that just proves what a 
complete newbie at this I am.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:16.750
What're you gonna do?

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:21.440
Well, I want to learn how 
to play, but considering that...

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.180
I guess it's too late to start now.

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.690
I don't think anyone can master 
anything right off the bat.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:31.520
That's why I practice 
every single day, too.

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:41.150
I win again.

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:44.740
You're so good at this, Togano-san.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:51.710
Nice! Over here!

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:51.710
Good one!

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:53.090
Okay, move your feet!

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:53.880
One more!

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:54.720
Oh, nice hit!

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.990
<i>Tatsumori-san is in the track club?</i>

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:09.300
A, e, i, u, e, o, a, o!

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.010
Good, Akebi Komichi!

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:14.160
A, e, i, u, e, o, a, o!

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.160
Your voice should come 
from deep in your belly!

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.570
A, e, i, u, e, o, a, o!

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:16.280
<i>Akebi-san...</i>

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:21.300
Your voice is sounding 
better than yesterday.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:23.980
<i>Look at how much she's sweating.</i>

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.430
Let's keep this up.

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:24.300
Okay!

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:26.660
<i>But she looks kind of...</i>

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:50.940
Good, Togano. Next practice, 
you'll take the court as a forward.

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:51.480
Yes, ma'am!

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:53.720
<i>Togano-san, too.</i>

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:05.010
I did it!

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:19.550
You know, there was a time when 
I couldn't make a basket at all.

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:21.040
Huh?

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:24.590
Because I was trying to make 
long shots right off the bat.

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:27.330
Well, that's obviously too much.

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.720
I still miss all the time,

00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:33.300
but I started practicing shooting 
from closer to the net,

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.680
and gradually moved farther away from it.

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:39.680
So I'm sure there's something like that

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:44.130
for you to try, too.

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.320
Oh...

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:49.830
I know this song.

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:26.970
Are you ready to leave?

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:28.960
Oh... Yeah.

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:36.990
Morning!

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:37.970
Morning.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:40.990
M-Morning.

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:46.890
A-Akebi-san, will you have some 
time after school today?

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.990
Here I am.

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:54.990
I'm so excited, I'm getting nervous.

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:57.490
Shouldn't that be my line?

00:16:57.490 --> 00:16:58.580
Oh, yeah!

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:02.570
Okay... here I go.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.660
Hey, Kizaki-san, there you are.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.290
O-Of course I am!

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:20.690
<i>Erika-chan can play piano, too?</i>

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:21.240
I'm on cleaning duty this week.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.710
Oh, that's right.

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:26.990
So what did you want? 
I need to head to my club.

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:29.480
Aw, always so standoffish.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.500
Ai was a little freaked 
out the other day, too.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:35.350
She said every time she goes to 
your room, you act like it's a bother,

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:39.090
so she asked if it was okay to 
bring you a notice from the dorm.

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:39.860
Huh?

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:45.170
So I told her that you're super 
scary when someone makes you mad.

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:47.510
D-Don't give people weird ideas!

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:49.640
But it's true, isn't it?

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.640
I'm not like that to everyone.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.970
What?! You mean...

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.390
I've never seen Erika-chan act that way.

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:02.680
But her piano playing was beautiful.

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:05.420
Sorry.

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:06.050
Huh?

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:10.170
I'm really not up to it.

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:14.050
I can't follow a performance 
like that by Kizaki Erika.

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:15.520
W-Wait!

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.650
I lied to you, Akebi-san.

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:21.040
The truth is... I can't play the guitar.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:22.730
So, bye.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.380
I want to hear it!

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.990
Please let me hear it.

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:54.000
<i>I can't forget you</i>

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:59.470
<i>As I walk this winding road</i>

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:04.940
<i>With the newly-born sun</i>

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:10.690
<i>And yellow sand that crosses 
over from my dreams</i>

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:15.810
<i>The day we fell over tickling each other</i>

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:21.270
<i>Will never come a second time</i>

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:27.770
<i>I'm sure a livelier future 
than I ever imagined</i>

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:31.760
<i>Is waiting for me</i>

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:37.780
<i>Just the sound of "I love you"</i>

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:43.140
<i>Was enough to make me feel stronger</i>

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:48.760
<i>I embraced that tiny happiness</i>

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:55.650
<i>So tightly that I could have crushed it</i>

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.950
No, that's not right.

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:22.850
I did it!

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:23.330
Did what?

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:25.330
Oh, Togano-san...

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:27.330
A-An F chord.

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:30.730
Oh... And?

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.780
It's really important!

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:39.110
I'm gonna give her a much better 
performance than <i>that</i> next time!

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:41.150
Hmm...

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.100
Let me hear it again.

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:43.890
Huh?

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:45.810
The F chord.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.330
Aw, jeez... Fine, I guess.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.250
Roll, roll.

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:54.590
<i>Today, I got to hear both Kizaki-san and 
Hebimori-san play their instruments.</i>

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:59.140
<i>And it made me feel like I need to 
work hard in the drama club, too.</i>

00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:57.220
Roll, roll.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.780
Onee-chan, it's about to start.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:02.510
Okay!

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:06.020
<i>Next, bend your knees, stretch 
your arms out wide,</i>

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:08.090
<i>and bring your hands 
together above your head.</i>

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:09.730
Above your head!
