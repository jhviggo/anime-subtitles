00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.470
On your mark... Set...

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.660
Have you decided yet, Kizaki-san?

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.480
I sorta have an idea, but...

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.500
We're gonna have to decide soon.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.160
Wow, Togano-san, you've been playing 
basketball since grade school?

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.030
Yeah. What about you?

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.170
It's always been table tennis for me.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.270
I went for the volleyball club.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.500
Did you?

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.470
On your mark...

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.530
Set...

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.260
Next is...

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.420
Akebi-san?

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.680
Akebi-san!

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.450
Yes!

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.690
It's your turn next.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.080
Oh... Right.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.890
Akebi Komichi! I'm ready!

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.540
Huh?

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.530
O-On your mark...

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.050
Set...

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.370
Huh?!

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.720
She's barefoot?!

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.500
Jeez, I can't believe you did that.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.230
Episode Three 
Have You Decided on a Club?

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.930
The teacher chewed me out about 
how I could've hurt myself.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.170
And you had to pick up 
rocks as punishment, huh?

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.770
You had the fastest time out 
of the whole class, though.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.600
I bet it was even faster than a boy's time.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.160
Really?!

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.930
I actually run faster when I'm barefoot!

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.690
Hey, is Akebi Komichi-san in this class?

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.500
Um... well...

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.620
Who are they?

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.700
I think they're older students.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.170
We heard she's the only one wearing 
a sailor uniform to school.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.940
Akebi-chan, Akebi-chan! Hide!

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.980
Huh?

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.190
There she is! The girl 
with the sailor uniform!

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.140
We saw you running out there last period.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.270
Please join the track club!

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.200
The basketball club!

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.890
No, no! The soccer club!

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.900
Um... I...

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.500
Wow, she's all popular now.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.290
I thought they were gonna...

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.490
Uh-huh.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.520
Or... have you already picked a club?

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.570
Huh? No, not yet...

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:28.340
Um—

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.490
Excuse me, ladies.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.920
I'm very sorry, but we need to 
prepare for our next class.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.010
Could you try to recruit new 
members some other time?

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.630
Yeah, you're right.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.520
Sorry for barging in like that.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.090
Anyway, come check out our clubs 
if you feel like it, okay?

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.750
Okay...

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.150
No running in the halls!

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.130
I went to check out the equestrian club,
 and they actually have horses.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.250
<b>Club Application Form</b>

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.250
<b>\h\h\h\hName of Club 
I wish to join the _____ club.</b>

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.620
Wow, were they big?

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.420
They were huge!

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.920
Um...

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.140
Akebi-san?

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.330
You have really nice legs, Tanigawa-san.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.660
Huh?

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.950
Your skin looks so smooth, like porcelain!

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.460
I realized it during PE earlier!

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.960
What are you...

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.020
Do you mind if I lift your skirt?

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:41.830
What?!

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.910
Seriously, what are you even asking?

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.920
Usagihara-san is running a contest 
to see who has the prettiest legs.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.030
Would you like to join in?

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.180
The teacher won't like this.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.980
You'll get your uniforms dirty.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.090
I'll pass.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.070
More importantly, Akebi-san, have you 
decided which club you're joining?

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.850
I'm still deciding, actually. 
They all seem really interesting.

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.090
So thanks for what you did earlier!

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.160
No, I really didn't do anything 
that deserves thanks.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.070
Club applications need to 
be submitted this week.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.480
Don't be late.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.290
I won't!

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.830
Class President Tanigawa is so serious.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.450
She just gives off this air of 
neatness and classic beauty.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:34.610
She looked so cool setting those 
older girls straight earlier.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.620
I feel like she could stand to be 
a little more playful, though.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.790
Its like she's Miss. Rules and 
Regulations in the flesh.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.090
<i>I can hear you.</i>

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.040
Could you take care of this, please?

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.200
<i>I'm not trying to be particularly 
serious or anything.</i>

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.620
Yes, ma'am.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.640
You're always such a big help.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:58.900
<i>I just...</i>

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.790
<i>don't think anything is worth getting 
in trouble with the teachers over.</i>

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.640
Tanigawa-san, you're always so well-prepared.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.650
Okay, who knows the solution to this one?

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.940
Bye!

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.200
See you tomorrow.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.010
Wake up, Kamimoku-san.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.160
Goodbye.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.480
Goodbye, Tanigawa-san.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.670
Kamimoku-san, classes are over!

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.670
Komichi!

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.580
<i>Akebi-san is already so 
popular within the class.</i>

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.950
<i>She's friendly and really cute,</i>

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.310
<i>and...</i>

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:56.580
Well, bye!

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.470
See you tomorrow!

00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:58.450
Bye!

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.980
Tanigawa-san!

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:05.380
<i>She talks to me often.</i>

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:07.530
Heading home now?

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:08.890
Uh, yeah...

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:11.450
I noticed you were... dancing to something.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.460
Yeah! Fukumoto Miki-chan's solo debut song!

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:16.740
It's such a good song!

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.480
<b>Fukumoto Miki</b>

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:29.170
What do you think?

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.810
Y-Yeah...

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.770
<i>She's so close, I'm not 
hearing much of it.</i>

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:48.480
I'm kind of amazed you can dance to this.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.010
Huh? Really?

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:50.590
Yeah.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.430
I've watched the music video over 
and over again to practice!

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.600
Music programs on TV, too!

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:01.420
I always try to guess what she's thinking 
when the look on her face changes.

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:05.260
You have a very inquisitive mind.

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:09.230
Thanks.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:10.270
No problem!

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.620
What about you? Is there 
anything you really like?

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:14.500
Me?

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.580
Yeah! I want to know more about you!

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:20.990
There's nothing that I particularly like.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.720
Well, have you decided on a club yet?

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.090
Not... yet.

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:31.570
I know, right?

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:35.660
There are too many to choose from!
 I can't pick just one!

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.520
It's not because there are 
too many I want to—

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.570
Tanigawa-san, your legs really are pretty!

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:45.660
That again?

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:49.020
Please show me! I really want to see them!

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.200
No.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.990
Why not?

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:53.530
Because it's embarrassing!

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.070
You can take a picture at 
home and send it to me!

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:59.040
How about that?

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.660
That's even more embarrassing! 
And it'd be saved in my history!

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.200
No, huh?

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:08.560
Okay, then I'll just give you 
my contact info for now!

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.600
Oh, I'll give you mine, too.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.200
Yay!

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.170
Let's keep in touch all the time!

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.750
<i>She so easily does things that I've 
always wanted to, but couldn't.</i>

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:21.980
See you tomorrow!

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:31.270
<i>It makes me happy.</i>

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.160
I'm home.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.440
Mom?

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.900
Maybe she's out shopping.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.920
I guess it's just me.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.400
You have really nice legs.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.120
I actually took one.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.630
That's so risque!

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.670
<i>But it's not lewd or anything... right?</i>

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:41.780
<i>I'm just taking a picture of myself!</i>

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:43.630
<i>There's nothing lewd about it!</i>

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.250
<i>And yet... my heart is pounding.</i>

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:50.140
<i>It's like I'm seeing a version 
of myself that I don't know.</i>

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:54.130
<i>It's... kind of fun.</i>

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:56.360
<i>So I might as well...</i>

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:58.650
I'm home.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:00.610
Kei?

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:02.440

And there's the aggressive 
literature club recruiter!

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:08.250
What are you going to do, Tanigawa-san?

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:11.920
I knew from the start that I wanted 
to join the literature club.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.210
Yeah... I'm going to think 
about it a bit longer.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:19.710
<b>Literature Club 
Seeking new members!!

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:21.960
Akebi-san?

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:26.310
What? You've already decided 
which club you're joining?

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:24.780
Here it comes!

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:25.710
Okay!

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:31.690
I envy you. I just keep waffling 
back and forth between them all.

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:34.290
Maybe I'll just join the 
literature club, too.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.460
You shouldn't decide that way!

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.350
If there are that many 
things you want to do,

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:41.840
you need to pick the one that's right.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:42.980
Kojou-san...

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:47.200
Get a good look at all of them.
 I'll go with you.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.220
Thanks!

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:05.250
<b>Pure Heart</b>

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:17.090
I never knew a school could 
have this many clubs.

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:19.480
I couldn't believe it, either.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.550
So much for deciding.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:25.020
That just gave me even more 
things I want to try!

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:32.550
Sorry I wasn't much help.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:33.020
Huh?

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.960
Why do you say that? I had a lot of fun!

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:42.530
I'll go home and try to 
really think it through.

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:44.520
Thank you so much for doing this with me!

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:50.020
Sure.

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:53.870
I hope you find a club 
that's perfect for you.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.820
It's really pouring.

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:17.210
You're soaked, Kojou-san.

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:20.510
I'm sorry. If you hadn't been 
visiting clubs with me...

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:21.760
No, it's okay.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:24.920
I'm more worried about you. 
Aren't you cold in those thin clothes?

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:26.780
I'm totally—

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:30.370
See? Take those off before you catch a cold.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:33.790
Okay.

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.660
This is a little embarrassing.

00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:15.110
It's so warm.

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:16.910
Thanks!

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.130
You look a little more grown-up in that.

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:27.700
Oh, that's...

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:29.690
<b>Beyond the Blue Sky</b>

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:29.690
<b>Imai Tsutomu</b>

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:32.660
It's the novel I'm going to read 
at the club's next reading.

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:34.160
A reading...

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.590
That sounds fun!

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:37.430
Hardly.

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:41.180
It'll be my first time. I can't 
read in front of people.

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:43.410
You'll be fine!

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:46.370
Have you done that before?

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:49.870
Yeah... though it was just 
for my little sister.

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:55.730
I love looking down at Kao's head 
while she's looking at the book.

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:01.910
I'd like to hear it, too.

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.780
The way your sister does.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:08.380
Sure.

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.740
You'll have to tell me what 
the harder kanji are, okay?

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.440
<i>Beyond the Blue Sky</i> by Imai Tsutomu.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.800
"With five minutes before the bell rings,

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:38.260
I hurriedly clear off the top of my desk.

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:40.870
It's been six months since the accident.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.210
As I hobble along on my crutches,

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:47.520
a large spider..."

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:57.010
"A large spider languidly passes me by.

00:18:57.930 --> 00:18:59.410
I look up at the sky.

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:09.720
'How lucky the clouds are.
 They're so free...'

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:15.270
Tomorrow is the final round of 
the prefectural tournament.

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:18.350
I was supposed to be in it.

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:20.700
'Hey!'

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:26.310
A voice that sounds much too deep to be a 
middle schooler calls me from behind..."

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:29.300
"Hey!"

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:44.880
"Slow, relaxed footsteps approach me,
 resounding quietly.

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:48.280
Then, suddenly, someone enters
 my field of vision.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.330
'I know a club that's perfect for you!'"

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:24.600
Huh?

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:30.040
Mom?

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:37.880
Uh... sorry.

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:43.830
It stopped raining.

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:52.280
I am so sorry! I must have been heavy.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.690
Not at all! That actually made me happy!

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:58.980
My sister always says my mom's 
lap is comfier than mine.

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:00.910
I can't stand it!

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:03.970
So how did my lap feel?

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:07.400
Y-Yeah... It felt nice.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.240
And...

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:11.120
So did your reading.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:11.900
Huh?

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:16.950
Akebi-san, why don't we take 
a look at one last club?

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.940
Good morning.

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:24.060
Morning!

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:25.160
Morning.

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:28.390
Akebi-chan, it's not too late!

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:31.090
Join the softball club with me! 
We'll aim for the nationals!

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.100
Roubai allows students 
to join multiple clubs.

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.430
Wanna climb some mountains?

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:37.430
Those both sound like fun,

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:40.310
but I found the club that's right for me.

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:41.670
I-I see...

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.720
Really? What is it?

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:44.420
Good morning.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.180
Oh, good morning, Tanigawa-san!

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.260
Morning!

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:49.310
I decided which club I'm joining.

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:50.240
Oh?

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:52.320
Photography.

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:55.990
That's perfect for you!

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:58.880
Well? What did you decide on, Akebi-chan?

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.200
Tell us! Tell us!

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:08.530
The drama club!
