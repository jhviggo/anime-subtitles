Yeah!

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.890
Oh, yeah! We're getting warmed up now!

Oh, Usagihara-san.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.920
This year's performance is by 
just one first-year member!

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.130
And that first-year is the girl who's 
been the talk of the whole school...

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.770
You wiped off all the sweat?

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:19.550
Yeah.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.460
She always says hi to anyone 
she makes eye contact with.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.990
Once you see that sailor 
uniform, you know it's her.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.000
You're up as soon as the broadcasting 
club girls say your name.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.060
Yeah.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.400
Are you nervous?

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.100
A little.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.850
You'll be fine. If anyone 
can do this, it's you.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.060
I'll be rooting for you, too.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.120
Okay!

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.290

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.880

Thanks for your time.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.900
She was all for the accompaniment idea, huh?

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.340
I was surprised when she told me
 to play right then and there.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.150
So, um... thanks.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.200

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.880
It's fine. Akebi-chan will be thrilled.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.150
The song you're dancing to

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.890
has a piano accompaniment, right?

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.260
Yeah! I love that piano part!

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.120
What if you could dance to a live piano 
accompaniment at the after-party?

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.340
What?

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.800
I can't even imagine something that amazing.

she used for her cheer!</i>

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.600
<i>Akebi-san was constantly running.</i>

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.960
<i>I only ever saw her from behind as she 
sprang off the ground, but now...</i>

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.550
<i>Darn it, I'm such an idiot.</i>

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.500

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.570
