00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.570
Drink with me!

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.630
It all started with the idol 
Fukumoto Miki-chan's commercial.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.110
I fell in love with Miki-chan 
and her outfit at first sight.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.600
S-So cute...

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.560
So cute! So cute! So cute! 
So cute! So cute! So cute!

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.680
So when I found a photo from when 
my mom went to this school,

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.500
I thought it was fate.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.260
If that's where you want to go, that's fine,

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.800
but it'll be tough.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.320
I'll work hard!

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.920
Also... if I make it into Roubai Academy...

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.660
I want you to make a sailor uniform for me!

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.590
I always admired how my mother 
looked when she was working.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.880
I only had eyes for that sailor uniform.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.320
And that sailor uniform is the 
reason I got into this school.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.220
The principal said I could 
wear either uniform, so...

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.270
I chose the sailor uniform!

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.670
Episode Two 
See You Tomorrow

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.280
<i>Oh, man! I talked for too long!</i>

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.790
<i>They're all bored now! I just know it!</i>

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.730
Akebi-san? Are you finished?

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.990
Oh! My best feature is that 
my body is really flexible,

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.510
and there's one thing I do that always 
makes my little sister laugh!

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.280
I'd like to finish by showing it to you!

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.120
Here I go!

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.940
After her big sister tries 
so hard to look awesome...

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.690
I'm a ghost now!

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.190
This always...

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.350
Huh?

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.340
Um... yeah... I'm done now.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.470
Okay, thank you for that.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.960
I understand you a lot 
better now, Akebi-san.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.200
I thought that last bit 
was funny, personally.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.550
Kizaki-san...

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:34.460
Only...

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.210
I think everyone else...

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.570
well... only saw up your skirt.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:45.590
Huh?

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.410
Washio Hitomi. I plan to 
join the volleyball club.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:52.190
That's all.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.440
<i>Seat number 16, Washio Hitomi-san.</i>

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.260
Volleyball club.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.840
She's very tall.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.950

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.820
Yeah!

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.910
Okay, move your desks together the way 
I've drawn on the board to form groups.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.990
Wh-What do you think?

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.810
Yeah, you look great!

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.580
So do you!

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:53.410
Here you go.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:54.500

Thank you.

<i>Akebi-san, if you give everyone that much...</i>

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.250
And... there.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.390
Here you go!

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.050
<i>Yep. See?</i>

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.160
<i>Sitting around our desks like this...</i>

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.460
<i>It feels like we're a family!</i>

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.470
All right, let's eat.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.020
Let's eat.

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.950
<i>That's gotta be rough!</i>

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:16.580
Um, please feel free to use this.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.680
Oh... Thanks.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.050
I left my glasses case in my bag.

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:26.950
This is a huge help.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.980
Glad to hear it!

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.770
<i>Wait...</i>

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.760
<i>Didn't I wipe my sweat 
with that handkerchief earlier?</i>

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:40.790
Akebi-san?

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.630
Um, that handkerchief...

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.570
Oh, I used the part that's dry.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:54.110
<i>It's fun just watching her.</i>

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:58.570
Thanks for the handkerchief, uh...

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.090
Akebi Komichi!

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:03.590
Nice to meet you, Kojou Tomono-san!

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.890
Nice to meet you. You actually 
remembered my name.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:09.730
I'm so happy.

<i>Seat number 6, Kojou Tomono-san.</i>

<i>She's a really nice girl.</i>

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.190
I bet you're pretty popular, 
right, Akebi-chan?

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.880
<i>Seat number 2, Usagihara Touko-san.</i>

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:30.950
I've never been popular in my life!

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:34.910
No way! You're the only one in 
a pure white sailor uniform.

00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:37.190
And you wear it so well, too.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.280
You're like an idol!

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.420
I-Ido...

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:46.360
Y-You can call me that all you want, 
but I won't do anything for you!

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.290
<i>Kao! She said I look like an idol!</i>

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:52.740
Seriously, your face is just my type, too.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.390
Wow, no one's ever said that to me before!

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.230
But the blazer looks nice too, doesn't it?

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.000
I really wanted to wear this.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.470
Yeah! It looks really mature!

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:06.630
I wanna wear one someday, too!

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:10.420
Well, then... want to try it on now?

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.000
Huh?

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.520
There we go.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.070
Okay!

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.000
Lend me yours, too.

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:22.240
Oh, wow! Really?

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:28.840
Huh?!

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.490
Whoa! Wait, wait!

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:32.390
She was just joking!

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:33.030
Huh?

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:38.830
If you take that off, won't you 
be in just your underwear?

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:40.070
Oh, right!

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:42.950
Wow, you're the serious type, huh?

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:46.160
You're just such a smooth talker, 
I walked right into it.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:50.010
<i>Uh, no, you're just super accident-prone.</i>

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:52.950
<i>I need to make sure no creepy 
pests get hold of her.</i>

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.120
Cackle, cackle, cackle...

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.700
What?! You didn't go to 
cram school, Akebi-chan?!

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.110
That's so unusual!

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:03.910
I-Is that weird?

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:08.010
No, it's just that almost everyone 
trying to get into Roubai goes to one.

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:09.950
For instance...

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:11.280
That girl there!

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:15.200
Tanigawa Kei. She always scored 
the highest on mock exams.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.300
You can't go wrong having her as a friend.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.410
And that's Tatsumori Ai.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:22.240
She went to the same cram school as me.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.020
She's short-tempered and gets mad easily.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.410
She called me out for talking during 
study periods so many times.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:30.480
Isn't that your own fault?

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:34.190
Oh, by the way...

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:37.480
<i>Hi, everyone! This is Mika, second-year, 
with the broadcasting club!</i>

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:37.450
You and those two girls you pointed 
out are from Tokyo, right?

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:38.410
Yep.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.560
<i>I'm Miku.</i>

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:41.790
Kizaki-san's also from Tokyo, 
and Kojou-san is from Nagano.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:41.680
<i>To all the new first-years, 
congrats on getting in!</i>

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:42.570
<i>Nice to meet you all.</i>

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:43.990
How do you all come to school?

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:48.330
<i>This program is being broadcast into every 
classroom from the broadcasting club's station!</i>

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:44.660
Oh, Iâ€”

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.920
You either move here or stay in the dorms!

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.540
<i>The goal is to broadcast all over Japan.</i>

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:51.240
I'm staying at my grandma'sâ€”

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.520
Dorm life for me!

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.490
<i>Anyway, it's time for Roubai's hit chart!</i>

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.490
Also, Kizaki-san's my neighbor!

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:56.750
Huh?

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:58.950
Really? That's great.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.040
<i>Today, we've got the perfect 
congratulatory song for you!</i>

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.080
Huh?

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.590
<i>Just for you.</i>

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.830
Dorms, huh? I've always 
wanted to stay in one.

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:03.310
<i>Wait, no! It's not perfect! 
Call me out on that!</i>

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:05.520
<i>Yeah, it's a song about a one-sided crush.</i>

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.860
Can I come visit you sometime?

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.710
<i>Blessings to all high school girls!</i>

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:06.950
As soon as you can!

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:08.420
Wait, what?

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:08.770
<i>Blessings to all!</i>

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:10.690
<i>Now, please listen to...</i>

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:14.100
<i>Fukumoto Miki's "Delusion."</i>

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.640
Hey, Akebi-san, you said you 
liked this singer, right?

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:22.580
Yeah! Miki-chan looks super 
cute singing this song!

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:24.480
Yeah? How so?

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.020
Well...

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.620
Oh, like what she does in this part here!

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:32.430
Oh, the thing with the lip balm?

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:34.160
Yeah! You know about it?!

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:37.450
I don't. What does she do?

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:41.220
Akebi-chan, show her!

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:44.480
I wouldn't get it across 
very well, though.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.720
Nah, you can totally do it!

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.440
I even have lip balm right here!

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.250
Akebi-san...

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.400
If you can't even express what you 
love most about your favorite...

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:00.480
Can you really call yourself a fan?

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:11.650
I-I can do it!

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.530
C-Can you?

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:17.050
<i>But if I'm going to do it, 
I have to do it right,</i>

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.510
<i>or it'd be an insult to Miki-chan.</i>

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.530
I'll wipe this off before I return it.

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:23.420
Sure, sure.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.590
<i>She puts lip balm on two fingers like this,</i>

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.930
<i>brings them up to her lips, and...</i>

00:12:56.530 --> 00:13:00.490
Akebi-chan, do the thing where 
you look upward at us again!

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:01.980
Huh? Okay...

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:03.910
Like this?

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.280
Akebi-chan! One more!

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.070
Okay!

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.080
Akebi-san! You definitely 
got her appeal across!

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.060
Really?

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:18.820
Quit making her do it over and over! 
You're putting her on the spot!

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.690
Uh, uh, I do not speak Japanese.

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:24.070
Liar! I know you do!

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:24.070
<i>What is this feeling?</i>

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:27.340
<i>I feel full... in multiple ways.</i>

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.070
Thanks for lunch!

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:36.130
There.

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:52.470
Akebi-chan!

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:56.490
What do you wanna play?

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.240
Okay, good job!

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:10.620
Komichi-chan, what do you want to play?

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.900
It's okay! I'll play by myself!

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:17.890
Just keep working while you watch me!

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.410
I can skip two bars now!

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:28.680
How about...

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:38.110
All that's left is the closing.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:42.680
So, Tamura-sensei, how was your 
first day as homeroom teacher?

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.520
R-Right!

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.960
I have lots of very unique students.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.900
Honestly, I'm a little anxious.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:49.200
<b>Class Roster</b>

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:49.320
<b>Class Roster</b>

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:49.450
<b>Class Roster</b>

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:49.570
<b>Class Roster</b>

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:54.460
But I think it's going to be a fun class.

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:56.790
<b>Akebi Komichi</b>

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:08.470

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.480
See you tomorrow.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.630
See ya!

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:15.780
Oh... Yeah, see you tomorrow.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.790
She said, "See you tomorrow"!

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:44.140
Whoa, whoa...

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:50.710
I got a little nervous.

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:53.940
I'll have to say it tomorrow!

00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:59.300
Usagihara Touko-san...

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.510

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:59.050
See you tomorrow!

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.450
I'm home.

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:19.140
Welcome back. Your dad's home.

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.780
He says he has to go back 
to work tomorrow morning.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.130
Oh...

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.880
He asked where you were.

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:36.400
He wanted to see you in your sailor uniform.

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:39.230
Should I wait a bit before changing?

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:42.240
Oh, it's fine. His own 
fault for falling asleep.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:45.400
Besides, you probably ran 
and got all sweaty, right?

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.660
Let your uniform dry out a bit first.

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:49.710
Okay...

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:51.460
<b>Komichi
Kao</b>

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.860
Dad? You should sleep in 
the bed, or you'll get sick.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.550
I keep telling him that, 
but he won't listen.

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:35.790
Come on, Kao. You, too.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.310
Onee-chan...

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:43.970
Dad came home.

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:44.650
Uh-huh.

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:50.400
The bath's ready, you two. Go on and get in.

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:52.800
Okay!

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:58.140
Bathy, bathy, bathy, bathy, bathy time.

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:02.020
You're awake.

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:03.750
You got me.

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:06.910
I didn't hear any snoring.

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:10.340
Well, it's been so long, 
I got a little nervous.

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:13.220
So you faked being asleep? Unbelievable.

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.170
Komichi was dying to show 
off her uniform to you.

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:22.310
I just don't know what to say to a girl 
her age that would make her happy.

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:25.980
Komichi's grown up, huh?

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:31.000
Kao, one of the girls in class 
today said I was funny!

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:36.160
One even said I looked like an idol!

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.220
You sound like you're enjoying yourself.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:39.700
Huh? You think so?

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:42.500
I wanna go to that school, too.

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:44.070
That'd be great.

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:47.080
And then I'll wear the same uniform as you!

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.690
Uh... It's really embarrassing, though.

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:52.180
I'd show it off with pride!

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.290
You're such a strong girl!

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.430
Pride, huh?

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:01.950
I bet Kizaki-san couldn't do that.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.360
Who's Kizaki-san?

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:09.350
My classmate. The one who said I was funny.

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:10.390
I wanna meet her!

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.090
You mean you want me to invite her over?

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.060
Yeah! Do it!

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:18.110
Oh, no, I couldn't!

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:19.170
Why not?

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:21.780
You think she'd come?

00:20:22.150 --> 00:20:25.650
Uh-huh. You can tell her Kao said so.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:34.530
Darn it, Kao! You're such 
a good little sister!

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.350
Okay, then... just a little.

00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:41.050
Huh?

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:42.620
Where's Dad?

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:53.420
Dad, welcome home.

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.550
Oh, same to you, Komichi.

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:57.890
Thanks.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.760
So... how was school?

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:02.770
I was kinda nervous...

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:04.560
But it was fun.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:05.570
That so?

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:06.260
Yeah.

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:11.240
Oh, and there's a bunch of 
stuff I want to tell you!

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.630
Komichi...

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:38.880
What time are you leaving 
for school in the morning?

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:41.740
What about you?

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:46.530
Well... I'll have to be out of here by six.

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:50.610
Then I'll get changed before that.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.620
Can't wait to see it.

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:57.020
Yep!

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:05.210
Dad!

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:08.650
See you tomorrow!
