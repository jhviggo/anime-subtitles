Most of the other students will start

I'll give you a quick tour of

A tiger beetle. It's even 
prettier than the picture!

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.520
A peacock butterfly, too?

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.930
I've never seen one before!

A ladybug?

It's a weevil.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.710
Their long necks make them unique.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.290
Huh.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.470
<i>Akebi Komichi...</i>

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.470
<i>Last time, she had a Schlegel's 
green tree frog.</i>

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.260
<i>And today, she's playing with a weevil.</i>

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.360
What?!

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.530
Oh, no!

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.910
No way, no way! I can't 
stand this sort of thing!

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.030
Should I go get a teacher ASAP?

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.710
A Japanese rat snake.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.410
It looked this way!

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.030
It's gonna bite you!

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.090
<i>It's not even scary.</i>

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.420

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:59.550

Ohkuma Minoru-san?

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.790
Uh, yeah...

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.620
<i>She has eyes like a seal's.</i>

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.300
Let's take it somewhere quiet.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.590
Yeah... Let's.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.600
This area should be safe.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.930
Ohkuma-san, is that your own cage?

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.210
You actually bring it to school?

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.720
Yes! Because you never know 
what you'll find, or where!

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.230
Japanese rat snakes are interesting 
because their colors and patterns vary

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.480
depending on the region.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.090
Wow, really?! I never knew that!

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.100
I've seen them swimming like 
pros in the river before!

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.790
That's a priceless sighting!

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.650
And not long ago, 
when I was walking in the woods,

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.420
I bumped into a vine 
wrapped around a branch.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.140
And that vine was...

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.730
Wait, you mean...

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.490
A Japanese rat snake!

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:11.910
Incredible!

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.670
What's that, Ohkuma-san?

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.250
My research notebook.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.570
I write down unique characteristics 
of living things I see,

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.680
and the details of how 
I found them, every day.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.080
Your stories gave me valuable information.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.910
I do that, too!

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.720
I always write down things 
I notice in a notebook.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.560
So you're also interested in the 
observation of living things?

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:39.060

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.590
I write notes about everyone in our class.

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.270
I was just so happy to have classmates, 
since I've never had them before.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.840
I can't always find the right 
timing to talk to them, so...

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.680
That's where observation comes in handy.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.380
Learning more about someone, 
such as what they like and dislike,

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.130
could help you out in future conversations.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:12.880
Then let's do that together!

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.460

Hiraiwa Hotaru-san...

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.440
I haven't really talked 
to her very much yet.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.130
What's she going to get?

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.630
C-Could it be...

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.930
Hmm... I'm surprised she's going for 
the red bean soup on the top shelf.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.380
She's quite a challenger.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.700
Will she be able to purchase 
an item that's up so high?

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.790
This is truly intriguing.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:16.820
Akebi-san?

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.370

Huh?

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:56.590
Observing living things means

00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:00.330
watching them from an objective 
viewpoint and recording what you see.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.760
You're not supposed to interfere 
in what you observe.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.280
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.870

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:34.890
You could call it spying.

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:39.220
You erase your own presence in order 
to secretly observe your subject.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.540
To ensure you don't miss 
even a moment's change...

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:44.410
What did you call me out here for?

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.660

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.760
She's talking to a girl from Class 1.

How do you know that?

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.930
I live in the Mangetsu Dorm.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.310
It looks like they're 
talking about something,

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:19.170
but I can't hear them from here.

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:22.530
It's not just their conversation 
that can tell us what's going on.

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:26.500
Let's carefully observe their body language, 
expressions, and the situation.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.700

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:30.930

You stand out no matter where you are,

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:39.900
so we might as well conceal ourselves 
from our subject completely.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.000
O-Okay...

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.400

I can't see very well from in here.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:00.890
Is she searching for something?

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.760
Huh?

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:20.040

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:23.730
I-It's just, uh...

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.910
I missed breakfast today 
because I overslept,

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:29.070
so my mom wrapped this up for me...

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:33.290
Um... Ohkuma-san?

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.600
I-I'm so sorry!

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.300
<b>• Akebi Komichi is the <u>active type</u>!!</b>

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.300
<b>Plays with her little sister often? 

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.300
<b>Akebi Komichi is <u>conspicuous</u>!!</b>

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.300
<b>Dirt on her shoes.
Gets sidetracked easily?</b>

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.300
<b>Akebi Komichi is extremely <u>ticklish</u>!!</b>

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.300
<b>Shijou-san's chest is soft
 and warm like the bunnies
 in the pen</b>

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.300
<b>Shijou-san 
Prefers bread with breakfast!!</b>

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.300
<b>That sandwich looked
 really good... 

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.550
This isn't going very well, is it?

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:53.930
But I've still been able to gather 
some very interesting data,

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:55.320
so it all worked out.

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:03.600
Wow, you're really good 
at drawing, Ohkuma-san!

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:08.010
S-Since I keep a research 
notebook every day,

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:10.320
I naturally picked up the ability.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.070
That's so impressive!

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:13.990
What about you?

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:16.330
Are you finished drawing it?

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.060
I get it.

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:22.660
Drawing it in a simplified manner

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:26.560
can actually enhance the subject's 
unique characteristics.

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:28.710
Another good call.

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:41.110
That feels nice.

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:43.820
Yes, it's a very nice breeze.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.610
Since we're always stuck at 
our desks during class time,

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:50.370
we're lucky to have a chance to 
observe in this kind of setting.

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.120
Really?

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:56.630
You get a better look at people's hobbies, 
preferences, and natural behaviors.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.600
For example... let me see...

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.000
Look there.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.360
Togano Mai-san.

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:12.200
The fact that she can draw so many 
different species of birds so distinctly

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.560
tells me that she's very fond of birds.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.640
Wow, you're right.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.860
I hope I can have a good 
chat with her sometime.

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:22.990
Minakami Riri-san.

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:25.290
Is she done drawing, too?

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:28.620
I think it's more likely that she's 
looking for something to draw.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.110
The way she patiently searches for prey

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:33.760
reminds me of a black leopard, 
a master of hunting.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:37.380
You're right!

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:42.120
Or... maybe she just doesn't like 
big crowds of people, like me.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:17.610
You've spent a lot of time watching 
everyone, huh, Ohkuma-san?

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:18.620
Huh?

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.360
I-I wouldn't say "everyone"...

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.870
The living thing that currently 
interests me the most is...

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:25.870
Is?

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:29.570
Um...

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.350
Akebi-san, there you are.

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:39.910
Hey, Ohkuma-san, you're really
 good at drawing!

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:41.240
She really is!

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.860
Yeah, you captured its unique 
characteristics really well.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.510
Wow, Ohkuma-san, you're red as an apple.

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:52.030
An apple!

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:52.360
You're right!

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.730
How cute!

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:02.960
<b>Class 1-3</b>

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:02.960
<b>Roubai Academy 5</b>

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:07.730
Akebi-san, didn't something feel 
strange to you a moment ago?

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:08.870
Strange how?

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.710
Like someone was watching us...

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.380
I see.

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:20.160
So yeah, that happened. 
I laughed my butt off.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.610
Really?

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:29.250
<i>I knew it. The one watching was 
my roommate, Tougeguchi-san.</i>

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:37.990
<i>I had no idea there was 
someone else like me.</i>

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:39.990
See you tomorrow.

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:41.540
See you tomorrow.

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:46.490
<i>But why would...</i>

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:50.630
<b>Akebi Komichi</b>

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:50.760

<b>Akebi Komichi</b>

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.670
Today was another bust.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:01.960
I just never get the chance.

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:06.440
I mean, an elite all-girls 
school in the country

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.210
should be full o' girls 
who ain't that popular.

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:14.410
But they're all so pretty, and they're 
always with their brilliant buddies...

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.880
I thought I was the only one on her side!

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.900
Akebi Komichi, you...

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:26.370
traitor!

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.670
Man, nothin' makes me feel 
better than a good scream!

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:41.650
Akebi...san?

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:43.940
And... Ohkuma-san?

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.730
Wait, th-this ain't what it looks like!

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:50.290
I wasn't sayin' anything about you, 
Akebi-san... um... I mean, uh...

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:52.350
This...

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.120
Why's a pretty girl like her hafta 
take the test for this school?

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.540
It's gonna kill my middle school debut.

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:26.140
Ow...

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.870
What am I gonna do if this doesn't 
get better before the exam?

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:36.400
<i>I forgot my handkerchief...</i>

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.070
<i>I'm hopeless.</i>

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:45.570
Here.

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:47.340
Use this.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.500
Th-Thanks...

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.820
Why are you using a restroom 
so far from everything?

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:00.340
Huh? Er... What about you?

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:04.100
I just feel kinda uneasy in crowded places.

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:06.860
There is a god...

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.040
A kind one...

<i>The exam will begin shortly.</i>

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:17.820

<i>Please report to your designated classroom.</i>

What d'ya want me to do with this?!

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:25.210
Keep it until the next time I see you!

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:33.090
Next time? What does she mean by that?

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:35.950
This is just the entrance exam venue.

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:37.770
There's no guarantee we'll...

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.080
Was she tellin' me I have to pass?!

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:45.930
This is the handkerchief 
I lent to you before the exam!

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:49.400
I-I'm sorry!

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.940
I wanted to return it all this time...

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:56.430
I'm so happy!

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.620
So that girl was you, Tougeguchi-san!

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:02.090
All this time, I wondered who it was!

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:04.790
I'm so happy we got into 
this school together!

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:05.970
Thanks!

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:12.840
I just didn't recognize you in the uniform.
 It makes you look so different.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.220
<i>I never thought the girl in the silly PJs</i>

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:21.490
<i>would show up in a sailor uniform 
on the first day, either.</i>

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:30.680
<i>Still...</i>

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:36.550
<i>It's because I met Akebi-san and realized 
someone else was as nervous as me</i>

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:38.470
<i>that I was able to stick with the exam.</i>

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:42.820
What do we do now, Ohkuma-san? 
The subject caught us again!

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.900
At this point, you might 
as well call it a talent.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.540
Well, I'm gonna go now.

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:53.360
Okay.

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.600
Akebi Komichi...san!

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:01.940
I-I'm...

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.450
I'm glad to know ya!

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:10.970
Same to you!

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:28.480
I guess Tougeguchi-san was looking for the 
right moment to talk to you all along, too.

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:32.250
She should have said something to me sooner!

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:42.210
There were some blunders and 
accidents along the way,

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:46.040
but I guess we can say our observation 
mission was an overall success.

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.120
Yeah!

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:51.130
I was really happy to learn some 
new things about our classmates!

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:53.000
Thanks!

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:57.760
I never thought I'd have a chance 
to talk to you this way,

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.540
so observing with you has been 
a great experience for me.

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:03.520
So I...

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:06.270
want to thank you, too.

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:09.410
You know...

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:14.950
I always wanted a chance to 
talk to you, too, Ohkuma-san.

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:16.280
Huh?

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:22.330
I wondered why you were always 
secretly watching me.

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:25.930
What?! Y-You knew about that?

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:31.140
But I got to learn lots of things 
I didn't know about you today.

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:34.440
You know a lot about living things, 
and you're good at drawing.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:39.670
There's still a lot I don't know,

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:42.200
so I hope you'll teach me 
lots more from now on.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:57.240
Would you like to observe 
insects together next time?

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:02.130
Yes! Yes!

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:07.210
Yay! Thank you!

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.900
Akebi-san, not so tight...
