00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.160
Buying supplies for the 
athletic festival, huh?

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.980
That takes me back.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.230
Will I be able to lead everyone well enough?

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.250
Yeah, it is a pretty big mall.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.990
I'm excited, though.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.590
Will you have time to catch the bus?

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:25.240
Plenty.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.840
Did you check the weekend schedule?

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.580
I'll check it again!

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.950
Whoa, whoa. Hold still.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.360
R-Right...

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.770
I'll go get the schedule!

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.260
It's on the shelf in the living room.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.950
There, all done.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.560
Thanks!

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.900

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.500
Morning, Kojou-san. We're here.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.380
Sorry.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.450
That always happens when 
I get too absorbed in a book.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.340
That's some amazing concentration.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.010
Thank goodness you were on the same bus.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.570
I miss my stop all the time.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.100
Hey!

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.320
Over here!

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.200
Hey!

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.810
Morning, Erika-chan, Usagihara-san!

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:15.780
Morning.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.840
Morning.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.770
Wow, you guys look pretty 
different in regular clothes.

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:20.870
True.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.390
Yeah...

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.480
It's kinda embarrassing.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.300
Nah, you look cute. That getup suits you.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.020
You look cute, too!

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.160
The braid looks really stylish!

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.570
I put a little effort into it.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.490
Your nails are cute, too!

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.670
Aren't they?

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.910
They're only for today, though.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.060
And look at you, Komichi-san.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.770
Huh?

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:48.750
Your hair.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.600
You can tell?

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.370
Yeah. It's a little shorter now.

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.550
Well, ready to go get those supplies?

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.910
The things we need for the 
athletic festival are...

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.060
Vinyl tape for the cheer squad,

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.910
cloth to make the class flags,

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.610
and a few other little things.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.810
There's a directory over there.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.060
Leave it to me!

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.070
I'll be your guide to this mall today!

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.260
Wow... It's almost like 
we're at an amusement park.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.400
I've never shopped at a place like 
this before, so I'm kinda excited.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.260
It has a movie theater, too.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.260
Really?

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.480
I've actually never been to 
this particular mall, either.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.520
Which stores do you usually 
go to, Akebi-san?

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.540
I go to...

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.530
Veggie Fest

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.090
The grocery store!

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:48.800
This place is huge.

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.740
Seasonal

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.740
Fruits

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.740
<b>Oranges</b>

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.740
<b>Dekopon</b>

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.740
<b>Champon Ken</b>

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.480
The food court!

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.240
They all look so good!

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.950
<b>Play Room</b>

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.960
The play room!

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.950
These mats are super soft. It's really fun!

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:00.960
There we go!

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.860
Whoa, whoa! Akebi-chan!

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.220
I kind of dressed up for this.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.760
Oh, right! I guess you 
can't play in that, huh?

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:09.720
I got too excited...

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.280
I can totally relate, though.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.050
I have a little brother,

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.040
so I used to play with him in 
these things all the time.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:19.930
Exactly!

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:26.970
Kao and I used to play here while we 
waited for Mom to finish shopping.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.750
Then Mom would buy us ice cream 
or taiyaki or something,

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.080
and we'd all eat together.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.240
I guess you have a lot 
of memories here, huh?

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.850
Yeah!

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:40.150
When my dad had the day off work,

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.160
we'd go play in the river 
after the shopping was done!

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.100
Sounds fun.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.870
Ooh!

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.990
I didn't know this store 
was at this mall, too!

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.470
I've never been in there...

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.870
They have all kinds of cute accessories.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.400
Let's take a look!

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.970
<i>Usagihara-san knows more about it than I do!</i>

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:00.630
Hey, Akebi-chan!

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.740
This is the brand that 
Fukumoto Miki modeled for!

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.110
Miki-chan?!

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.630
Wow! They actually sell these here?

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:13.000
And it's not that expensive. 
I bet it'd look good on you.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:16.460
Yep, it totally does!

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.760
<i>Usagihara-san's amazing!</i>

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.630
Oh, this is cute.

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:24.880
Hm, nice.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.460
Oh, they have that brand here, too!

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.730
Wow, they even have this store here!

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:56.990
Wow...

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.430
Wow, and this store, too!

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.820
<i>Shouldn't we be buying supplies?</i>

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.000
Dragonfly Books

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.670
Oh, I go to that bookstore sometimes, too.

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.420
Oh, really?

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:17.770
I'd like to check it out, too.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:34.750
That book...

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.130
What a coincidence!

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:42.330
I just finished reading that on my way here.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.540
I've been curious about this 
author's work for a while.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.280
Want to borrow my copy?

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:49.720
Really?

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.610
Sure!

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.640
I'd like to hear your thoughts about 
it when you finish reading it.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.420
Okay.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.050
Do you do any writing, Kojou-san?

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.030
The literature club kinda 
gives me that impression.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.790
That's true.

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:08.880
There were kids in grade school who liked 
reading books and wrote some of their own.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.060
Right?

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:15.270
Actually... I thought I'd 
like to try writing one.

<b>ISOGAWA TATSUHIKO</b>

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:21.030
I really like this author's 
literary style and word choices.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:25.510
It makes me wish I could 
express myself that way, too.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:28.920
But when I actually try to write something,

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.190
I can't decide on a theme to write about.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.130
A theme, huh?

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:35.790
That does sound pretty hard.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:38.560
What kinds of things do you like to read?

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:43.860
Well, I guess... essays, fantasy, mysteries...

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:47.080
The books I read are all different genres.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.800
What do you like, then?

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.690
Well, I like reading, so...

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.950
Uh, s-sorry!

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:57.810
This isn't something you should 
have to think about for me.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.200
Reading books and writing them 
are completely different.

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:05.590
Maybe reading is the one 
I'm specialized for.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:14.910
Pretty...

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:17.410
Ah, crepuscular rays.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.850
If I recall, the phenomenon is also 
known as a "pipe organ of light."

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:27.780
That's such a beautiful way to describe it.

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:30.440
It's from a line in a 
poem by Miyazawa Kenji.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.680
Oh...

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.350
I didn't know there were so 
many different types of books.

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.570
<b>Literary Masters of the World One</b>

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.570
<b>Literary Masters of the World Two</b>

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.570
<b>Literary Masters of the World Three</b>

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.570
<b>Literary Masters of the World Four</b>

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.570
<b>Literary Masters of the World Five</b>

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.570
<b>Literary Masters of the World Six</b>

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.570
<b>Literary Masters of the World Seven</b>

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.570
<b>Literary Masters of the World Eight</b>

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:40.570
Some are all nicely boxed...

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.530
And some are small enough to 
fit in the palm of my hand.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.300
You're right.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.300
One of the funnest things about 
books is the variety of bindings.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:51.550
These are so cute!

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:52.990
Aw, they really are!

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.180
By the way, is that bookmark 
you were using handmade?

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:00.150
Huh? Uh, yeah.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:02.450
The pressed flowers were really pretty!

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.610
Thanks.

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:07.670
My mom made it for me.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:08.890
Wow!

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:11.450
I've been using it ever since I was little.

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:14.540
To me, it's basically 
like a good-luck charm.

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:20.410
Whew, I'm beat.

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:23.950
That sure hits the spot.

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:25.950
We did end up taking a lot of detours.

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:31.000
Yeah, I just haven't been in a mall 
in so long, and it was so fun...

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.740
Let's eat.

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:37.550
This is... a hamburger?

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.520
This is the first time you've 
had one, Erika-chan?

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.440
Yeah. I've always wanted to try one.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:49.670
You hold it with the wrapper 
around it to eat it.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.340
Oh, almost forgot.

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:58.710
Ta-dah!

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:02.490
What are those?

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:04.180
Thread for friendship bracelets.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:05.730
Friendship bracelets?

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:09.240
They're basically good-luck charms woven 
from thread and worn as bracelets.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.450
Good-luck charms?

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:13.960
Yeah. You wear them when you have 
a wish you want to come true.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:18.850
They say when it wears out and falls off 
on its own, the wish will come true.

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:21.890
Kizaki-san and I were talking 
about having everyone in class

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:26.730
do their part in the athletic festival 
wearing matching bracelets.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.520
It's pretty good.

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:48.470
Erika-chan, you're so cute!

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.840
Jeez, don't pick on me.

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:55.500
Well, anyway, that's the idea.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:59.260
Why don't we all make the bracelets 
together at the Mangetsu Dorm later?

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:00.300
I'm in!

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:03.250
I've never been to the dorms before.

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:07.560
Okay! Now that that's decided, 
let's see when the bus is coming.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.410
Oh, Kizaki-san...

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:12.300
Let me give you that book before I forget.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:13.760
Thanks.

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.770
<b>The End</b>

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:16.180
Huh?

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.420
Kojou-san?

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:25.520
What's wrong?

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:27.620
It's gone...

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.600
My bookmark is gone!

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.960
Any luck?

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.740
I didn't see it anywhere.

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:25.390
No, huh?

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:26.380
Yes.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.050
Okay.

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:30.320
I see...

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.190
Well, thank you.

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:33.690
What'd they say?

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:37.460
No one has brought in any lost items.

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:41.100
And the bus is back at the depot, 
but they didn't find it there.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:44.910
So it has to be somewhere in the mall.

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:47.540
I'll go look around one more time.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.390
Oh, don't worry about it.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.630
I've been using that thing forever.

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:55.550
Maybe it's just time for a new one.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.370
Sorry for dragging you all into this.

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:01.740
Anyway, the bus to the dorm 
should be here soon, right?

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:04.740
Uh... Yeah, it should, but...

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.600
We should get going, then.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:18.330
The bookmark!

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.240
We found it!

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:27.170
That's where we were talking this morning.

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:34.640
Someone tied it to a balloon 
to make it easier to see.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.070
Whew, what a relief!

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:41.830
Sorry about this. I must've dropped 
it when I pulled out my notebook.

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:02.980
The gold medal winner of the 
34th Elementary School Essay Contest

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.820
is Miss Kojou Tomono.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:26.400
Mom! I want to write books when I grow up!

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.770
Th-The tree just barely saved it!

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:38.980
Yeah, but...

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:57.420
Kojou-san, climb on!

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:58.130
Huh?

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.550
Climb on... your back?

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:02.670
On my shoulders!

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:07.140
What?! N-No way! I'm way too heavy!

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:08.170
Oh, I know!

00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:17.130
Y-You're sure this is okay?

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:18.070
Yep!

00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:19.440
No problem!

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:21.140
O-Okay...

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.640
Sorry I'm so heavy.

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.010
Let's do it!

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:27.930
Right!

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:27.930
Okay!

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.580
Ready... up!

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.670
A-A little more forward!

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:44.860
Okay!

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.670
That's good!

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:56.590
Kojou-san! Almost there!

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.930
I can't. We're still not high enough.

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:05.410
But we're so close...

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.830
A little higher...

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:13.430
Kojou-san, let's try it one more time!

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:14.360
Huh?

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.300
Akebi-san, I don't know about this...

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:23.200
Don't worry! I promise we'll catch you!

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.700
O-Okay...

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.690
Usagihara-san!

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:31.720
Ready!

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.850
Erika-chan!

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:33.720
Yeah!

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:35.470
Here we go!

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:37.780
Ready... Up!

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:49.670
I got it!

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:05.990
Thank you!

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.950
Man, that was a close call, huh?

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:13.130
You surprised me when you suggested 
doing it like a mock cavalry battle.

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:17.750
Well, I'd say Akebi-chan's idea 
was a lot more surprising!

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:18.530
It really is a beautiful bookmark.

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:20.560
You're right. Who else 
would've come up with that?

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:21.800
You're amazing, Komichi-san!

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:27.310
You know, when I saw you 
looking up at that balloon,

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:30.720
it felt like your feelings were 
flying away along with it.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.000
I'm so glad we got it back!

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:37.290
Yeah... Thank you!

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.500
Yikes!

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:49.650
Oh, man... I didn't bring my umbrella.

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:50.680
Me, neither.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.300
I do have mine, but...

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:58.020
The bus stop is a bit of a 
walk from here, isn't it?

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:02.310
Hmm... Maybe we should 
wait for the next one.

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:04.020
I guess so.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.790
Wait, where's Akebi-san?

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.440
Look, guys! Even in the rain,
 it's still floating!

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:24.830
That girl's got so much energy!

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:32.210
Watching Akebi-san kind of makes me 
want to write a character like her.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.070
I think she's just incredible.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.460
All right!

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.620
Wait for me!

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:44.710
Huh?!

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:50.730
Yeah!

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:54.220
Let's race to the bus stop!

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:03.400
This feels great!

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.180
Looks like... the rain stopped.

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:44.990
I guess it was just a passing shower.

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:52.840
Oh! Look at the sky!

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:01.070
The pipe organ!
