WEBVTT

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.980
Morning.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.370
Hey, Akebi-chan's here!

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.330
Morning, Komichi-san.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.790
Morning, Erika-chan, Usagihara-san.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.900
A summer uniform! The red ribbon's so cute!

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:32.940
Thanks!

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.880
You both look really cute, too!

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.270
You think so?

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.220
Hey, let's take a picture together!

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.810
Morning.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.580
Okay.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.150
Oh, yeah, good idea!

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.220
Morning, Riri-san!

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.440
Morning!

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.700
Wow, your ribbon's red.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.910
You'll get even more attention now.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.120
Y-You think so?

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.330
An' that's fine. Soak up that attention.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.700
Yeah, we finally got to switch 
to our summer uniforms,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.360
but we'll be in our gym 
clothes all day today.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.990
Yeah, not much class time before 
the athletic festival starts.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.040
I'm lovin' that, though!

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.390
Ditto!

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.340
Right?

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.980
Let's all practice hard!

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.310
Start by doing this...

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.380
And wrap it around the 
chair legs several times.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.360
Episode Ten 
Fight On! Fight On!

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.750
L-Like this?

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.390
Yeah, that's it.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.680
When you're done wrapping,

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.650
tie up the center with 
a short length of tape.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.670
Then take it off and cut it with scissors.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.550
Finally, pull the bundled-up tape 
pieces loose with your hands.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.070
I did it!

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.610
They're so cute!

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.420
That was easier than I thought.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.400
So soft and fluffy.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.550
That's amazing, Nawashiro-san!

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.490
I was wondering what we were 
gonna use the vinyl tape for!

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.780
I figured cheering is better with pompoms,

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.730
so I looked up how to make them.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.230
I see!

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.830
Okay! Let's cheer everybody on!

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.070
Yeah!

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.500
You're in the tennis 
club, right, Shijou-san?

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.630
Yeah. Have you ever played?

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.050
Our summer house has a 
court, so yeah, a little.

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.130
S-Summer house?!

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.910
I was only playing around for fun, though.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.120
I'll do my best not to trip you up.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.160
Oh, you won't.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.850
It's not like I'm that good at it, either.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.150
Your tennis wear looks really nice.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.240
Huh?

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.950
Oh... Thanks.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.390
What's wrong?

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.300
N-Nothing!

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.570
S-Sorry.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:11.650
Don't worry about it.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.280
Let's take it easy at first 
an' try to get a rally goin'.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.530
We can take our time 
gettin' used to the ball.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.920
Okay.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.950
That said...

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.230
One point!

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.250
We ain't got near enough people.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.560
If no students show up to practice,

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.800
that gives us a much higher 
chance of winning on game day.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.630
Let's beat 'em to a pulp!

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:41.420
Yep.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.420
I'll show 'em what a table 
tennis club member's got!

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:48.140
Is this is?

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.730
Over there, I think.

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.240
Tougeguchi-san?

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.460
Akebi-san!

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.670
Wh-What're y'all doin' here?

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.110
Okay, here we go!

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.940
Ready, and...

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.420
Fight on! Fight on! Table tennis!

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.600
Fight on! Fight on! Practice!

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.620
Fight on! Fight on! Table tennis!

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.750
Fight on! Fight on! Practice!

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.660
T-Tone it down!

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.370
What in the world was that?

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:24.690
What was it?

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:27.610
A cheer!

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.520
A cheer?!

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.330
Yep!

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.910
I guess we weren't very together, though.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.230
How do you cheer, anyway?

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:39.500
Huh?

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.990
Good question.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:46.680
When I think of cheering, I think of 
the cheerleaders in foreign TV shows.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.170
They hop and jump and do lifts...

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:51.500
Lifts?!

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:57.070
Fight on! Fight on! Fight on! Fight on!

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.920
That sounds good.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.620
It means lifting another 
cheerleader over your head.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.230
I've done that before!

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.810
Okay!

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.100
Whoa! Stop, stop!

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.730
Huh?

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.460
Yer freakin' people out, usin' a 
big move like that outta nowhere!

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.070
Start with some simple choreography!

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.820
What kind of choreography?

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.490
You ain't never seen the stand dances 
they do at Koshien and stuff like that?

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.590
For example...

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.940
Stuff like this, and this...

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.690
and this!

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.040
Wow! That was so cool!

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.470
It takes nothin' to get 
you all excited, huh?

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:48.560
Sheesh... Why'd ya volunteer to do this 
if ya don't even know the basics?

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.620
I thought it'd give me a chance 
to watch everyone practice.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:52.780
I see.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.440
Why don't we all try that, then?

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:58.260
Here we go!

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:00.490
Ready, and...

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:04.770
Fight on! Fight on! Ayumi!

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:09.320
Fight on! Fight on! Minoru!

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:11.250
Wow!

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.480
I think I can actually 
feel a surge of power!

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.230
Well, it's better than it was before.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.300
Thanks, Tougeguchi-san!

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.900
Want me to help with your table 
tennis practice in return?

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.010
N-No, thank you!

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:26.100
C'mon, no need to be modest!

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.770
Look, I'm sayin'...

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:28.860
Seems awfully lively over there.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:29.800
Yeah.

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:35.060
Hebimori-san! Hotaru-chan!

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.200
Hey!

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.040
Hi.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:53.110
Fight on! Fight on! Oshizu!

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:56.800
Fight on! Fight on! Hotaru!

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.690
Fight on! Fight on! Oshizu!

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.270
Whoa, hang on...

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:04.500
Fight on! Fight on! Hotaru!

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:08.520
Fight on! Fight on! Oshi...zu...

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:14.710
Fight on! Fight on! Hotaru!

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.810
Hotaru-chan! Thanks!

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:30.930
I guess they made a connection.

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:34.610
We got some great advice.

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:38.040
Yeah! Cheering isn't just about the calls.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.110
There's a dancing element to it, too!

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:43.040
Maybe we'll be able to do 
a few different things!

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.530
Like what?

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:47.640
Well, like maybe...

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:52.160
I need to go practice with 
the basketball team now.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.250
Oh...

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.110
And I need to head to the dojo later.

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:57.200
Really?

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.480
Well, then...

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:16.720
So nice and cool...

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:21.580
Good practice, everyone.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:24.460
I'm gonna go watch Hitomi-chan's practice.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:25.740
See you later.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.680
See you.

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:33.000
So much energy...

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:37.810
That was a pretty tough practice, huh?

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.700
I can't move. I want a bath.

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:46.280
Okay!

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:54.940
Akebi-san?

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:29.680
Shijou-san, looks like 
a court just opened up.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:31.960
Let's start practice.

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:34.180
S-Sure...

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:49.100
<i>Until I started studying for 
entrance exams two years ago,</i>

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.040
<i>I had played hardball tennis 
all through school.</i>

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:56.180
<i>Of course, I'm sure everyone expects me 
to do great in the athletic festival.</i>

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.940
<i>Do skills really degrade this 
much in just two years?!</i>

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:13.890
<i>I spend all my club time picking up balls and 
doing practice swings, so I didn't even notice.</i>

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:23.380
Sorry I keep missing.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.700
Nah, don't worry about it.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.290
Here, have some of this.

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:43.210
It's my favorite black tea.

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:45.170
It should help you relax.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.770
Th-Thanks...

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:57.330
That's good.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:03.130
Here it comes!

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:06.270
Oh... So you didn't play for two years?

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.070
I wouldn't say you lost your skills.

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:11.070
You just grew up.

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:13.250
As in your height and such.

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:17.330
You're right! I got a <i>lot</i> taller!

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.120
And it wasn't just my height!

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.840
A lot of things... grew!

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:29.890
My mom said I was developing 
better than most girls, too.

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:32.350
That's not something to feel bad about.

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:35.340
That's what my mom says, too, but...

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:40.980
Fight on!

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.460
How was that?

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.400
Sounded good.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:51.710
<i>Akebi-san is so slender.</i>

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.300
But I think this part is still...

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:53.940
Shijou-san!

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:57.830
It's amazing that you can 
serve from that high up!

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:00.840
I'll send lots of cheers your way!

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:03.210
Must be nice.

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:09.860
Eep!

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.650
S-Sorry!

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:16.940
Shijou-san, you just said, "Must be nice."

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:17.920
Huh?!

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.220
You wanted to be on the 
cheer squad that badly?!

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:20.900
Huh?!

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:25.300
Why don't you help out the squad to fill in 
for the girls who went to other practices?

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.530
Kizaki-san?!

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:29.910
You're doing great too, Erika-chan!

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:29.910
Huh?!

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:36.550
Remember when I raised my 
hand for the cheer squad?

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.160
<i>Wh-What do I do?</i>

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:38.910
After that, my club president 
said I should do it

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:40.990
'cause it would help my 
club performance, too!

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:42.420
<i>I don't know how it even came to this...</i>

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:44.110
And then Kojou-san seemed so amazing to me,

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:46.150
since she's the one who 
steered me toward that club!

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.430
<i>That wasn't even what I meant!</i>

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:48.140
Isn't cheering great?

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:00.660
Here. Your pompoms.

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:06.290
We made these ourselves. Aren't they cute?

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:08.070
Y-Yeah...

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:09.810
Okay, let's do this!

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:11.770
I-I can't just jump right in like that!

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:13.960
We'll just do a little bit.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.490
Tougeguchi-san just taught me 
how to do it not long ago, too.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:19.420
Make an L!

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:20.750
Another L!

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:22.580
Then build up to...

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:24.630
V! And that's it!

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:27.150
<i>That does seem simple enough, but...</i>

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.240
Fight on! Fight on! Class 3!

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.580
What's this?

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.670
Fight on! Fight on! Class 3!

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:34.040
There's another one now.

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.840
Fight on! Fight on! Class 3!

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:37.840
I can hear your cheers!

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:41.140
Fight on! Fight on! Class 3!

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:45.150
Fight on! Fight on! Class 3!

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:57.370
You did great, Shijou-san!

00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:59.770
<i>That was so embarrassing!</i>

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:01.390
Did you get it on video, Tanigawa-san?

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:02.060
Yep!

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.700
Sh-She was recording it?!

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:08.070
One of the competitors wanted to see how 
her performance looked and asked her to.

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:15.800
I'm not tall like Nawashiro-san,

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:20.970
so I figured out that I have to reach my 
arms and legs out farther to look as powerful.

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:26.540
Neko-chan is good at moving 
really gracefully...

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:31.060
And Tanigawa-san has such beautiful legs,

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:33.760
so she looks amazing when she dances!

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:37.700
That all made me feel like 
I need to practice more.

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:40.720
Akebi-san...

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.630
Here, Shijou-san. You can look, too.

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:50.440
<i>I-I'm scared to watch it.</i>

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.150
K-Kamimoku-san?!

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.450
C-Careful!

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:25.590
<i>Fight on! Fight on! Class 3!</i>

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:28.910
<i>Fight on! Fight on! Class 3!</i>

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:30.180
Shijou-san...

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:32.360
<i>Fight on! Fight on! Class 3!</i>

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.360
You're not really stretching 
your elbows and waist much.

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:35.740
<i>Fight on! Fight on! Class 3!</i>

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:33.430
Yeah...

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:34.680
<i>What is this?</i>

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:39.010
<i>Fight on! Fight on! Class 3!</i>

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:37.900
<i>Why am I so scrunched up?</i>

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:40.970
I look so dumb.

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:42.380
<i>Fight on! Fight on! Class 3!</i>

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:41.960
Huh?

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:46.560
<i>Akebi-san's figure makes me 
envy her enough as it is.</i>

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.760
<i>But she's practicing so 
hard to cover for that,</i>

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.380
<i>and dancing with all her might.</i>

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:56.630
<i>I can't stand this!</i>

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:02.350
Akebi-san, can I try it just a little more?

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:11.580
Of course!

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:21.840
<i>I'm still embarrassed, but...</i>

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:24.330
You're doing great!

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:31.670
Now all you need is a smile!

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:38.260
They're matching up better.

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:40.280
<i>What is this?</i>

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.540
Last stage!

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.390
<i>It feels so good!</i>

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:08.330
Good work out there.

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:10.300
You were a lot of fun to watch.

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:12.380
Sorry to keep you waiting so long.

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.570
It wasn't that long at all.

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:16.880
You sure are sweating, though.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:20.920
Want to take a break?

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:32.490
No.

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:38.100
Let's play!

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:42.530
<i>I remember now...</i>

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:48.800
<i>why I started playing tennis.</i>

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:13.630
<i>Because it looked so cool!</i>

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:18.080
Shijou-san, you look so cool!

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.320
Here comes the next one!

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.810
<b>Roubai
Academy</b>

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:33.910
I learned cheer choreography today.

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:34.310
<b>Drama
Club
This
 Way</b>

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:34.310
<b>Seeking New Members</b>

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:36.800
Then, based on that choreography,

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.910
we all discussed how we could add 
more of this or that to it.

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:43.570
And then I did a bunch of 
dancing with Shijou-san.

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:49.560
Komichi-kun, your explanations are always so
full of adverbs that I barely understand you.

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.820
R-Really?

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:55.090
But I had so much fun!

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:58.650
Oh, really, now?

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:03.550
Then let me give you a gift 
that'll make you even happier.

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:09.290
What?!
