00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.730
Oh, they have that store in Tokyo, too?

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.020
There was always a line. 
You'd have to wait a whole hour.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.520
Ya made it, Komichi.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.740
M-Morning...

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.290
Unusual for you to just 
barely get here in time.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.260
They said Tamura-sensei's 
running a little late.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.760
Thank goodness.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.380
Akebi-san, Akebi-san!

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.870
That's me!

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.310
Is it true you're dancing 
at the after-party?

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.190

Oh... Yeah, for the drama club.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.530
I thought about joining 
the program, but didn't...

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.120
But I'll come watch for sure!

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.530
I can't wait to see you!

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.060
I'll be there, too!

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.670
Thanks!

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.690
That's pretty cool, Komichi.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.910
What're ya gonna dance to? What song?

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.020
I've actually already started practicing.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.450
Oh, so that's why you came 
in just under the wire.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.120
Well... there it is.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.110

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.630
Hey, Kizaki-san...

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.350
You can play piano, too, right?

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.360
Huh?

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.540
I heard you playing the one in the 
music room when I was cleaning before.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.850
Plus, there's a piano in your room, right?

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.070
I bet if you played the piano for Akebi-chan 
to dance to at the after-party,

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.050
everyone would love it!

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.440
Huh?

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.350
You know, I have a CD of the song by 
Miki-chan that Akebi-chan is dancing to.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.880
Huh?

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.410
It's a really nice song with 
a piano accompaniment!

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.060
What?!

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.340
Yeah, so...

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.930
H-Hey, I'm just wishing out loud!
 Don't be mad, okay?

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.260
Forget I said anything!

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.370
Oh, by the way, when I saw 
Ai in the entryway today—

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.120
I'm not mad!

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.390
I'm just a little surprised, that's all.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.530
Really?

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.880
What a relief!

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.850
Oh, hey, I made snacks.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:35.900
Want some?

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.080
Just one.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.470
It's very good.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.180
I can't say whether 
everyone would love it,

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.480
but I can play the piano.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.640
A little.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.250
Oops.

Receive!

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.950
I got it!

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.630
Ow!

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.630
Ouch...

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.450
A-Are you okay?

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.950
You two really are close, huh?

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.140
But that doesn't matter if you
 can't keep the ball in the air.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.890
This isn't working at all!

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:32.110
These team events are 
so important, and yet...

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.680
They're worth a lot of points, and the final 
round is the last event of the festival.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.920
There'll be a lot of people there.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.440
What should we do?

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.400
It'd be great if we could get all six of us 
together for a training camp on a day off.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.000
A training camp with all of us?

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.370
I mean, it's a team event.

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.080
We need all six of us.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:52.810
I was...

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.900
only thinking about how 
I could practice myself.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.790
We don't have a place where 
we can all practice, though.

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:02.020
A place...

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.870
If only there was a gym we 
could use on a day off.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:08.640
Oh!

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.190
<i>Hello, Komori residence.</i>

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:15.420
Good evening, Mako-sensei. 
This is Akebi Komichi.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:18.420
Oh, Komichi-chan! It's been so long!

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.020
It's good to talk to you again.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.170
Are you busy at the moment?

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:26.050
<i>What's this about? 
There's no need to be so polite.</i>

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.810
<i>So, how is Roubai Academy?</i>

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:30.790
It's so much fun!

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.130
<i>We're having our athletic festival soon.</i>

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.220
Oh, that does sound like fun.

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.220
Well, actually... the thing is...

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:47.970
You want to bring your classmates to 
Futaba Elementary's gym to practice?

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:51.320
<i>Yes, of course you can use the gym.</i>

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:53.250
Thank—

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.930
<i>I'm so happy.</i>

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:55.990
Huh?

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.770
You were always talking about 
how you wanted friends.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:08.110
For six years, I only knew you as 
the only little girl in her class.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:13.510
I always told you that I was sure 
you'd make lots of friends someday,

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.370
but there was nothing more I could do,

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.890
and that just broke my heart.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.250
<i>But I'm so glad.</i>

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:28.490
<i>You really did make friends.</i>

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:30.970
<i>That alone...</i>

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:35.180
makes me so happy.

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:39.200
Okay...

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:44.060
Thank you.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.970
How'd it go?

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:54.330
Mako-sensei said...

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.600

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.580
Yeah. I'm sorry.

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.190
This sucks.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:19.120
I don't see why our club 
has to meet on a Sunday.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.710
Right, Hitomi-chan?

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:26.270
Roubai's volleyball club is the most 
accomplished of all the clubs.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:28.760
What're you writing?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.350
An application.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.970
Anyway, Akebi-chan and the other 
girls sure are motivated, huh?

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:38.830
It's just a dumb athletic festival.

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:41.970
Aw, don't call it dumb.

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:46.190
I'm gonna be in the cheer squad 
along with Akebi-chan, you know...

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:49.740
Huh?

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:54.300
So those two can't make it...

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.000

Komichi's elementary school on Sunday?

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:25.440
Sounds like fun.

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:28.010

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:29.840

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:38.610

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.940
Wait, I don't have time 
to sit here celebrating!

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:49.950
I'm gonna get better at volleyball!

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.950
I wanna go, too.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.990
I'm going to practice volleyball.

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.000
I'm not just going to play around.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.590
I'll practice, too!

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:06.340
It's boring playing in the 
gym by myself all the time.

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:10.190
I said "playing"...

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:29.880
She's so squishy!

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.410
I didn't know you were 
a big sister, Komichi.

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:33.770
So smooth...

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.820
Yep.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.520
Hey, guys!

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.830
So squishy...

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:37.060
Usagihara-san!

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.340
Morning!

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:40.030
Morning.

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:43.230
Nawashiro-san and Washio-san 
had to go to their club.

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:44.590
But they'll come in the afternoon.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:51.130
Whew, I'm glad we got here in time!

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:54.910
Huh? Wait, how?

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:01.230
You're big!

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.580
What is this?

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:10.650
What is this little thing?

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:12.080
Oh, crap!

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.570
The bus'll be here any moment!

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.350
Okay, so what the heck happened?

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.110

You really went to all that trouble?

You're totally just ditchin'.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:35.690
She told them it was for volleyball 
practice, same as our club.

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:38.700
I didn't lie, and the captain approved.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.140
We're not asking too much, are we?

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:44.660
Why are you making that face?

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:48.040
You should be happy that all six 
of us are together to practice.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:51.100
You want to win, don't you?

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:53.880
Yeah.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.140
And you said we're going to win, right?

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:58.420
Did I say that?

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.130
What?! Riri-san?!

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:03.370
Yeah, I did. You're so gullible, Komichi.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:05.740
Hey! That was mean!

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:06.930
That was funny!

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:15.160
It looks like a pretty old building.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.330
Like something you'd see in a movie.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.310
I'll go get the key from the teacher.

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:23.050
Kao, you take the lead.

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:24.400
It's this way!

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:30.100

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:31.820

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:38.740
Thanks.

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.370
The net and balls are in the equipment room.

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:43.930
Think you can find them?

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:46.710
We've got girls from the 
volleyball club. We'll be fine!

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:49.930
I see. How many friends did you bring?

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:52.430
Five. And Kao, too.

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:56.280
Well, good luck.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.640
I'll be by to peek in on you all later.

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:02.530
Okay!

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:06.690
All right, let's get started.

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:33.350
Nice one!

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:41.110
One more!

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.790
Komichi's gotten a lot better.

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.560
I know. She's better than me now.

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.620
Hey, who's in the volleyball club?

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.080
One more, please!

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:56.080
Are you enjoying it that much?

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.250
Yeah.

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:02.350
I guess... I'm just so happy.

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:06.250
It used to be just me and Kao in this gym,

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:09.120
but now so many of my 
classmates are here with me,

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.850
and we're all able to practice together.

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:18.260
It won't help if you're only 
good when you're here.

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:20.350
The main event's still ahead.

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:24.480
Yeah, but I'm starting 
to enjoy this now, too.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.450
Yeah! I haven't been letting 
the ball drop as much!

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.250
Last run before our break! Let's go!

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:31.010
Yeah!

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:31.700
Yeah!

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:31.950
<b>To a Shining Future</b>

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.320
<b>To a Shining Future</b>

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.070
Akebi-chan! Attack!

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:42.820
Break time!

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:47.630
I'm burnin' up!

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:49.420
M-Minakami-san!

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.150
This isn't the place to 
take off your clothes!

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:58.700
C'mon, what's the problem?

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.400
Wait! Stop!

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.430
You're all sweaty, too. 
C'mon, show me whatcha got.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:06.870
I'll change in the locker room!

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:08.810
Kao-chan, we've got an 
undresser on our hands!

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:10.020
Pin her down!

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:11.300
Roger!

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:12.600
Hey!

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:14.520
Take her shorts off, too!

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:15.490
Huh?!

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:16.740
Now, now, hold still!

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.810
Wait, seriously, don't!

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:18.980
Hold still!

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.010
They saved me...

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:24.830
No!

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:24.370
Wha...

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.170
You too, Akebi-san?!

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:42.530
Ready to get started now?

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:45.730
All right...

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:48.010
Akebi-chan...

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.270
Where's the restroom?

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:53.870
The gym restroom is out of order.

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:55.920
I'll go, too. You can follow me.

00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:06.830
This school really is old, huh?

00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:10.520
Yeah. It's gonna be closed 
down once Kao graduates.

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:11.370
Huh?

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.700
That's why I'm so glad...

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:18.950
that my memories of my elementary 
school include you guys now.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:27.160
I was scared to use the restroom 
right up until third grade.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.960
I always asked the teacher 
to wait by the door for me.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:35.010
So now I wish I could tell my younger self

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:40.530
that I'm washing my hands with a friend now.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.230
Akebi-chan...

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:56.250
Well, maybe I'll go peek in on them now.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.310
Remember to stretch.

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.520
What should we do about the rotation?

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.690
Let's use rock-paper-scissors 
to pick teams for now.

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:10.580
Oh, Mako-sensei!

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:13.680
Komichi-chan...

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:16.900
You have so many...

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:22.050
Come on, Kamimoku-san! You can't sleep here!

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.480
Oh! They're here!

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:29.950
When I heard Nawashiro-san and Washio-san 
wouldn't be able to make it,

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:33.090
I put out a call to everyone in class.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.600
Onee-chan, lots of people came!

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:04.620
Usagihara-san!

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:06.520
Whoa...

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.350
C'mon, it's too hot.

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:13.220
Yeah.

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:22.770
I really... really get to 
practice with everyone.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.100
Sorry, though. Kizaki-san was the only one

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.900
who couldn't come because she 
had to practice something else.

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:30.540
Huh?

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:35.760
But it's still for the 
athletic festival, so go easy on her.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:40.480
<i>I messed up again.</i>

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:50.620
I see.

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:56.450
Well, there are lots of things you 
need to be alone to practice.

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:30.330
Here I go!

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:42.810
Onee-chan, today was fun, wasn't it?

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:44.440
It sure was.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.520
Think you'll be able to win 
at the athletic festival?

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:50.620
Yeah.

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.270
