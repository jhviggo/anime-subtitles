00:00.660 --> 00:04.330
<i>It all started when I went to 
where I usually go to play...</i>

00:04.330 --> 00:05.450
<i>I found something.</i>

00:15.470 --> 00:17.110
That's one big goblin!

00:19.510 --> 00:23.790
Listen up, kid. Don't mix me 
up with some damned goblins.

00:23.790 --> 00:26.070
My name's not "kid"! It's Komekko.

00:26.070 --> 00:28.330
Whatcha doing, Mr. Not-Goblin?

00:28.330 --> 00:30.610
Mr. Not-Goblin?

00:31.820 --> 00:38.080
All right, runt, I'm the Dark God Wolbach's 
right-hand man, the high-level demon, Host!

00:38.080 --> 00:39.470
Remember the name.

00:40.410 --> 00:41.760
So cool!

00:41.760 --> 00:43.940
Y-Yeah? You think so?

00:44.700 --> 00:47.490
I like the cut of your jib, kid.

00:47.490 --> 00:49.160
Thank you very much!

00:51.910 --> 00:57.630
Watch it there. I need that to undo 
the seal on Lady Wolbach's... eh?

00:58.520 --> 01:00.120
Whoa, are you kidding me?

01:01.380 --> 01:02.220
Here!

01:06.390 --> 01:07.830
Hell yeah!

01:14.250 --> 01:17.400
Hey, Komekko. Good to see you again.

01:17.400 --> 01:19.170
Did you bring what I asked for?

01:19.170 --> 01:20.550
Yep! Here's the offering.

01:20.870 --> 01:23.970
Nice! Well done. I knew you had it in you.

01:27.090 --> 01:28.520
What the hell is this?

01:28.520 --> 01:30.520
Sacrificial chicken, egg, and rice!

01:31.740 --> 01:34.330
I got it from that stalker guy.

01:35.480 --> 01:37.650
Wait!

01:38.280 --> 01:43.160
Stupid! There's no way you 
can break a seal with a lunch.

01:43.160 --> 01:47.970
It's gotta follow the inscription: 
you need a hen and its chick!

01:50.490 --> 01:53.300
Maybe I'm better off grabbing it myself...

02:18.940 --> 02:20.670
I'm home!

02:20.670 --> 02:22.400
Welcome home, Sis!

02:22.780 --> 02:25.370
You caught something?

02:25.370 --> 02:26.780
Yep! A big one.

02:26.780 --> 02:31.280
Look! A fierce ebon beast that I 
felled after a battle to the death!

02:31.800 --> 02:32.960
Wanna eat it?

02:36.050 --> 02:40.340
<b>Episode 5: Prelude to an Explosion of Madness</b>

02:46.320 --> 02:48.460
Ko... Komekko!

02:55.840 --> 02:59.150
K-K-K-K-K-K-K-Kome... Komekko is...!

02:59.150 --> 03:00.910
M-M-M-M-Megumin, calm down!

03:00.910 --> 03:02.270
Just c-c-calm down for a sec!

03:02.500 --> 03:05.010
There is no way that my sister,

03:05.010 --> 03:08.450
clever and tough as she is, 
became a monster's meal that easily!

03:09.140 --> 03:11.130
Komekko!

03:17.510 --> 03:20.710
Sh-She's done for. We should give up.

03:21.340 --> 03:26.250
We'll need to make a grave for her so that 
her noble sacrifice is never forgotten.

03:26.570 --> 03:30.280
Don't worry. She'll never truly be gone.

03:30.280 --> 03:33.980
Yes, she'll live on inside my heart forever.

03:33.980 --> 03:35.290
She's still alive!

03:35.290 --> 03:37.890
Open your eyes a sec! 
Because she's still alive!

03:37.890 --> 03:39.820
Aren't you giving up a little too soon?!

03:39.820 --> 03:42.010
I'm not sure what's going on, 
but this is our chance!

03:42.010 --> 03:44.250
We should escape from 
here and find my sister!

03:44.250 --> 03:44.920
Hang on!

03:44.920 --> 03:47.750
Please, can we at least try and save Inky?!

03:47.750 --> 03:49.660
At a time like this?! 
Are you kidding me?!

03:50.940 --> 03:53.170
Megumin!

03:55.120 --> 03:56.910
Oh, of all the annoying...

03:57.940 --> 03:58.960
Hey!

03:59.730 --> 04:02.790
Take that cat and incur the 
wrath of my little sister,

04:02.790 --> 04:05.480
who's waiting for it to get 
some meat on its bones.

04:05.480 --> 04:07.990
Now, you bear witness to 
my projectile combat!

04:18.770 --> 04:21.960
I didn't anticipate that they would 
have a shield of wind around them...

04:21.960 --> 04:26.680
They don't! That was pretty clearly 
just you having lousy throw control!

04:31.700 --> 04:33.950
Inky!

04:37.350 --> 04:40.810
She must have been a 
servant from the heavens.

04:40.810 --> 04:43.330
She's simply returned from whence she came.

04:43.330 --> 04:46.940
That's why we shouldn't cry,
but instead, bid her a warm farewell.

04:46.940 --> 04:50.490
Please don't make up weird 
justifications for abandoning Inky!

04:50.490 --> 04:52.440
What are we gonna do now?

04:52.720 --> 04:54.790
We'll address the missing Ink later.

04:55.900 --> 04:57.770
Komekko is the priority here.

04:57.770 --> 05:00.940
Despite how she might seem, 
my little sister is made of hardy stuff,

05:00.940 --> 05:02.740
and she has a good head on her shoulders.

05:03.200 --> 05:05.000
I'm sure she's out there somewhere.

05:05.350 --> 05:06.910
Y-You're right...

05:06.910 --> 05:09.960
Can you think of anywhere she might go?

05:10.210 --> 05:11.640
Places she'd go...

05:14.160 --> 05:16.870
I found a toy, too, 
so I've been playing with it!

05:17.290 --> 05:18.750
You wanna try?

05:18.750 --> 05:20.000
A toy?

05:20.540 --> 05:21.970
I figured it out!

05:21.970 --> 05:24.080
I hate that I have, but I did!

05:30.580 --> 05:33.660
Come on, Megumin, she can't possibly have...

05:33.660 --> 05:35.920
Gimme my food back!

05:41.220 --> 05:43.410
How in the world did this happen?

05:43.410 --> 05:46.330
What do you think Komekko is doing?

05:46.330 --> 05:49.760
I think she's trying to take Ink back.

05:49.760 --> 05:52.070
I believe that's a threatening posture.

05:56.520 --> 05:59.070
I don't know where to start here!

05:59.070 --> 06:01.660
She's picking a fight 
with a pack of monsters!

06:01.660 --> 06:06.180
And she's not even a little afraid! 
If anything, they seem scared of her!

06:06.180 --> 06:09.730
<i>It seems my little sister may, 
in fact, be a big deal.</i>

06:10.050 --> 06:11.310
Come on, Megumin!

06:11.310 --> 06:13.270
There's no time.

06:13.540 --> 06:16.190
I had hoped to avoid 
resorting to this, but...

06:18.190 --> 06:19.920
Your adventurer card?

06:23.240 --> 06:27.860
<i>A-A genius of my caliber should be 
able to hunt monsters with ease,</i>

06:28.220 --> 06:31.220
<i>earning enough points again in no time.</i>

06:31.220 --> 06:33.570
<i>No matter how long it takes...</i>

06:33.960 --> 06:36.730
<i>Even if it takes decades...</i>

06:36.730 --> 06:39.580
<i>I can still learn explosion magic!</i>

06:40.510 --> 06:44.960
<i>It's fine... I can just start over...</i>

06:44.960 --> 06:46.460
You're shaking, you know.

06:49.960 --> 06:51.930
Having a hard time letting go, right?

06:59.240 --> 07:00.780
Lightning!

07:04.520 --> 07:05.400
Komekko!

07:05.400 --> 07:06.500
Yunyun?

07:06.500 --> 07:08.520
I'll save Inky, too!

07:08.520 --> 07:10.860
Hurry and find the adults!

07:18.250 --> 07:20.890
Yunyun was pretty great back there, huh?

07:20.890 --> 07:22.240
That lightning was like "whammo"!

07:22.240 --> 07:23.510
Indeed she was.

07:23.510 --> 07:24.850
Very impressive.

07:24.850 --> 07:28.820
Although it bothers me how I've 
been surpassed by Yunyun.

07:29.160 --> 07:32.260
I'm so used to the sight of her cowering...

07:33.310 --> 07:36.050
<i>Lightning is intermediate magic.</i>

07:36.050 --> 07:38.650
<i>And now Yunyun has learned it.</i>

07:38.650 --> 07:40.670
<i>She'll graduate school now.</i>

07:40.980 --> 07:45.610
<i>Which means she no longer has a source 
of valuable skill-up potions.</i>

07:45.610 --> 07:49.490
<i>For her to learn advanced magic, from now on,</i>

07:49.490 --> 07:53.650
<i>she'll have to engage in combat 
against monsters to level up.</i>

07:54.040 --> 07:56.840
<i>My rival is going to be treated like</i>

07:56.840 --> 07:59.650
<i>an intermediate-skilled underachiever 
in the foreseeable future,</i>

07:59.650 --> 08:05.960
<i>in spite of her diligence as the chief's 
daughter, and all of her academic excellence.</i>

08:07.730 --> 08:10.190
Sis? Are you crying?

08:10.190 --> 08:15.550
I am not! I'm just so angry that my 
magic power is flowing from my eyes!

08:17.450 --> 08:20.710
What's up, Sis? You tired of running?

08:23.410 --> 08:26.910
Komekko, do you love your big sister?

08:26.910 --> 08:27.640
Yeah!

08:29.000 --> 08:31.820
Even if I can't learn the ultimate magic?

08:32.350 --> 08:34.700
Even if I can't be the 
strongest big sister ever?

08:34.950 --> 08:38.290
I can become the strongest 
instead, so it's okay!

08:42.450 --> 08:46.010
Listen closely! You need to stay 
at my side the whole time!

08:46.010 --> 08:46.920
Got it!

08:47.210 --> 08:50.880
Do not go after the monsters 
who've caught Ink!

08:50.880 --> 08:53.770
I'll make sure to get her back!

08:53.770 --> 08:54.880
Understood?

08:54.880 --> 08:56.030
Got it!

08:56.030 --> 08:57.270
I'll try my best.

08:57.270 --> 08:58.740
You can't just try!

08:58.740 --> 09:01.020
You have to promise not to go after them!

09:01.300 --> 09:02.270
Got it!

09:10.410 --> 09:12.530
Blade of Wind!

09:16.320 --> 09:17.550
Inky!

09:20.490 --> 09:23.730
Well, this is no good.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.700
It looks like Yunyun can 
handle them all by herself.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.850
Is that a bad thing?

09:28.850 --> 09:33.270
It is! It'd make a total waste of the 
resolve I gathered to turn around...

09:38.150 --> 09:41.410
Okay! Now I can pay her back!

09:42.440 --> 09:44.140
I am called Komekko!

09:44.140 --> 09:49.060
Watcher of the house, and the Crimson 
Demon's foremost lovable li'l sis!

09:49.440 --> 09:51.450
Komekko?!

09:51.450 --> 09:52.730
Komekko!

09:52.730 --> 09:54.850
Wh-What is wrong with you?!

09:54.850 --> 09:58.010
Did you seriously just try to steal your 
sister's brightest spotlight ever?!

09:58.010 --> 09:59.320
I'm not sorry!

09:59.320 --> 10:00.580
K-Komekko...

10:00.580 --> 10:05.830
What are you two even doing 
here? I thought you ran!

10:06.080 --> 10:11.320
It should be obvious that I would never 
flee in debt to my self-proclaimed rival.

10:11.320 --> 10:14.380
Could you please put less emphasis 
on the "self-proclaimed" part?!

10:14.380 --> 10:18.160
Besides, I'm already a real mage 
who's learned real magic!

10:19.600 --> 10:20.990
Lightning!

10:22.430 --> 10:25.640
I'm not a pending-in-parentheses 
mage like you!

10:25.640 --> 10:27.620
Pending-in-parentheses?!

10:26.440 --> 10:28.200
Blade of Wind!

10:28.200 --> 10:31.310
A bold statement from someone 
using intermediate magic!

10:31.310 --> 10:36.150
Don't say that! It makes me sound 
like a failure of a Crimson Demon!

10:36.500 --> 10:38.150
Fireball!

10:44.760 --> 10:49.280
Now you won't need to learn magic, Megumin.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.580
This girl is unbelievable.

11:02.890 --> 11:07.810
Didn't you lecture me about 
not learning explosion magic?

11:07.810 --> 11:10.640
What made you change your mind?

11:10.640 --> 11:13.590
I-I haven't, exactly.

11:14.020 --> 11:17.530
I still don't think learning 
explosion magic is a good idea,

11:17.530 --> 11:20.990
but giving up on your dream because 
of this mess would be a little sad...

11:22.160 --> 11:25.420
Hey, you're alive, ebon magical beast!

11:22.160 --> 11:26.610
B-Besides, you're in my debt since I 
learned intermediate magic to save you!

11:25.420 --> 11:26.850
They hurt you?

11:26.610 --> 11:28.730
It'd be a waste if you 
paid me back right away.

11:26.850 --> 11:30.650
This proves you survived the 
deathmatch for a reason!

11:28.730 --> 11:31.800
You've never owed me one before.

11:31.800 --> 11:34.820
I'm pretty sure any debts 
I've incurred will be squared

11:34.820 --> 11:37.660
after I haul your immobile self back home.

11:38.060 --> 11:41.710
Come on, Megumin! I learned 
intermediate magic to help you!

11:41.710 --> 11:44.340
Calling it even after something 
like that is no fair!

11:44.340 --> 11:46.220
Never satisfied, are you?

11:46.220 --> 11:50.750
I could leave you here, at the mercy 
of whatever other monsters come by.

11:50.750 --> 11:55.820
By helping you avoid that fate, I do 
believe I've saved your life, Yunyun.

11:55.820 --> 11:57.790
You're just twisting things to suit you!

11:57.790 --> 12:01.990
I risked my life to stand up 
to those monsters, but you...

12:01.990 --> 12:03.210
Sis!

12:08.500 --> 12:11.150
What? Why are there so many?!

12:13.080 --> 12:16.380
Could it be they're attracted 
to my immense magical power?

12:20.140 --> 12:21.620
I get it.

12:21.620 --> 12:24.390
The adults and our teachers 
are herding them this way.

12:25.490 --> 12:28.630
Once they're all in one place, 
they'll blow them all away.

12:28.630 --> 12:32.960
There's no one around here, so they can let 
loose with really powerful advanced magic.

12:33.490 --> 12:35.290
But we're here!

12:35.290 --> 12:37.270
They don't know that.

12:39.640 --> 12:44.050
Yunyun, this is your big chance 
to say that famous line.

12:44.050 --> 12:46.310
"Leave me behind, and go on ahead."

12:46.310 --> 12:48.000
I won't stop you.

12:48.310 --> 12:50.240
D-Don't leave me!

12:50.240 --> 12:52.340
You were the one who said it!

12:52.340 --> 12:56.650
We're not even until you get me safely home!

12:56.650 --> 12:59.640
Well, I regret saying it now.

13:10.930 --> 13:12.810
Is it you?

13:13.860 --> 13:18.880
<i>I've only been attacked by 
monsters when Ink was with me.</i>

13:18.880 --> 13:20.770
<i>Komekko was playing with the puzzle—er,</i>

13:20.770 --> 13:23.560
<i>the fragments that kept 
the Dark God sealed away.</i>

13:23.560 --> 13:27.520
<i>Not only that, but the appearance 
of the Dark God's minions</i>

13:27.520 --> 13:29.990
<i>matches the timing of Ink's arrival.</i>

13:32.030 --> 13:33.710
What's wrong?

13:33.710 --> 13:35.070
My head is killing me!

13:35.070 --> 13:39.550
My brain is trying to keep me from thinking 
any further, as a self-defense mechanism!

13:39.550 --> 13:42.670
This is really not the time 
for escaping reality!

13:42.670 --> 13:45.220
Sis, look at all that chicken!

13:45.220 --> 13:47.220
Let's catch a whole bunch and take it home!

13:54.500 --> 13:57.550
Oh, no. This is really bad, isn't it?

13:58.680 --> 14:00.800
<i>Yunyun can't move anymore.</i>

14:01.260 --> 14:04.640
<i>I'll have to learn magic so we can escape.</i>

14:16.850 --> 14:20.340
Yunyun, please stay with Komekko.

14:23.080 --> 14:26.440
Sis, what's wrong? 
Your eyes are redder than usual.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.100
Megumin!

14:30.540 --> 14:33.520
<i>I've never used magic before,</i>

14:33.520 --> 14:38.240
<i>but my Crimson Demon instincts let me 
understand how it flows through my body.</i>

14:38.770 --> 14:43.530
<i>It's okay. I know what I have 
to do, and I won't regret it.</i>

14:43.530 --> 14:44.480
<i>I can do this!</i>

14:45.540 --> 14:47.490
I've got plenty of skill points.

14:47.490 --> 14:52.220
For advanced magic... 
Maybe Crimson Laser or Light of Saber.

14:52.220 --> 14:53.380
Or maybe...

15:02.530 --> 15:04.270
Wh-What's wrong?

15:04.270 --> 15:07.500
Megumin, have you actually 
lost it this time?

15:14.460 --> 15:17.530
"Megumin found tonight's dinner!"

15:21.030 --> 15:22.640
My sister snapped!

15:24.010 --> 15:25.980
Yunyun! Komekko!

15:25.980 --> 15:28.150
Keep your heads low, and brace yourselves!

15:29.830 --> 15:32.630
Utilizing all skill points!

15:39.850 --> 15:43.080
She's crackling! And popping!

15:43.080 --> 15:45.720
M-M-M-Megumin, what is this? What's going on?

15:45.720 --> 15:48.230
That doesn't usually happen!

15:48.930 --> 15:50.130
Wait, did you—

15:54.490 --> 15:59.620
<i>The magic that I've been seeking for so long, 
despite knowing how foolhardy it was.</i>

16:00.180 --> 16:05.440
<i>This incantation, which I've practiced every 
day since I learned it all those years ago!</i>

16:15.550 --> 16:17.580
The sparks of genesis.

16:18.440 --> 16:20.140
The embers of oblivion.

16:20.660 --> 16:22.750
Past, present, and future,

16:22.750 --> 16:25.140
a forbidden force that 
subsumes all creation.

16:25.700 --> 16:30.240
Flame, I am become destruction, 
without mercy.

16:30.240 --> 16:33.360
By my blood, by my flesh,

16:33.360 --> 16:36.470
the commandments set by the 
old gods are now shattered.

16:36.700 --> 16:40.450
I am called Megumin. 
Foremost prodigy among Crimson Demons,

16:40.450 --> 16:43.050
and master of explosion magic.

16:43.050 --> 16:48.580
The sorcery I have single-mindedly 
sought for so long is now mine!

16:48.580 --> 16:51.780
I will never forget this day!

16:52.730 --> 16:56.440
Heavens! Earth! 
You will never forget my name!

16:56.970 --> 17:00.830
I am called Megumin! 
Foremost prodigy among Crimson Demons,

17:00.830 --> 17:03.420
and master of explosion magic!

17:04.270 --> 17:05.620
Behold my power!

17:05.620 --> 17:07.310
Explosion!

17:21.540 --> 17:22.830
This is it!

17:23.380 --> 17:25.180
This is what I wanted to see!

17:25.840 --> 17:29.380
What an explosion! What power!

17:30.240 --> 17:34.670
What a feeling... of satisfaction...

17:38.520 --> 17:42.180
She blew up all the chickens!

17:44.780 --> 17:48.700
<i>The adults who saw the 
explosion rushed over to us,</i>

17:48.700 --> 17:50.790
<i>and it was apparently quite the commotion.</i>

17:51.300 --> 17:55.640
<i>After all, what they saw was me 
and the chief's daughter collapsed,</i>

17:55.640 --> 18:00.790
<i>with Komekko and Ink standing 
watch, as if to protect us.</i>

18:11.930 --> 18:14.780
Megumin, what're you gonna do?!

18:14.780 --> 18:18.120
It's supposed to be a goddess of vengeance 
and domination with a forgotten name!

18:18.120 --> 18:21.790
They said the seal on her has been 
broken because of that explosion!

18:21.790 --> 18:24.180
The one you fired off!

18:24.180 --> 18:27.670
No one knows where she is! 
What're you gonna do?!

18:26.060 --> 18:27.840
<i>The adults of the village, understandably,</i>

18:27.670 --> 18:29.930
Seriously, what?!

18:27.840 --> 18:31.300
<i>didn't believe that Komekko was 
the one to break the seal.</i>

18:29.930 --> 18:33.080
Come on, say something, would you?!

18:31.300 --> 18:37.600
<i>And they don't know that I've 
mastered explosion magic, either.</i>

18:33.080 --> 18:35.000
Megumin! Are you listening?!

18:35.000 --> 18:39.100
Do you seriously not care?! 
Please, Megumin!

18:44.800 --> 18:47.210
Well, that was quite an ordeal.

18:47.210 --> 18:51.740
Megumin, you need to buy your 
sister some <i>actual</i> toys.

18:54.420 --> 18:57.440
I think I'll tell your fortune today.

19:00.540 --> 19:04.440
The town of rookie adventurers, Axel.

19:06.060 --> 19:11.810
After enduring many hardships, you will 
encounter wonderful new friends there.

19:12.180 --> 19:15.200
They are very capable and...

19:15.200 --> 19:18.360
Capable? Huh?

19:21.030 --> 19:21.590
Woop.

19:21.590 --> 19:24.480
What was that?! What did you see?!

19:24.870 --> 19:28.970
<i>And, since we had learned magic,</i>

19:29.490 --> 19:34.970
<i>we were told to come to school that weekend, 
as we would be graduating by ourselves.</i>

19:40.780 --> 19:43.560
Megumin... congratulations on graduating.

19:43.560 --> 19:45.740
Congratulations to me, too.

19:45.740 --> 19:48.490
I have no idea what you're crying about.

19:48.490 --> 19:53.630
All they did was hand us a slip of 
paper and tell us not to come back.

19:53.630 --> 19:57.630
Don't be mean! It's their way 
of saying we did a good job.

19:57.950 --> 19:59.280
Sure, sure.

19:59.640 --> 20:03.530
So, Megumin, what are you going to do now?

20:04.630 --> 20:08.260
Isn't it obvious? Now that I've 
mastered explosion magic,

20:08.260 --> 20:13.110
I need to depart on a journey to make 
the world aware of my supremacy!

20:13.110 --> 20:14.130
A journey?

20:14.610 --> 20:19.640
Granted, before that happens, I'll need 
to save enough money to actually leave.

20:24.220 --> 20:27.770
She really is an impertinent one, isn't she?

20:27.770 --> 20:31.450
Aren't kittens supposed to 
be more cute than bold?

20:31.450 --> 20:34.780
Are you going to keep her 
at your house, Megumin?

20:34.780 --> 20:36.880
I don't know if that's wise.

20:36.880 --> 20:40.250
There's no telling when Komekko 
might make a meal of her.

20:40.250 --> 20:42.580
But abandoning her feels wrong...

20:42.580 --> 20:48.430
I know! Maybe you should form a pact 
to really make her your familiar?

20:48.430 --> 20:51.930
Even Komekko wouldn't eat her then.

20:54.280 --> 20:56.110
<i>A familiar?</i>

20:57.320 --> 21:02.690
I do like the idea of a mage 
with a dark god as a servant.

21:02.690 --> 21:05.410
Dark... Wait, what?

21:05.410 --> 21:10.020
I was just saying making her 
my familiar was a good idea.

21:10.020 --> 21:16.160
Yes, and if she's to be my familiar, 
she'll need a proper name.

21:16.160 --> 21:18.970
Is... Ink not her name officially?

21:18.970 --> 21:20.120
Of course not!

21:20.120 --> 21:25.630
I'd feel sorry for her if she was stuck 
with such a bizarre, unfashionable name.

21:26.520 --> 21:28.770
It's bizarre and unfashionable?

21:28.770 --> 21:33.040
But, look, I think she 
likes her current name...

21:34.720 --> 21:36.100
I've got it!

21:37.590 --> 21:40.730
Y-You know she's a female, right, Megumin?

21:40.730 --> 21:42.950
So maybe keep that in mind, 
and go with a cute—

21:42.950 --> 21:44.770
Your name is Chomusuke!

21:45.090 --> 21:47.490
Yes, Chomusuke it is!

23:25.000 --> 23:40.010
<b>Next Episode Preview</b>

23:25.000 --> 23:40.010
<b>Episode 6: "The Raison D'être of an Explosive NEET"</b>

23:25.280 --> 23:26.830
Big trouble, Megumin!

23:26.830 --> 23:29.930
We worked so hard to graduate, but now 
have to spend every day job hunting!

23:29.930 --> 23:32.330
Society just doesn't know what to do 
with someone of my massive talents!

23:32.330 --> 23:34.510
But I know exactly how to make some money.

23:34.510 --> 23:35.870
I'll sell Chomusuke at a high price!

23:35.870 --> 23:36.850
Y-You better not!

23:36.850 --> 23:38.900
N-Next time, we'll spice up 
your bed time with an...

23:38.900 --> 23:40.040
Explosion.
