00:40.120 --> 00:42.810
Are you okay? Were you hurt?

00:43.360 --> 00:46.650
How can I become like you?

00:47.360 --> 00:50.480
What's your name, young lady?

00:52.490 --> 00:53.720
It's Megumin!

00:54.780 --> 00:58.540
<i>The girl was lit by the red
light of the explosion's flames.</i>

00:59.400 --> 01:03.650
<i>The heat and light it gave off
burnt an impression into her soul.</i>

01:04.380 --> 01:09.370
<i>This is the story of the girl known to
some as a mage of exceptional quality,</i>

01:09.040 --> 01:20.970
<b>KONOSUBA - An Explosion on This Wonderful World!</b>

01:09.370 --> 01:13.540
<i>but more commonly known as a
deranged user of explosion magic.</i>

01:14.110 --> 01:16.500
<i>It's the tale of her departure
from her hometown,</i>

01:16.500 --> 01:20.020
<i>and her journey to meet her true companions.</i>

01:21.010 --> 01:25.480
<b>Episode 1: The Crimson-Eyed Wizards</b>

01:35.440 --> 01:38.490
Megumin? Is that a nickname?

01:38.490 --> 01:39.570
It's my real name.

01:40.050 --> 01:41.410
Oh... okay.

01:42.390 --> 01:46.280
Who freed me from that seal, I wonder?

01:48.570 --> 01:50.440
Wait, is that—

01:50.440 --> 01:55.130
Your magic blew away a few pieces 
of this puzzle I had finally finished.

01:55.130 --> 01:57.310
Would you help me find them?

01:57.310 --> 01:58.640
Your... puzzle?

01:59.230 --> 02:00.730
Tell me, young lady,

02:00.730 --> 02:04.910
didn't the grown-ups from your village
warn you about coming near here?

02:04.910 --> 02:08.610
My mom always says any
place that's off-limits

02:08.610 --> 02:11.060
is usually being used to hide treasure.

02:11.060 --> 02:12.930
So I come here every day.

02:12.930 --> 02:14.460
Do you, now?

02:15.590 --> 02:20.270
It seems I owe you my thanks, young lady.

02:20.270 --> 02:23.870
Tell me, do you have a wish?

02:23.870 --> 02:25.110
A wish?

02:25.110 --> 02:26.920
Don't be shy. Anything you want.

02:26.920 --> 02:31.320
I might not seem like much, but I'm
a great mage of incredible power.

02:31.320 --> 02:32.710
World domination!

02:34.130 --> 02:37.060
S-Sorry, that's a bit much.

02:37.060 --> 02:40.940
What have I gotten myself into? 
Is this girl a bigger deal than I thought?

02:40.940 --> 02:43.420
Um, is there anything else you want?

02:43.420 --> 02:46.230
In that case, please give me massive boobs.

02:46.520 --> 02:48.760
That's also a no-go, I think.

02:48.760 --> 02:51.270
Besides, how old are you now?

02:51.270 --> 02:54.510
You don't look old enough to
worry about that sort of thing.

02:54.510 --> 02:57.610
Then... I wanna be the Devil King!

02:57.610 --> 03:00.860
I-I am so sorry! Let me rephrase what I said!

03:00.860 --> 03:05.330
Compared to a big shot like you, I'm a
mage with only semi-moderate power!

03:05.330 --> 03:09.300
I think I could only grant
a moderate wish of yours!

03:09.300 --> 03:14.420
Well, I'm missing three pieces of this thing, 
so could you just help me find those?

03:14.420 --> 03:15.620
Okay, hang on.

03:15.620 --> 03:18.960
I can manage something
slightly bigger than that!

03:21.650 --> 03:26.920
Besides, there has to be something else, 
a bigger dream of yours.

03:26.920 --> 03:28.970
A big dream?

03:28.970 --> 03:29.610
Yeah.

03:31.260 --> 03:34.470
I want you to teach me
the magic you just used!

03:34.830 --> 03:35.890
That's...

03:36.180 --> 03:37.470
You have to! Please!

03:39.610 --> 03:44.240
I... can't really recommend
learning that magic.

03:45.150 --> 03:48.030
Fine, then. Just help me catch some crawfish.

03:48.030 --> 03:48.860
You've got it wrong!

03:48.860 --> 03:51.620
Please don't give me that pitying
look for pitiful people!

03:51.620 --> 03:54.910
I'm just trying to say, that spell
has a lot of negatives to it!

03:54.910 --> 03:56.450
What kind of magic is it?

03:56.810 --> 03:58.060
Well...

03:58.580 --> 04:02.540
It's called explosion magic, and it's
the most powerful kind there is.

04:03.380 --> 04:04.660
The most powerful?!

04:17.050 --> 04:18.140
Most powerful!

04:18.140 --> 04:19.940
You rock, Sis!

04:20.570 --> 04:23.690
Look at all these! I think we 
should have grilled crawfish.

04:23.690 --> 04:25.860
Let's pick some edible
plants while we're at it.

04:25.860 --> 04:26.780
Yeah!

04:27.010 --> 04:29.290
Crawfish for dinner tomorrow!

04:29.290 --> 04:30.850
I see, I see.

04:29.290 --> 04:32.520
Crawfish for the day after! And cicadas!

04:32.520 --> 04:38.200
Crawfish for dinner tomorrow!
Crawfish for the day after! And cicadas!

04:38.200 --> 04:42.300
Crawfish for dinner tomorrow!
Crawfish for the day after!

04:50.440 --> 04:52.010
They're quite good.

04:52.700 --> 04:56.190
U-Um... I wasn't really...

04:56.590 --> 04:57.340
Bye.

05:00.150 --> 05:01.760
Was that charity?

05:01.760 --> 05:03.950
She had a hungry look in her eyes.

05:03.950 --> 05:06.420
That's my sister! So generous!

05:11.990 --> 05:12.780
Huh?

05:13.060 --> 05:14.410
There's someone there!

05:16.920 --> 05:20.290
Hey, Megumin! I was worried 
since no one was home!

05:20.290 --> 05:22.040
You're back!

05:22.040 --> 05:24.620
Yay! It's Dad!

05:23.530 --> 05:25.430
Hey, it's Kome—

05:25.800 --> 05:27.780
Oh, that's quite a catch!

05:26.550 --> 05:27.670
I gotcha! I gotcha!

05:27.670 --> 05:31.230
Oh, no! Not tickles! Make it stop!

05:27.780 --> 05:28.930
Mom.

05:29.350 --> 05:31.220
But tonight...

05:33.630 --> 05:35.410
We're having sukiyaki!

05:36.450 --> 05:39.500
Real meat! How many months has it been?!

05:39.500 --> 05:42.320
And today is special, 
because everyone gets two pieces!

05:42.320 --> 05:43.450
Did you say two?!

05:43.450 --> 05:45.560
Your dad gets three! Doesn't he?

05:45.560 --> 05:46.520
He does not!

05:46.940 --> 05:49.510
Sis, what's sukiyaki?

05:49.510 --> 05:53.110
It's fancy food that you only get
to eat on special occasions.

05:53.110 --> 05:55.150
You eat them with raw egg.

05:55.150 --> 05:56.520
Egg? Like <i>from a chicken</i>!?

05:58.010 --> 06:00.560
To think a day would come
when I'd get to have my

06:00.560 --> 06:03.070
darling daughters around the
table for a hot sukiyaki meal.

06:03.070 --> 06:05.950
I made the right choice in dedicating
myself to my craftsmanship.

06:05.950 --> 06:08.670
Has work been going that well lately?

06:08.670 --> 06:09.690
Sure has!

06:09.690 --> 06:13.460
I met this wonderful person who actually
understands the quality of my goods.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.550
Hey, I worked hard, as well.

06:15.550 --> 06:19.700
You sure did! Your sales pitch worked wonders.

06:19.700 --> 06:22.310
I've gotta say, our customer
got herself quite a deal.

06:22.310 --> 06:24.450
This is a little hard to swallow...

06:24.450 --> 06:25.500
What?!

06:25.500 --> 06:28.080
Who, exactly, was this customer?

06:36.030 --> 06:38.320
Honey. Could you get some tea?

06:40.300 --> 06:42.720
Honey... some tea?

06:42.720 --> 06:44.680
Oh, dear, of course not!

06:44.680 --> 06:48.190
How could we possibly have any tea
when we haven't sold a damn thing?

06:48.190 --> 06:51.360
You can worry about luxuries
after business picks up.

06:54.220 --> 06:54.980
Oh!

06:54.980 --> 06:58.010
Well, I'm surprised to see
these sorts of things here.

06:58.010 --> 07:01.850
Are you a traveler? Please, take your time.

07:01.850 --> 07:06.170
Mm, to think that humans were
capable of this sort of craft!

07:06.170 --> 07:08.350
Here, let me see that one.

07:08.350 --> 07:12.120
Oh, this is wonderful!
Our first customer of the day.

07:12.780 --> 07:14.210
Get out of here.

07:15.740 --> 07:18.800
That's one of my finest pieces,
one I put a lot of work into.

07:18.800 --> 07:21.470
I won't sell it to anyone who doesn't
really appreciate its value.

07:21.470 --> 07:24.450
Oh, there you go, saying that kind of
thing for literally no reason again.

07:24.450 --> 07:28.980
You really want to tell our hungry children
that you didn't sell anything? Again?

07:29.880 --> 07:33.220
No, it's clear this wouldn't usually
be sold in a market like this.

07:33.870 --> 07:37.360
I can tell that you're a magic
tool craftsman of fine skill.

07:37.720 --> 07:40.670
You know what you're talking about, miss!

07:40.670 --> 07:43.790
This makes the trip all
the way out here worth it!

07:43.790 --> 07:46.550
Indeed, the magic power contained
in this piece is massive!

07:46.550 --> 07:49.870
A real masterpiece, not like the trash
that amounts to being a good luck charm!

07:49.870 --> 07:51.460
I-Is that right?

07:51.460 --> 07:55.470
It has the ability to attract
the person you're seeking!

07:56.320 --> 07:59.280
I've actually been searching for
someone dear to me for a long time.

07:59.280 --> 08:01.360
It sounds like a perfect
match for my journey.

08:01.360 --> 08:04.390
Well, with this, we Crimson Demon craftsmen

08:04.390 --> 08:07.190
guarantee that your journey
will be a successful one!

08:07.190 --> 08:08.620
It'll be ten thousand eris!

08:08.890 --> 08:12.350
A guarantee? A pact, in other words?

08:12.640 --> 08:14.840
Huh? Sure, of course!

08:15.710 --> 08:18.420
Interesting. I'll take it!

08:18.420 --> 08:21.560
Thanks for your purchase!

08:22.360 --> 08:26.180
She was a real sweetheart with
an uncommon eye for quality!

08:26.180 --> 08:28.570
Probably a famous adventurer!

08:28.570 --> 08:31.070
Well, it sounds like you did a good deed.

08:31.070 --> 08:33.760
I bet she's pleased with her purchase.

08:33.760 --> 08:36.110
And thanks to her, we get to eat real meat.

08:36.110 --> 08:40.000
And now I can afford a new
uniform for my daughter.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.330
I feel genuine paternal pride!

08:43.070 --> 08:44.950
That's right, Megumin.

08:44.950 --> 08:48.740
Really and truly? After you said I'd
be stuck with your hand-me-downs?

08:48.740 --> 08:50.820
Well, you didn't seem happy about that.

08:50.820 --> 08:54.600
I mean, considering you customized it
to match the trends of your era...

08:54.600 --> 08:56.980
Hey, now! Your mother made that look work!

08:56.980 --> 08:59.590
It was totally tubular!

08:59.590 --> 09:01.580
People were wondering, 
"Is this chick the last boss?"

09:01.580 --> 09:03.840
Come on, that was a long time ago.

09:03.840 --> 09:07.070
This "tubular" talk is exactly
why I was against the idea.

09:07.300 --> 09:08.540
Totally tubular!

09:07.600 --> 09:08.810
<b>KONOSUBA - An Explosion on This Wonderful World!</b>

09:11.060 --> 09:13.710
Truly, when wearing the
uniform of our magic academy,

09:13.710 --> 09:16.940
it's only fitting that you wear
your own set, in your own style!

09:18.940 --> 09:20.010
You're awesome, Sis!

09:20.010 --> 09:21.340
How adorable!

09:21.810 --> 09:24.070
My little girl has grown up so much!

09:24.070 --> 09:25.590
She's only just enrolled, dear.

09:25.590 --> 09:27.990
Honey, put on the fancy tea!

09:27.990 --> 09:29.620
We have boiled water. How about that?

09:30.100 --> 09:34.420
Mom, Dad, I intend to learn at
the academy in order to become...

09:35.900 --> 09:38.010
a great master of explosion magic!

09:47.840 --> 09:50.510
Congratulations on your enrollment, everyone.

09:50.510 --> 09:53.610
And welcome to the temple
of Crimson Demon learning,

09:53.610 --> 09:56.020
and the greatest magic academy in the world!

09:56.390 --> 10:00.010
The Red Prison!

10:04.390 --> 10:10.040
May your journey down the paths of sorcery
and magic be bathed in the crimson light!

10:10.400 --> 10:14.060
I will now recite from the pulse-pounding
scripture of the second book,

10:12.740 --> 10:17.040
<i>Not good. If the headmaster starts in on
the sagas, we're gonna be here all night.</i>

10:14.060 --> 10:16.480
so that our new students

10:16.480 --> 10:20.640
may have the opportunity to thoroughly
absorb, in great detail, the—

10:17.600 --> 10:22.310
Uh, this hereby concludes this
year's matriculation ceremony!

10:20.640 --> 10:23.340
Hey! It was just about to get good!

10:23.340 --> 10:26.300
At least let me get to the
third book of the saga!

10:26.300 --> 10:28.170
You didn't mind last year!

10:28.580 --> 10:32.690
Well, everyone, good luck with
your lessons starting tomorrow.

10:35.180 --> 10:39.840
<i>The Red Prison. This is where the
first page of my story is written.</i>

10:40.780 --> 10:44.360
<i>And here are my contemporaries, who will 
soon be reduced to mere stepping stones.</i>

10:44.360 --> 10:48.210
It's finally over. The headmaster
never knows when to stop.

10:49.110 --> 10:51.360
A class of eleven, huh?

10:51.360 --> 10:53.290
Well, it's not a big village.

10:54.500 --> 10:58.750
The chosen eleven. Eleven is a sorcerous number.

10:58.750 --> 11:00.670
Oh, nice! Sounds cool.

11:01.030 --> 11:02.710
You coming, Megumin?

11:02.710 --> 11:05.500
There's a party at Nerimaki's house.
Her family runs the pub.

11:06.190 --> 11:08.180
I'm not here to make friends.

11:08.660 --> 11:12.640
Impressive. Putting on the lone wolf act
already at the enrollment ceremony.

11:12.640 --> 11:14.020
She gets it.

11:16.630 --> 11:18.280
E-Excuse me...

11:18.280 --> 11:19.280
Can I help you?

11:19.280 --> 11:21.540
Uh... who were you again?

11:21.540 --> 11:24.460
We live in the same village!
You don't know my name?

11:24.460 --> 11:26.390
You just... don't make much of an impression.

11:26.390 --> 11:27.850
Really? Nothing at all?

11:27.850 --> 11:29.290
Honestly, no.

11:29.290 --> 11:31.470
Let's see, if I remember right...

11:31.470 --> 11:33.590
Isn't she the chief's daughter?

11:33.590 --> 11:35.180
M-My name is Yunyun!

11:35.180 --> 11:36.640
Oh, right, right!

11:36.640 --> 11:39.010
I had no idea you were
in the same year as us.

11:39.010 --> 11:40.540
You kind of blend into the background.

11:41.210 --> 11:43.750
So, what do you want, Yunyun?

11:43.750 --> 11:45.510
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

11:45.510 --> 11:46.880
Oh, well...

11:47.360 --> 11:51.160
I've been looking forward
to meeting you, is all!

11:51.160 --> 11:53.420
Really? When we barely know each other?

11:53.420 --> 11:54.630
Are you stalking me?

11:54.630 --> 11:56.660
Wait, no... I didn't mean it like that!

11:56.660 --> 11:59.450
Well, it's a creepy notion,
so please don't follow me around.

11:59.450 --> 12:01.440
Wait... I...

12:03.590 --> 12:06.450
I enrolled here to defeat you!

12:10.210 --> 12:14.900
Declaring yourself her rival so early on.
An exciting turn of events, for sure.

12:16.590 --> 12:18.740
W-Wait, no, I mean...

12:19.640 --> 12:23.420
<i>And thus, my school days began.</i>

12:26.070 --> 12:30.510
<i>Life in the Red Prison was beyond harsh.</i>

12:31.120 --> 12:35.280
<i>Crimson Demons are only considered
adults after learning advanced magic,</i>

12:35.280 --> 12:37.650
<i>but that's not the kind of
magic I'm interested in.</i>

12:38.350 --> 12:40.890
<i>I want what I saw on that day. That...</i>

12:42.550 --> 12:47.040
Well, it's been a month since 
you all started attending class.

12:47.040 --> 12:49.620
Today I'm going to lecture you
on special classes of magic.

12:50.030 --> 12:52.500
In addition to advanced magic,

12:52.500 --> 12:56.390
there's also blasting magic,
bursting magic, and bombing magic.

12:56.390 --> 12:59.070
Teacher! Something crucial isn't in the text.

12:59.070 --> 12:59.630
Say what?

12:59.630 --> 13:01.750
There's nothing about explosion magic.

13:02.060 --> 13:03.470
Explosion?

13:03.470 --> 13:04.370
Is she serious?

13:06.140 --> 13:09.090
Whatever you do, 
don't pursue explosion magic.

13:09.090 --> 13:10.550
Why not?

13:10.550 --> 13:12.590
Explosion magic is...

13:12.590 --> 13:16.090
something that repays
an entire life's pursuit of it

13:16.090 --> 13:18.390
with no practical applications.

13:19.170 --> 13:21.350
It's basically joke magic!

13:23.530 --> 13:26.510
Come on, Megumin, quit trying to crack us up!

13:26.510 --> 13:29.300
You have comedic talent,
as well. Very impressive.

13:30.520 --> 13:33.890
Come on, it's not that funny, people!

13:38.700 --> 13:43.250
Okay, it's time for combat training,
formerly known as gym class!

13:43.250 --> 13:46.510
Yes! I've been looking forward to this!

13:46.510 --> 13:48.210
Now, what is the most important thing

13:48.210 --> 13:50.980
when a Crimson Demon engages in combat?

13:50.980 --> 13:54.360
Let's hear from our
second-ranked tester, Yunyun!

13:54.360 --> 13:56.950
Uh, m-me?

13:56.950 --> 14:00.190
U-Um, in combat, it's important to...

14:00.620 --> 14:02.150
r-remain calm!

14:02.150 --> 14:05.730
You have to remain calm
and never lose your composure!

14:05.730 --> 14:06.520
Five points.

14:06.520 --> 14:07.270
Only five?!

14:07.270 --> 14:08.860
Next up, number one, Megumin!

14:09.690 --> 14:11.060
Destructive power!

14:11.060 --> 14:13.240
The strength to obliterate everything!

14:13.240 --> 14:16.730
I believe that power is
the most important of all!

14:16.730 --> 14:17.970
Eh, fifty points for that.

14:18.630 --> 14:20.850
True, power is valuable.

14:20.850 --> 14:23.960
But you're wrong! It's only worth fifty points!

14:23.960 --> 14:26.640
I-I only scored fifty points?

14:26.640 --> 14:28.460
That's still ten times what I got.

14:29.170 --> 14:32.050
Arue! I'm sure you know the answer.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.340
Looking cool, sir.

14:35.340 --> 14:38.270
Oh, yeah! The full hundred points!
Yes, it's looking cool!

14:38.270 --> 14:41.560
Crimson Demon combat doesn't
begin unless it begins in style!

14:41.560 --> 14:45.030
Allow me to demonstrate
exactly what that means.

14:45.620 --> 14:48.690
Call of Thunderstorm!

14:54.080 --> 14:55.820
My name is Pucchin!

14:55.820 --> 14:59.190
Arch wizard and master of advanced magic!

14:59.190 --> 15:01.580
The foremost homeroom teacher
among the Crimson Demons,

15:01.580 --> 15:04.050
and he who shall usurp
the headmaster's throne!

15:06.530 --> 15:09.680
S-So cool!

15:09.680 --> 15:13.270
So that's what he summoned those clouds for.

15:13.270 --> 15:14.190
Makes sense.

15:14.460 --> 15:16.240
I-It's so embarrassing!

15:16.240 --> 15:18.760
What are you talking about?
That's our whole deal!

15:18.760 --> 15:20.160
We are Crimson Demons.

15:20.160 --> 15:20.940
Ow, hot!

15:22.730 --> 15:26.170
Okay, I want you to split up into pairs.

15:26.170 --> 15:28.780
Focus on coming up with a
cool way to declare yourself,

15:28.780 --> 15:30.690
and experiment with great posing!

15:30.690 --> 15:32.270
Okay.

15:32.270 --> 15:33.780
P-Pairs?

15:36.150 --> 15:39.530
Okay, whoever's left will
be paired up with me.

15:40.910 --> 15:42.420
<b>KONOSUBA - An Explosion on This Wonderful World!</b>

15:45.870 --> 15:47.260
Enemy sighted!

15:47.260 --> 15:50.280
Based on my personnel statistics study,

15:50.280 --> 15:54.670
there's a high likelihood of you becoming
a very powerful mage in the future.

15:54.670 --> 15:58.310
Which is why I should assert my
dominance over you right now!

15:58.830 --> 16:01.980
I have no idea what you're on about,
but I can tell you're motivated!

16:01.980 --> 16:03.480
<b>KONOSUBA - An Explosion on This Wonderful World!</b>

16:02.360 --> 16:03.470
Explosion!

16:03.830 --> 16:08.150
My name is Funifura!
I just enrolled and am studying magic!

16:08.150 --> 16:09.610
A-And y'know...

16:09.610 --> 16:11.360
My name is Dodonko!

16:11.360 --> 16:14.480
Uh... and then... what comes next?

16:14.480 --> 16:16.300
My name is Nerimaki!

16:16.300 --> 16:18.150
The daughter of a thriving local pub owner!

16:18.150 --> 16:20.310
Service with a smile,
but we only accept cash!

16:20.310 --> 16:22.230
Wait. That doesn't sound right.

16:22.230 --> 16:24.750
It's hard to come up with
something on the spot, yeah.

16:24.750 --> 16:26.250
Explosion!

16:24.750 --> 16:26.260
<b>KONOSUBA - An Explosion on This Wonderful World!</b>

16:26.250 --> 16:27.730
My name is Arue.

16:27.730 --> 16:31.450
She who will master advanced magic
and wield an authorial pen!

16:31.450 --> 16:34.340
The foremost in personal development
in the new class of students!

16:34.340 --> 16:35.970
Damn your developments!

16:35.970 --> 16:37.470
They're massive!

16:35.970 --> 16:37.470
<b>KONOSUBA - An Explosion on This Wonderful World!</b>

16:38.420 --> 16:40.220
Seems only Arue knows what she's doing.

16:40.550 --> 16:42.780
Go on, give it a try, Yunyun.

16:42.780 --> 16:43.950
O-Okay.

16:44.470 --> 16:45.950
Um...

16:45.950 --> 16:50.240
I... I'm the chief's daughter, and, um...

16:50.240 --> 16:52.700
Come now! How are you going to
do this if you're embarrassed?

16:52.700 --> 16:56.310
Mastery of declaring yourself is
mastery of Crimson Demon combat!

16:56.310 --> 16:58.540
But, sir, it's so embarrassing.

16:58.540 --> 17:02.210
Well, that is an odd thing
for a Crimson Demon to say!

17:03.410 --> 17:05.870
An odd thing indeed!

17:07.290 --> 17:08.540
What's wrong?

17:08.540 --> 17:09.360
Nothing.

17:16.880 --> 17:21.460
Teacher. I'm not feeling well, so is it
all right if I sit out PE again today?

17:21.460 --> 17:24.460
Again with this? You know today's
lesson is important, right?

17:24.460 --> 17:26.910
You can't fake being sick to get out it.

17:27.650 --> 17:29.540
Th-The awakening!

17:29.540 --> 17:33.350
If nothing is done, the other entity
inside me will seize control!

17:33.890 --> 17:35.780
Megumin! No! It can't be...

17:35.780 --> 17:39.720
Is <i>the thing</i> sealed within 
you trying to awaken?!

17:41.400 --> 17:42.770
So be it.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.750
You can rest over there.

17:44.750 --> 17:47.030
You must ensure the seal remains intact!

17:47.350 --> 17:49.720
Understood. If you'll excuse me.

17:52.680 --> 17:56.490
Yunyun, it appears I'm down a partner.

17:56.490 --> 17:58.300
Would you join me?

17:58.300 --> 18:00.420
Oh, okay! Thanks.

18:02.380 --> 18:07.400
Um... I'm going to be chief
of the village someday...

18:07.400 --> 18:09.830
Well, honestly, I'm not sure about that...

18:09.830 --> 18:12.150
Then just bluff about it.

18:12.150 --> 18:13.510
Bluff?

18:14.410 --> 18:15.250
Stare.

18:18.230 --> 18:20.410
Like this. And then like that!

18:18.490 --> 18:19.710
This?

18:25.900 --> 18:27.550
Teacher, it's raining!

18:27.550 --> 18:32.580
Come to think of it, the source of magic
power, the moon, is at its apex today.

18:32.580 --> 18:36.120
It seems my strength is
overflowing as a result.

18:36.120 --> 18:38.920
You could just admit you didn't
think of a way to stop it!

18:39.190 --> 18:43.790
The headmaster's beloved tulip
flowerbed is being washed away.

18:43.790 --> 18:44.560
Huh, really?

18:45.310 --> 18:46.180
Wait, no!

18:47.920 --> 18:50.650
This is bad! Everyone, catch those tulips!

18:50.650 --> 18:52.660
Or I could lose my job!

18:52.880 --> 18:54.380
You really want to blurt that part out?

18:57.150 --> 19:00.140
Teacher, my stomach hurts, so I'm
gonna head to the nurse's office.

19:00.140 --> 19:02.040
Oh, come off it and help!

19:07.370 --> 19:09.550
Yunyun! It's headed your way!

19:11.530 --> 19:15.240
Damn it... Wait, I know.
The seal has been broken!

19:15.240 --> 19:17.610
This rain was caused by a dark god!

19:17.610 --> 19:18.890
Now he's blaming dark gods.

19:20.180 --> 19:20.880
<b>KONOSUBA - An Explosion on This Wonderful World!</b>

19:28.950 --> 19:30.640
What in the world just happened?

19:30.640 --> 19:32.980
How was any of this educational?

19:32.980 --> 19:36.300
It would've been easier
if we could use magic...

19:36.300 --> 19:37.720
Tell me about it.

19:37.720 --> 19:40.270
I can't wait to learn some.

19:40.270 --> 19:41.800
Tell me about it!

19:41.800 --> 19:45.170
This mess could've been solved with
a single, powerful explosion spell...

19:46.000 --> 19:47.360
Never mind.

19:48.620 --> 19:50.420
Hey, Megumin...

19:50.420 --> 19:52.130
I know everyone laughed,

19:52.130 --> 19:54.740
but I think whether it's a joke
would depend on who's using it.

19:55.950 --> 19:57.570
Don't be so friendly.

19:57.570 --> 19:59.960
You're supposed to be my rival, aren't you?

20:01.380 --> 20:05.730
Y-You're right! We're rivals,
competing in mastery of magic!

20:05.730 --> 20:08.820
I might've come in second place
during exams, but next time—

20:08.820 --> 20:09.860
Sure, sure.

20:09.860 --> 20:12.550
Do you have to sound so dismissive?!

20:32.610 --> 20:36.130
<i>Explosion magic... is joke magic?</i>

20:38.470 --> 20:41.250
<i>No. I saw it on that day.</i>

20:41.630 --> 20:42.980
<i>That light...</i>

20:52.400 --> 20:55.480
This is dangerous, young lady.
You'll want to back up.

21:06.390 --> 21:09.450
You need to rest a bit longer, my other half.

21:10.020 --> 21:14.440
This world is too peaceful for
your presence at the moment.

21:16.090 --> 21:20.150
Rest within the primordial flame,
cloaked by the smoke of supremacy.

21:21.080 --> 21:23.200
Explosion!

21:21.080 --> 21:23.200
Explosion!

21:41.880 --> 21:44.150
<i>I don't care if it's a joke.</i>

21:44.920 --> 21:48.480
<i>I'm going to master explosion magic,</i>

21:48.480 --> 21:51.130
<i>and become a mage like that woman!</i>

We don't know magic yet, but we're
already having combat practice!
