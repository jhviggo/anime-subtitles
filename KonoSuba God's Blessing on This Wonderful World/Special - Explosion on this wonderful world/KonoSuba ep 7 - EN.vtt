WEBVTT

00:03.560 --> 00:04.970
I have arrived!

00:04.970 --> 00:08.590
The city of water and hot
springs, Arcanretia!

00:09.490 --> 00:12.740
<i>Clad in the armor of my friends' parting gifts,</i>

00:12.740 --> 00:16.530
<i>I stand here with my sister's
wishes in my heart...</i>

00:16.530 --> 00:19.050
<i>And I feel up to any challenge!</i>

00:19.050 --> 00:26.460
<i>And thus begins the first page
in the book of my adventures!</i>

01:49.630 --> 01:56.510
<b>KONOSUBA - An Explosion on This Wonderful World!</b>

01:58.050 --> 02:02.350
<b>Episode 7: Troublemakers of the City of Water</b>

02:02.480 --> 02:05.540
It... It wasn't supposed to be like this.

02:08.940 --> 02:13.300
<i>It's been a week since
I teleported to this town,</i>

02:13.300 --> 02:16.680
<i>and not only have I had trouble earning
the fare to my next destination, Axel,</i>

02:13.910 --> 02:18.250
Just sign right here and your
life will be rose-tinted bliss!

02:16.680 --> 02:19.990
<i>but I'm barely able to cover
the cost of food and lodging.</i>

02:18.250 --> 02:20.000
All it takes is a signature!

02:20.840 --> 02:23.000
Huh? It's a bad idea?

02:23.000 --> 02:24.210
Yes.

02:24.210 --> 02:28.910
All of the monsters that live near
Arcanretia tend to be really strong.

02:29.380 --> 02:34.850
There are manageable ones like
goblins and kobolds, too, but...

02:34.850 --> 02:36.710
They always seem to appear alongside the kind

02:36.710 --> 02:39.630
that would make quick work of
an amateur. Which means...

02:39.940 --> 02:45.260
A rookie adventurer like myself
can't accept quests here, then.

02:45.510 --> 02:47.010
Sorry about this.

02:49.390 --> 02:54.900
I know my explosion magic could
obliterate any kind of foe!

02:54.900 --> 02:58.380
But if I can't take any work on,
I literally can't get anywhere.

02:58.840 --> 03:03.740
No! It should be fine if I find a normal
job that doesn't require magic!

03:04.120 --> 03:05.290
It should!

03:11.830 --> 03:12.630
You're fired.

03:12.630 --> 03:14.160
Hang on a second, boss!

03:14.160 --> 03:15.920
There's a good explanation for this!

03:15.920 --> 03:18.210
Is there? Let's hear it.

03:18.440 --> 03:22.080
Well... these customers were
treating me like a child,

03:22.080 --> 03:26.240
so I asked them, "How could 
I possibly seem like a child?"

03:26.240 --> 03:29.840
And they had the nerve to talk about my
height, and my chest, among other things.

03:30.060 --> 03:33.950
And that's why you ended up pressing
piping hot oden against their faces?

03:33.950 --> 03:35.510
Hot!

03:35.510 --> 03:36.410
Yep!

03:36.410 --> 03:37.980
Okay. So you're fired.

03:42.280 --> 03:43.780
At this rate...

03:43.780 --> 03:47.230
Would you like to join us in loving
Lady Aqua? Worshiping her?

03:47.230 --> 03:51.400
Serving her? I'm sure it would provide
a dramatic change in your life,

03:51.400 --> 03:53.160
in more ways than one!

03:53.160 --> 03:56.780
Joining the Axis Church has all kinds
of benefits, like learning party tricks

03:56.780 --> 04:00.120
and becoming really popular
with undead monsters!

04:05.540 --> 04:07.740
I don't have time for this.

04:07.740 --> 04:09.950
I need to earn money somehow!

04:10.970 --> 04:14.990
Join the Axis Church now and you're
guaranteed to have good luck!

04:14.990 --> 04:17.930
Would it... help me make friends?

04:20.890 --> 04:21.780
Yunyun?

04:21.780 --> 04:25.660
You'll get friends, family, and lovers!
Of all ages, from adults to kids to old folks!

04:26.140 --> 04:31.190
<i>I think I may have developed a
subconscious reliance on her.</i>

04:31.190 --> 04:32.260
<i>Which is bad!</i>

04:33.790 --> 04:38.750
Aren't you two ashamed to do this
sort of thing to a helpless girl?!

04:38.750 --> 04:39.410
What's this?

04:39.410 --> 04:41.310
Stop trying to make this about us!

04:41.310 --> 04:42.130
Give it a rest and—

04:42.130 --> 04:43.310
Hold it right there!

04:45.060 --> 04:46.550
Please, help me!

04:46.550 --> 04:50.400
These two were all, "Look at the pretty
mug on you! I bet you want it, huh?"

04:50.400 --> 04:53.330
"Waltzing around town with
that hot little body,

04:53.330 --> 04:57.720
I bet you knew exactly what would happen!"
And then they tried to drag me off!

04:57.720 --> 04:58.760
We did not!

05:00.560 --> 05:02.160
I am called Megumin!

05:02.160 --> 05:07.150
Foremost mage among the Crimson Demons,
and master of explosion magic!

05:07.650 --> 05:11.290
And I can hardly overlook
this brand of villainy!

05:11.290 --> 05:13.720
Wait, you're a Crimson Demon?

05:13.720 --> 05:16.620
Don't be hasty, now. Let's talk this over.

05:16.620 --> 05:20.270
Unfortunately for you, my crimson gaze

05:20.270 --> 05:24.600
can see through the excuses that
would fool your average dullard!

05:24.600 --> 05:27.250
Girl, I think your crimson
gaze might be blind!

05:29.430 --> 05:31.800
Great, now what are you gonna do about this?

05:31.800 --> 05:33.920
That woman was an Axis cultist!

05:33.920 --> 05:34.400
Huh?

05:34.610 --> 05:38.540
She defaced a portrait of Lady
Eris that was hung in our church!

05:38.540 --> 05:39.030
Huh?!

05:39.030 --> 05:41.320
And the other day, she ran
off with all the bread

05:41.320 --> 05:43.240
that we were supposed to
distribute to the needy!

05:43.240 --> 05:43.660
What?!

05:43.660 --> 05:46.950
Well, that's, uh...
I'm terribly sorry about that.

05:46.950 --> 05:48.970
I haven't been here long, and I don't...

05:48.970 --> 05:50.660
Officer, that's them!

05:52.310 --> 05:56.900
I half expected this to be nonsense,
considering the Axis Cult was involved,

05:56.900 --> 06:01.160
but it looks like the Eris Sect is
actually harassing a young girl.

06:01.370 --> 06:04.520
Ma'am, I don't know what
that Axis cultist told you,

06:04.520 --> 06:06.100
but we haven't done anything wrong!

06:06.100 --> 06:08.660
Dear me! Look how defiant they are!

06:08.660 --> 06:11.020
And after they were trying
to do who-knows-what

06:11.020 --> 06:13.700
not just to that darling girl,
but myself, as well!

06:13.700 --> 06:16.420
You must've been so scared!
But it's all right now!

06:16.420 --> 06:17.440
What are you talking about?!

06:17.650 --> 06:19.980
Why don't you explain yourselves
down at the station?

06:19.980 --> 06:20.790
Come along, now.

06:20.790 --> 06:21.940
Wh-What?!

06:21.940 --> 06:23.680
Let's go! Now's our chance!

06:23.680 --> 06:27.920
Hang on! I need to question you two, as well!

06:31.490 --> 06:33.700
Are you all right? They didn't hurt you?

06:35.050 --> 06:37.460
Looks like I arrived in the nick of time!

06:37.460 --> 06:39.080
Talk about a close call.

06:39.080 --> 06:40.840
What are you trying to pull?

06:40.840 --> 06:44.750
Why are you trying to make
it sound like you saved me?

06:44.750 --> 06:47.770
It's not like I had any reason to run.

06:47.770 --> 06:50.750
Come, now. If you had stayed there,

06:50.750 --> 06:54.620
those wicked Eris cultists would've
definitely done something horrible to you.

06:54.620 --> 06:57.630
I mean, look at you!
You're so cute and... lolicious.

06:58.360 --> 07:01.400
Now, if you want to thank me for helping you,

07:01.400 --> 07:03.620
just sign this certificate of conversion...

07:03.620 --> 07:05.690
I am not joining the Axis Sect!

07:05.690 --> 07:08.410
Why should I thank you in the first—

07:10.560 --> 07:12.680
Someone must be hungry!

07:12.680 --> 07:15.770
Why don't you come with me?

07:15.770 --> 07:17.420
I'll take real good care of you!

07:18.080 --> 07:21.990
And yet, I have a tremendously
bad feeling about it.

07:22.650 --> 07:26.030
My name is Cecily, and I'm a priest
with the Religious Order of Axis!

07:26.030 --> 07:29.790
You can call me "Big Sis Cecily," okay?

07:31.080 --> 07:33.470
My name is Megumin...

07:33.470 --> 07:35.280
So call me that.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.120
What an unusual name!

07:37.120 --> 07:42.250
But no matter. Let's get you some tasty
food, and we can have a nice chat.

07:51.820 --> 07:53.070
It's a loli!

07:53.070 --> 07:55.780
Our order has been blessed with a loli!

07:55.780 --> 07:57.170
Look how lolicious she is!

07:57.170 --> 07:58.530
Loliloli!

07:58.870 --> 08:02.550
The next person to say "loli"
is going to catch these hands!

08:05.370 --> 08:07.940
God, she is a <i>loli</i> loli.

08:07.940 --> 08:13.350
Miss Megumin, our adherents are
forbidden from being near children.

08:13.350 --> 08:16.190
So, please, try to understand how they feel.

08:16.190 --> 08:18.930
What in the world did you people do?!

08:22.410 --> 08:24.650
Please, enjoy.

08:26.500 --> 08:27.600
This isn't one of those

08:27.600 --> 08:30.960
"By eating this, you accept membership
in the Axis Sect" deals, is it?

08:31.270 --> 08:35.010
Come, now! We would never
try anything so dastardly!

08:35.010 --> 08:35.680
Right?

08:35.680 --> 08:37.340
Th-That's right!

08:37.340 --> 08:39.060
I swear to Lady Aqua!

08:39.060 --> 08:40.160
Good grief...

08:47.650 --> 08:51.250
Ah, it seems an adorable
guest has joined us.

08:54.650 --> 08:57.270
This our arch priest, Father Zesta.

08:57.270 --> 09:01.770
I hear you've had trouble finding
work or a place to stay.

09:02.240 --> 09:06.660
If you'd like, you can have a
room here until you find a job.

09:07.090 --> 09:08.720
Thank you so much!

09:08.720 --> 09:12.810
I hate to impose, but I was
really running out of options.

09:12.810 --> 09:16.120
If there's anything I can do to
thank you, please, just ask.

09:16.520 --> 09:18.980
Did you say... <i>anything</i>?

09:18.980 --> 09:22.570
Er, that's more a figure of speech...

09:22.570 --> 09:23.580
In that case...

09:24.940 --> 09:27.430
Could you call me "Big Brother"?

09:27.430 --> 09:29.350
Wait, no... "Daddy"!

09:29.350 --> 09:31.470
Maybe some underpants instead?

09:31.470 --> 09:33.740
Actually, just sit on me!

09:33.740 --> 09:36.040
Oh, dear, I can't decide!

09:36.390 --> 09:42.050
Oh great goddess Aqua! Please offer
your guidance to this lost lamb!

09:42.050 --> 09:45.390
Excuse me, but what is this deviant's deal?

09:46.430 --> 09:51.440
That's Father Zesta. He runs our chapter,
and is next in line to be pontiff of our order.

09:51.440 --> 09:54.170
Is your order... going to be okay?

09:54.170 --> 09:57.880
I know what you're thinking, but he can
be pretty competent when he has to be.

09:57.880 --> 10:00.320
It'll probably be fine?

10:00.510 --> 10:03.000
You really don't sound that invested.

10:05.780 --> 10:10.330
Father Zesta, I hate to interrupt your fun,

10:10.330 --> 10:14.010
but I have today's report
on our conversion rates.

10:16.910 --> 10:18.350
This doesn't look promising.

10:18.580 --> 10:22.460
Yes, most likely due to the
machinations of that wicked Eris Cult.

10:22.460 --> 10:25.190
Maybe we should switch up 
our proselytization methods?

10:25.190 --> 10:26.090
How, for example?

10:26.090 --> 10:29.200
We could pretend to be
members of the Eris Sect,

10:29.200 --> 10:31.240
and just before someone signs up,

10:31.240 --> 10:35.070
switch out the certificate of conversion
with one for the Axis Church.

10:35.070 --> 10:39.030
No, that would be too obvious, and they'd
be able to run at the last second.

10:44.310 --> 10:47.960
You're looking for an effective method
to recruit new members, then?

10:50.930 --> 10:55.930
Crimson Demons are renowned for
our wisdom. Perhaps I can help?

11:00.460 --> 11:01.520
Listen closely.

11:01.520 --> 11:05.100
First, I intentionally spill these apples.

11:07.800 --> 11:11.290
"Oh, my apples!" I'll scream in anguish.

11:11.290 --> 11:14.350
And then some kind person
will help me collect them.

11:14.680 --> 11:18.940
That's when I say, "Thank you
so much! You're a huge help!"

11:18.940 --> 11:23.790
And you pretend to coincidentally
have come across the scene.

11:23.790 --> 11:28.510
Then I'll go, "Mr. Zesta!
This person just helped me!"

11:28.780 --> 11:33.540
Which is your cue to go,
"Please, let me thank you somehow,"

11:33.540 --> 11:37.510
at which point you invite
us both to a nearby café.

11:37.740 --> 11:39.730
Which is where you will
threaten... or rather,

11:39.730 --> 11:42.130
give a sermon to convince them to convert!

11:42.130 --> 11:44.660
M-M-M-M—

11:45.000 --> 11:47.920
Magnificent! Such brilliant thinking!

11:47.920 --> 11:49.710
Is this the wisdom of the Crimson Demons?!

11:49.710 --> 11:53.300
It sounds more effective than
any plan I've ever heard of!

11:54.520 --> 11:56.530
Now then, let's get underway.

11:56.530 --> 11:57.310
Right!

12:00.790 --> 12:03.410
Here comes someone who looks helpful.

12:08.030 --> 12:08.860
Wha—

12:10.740 --> 12:12.720
Oh, my apples!

12:16.810 --> 12:20.000
Thank you so much! You're a huge help!

12:20.000 --> 12:23.250
Can I do anything to thank you?!

12:23.510 --> 12:25.250
Th-That's okay!

12:35.750 --> 12:38.130
Well, nothing is perfect from the get-go.

12:38.130 --> 12:40.390
I think I've the gist now,
so I bet it'll work next time.

12:40.390 --> 12:42.220
Could you just leave?

12:42.220 --> 12:45.240
Now, now, everyone makes mistakes sometimes.

12:45.240 --> 12:46.820
Do you even realize it was your fault?

12:47.600 --> 12:53.960
Let's change up the premise. This time,
we'll pretend that you're attacking me.

12:53.960 --> 12:54.650
Right.

12:59.550 --> 13:03.390
Let's go for that hardy-looking fellow
with the righteous air about him.

13:04.290 --> 13:07.300
Someone! Someone, help me!

13:07.300 --> 13:09.950
This old man was going to make me...

13:12.510 --> 13:14.310
Where is he?

13:14.310 --> 13:15.320
Huh?

13:16.480 --> 13:18.500
What are you doing?!

13:18.500 --> 13:22.110
We've already got his attention!
You need to come after me!

13:22.110 --> 13:25.620
At this rate, I'm just going to look crazy!

13:25.620 --> 13:28.370
Miss, what's this all about?

13:29.300 --> 13:30.440
Well...

13:31.190 --> 13:34.990
I happen to be a police officer,
although I'm off-duty today.

13:34.990 --> 13:38.110
Th-There's actually... a good explanation...

13:38.110 --> 13:43.090
Well, I'd like to hear it,
considering the commotion you're making.

13:45.260 --> 13:47.510
<b>KONOSUBA - An Explosion on This Wonderful World!</b>

13:45.660 --> 13:47.520
Son of a...

13:47.930 --> 13:50.000
I am <i>done</i>.

13:50.200 --> 13:52.120
Now, don't be that way.

13:52.120 --> 13:54.100
I apologize for running
and leaving you behind.

13:54.100 --> 13:56.640
It's just, he looked rather tough, you know?

13:58.220 --> 14:03.830
That's no excuse! I was chewed out
by a constable because of you!

14:03.830 --> 14:06.540
I'm so sorry! You have my
most heartfelt apology!

14:07.780 --> 14:09.970
Do you actually feel sorry at all?

14:09.970 --> 14:11.980
Now, now, let's renew our approach.

14:12.870 --> 14:14.950
Oh, look, meat skewers!

14:15.580 --> 14:18.540
I can't be bought with food, you realize.

14:22.310 --> 14:23.990
This is really good!

14:23.990 --> 14:28.050
I'm curious, Miss Megumin. What has you
traveling on your own at such a young age?

14:28.610 --> 14:31.070
I'm actually searching for someone.

14:31.610 --> 14:35.430
Although my only clues are
that she's a beautiful,

14:35.430 --> 14:38.360
voluptuous woman who uses explosion magic.

14:38.690 --> 14:40.850
That sounds familiar...

14:41.170 --> 14:43.420
What?! Could you tell me more?

14:43.890 --> 14:47.070
Something about a buxom beauty of
some renown in the town of Axel,

14:47.070 --> 14:52.570
who can use explosion magic, and is
running a magical item shop, I think?

14:53.700 --> 14:58.580
The fact that she's a buxom beauty made
an impression, so it stuck in my memory.

14:59.530 --> 15:03.460
Well, since you've given me a good
lead in addition to good food,

15:03.460 --> 15:06.830
let me help a bit more with
your recruiting efforts.

15:07.190 --> 15:10.200
Would you be so kind, Miss Megumin?

15:11.170 --> 15:12.310
There they are!

15:12.310 --> 15:13.730
Get them!

15:13.730 --> 15:17.570
Uh, Zest?! Why did you steal the
toilet paper from that bathroom?!

15:17.570 --> 15:20.100
I left certificates of
conversion in their place!

15:20.100 --> 15:24.990
Wouldn't you despair at having no paper,
and search for grace in Lady Aqua's arms?!

15:24.990 --> 15:27.180
You didn't think about
the trouble you'd cause,

15:27.180 --> 15:29.480
or the fact that they might wipe
their butts with your certificates?!

15:34.230 --> 15:35.860
Let's just head back.

15:36.560 --> 15:41.140
I don't mind, but... are you sure
you want to, Miss Megumin?

15:41.370 --> 15:42.110
Excuse me?

15:42.360 --> 15:45.750
Considering how highly
you billed yourself...

15:46.590 --> 15:51.770
Crimson Demons are renowned for
our wisdom. Perhaps I can help?

15:52.690 --> 15:56.200
<i>I</i> certainly wouldn't want
to return empty-handed.

15:56.850 --> 16:00.110
Fine. Let's try one more time.

16:00.780 --> 16:03.710
But I'm going to do it myself this time.

16:03.710 --> 16:05.760
Can you restrain yourself?

16:05.760 --> 16:07.690
I see...

16:07.690 --> 16:10.560
I suppose I'll select the mark, then.

16:10.560 --> 16:12.520
You're even calling them "marks" now.

16:12.530 --> 16:14.530
<b>KONOSUBA - An Explosion on This Wonderful World!</b>

16:12.860 --> 16:14.520
Well, well...

16:17.820 --> 16:21.670
There, Miss Megumin. Here comes
a pleasant-seeming young girl.

16:22.290 --> 16:23.610
Good grief...

16:27.460 --> 16:30.380
I can't believe I tripped over nothing!

16:31.510 --> 16:35.700
I skinned my knee!
It hurts so much, I can't move!

16:35.700 --> 16:37.120
At this rate, the wound will—

16:37.120 --> 16:38.650
What are you doing?

16:39.760 --> 16:41.180
Seriously, Megumin.

16:42.240 --> 16:43.900
What are you doing?

16:56.870 --> 16:59.370
What are you doing...

16:59.370 --> 17:01.950
in the middle of the street?!

17:01.950 --> 17:03.250
Please stop!

17:03.250 --> 17:06.490
Don't roll me like that! Yunyun!

17:06.490 --> 17:10.950
Yunyunyunyunyunyun!

17:06.490 --> 17:10.950
Meguminminminminmin!

17:08.960 --> 17:10.960
<b>KONOSUBA - An Explosion on This Wonderful World!</b>

17:11.760 --> 17:18.390
So, you fall over in the middle of the
street, beg for help, and then what?

17:18.390 --> 17:20.930
I've got questions myself.
What are you doing here?

17:20.930 --> 17:23.700
Huh?! Well, that's... er....

17:23.700 --> 17:26.200
And why is Chomusuke with you?

17:26.810 --> 17:30.120
It's just... Chomusuke
has really missed you!

17:30.120 --> 17:32.450
She's been totally
heartbroken with you gone.

17:36.120 --> 17:39.440
Look! See? She's so excited
to see you again!

17:43.940 --> 17:48.460
Excuse me, but who are you, and what is
your relationship with Miss Megumin?

17:48.460 --> 17:52.130
I-I'm Megumin's rival.

17:52.130 --> 17:59.730
And I've actually been curious...
How do you know Megumin?

17:59.730 --> 18:02.890
You want to know about our relationship?!

18:02.890 --> 18:04.740
This is Zesta, with the Axis Sect.

18:04.740 --> 18:06.210
The Axis Sect?!

18:06.210 --> 18:10.730
Miss Megumin has been helping
me recruit new members.

18:11.140 --> 18:14.340
That was your idea... of proselytizing?

18:20.430 --> 18:26.890
Hey, Megumin, I'm not sure you should stay
here and mess with the Axis Sect much longer.

18:26.890 --> 18:30.090
Believe me, I am fully aware of that fact.

18:30.090 --> 18:31.120
In that case...

18:31.870 --> 18:35.000
By all means, Miss Yunyun,
make yourself at home.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.640
O-Okay... sure.

18:43.900 --> 18:45.630
Well, now.

18:45.910 --> 18:48.800
What manner of kink is this?

18:49.730 --> 18:52.400
Father Zesta, chief priest
of the Holy Order of Axis.

18:52.400 --> 18:56.000
I'm afraid you're wanted for arrest.

18:57.320 --> 19:01.720
What, exactly, is this? Arresting
someone without stating any charges?

19:01.720 --> 19:03.370
That doesn't strike me as very legal.

19:03.670 --> 19:05.340
Megumin...

19:05.340 --> 19:07.990
What has he supposedly done?

19:07.990 --> 19:11.490
Father Zesta! What did you do this time?!

19:11.490 --> 19:15.650
Didn't we tell you to show some restraint
when playing with yourself?!

19:15.650 --> 19:19.120
And we warned you that sexually harassing the
priestesses of the Eris Sect was going too far!

19:19.120 --> 19:23.620
Or were you going on another public
tirade about how it's unfair that

19:23.620 --> 19:26.380
women can buy men's underpants
without suspicion,

19:26.380 --> 19:30.380
but men can't do the same
without getting dirty looks?

19:33.670 --> 19:34.580
Take him away.

19:34.580 --> 19:35.930
We appreciate your cooperation.

19:35.930 --> 19:37.910
Aw! Megumin, you traitor!

19:38.250 --> 19:40.790
Don't make it sound like
I've done anything wrong.

19:41.320 --> 19:45.170
You've been charged with
conspiracy to commit treason.

19:45.900 --> 19:47.520
Take a look at this.

19:49.140 --> 19:53.360
"A threat is descending upon
the city of Arcanretia."

19:53.360 --> 19:55.610
"Should something seem
off with the hot springs,

19:55.610 --> 19:57.920
be cautious of those in charge
of their management."

19:57.920 --> 20:00.920
"For they are a servant of the Devil King."

20:01.190 --> 20:04.660
This info came from the
Crimson Demon Village.

20:04.660 --> 20:09.290
I'm sure you're familiar with
their famous fortune teller?

20:11.690 --> 20:13.420
<i>Don't tell me...</i>

20:13.420 --> 20:15.530
There have been complaints
over the last few days

20:15.530 --> 20:18.310
from various inns about the water
quality of the hot springs.

20:18.310 --> 20:22.500
Just like the fortune said,
something seems to be happening to the springs.

20:22.970 --> 20:26.720
And the Axis Sect is responsible
for managing the water control...

20:26.720 --> 20:29.480
Which would imply a connection between
you all and the Devil King—

20:30.070 --> 20:32.060
How dare you, you little wench?!

20:32.060 --> 20:36.320
Don't you know our creed includes, 
"Slay the demons, defeat the Devil King"?!

20:36.320 --> 20:37.780
Our order would never do such a thing!

20:37.780 --> 20:38.590
Back off!

20:38.590 --> 20:41.000
Or do you want obstruction of justice
and lewd conduct added to your charges?!

20:42.000 --> 20:44.990
I'll shut your foolish
mouth with a big smooch!

20:44.990 --> 20:45.990
Smooch!

20:45.990 --> 20:47.290
Take him away already!

20:47.500 --> 20:50.480
This is a conspiracy by the Eris Cult!
Don't be deceived!

20:50.480 --> 20:52.400
They fear my animal magnetism!

20:52.400 --> 20:56.880
They've duped this dimwitted
girl into doing their bidding!

20:58.300 --> 21:04.250
Oh, no! What will become of our
order with Father Zesta gone?

21:04.250 --> 21:06.300
What kind of problems will it cause?

21:09.100 --> 21:12.190
Huh, looks like we'll be okay after all.

21:12.190 --> 21:13.820
I apologize for the fuss.

21:14.150 --> 21:18.590
I do wonder what brought these
accusations on, though.

21:19.880 --> 21:20.960
Yunyun...

21:22.300 --> 21:25.500
You've seemed awfully nervous for a while now.

21:25.900 --> 21:27.210
Well...

21:27.730 --> 21:32.450
When I left the Crimson Demon village,
Soketto asked me to do something.

21:32.450 --> 21:35.480
She saw that this city would be in danger,

21:35.480 --> 21:40.170
and wanted me to deliver a letter of
prophecy if I was going to Arcanretia.

21:40.170 --> 21:43.340
And so, well...

21:45.100 --> 21:49.550
In other words, that letter you
brought is what caused all this.

23:27.390 --> 23:30.150
I just want to go back home
to the Crimson Demon village!

23:30.150 --> 23:32.470
The Axis Sect definitely
seems like bad news...

23:32.470 --> 23:36.520
What in the world?! Did she actually
follow Chomusuke all the way here?!

23:36.520 --> 23:38.780

family meeting with an...
