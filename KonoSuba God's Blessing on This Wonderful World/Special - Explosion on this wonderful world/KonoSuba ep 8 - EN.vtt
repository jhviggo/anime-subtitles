00:03.320 --> 00:07.770
I was just delivering a letter! 
I didn't think it would turn out like this!

00:07.770 --> 00:10.160
What should we do, Megumin?!

00:12.370 --> 00:14.290
You don't need to worry.

00:14.540 --> 00:19.760
I'm sure Father Zesta is enjoying being 
interrogated by that lady knight as we speak.

00:19.760 --> 00:22.040
It'd be rude to ruin his fun.

00:23.830 --> 00:28.030
More importantly, you two wanna 
help me with collecting votes?

00:28.030 --> 00:29.840
I'm willing to pay for the labor.

00:29.840 --> 00:31.540
What votes?

00:32.240 --> 00:34.620
Oh, what a sin it is!

00:34.620 --> 00:37.890
Father Zesta was colluding with 
the Devil King's army all along!

00:37.890 --> 00:41.820
I beg you all, for our next pontiff, 
we must ensure someone more faithful,

00:41.820 --> 00:43.390
such as myself!

00:43.390 --> 00:47.800
Commit now and you'll get a free vial of 
holy water that normally costs 10,000 eris!

00:48.140 --> 00:52.810
Should I be named head of the Axis order, 
I make the following promises:

00:52.810 --> 00:56.120
One, the legalization of polyandry.

00:56.120 --> 01:00.540
Two, the marriage age 
will be further lowered!

01:00.540 --> 01:04.410
Three, even siblings will be eligible, 
as long as they love each other!

01:04.410 --> 01:07.020
Vote for the greater good! Vote for me!

01:06.490 --> 01:08.990
No, no, vote for me!

01:08.100 --> 01:10.270
No, you should vote for me!

01:09.380 --> 01:11.020
No, me!

01:10.590 --> 01:14.010
No, they should vote for—

01:11.420 --> 01:14.010
Well, they certainly didn't wait long.

02:37.590 --> 02:44.470
<b>KONOSUBA - An Explosion on This Wonderful World!</b>

02:46.010 --> 02:50.270
<b>Episode 8: Fanatics of the Water City</b>

02:50.720 --> 02:55.520
Where do these Axis faithful 
get all their energy from?

02:55.520 --> 02:59.290
I think I wanna go back to 
the Crimson Demon village.

03:00.590 --> 03:02.320
Here I am!

03:03.000 --> 03:06.330
Here's your ice-cold jelly slime!

03:06.760 --> 03:09.920
Wh-What kind of creepy beverage is this?

03:09.920 --> 03:11.560
It's an Arcanretia delicacy!

03:11.560 --> 03:14.840
The smooth mouthfeel will 
get you hooked. Just try it!

03:16.120 --> 03:18.340
These are on me.

03:18.340 --> 03:21.040
And if you convert to the Axis sect...

03:21.040 --> 03:23.350
Well, you probably know the rest by now.

03:24.550 --> 03:28.150
Now that we've done a bit of 
sabotage on the nominees,

03:28.150 --> 03:32.360
let's go and talk to the inns 
that filed the complaints.

03:33.010 --> 03:36.860
I'm so relieved, miss! You really 
do want to investigate after all!

03:36.860 --> 03:38.620
Please, call me "Big Sister."

03:38.620 --> 03:41.730
Well, if Zesta really is innocent,

03:41.730 --> 03:44.740
it would mean being weighed down by a 
guilty conscience from here on out...

03:44.740 --> 03:45.530
For Yunyun.

03:45.530 --> 03:46.920
No way! That's awful!

03:47.200 --> 03:50.460
Oh, Yunyun, you are so adorable!

03:50.460 --> 03:53.710
You must've felt responsible, 
but unsure what to do about it!

03:54.230 --> 03:55.670
Miss?

03:55.870 --> 04:01.020
If thou art troubled, then instead 
focus on enjoying yourself.

04:01.020 --> 04:03.260
Let the path of least 
resistance show you the way.

04:03.260 --> 04:05.310
Flow along it, like water.

04:05.310 --> 04:09.400
Do not restrain yourself; let your 
instincts guide your actions.

04:10.110 --> 04:13.070
And... call me Big Sister.

04:22.280 --> 04:24.430
Jelly slime!

04:24.430 --> 04:26.520
What the heck is going on?

04:26.520 --> 04:29.570
And this is supposed to be sabotage 
by the Devil King's forces?

04:29.570 --> 04:33.420
But why would they pour slime 
mix into the hot springs?

04:33.420 --> 04:36.040
This has gotten too stupid 
already. Can I leave?

04:36.040 --> 04:37.040
Hang on!

04:37.040 --> 04:41.640
I get what you mean, but if this is really 
what's wrong with the hot springs...

04:42.040 --> 04:44.030
I suppose you have a point.

04:44.670 --> 04:50.260
This is where spring water from the mountains 
is collected and flows to the various inns!

04:50.260 --> 04:56.930
And because the Axis order runs it, we get 
to do whatever we want around town!

04:56.930 --> 04:59.860
Your order is really pretty awful, isn't it?

04:59.860 --> 05:05.810
And there are reports that the strangeness 
began after Father Zesta visited this place...

05:05.810 --> 05:07.750
Yes, it seems so.

05:08.280 --> 05:11.070
I think he might be guilty after all.

05:11.070 --> 05:12.820
Be that as it may,

05:12.820 --> 05:15.520
ambiguity leaves a bad aftertaste, 
so let's make sure we have evidence.

05:15.520 --> 05:18.330
You probably shouldn't assume he's guilty.

05:22.060 --> 05:23.620
You ladies Axis sect?

05:24.100 --> 05:27.550
You people are late. 
We've already recovered the evidence.

05:27.550 --> 05:29.330
Is it in that bag?

05:30.800 --> 05:33.340
A ton of jelly slime mix.

05:34.550 --> 05:38.840
Father Zesta was spotted 
carrying this bag around.

05:38.840 --> 05:41.070
I don't think there's any 
way out of this for him.

05:41.680 --> 05:42.900
Even so...

05:43.350 --> 05:46.700
Why would he do something so ridiculous?

05:46.930 --> 05:51.250
If his aim was to ruin the hot springs, 
couldn't he have poisoned them instead?

05:51.250 --> 05:52.320
Poison...

05:53.530 --> 05:57.530
The thing is, when someone tells you the 
Axis cult pulled something like this,

05:57.530 --> 05:59.450
it suddenly makes a lot of sense.

06:01.420 --> 06:06.580
I mean... he's definitely strange, 
but he didn't seem <i>actually</i> evil.

06:07.430 --> 06:10.590
It's probably clean if I drink it 
directly from the faucet, right?

06:10.590 --> 06:15.820
Right?! Anyone have a cup? And can 
any of you use the spell Freeze?

06:16.800 --> 06:19.200
This is the problem with the Axis cult...

06:23.240 --> 06:27.310
Do you think Father Zesta really is 
involved with the Devil King's army?

06:27.310 --> 06:29.740
He sure doesn't seem that way.

06:33.290 --> 06:35.710
<i>I suppose even she's 
feeling down about this.</i>

06:37.030 --> 06:40.270
They said I couldn't drink any 
because it was evidence...

06:40.270 --> 06:44.080
even though there was so much!

06:45.630 --> 06:48.810
Well, what's done is done.

06:48.810 --> 06:52.180
I'm sure he'll be back better than 
ever after paying his debt to society.

06:52.180 --> 06:56.320
I'm pretty sure the penalty for 
conspiracy to commit treason is death.

06:58.230 --> 07:02.800
Well, if apologies were good enough, 
wouldn't all of you be out of a job!?

07:02.800 --> 07:06.840
You accused me, the head of 
the Axis Religious Order...

07:06.840 --> 07:09.190
Me, of all people!

07:09.430 --> 07:13.240
Of colluding with demoniacal 
forces?! Are you mad?!

07:13.240 --> 07:16.190
I'm so sorry. So please, 
could you leave it at that...

07:16.190 --> 07:16.970
For goodness' sake.

07:16.970 --> 07:17.940
Father Zesta?

07:18.290 --> 07:20.960
Oh, if it isn't Cecily.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.520
You must've been waiting for my release!

07:25.520 --> 07:27.310
You were released?!

07:27.310 --> 07:29.800
Are you really that shocked?

07:29.800 --> 07:33.630
It should be obvious I would never 
commit such a foolish crime.

07:33.630 --> 07:35.330
Go on, tell them!

07:36.460 --> 07:43.220
For mistakenly arresting the honorable 
Father Zesta of the Axis Order...

07:43.800 --> 07:46.330
I'd like to offer a sincere apology!

07:46.610 --> 07:49.700
We apologize, Father Zesta!

07:49.700 --> 07:51.530
That reminds me!

07:51.530 --> 07:56.630
That smug-looking prosecutor in glasses, who 
showed up with that lie-detecting magic device...

07:56.630 --> 07:59.960
Please make sure to give her my thanks.

08:00.260 --> 08:02.840
She was the one who cleared 
these suspicions up.

08:02.840 --> 08:09.930
And the sight of her cool, confident face 
slowly welling up with tears was quite a treat!

08:11.800 --> 08:18.960
If I had my druthers, you'd be crawling at 
my feet, giving my toes a good licking...

08:20.250 --> 08:23.800
But I suppose, in my magnanimity, 
I'll let you off this time.

08:24.490 --> 08:28.880
Th-Th-Thank you for your 
generosity in this ma—

08:31.100 --> 08:33.560
If only your brain...

08:34.410 --> 08:37.540
was half as big as those breasts of yours!

08:43.310 --> 08:48.230
But this doesn't actually solve 
the problem at hand, does it?

08:48.970 --> 08:53.400
The truth remains that someone has been 
pouring that powder into the springs.

08:53.750 --> 08:55.710
Indeed it does.

09:13.620 --> 09:16.540
Well, you certainly inspire 
a lot of devotion.

09:18.330 --> 09:20.020
We meet again.

09:20.020 --> 09:23.350
You certainly managed to give 
me the slip last time.

09:25.940 --> 09:26.860
What is this?!

09:26.860 --> 09:29.950
Miss Megumin, who is this 
scandalously-clad vixen?!

09:29.950 --> 09:34.050
Appearing in the middle of a town like 
this... You seem awfully confident.

09:34.050 --> 09:36.550
Are you that desperate to 
take Chomusuke from me?

09:36.550 --> 09:38.050
Miss Megumin!

09:38.050 --> 09:42.770
What is your relationship with this woman 
who is flaunting her bosom so brazenly?!

09:42.770 --> 09:46.460
Those irritating townsfolk aren't 
here to save you this time.

09:46.460 --> 09:49.450
I'd normally just crush you both 
and be done with it,

09:49.450 --> 09:51.870
but since Lady Wolbach seems 
attached, I'll simply—

09:51.870 --> 09:53.790
Miss Megumin, please, I need to know!

09:53.790 --> 09:57.330
Why is she dressed like such a jezebel?!

09:57.330 --> 10:01.590
And the fact that she's wearing a robe, 
as if it hides anything, is indecent!

10:01.590 --> 10:02.920
It's indecent, I say!

10:02.920 --> 10:07.150
And yet, for how indecent it is, there is 
also a razor-sharp aesthetic edge to it.

10:07.150 --> 10:11.100
Yes, a bit like the transgressive thrill from 
the combination of a swimsuit and a raincoat—

10:11.100 --> 10:14.680
Would you knock it off?! 
Who the hell are you?! Buzz off!

10:15.370 --> 10:18.330
I wouldn't provoke her, Zesta.

10:18.330 --> 10:20.310
She's our enemy.

10:20.310 --> 10:23.480
She followed us all the way here 
in pursuit of this furball.

10:23.480 --> 10:25.830
Oh, so she's after Chomusuke...

10:25.830 --> 10:29.480
That's a rather whimsical motivation 
for such an edgy-looking individual.

10:29.480 --> 10:31.740
Could you two leave it at that?

10:31.740 --> 10:36.200
I think you're just angering her further.

10:36.200 --> 10:39.250
All right, worms, if you want 
to spare yourselves some pain—

10:39.250 --> 10:42.700
And what should I do if I want 
you to hurt me instead?!

10:42.700 --> 10:44.200
F-Father Zesta!

10:44.200 --> 10:46.810
Then I'll do just that!

10:46.810 --> 10:49.160
Fireball!

10:51.900 --> 10:54.160
Oh... She's a demon girl.

10:54.550 --> 10:55.880
Reflect.

11:04.100 --> 11:07.610
Well, I thought you were 
just some old freak,

11:07.610 --> 11:09.280
but that was impressive.

11:10.450 --> 11:12.190
<i>Wh-Wh-Wh-What was that?!</i>

11:12.190 --> 11:14.700
<i>The old pervert who got arrested did that?!</i>

11:16.260 --> 11:20.070
A demon girl... So, a demon?

11:20.900 --> 11:24.050
From orcs to ogres, I've always 
thought myself open-minded...

11:24.050 --> 11:25.800
But demon girls?

11:25.800 --> 11:29.940
The commandments of the Axis 
order forbid appreciating them!

11:29.940 --> 11:31.650
Frustrating though it may be...

11:32.070 --> 11:36.300
And what, exactly, can a human 
priest do against me?

11:36.300 --> 11:39.820
He can destroy you.

11:48.150 --> 11:50.570
You have quite the sense of humor.

11:50.570 --> 11:54.280
I am a servant of the great 
dark god, Wolbach, and I—

11:53.650 --> 11:56.510
Sacred Highness Exorcism!

12:02.690 --> 12:05.640
I beg your pardon, miss demon girl.

12:07.900 --> 12:12.800
I am the head of the Holy Order of Axis,

12:12.800 --> 12:15.910
the arch priest, Zesta.

12:15.910 --> 12:21.620
Likewise, I am a beautiful priest 
of the Axis Order, Cecily.

12:21.620 --> 12:26.580
Sister Cecily, it seems this demon girl 
is the perpetrator behind this mess.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.720
I believe so, Father Zesta.

12:28.720 --> 12:32.940
She's the reason you had 
to go through that ordeal.

12:32.940 --> 12:35.060
What are you talking about?

12:35.060 --> 12:37.380
What is any of this?

12:37.380 --> 12:41.810
I-I've been looking for 
Lady Wolbach ever since I got here!

12:48.740 --> 12:51.050
She's fleeing! After her!

12:51.050 --> 12:56.990
In the name of the Axis Church, make her 
rue the day she was born a demon girl!

12:56.990 --> 12:58.470
Right away, sir!

12:58.830 --> 13:00.170
Demons...

13:00.750 --> 13:02.630
...must die!

13:03.280 --> 13:04.540
I'll let you—

13:06.380 --> 13:08.930
It's a demon hunt!

13:14.220 --> 13:15.910
What was that?

13:15.910 --> 13:18.020
Please, don't ask me.

13:18.850 --> 13:20.870
String her up!

13:18.860 --> 13:20.860
<b>KONOSUBA - An Explosion on This Wonderful World!</b>

13:20.870 --> 13:24.320
So... does that take care of everything?

13:24.320 --> 13:29.790
Hard to say. I'd honestly rather not think 
about the Axis Sect at all anymore.

13:32.280 --> 13:34.720
What are you going to do now, Yunyun?

13:35.040 --> 13:37.760
I'm headed for the town of Axel.

13:37.760 --> 13:41.900
I heard there's someone there 
who can use explosion magic.

13:41.900 --> 13:43.660
I...

13:43.660 --> 13:50.680
I-I'm headed to Axel, too. I thought I could 
start training against weak monsters.

13:50.680 --> 13:52.820
Well, isn't that a coincidence?

13:52.820 --> 13:54.910
Go on ahead without me, then.

13:54.910 --> 13:58.800
I'll be along once I've earned 
enough money for the trip.

13:58.800 --> 14:00.040
Huh?

14:00.040 --> 14:04.380
B-But since I'm in no hurry...

14:04.380 --> 14:10.950
I-I know! Maybe I'll do a bit of sightseeing 
around town, and then head to Axel...

14:12.650 --> 14:16.540
Ah, Miss Megumin, you're still here.

14:16.770 --> 14:19.360
That demon was a slippery one, I must say.

14:19.360 --> 14:21.360
I was enjoying her tears so much,

14:21.360 --> 14:25.700
I kept only grazing her with my 
magic, which let her escape.

14:25.700 --> 14:28.010
You seem happy about that.

14:28.010 --> 14:32.900
Don't be silly. I'm beside 
myself with frustration.

14:33.660 --> 14:37.300
Now, then, Miss Megumin, if you would...

14:41.450 --> 14:43.140
What is it?

14:43.560 --> 14:46.140
The cost of a coach trip to Axel.

14:47.740 --> 14:52.090
The recruitment methods you taught me...

14:52.090 --> 14:55.230
I'm certain they'll come 
in handy, yes indeed.

14:55.230 --> 14:58.410
Why, they might even become 
an attraction for the town.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.710
Consider that coach fare to 
be my way of thanking you.

15:02.540 --> 15:05.130
So, what will you do for today?

15:05.130 --> 15:09.890
Late as it is, I believe there's 
still one last departure for Axel...

15:12.000 --> 15:13.980
<i>I can just go to Axel?</i>

15:14.770 --> 15:16.060
<i>I want to go.</i>

15:16.060 --> 15:20.030
<i>I want to get there as soon as possible, 
and tell her about what's happened!</i>

15:20.450 --> 15:22.230
<i>Then I want to gather companions,</i>

15:22.230 --> 15:25.730
<i>and unleash the explosion magic I've 
been aching to use for so long!</i>

15:26.190 --> 15:28.100
I'll head there right away!

15:28.310 --> 15:32.740
Oh, Yunyun, you're going to do 
some sightseeing first, right?

15:32.740 --> 15:36.460
I'll just be heading to Axel first, then.

15:36.460 --> 15:37.920
Aw, come on!

15:37.920 --> 15:40.780
M-Maybe I've changed my mind?

15:40.780 --> 15:45.710
If you go now and start training 
before me, you'll have an advantage!

15:47.540 --> 15:51.450
Miss Megumin, since it's late, 
why not stay the night?

15:52.770 --> 15:56.730
There are many from our order who'd 
like to give you their regards.

15:56.730 --> 16:01.260
Now that you mention it, 
that's a good point. What should I do?

16:01.260 --> 16:04.660
You could even stay another 
week, if you like.

16:04.660 --> 16:06.680
That might be nice!

16:17.290 --> 16:20.000
Isn't the water nice, Megumin?

16:20.880 --> 16:23.250
Bathing with a loli...

16:24.790 --> 16:29.700
Is there a reason that predatory gaze of 
yours has been making me feel threatened?

16:29.700 --> 16:33.020
What am I supposed to do? 
It's a tiny little bath.

16:33.020 --> 16:33.440
Y'know?

16:33.860 --> 16:38.050
Just know, I fight back when people 
try anything strange with me!

16:38.250 --> 16:39.520
Aw...

16:39.990 --> 16:44.760
Actually, there was something 
I wanted to tell you in private.

16:48.440 --> 16:49.430
Huh?!

16:49.430 --> 16:51.780
You mean Zesta did it after all?!

16:51.780 --> 16:58.090
That's right. Seems he mixed up the baking 
soda and slime mix when cleaning up.

16:58.340 --> 17:00.180
That was it?

17:00.570 --> 17:04.640
Which means it had nothing to 
do with demons, after all.

17:04.640 --> 17:07.330
But don't tell anyone else about this, okay?

17:07.330 --> 17:10.650
I want exclusive dibs on this 
piece of blackmail bait.

17:11.290 --> 17:14.600
Well, it doesn't really matter now, anyway.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.930
Uh... You're awfully close.

17:19.930 --> 17:22.760
It's a small bath! What can you do?

17:23.100 --> 17:28.230
Y'know, tight as it is, these baths 
apparently cost quite a bit to dig.

17:29.860 --> 17:35.750
They apparently hired a skilled mage who 
created the holes with rupture magic.

17:35.960 --> 17:39.570
See how nicely they're 
shaped in little rings?

17:39.570 --> 17:41.410
Rupture magic?

17:41.410 --> 17:46.370
Apparently. They wanted to 
make bigger baths, I heard.

17:47.940 --> 17:48.990
Miss...

17:49.610 --> 17:51.000
What is it?

17:51.000 --> 17:54.400
And I'd be really happy if you 
finally said "Big Sister Cecily"

17:54.400 --> 17:57.290
in an adoring voice, instead of just "miss."

17:57.290 --> 17:58.740
Miss!

17:58.740 --> 18:01.770
Let's see... You want a bigger 
open-air bath, right?

18:03.020 --> 18:04.470
That would be nice.

18:04.990 --> 18:08.980
Why do you ask? And why are 
your eyes sparkling like that?

18:11.920 --> 18:14.740
I can use explosion magic.

18:16.230 --> 18:20.720
Is it okay if I create the largest 
bath in this entire city?

18:23.340 --> 18:25.850
Yeah, of course.

18:25.850 --> 18:31.970
In the Axis Order, we believe anything 
goes, as long as it's not illegal!

18:32.580 --> 18:36.940
Follow your heart, and fire 
away with your magic!

18:39.530 --> 18:41.020
All right, miss.

18:41.020 --> 18:42.680
Call me Big Sister!

18:42.680 --> 18:44.950
Here we go, <i>miss</i>!

18:51.610 --> 18:55.780
I've been holding back ever 
since I got to Arcanretia.

18:57.750 --> 19:00.390
Explosion!

19:32.050 --> 19:37.060
I must say, I never would've guessed 
you could use explosion magic!

19:37.060 --> 19:40.540
I can't thank you enough, Miss Megumin.

19:40.540 --> 19:45.480
A bath that big can fit everyone 
in the order at once!

19:45.480 --> 19:47.700
No mixed bathing, Father Zesta.

19:49.210 --> 19:54.990
Well, be that as it may, I hope you'll come 
and visit us the next time you're in town.

19:54.990 --> 19:56.530
I think I will.

19:56.530 --> 20:01.290
Once I've found companions, if the 
subject of a vacation ever comes up,

20:01.290 --> 20:03.250
I believe we'll come straight here.

20:04.370 --> 20:09.310
May the divine Aqua offer her 
protection on your journey.

20:09.980 --> 20:11.720
Blessing.

20:16.920 --> 20:20.780
U-Um, Father Zesta? Could you 
cast that spell on me, too?

20:22.040 --> 20:25.560
His troubles did begin with the 
letter you brought, Yunyun...

20:25.560 --> 20:27.440
No fair! That wasn't my fault!

20:30.770 --> 20:34.320
I didn't do enough to earn 
something like this...

20:34.320 --> 20:38.920
It's okay. I'm sure you'll need it.

20:40.080 --> 20:43.830
Just take it! Kids don't 
need to be so considerate.

20:52.350 --> 20:54.350
Make good use of those 
once you get to Axel—

20:57.140 --> 21:01.110
The coach for Axel is leaving!

21:02.200 --> 21:03.450
I'm heading out!

21:03.450 --> 21:05.240
Wait for me!

21:12.510 --> 21:16.790
This coach is now rolling out for Axel!

21:20.310 --> 21:23.460
<i>The town for beginning adventurers, Axel.</i>

21:23.800 --> 21:27.210
<i>I'll make that my base of 
operations as I gather allies.</i>

21:28.870 --> 21:32.990
<i>Ideally, I'd like a party that's a match 
for me, full of advanced classes.</i>

21:34.690 --> 21:37.110
<i>A reliable, courageous leader.</i>

21:37.530 --> 21:39.220
<i>A sturdy front-line fighter.</i>

21:39.590 --> 21:41.230
<i>A benevolent healer...</i>

21:41.600 --> 21:45.430
<i>And me, the one who analyzes 
situations with her brilliant mind</i>

21:45.430 --> 21:47.980
<i>before delivering certain victory...</i>

21:48.810 --> 21:50.760
<i>with a single spell!</i>

23:25.280 --> 23:27.100
Big trouble, Megumin!

23:27.100 --> 23:29.740
We managed to board the coach to Axel, 
but it's been attacked by monsters!

23:29.740 --> 23:31.980
I'll obliterate them with 
my explosion magic!

23:31.980 --> 23:33.530
Hang on! You'll kill us all!

23:33.530 --> 23:35.410
Let me do it!  Please, let me do it!

23:35.410 --> 23:37.670
N-Next time, we'll dig up your 
shameful secrets with an...

23:37.670 --> 23:39.970
Explosion!
