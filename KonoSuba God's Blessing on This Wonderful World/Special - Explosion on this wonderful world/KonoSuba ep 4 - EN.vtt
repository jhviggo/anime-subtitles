WEBVTT

00:04.510 --> 00:06.360
Good morning, Megumin.

00:06.360 --> 00:07.730
Here you go.

00:07.730 --> 00:09.260
What is this?

00:09.260 --> 00:11.830
Do you have feelings for me or something?

00:11.830 --> 00:16.380
It's a little unsettling to suddenly 
have you lovingly prepare my lunch...

00:16.380 --> 00:20.320
I'm not going to challenge you today, 
so I don't want you bugging me!

00:20.320 --> 00:24.370
You make it sound like I'm some ruffian 
who's always mugging you for your lunch.

00:24.370 --> 00:27.600
I know I'm the one who always 
instigates the duels,

00:27.600 --> 00:29.370
but you <i>are</i> kind of a ruffian.

00:37.520 --> 00:38.750
Good morning, people.

00:41.680 --> 00:44.760
<i>Something about Yunyun 
seems strange lately.</i>

00:44.760 --> 00:50.820
Monsters believed to be minions of the Dark 
God have been spotted around the village.

00:51.130 --> 00:54.490
Which means we can no longer 
afford to take this lightly.

00:56.790 --> 00:59.260
That being the case, 
impromptu though it might be,

00:59.260 --> 01:03.180
the plan is to gather enough 
villagers to redo the seal.

01:03.180 --> 01:06.650
The ritual will last from tomorrow 
evening until the morning after.

01:07.770 --> 01:11.200
All right, let's go over 
the results of your tests.

01:11.550 --> 01:15.400
As usual, our top three scorers will 
receive these skill-up potions.

01:15.870 --> 01:17.430
In third place is Nerimaki!

01:22.210 --> 01:27.210
<i>Four points until I can learn explosion 
magic, as I've long dreamed!</i>

01:27.210 --> 01:28.600
Second place, Arue.

01:30.780 --> 01:32.840
First place, Megumin!

01:33.260 --> 01:34.570
Well done, girls.

01:35.920 --> 01:38.640
First period is going to 
be equipment crafting.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.450
Head over to the home economics room!

01:51.610 --> 01:54.550
Would you say something?! 
This is really awkward!

01:54.550 --> 01:56.360
What's gotten into you?

01:56.360 --> 01:59.030
I can't believe you weren't in the top three.

01:59.510 --> 02:04.020
If I remember correctly, you needed 
three points to learn advanced magic.

02:04.020 --> 02:06.140
And I need four...

02:06.140 --> 02:07.380
Is this fine by you?

02:07.380 --> 02:11.220
Wasting the lead that would give you 
the chance to graduate before me?

02:11.220 --> 02:12.970
Look, look here!

02:12.970 --> 02:16.120
I'm not trying to compete. Not today.

02:18.450 --> 02:19.860
I see.

02:25.190 --> 02:29.040
<i>Something is definitely 
off about Yunyun lately.</i>

03:51.620 --> 03:58.500
<b>KONOSUBA - An Explosion on This Wonderful World!</b>

04:00.050 --> 04:04.340
<b>Episode 4: The Crimson-Eyed Lonely Master</b>

04:00.260 --> 04:04.490
Seriously, it was the craziest thing!

04:03.510 --> 04:07.220
Hey! I heard that there's a 
Hero candidate in the village!

04:07.220 --> 04:09.110
Oh, I heard about that!

04:09.110 --> 04:12.270
To be more specific, 
<i>I</i> actually met him yesterday!

04:12.270 --> 04:14.170
He was hot, and pretty friendly!

04:14.170 --> 04:18.680
And he's looking for a skilled mage 
to help defeat the Demon King!

04:18.880 --> 04:23.820
Anyone in the position to be named a 
Hero must be a quality human being.

04:23.820 --> 04:27.580
The kind who would show 
up in the heroic annals!

04:27.900 --> 04:33.730
<i>One day, I'll be the kind of mage that can 
join the party of a hero candidate...</i>

04:33.730 --> 04:36.070
<i>A group that can overcome 
any kind of threat,</i>

04:36.070 --> 04:39.690
<i>who would never resort to cowardly 
tricks or cheap chicanery!</i>

04:39.690 --> 04:41.500
<i>Rising head-first to every challenge!</i>

04:42.220 --> 04:44.640
<i>And with my magic,</i>

04:44.640 --> 04:47.810
<i>I will obliterate the Demon King's generals 
or anyone else who stands in our way,</i>

04:47.810 --> 04:50.750
<i>as my name echoes across the entire world!</i>

04:54.930 --> 04:58.110
<i>And once the Demon King has been slain,</i>

04:58.110 --> 05:03.210
<i>I will ascend to the throne as 
the new Demon King... Megumin!</i>

05:06.620 --> 05:08.710
Megumin? Megumin!

05:10.150 --> 05:13.990
What was that? You suddenly 
started cackling. You okay?

05:14.480 --> 05:17.770
I was so absorbed in important thoughts
that I wasn't paying attention.

05:17.770 --> 05:18.800
Do you need something?

05:19.130 --> 05:22.680
Well... I wanted to talk to you 
about something on the way home.

05:35.380 --> 05:36.860
So, Megumin...

05:38.150 --> 05:42.780
What do you think it means... to be friends?

05:45.640 --> 05:48.700
I've always known you had issues, Yunyun,

05:48.700 --> 05:52.060
but I didn't think you had 
no idea what friends were...

05:52.060 --> 05:54.340
I know! I know what they are!

05:54.340 --> 05:57.580
You go shopping together, and have fun...

05:57.580 --> 06:00.660
Wait, no, that's not what I'm talking about!

06:01.050 --> 06:04.970
For example, you always try 
to sponge off me, right?

06:04.970 --> 06:07.140
But you never try to get money.

06:07.360 --> 06:11.570
Of course not. I realize there are 
some lines that shouldn't be crossed.

06:11.570 --> 06:13.260
Not to mention I'd hate for you

06:13.260 --> 06:15.650
to start making <i>physical</i> demands 
in exchange for money.

06:15.650 --> 06:17.460
I would do no such thing!

06:17.810 --> 06:22.920
And to be honest, I thought that 
was the case. But Funifura-san...

06:22.920 --> 06:25.090
She asked for money?

06:25.090 --> 06:27.650
No! It's not like that!

06:28.210 --> 06:29.560
It's just...

06:30.790 --> 06:35.910
And that's basically it. 
Funifura's cute little brother is sick.

06:36.520 --> 06:37.410
But...

06:37.410 --> 06:43.440
Yeah. The thing is, we don't really 
have enough money for the medicine...

06:43.680 --> 06:47.810
So I thought, as her friends, 
we should try and help!

06:47.810 --> 06:50.890
So I was thinking we could 
raise money for her!

06:51.410 --> 06:55.930
We can count on you, too, right, 
Yunyun? Our friend needs us!

06:56.970 --> 07:01.870
But something about giving them 
money feels rude somehow...

07:01.870 --> 07:03.990
I'm just not sure what to do.

07:03.990 --> 07:05.730
What do you think, Megumin?

07:05.730 --> 07:10.990
Given that I never have money 
as a fundamental principle...

07:10.990 --> 07:13.280
I'd think of some other way to contribute.

07:13.280 --> 07:14.790
Like what?

07:14.790 --> 07:15.800
For instance...

07:16.530 --> 07:20.280
My friend and I could wear masks 
and then raid an apothecary.

07:20.280 --> 07:23.750
Wouldn't just loaning the money 
be less problematic than that?

07:25.130 --> 07:28.270
True friends don't simply offer charity!

07:28.270 --> 07:31.070
They endure trials together!

07:31.070 --> 07:34.180
So you're saying, if you were really hungry,

07:34.180 --> 07:38.150
you'd rather someone else starve with you 
instead of them sharing their food?

07:38.150 --> 07:40.210
No. Not even close.

07:40.210 --> 07:44.580
But, well, if a friend was truly in grave need,

07:44.580 --> 07:47.210
I don't think it's out of the 
question to loan them some money.

07:47.210 --> 07:49.930
Granted, I am in perpetual 
grave need, myself.

07:49.930 --> 07:53.030
Trying to subtly get that across, huh?

07:54.000 --> 07:56.820
But I get what you mean. Thanks.

07:59.400 --> 08:00.410
It's fine.

08:03.240 --> 08:05.490
Hey, Megumin, Yunyun.

08:07.800 --> 08:11.610
Why, if it isn't Bukkorori, who's still sulking 
over having been rejected by Soketto.

08:11.610 --> 08:12.330
Shh!

08:12.330 --> 08:16.870
Don't "shh" so loudly. It's honestly more 
painful to see you try to avoid the subject.

08:16.870 --> 08:20.260
Besides, I never told her how I felt, 
so I didn't get rejected!

08:20.260 --> 08:21.690
That's an optimistic approach.

08:21.940 --> 08:24.470
Honestly, the entire world 
is waiting for my awakening,

08:24.470 --> 08:27.060
so I shouldn't be hung up over romance.

08:27.060 --> 08:29.120
You mean the thing about 
the Dark God's minions?

08:29.120 --> 08:29.820
Yep.

08:29.820 --> 08:33.340
Wouldn't it be easier at this 
point to break the seal,

08:33.340 --> 08:36.190
and then have the entire village 
fight together to slay it?

08:36.460 --> 08:38.750
That idea did come up.

08:38.750 --> 08:42.660
But seeing as our ancestors went to the trouble 
of nabbing a Dark God from another region

08:42.660 --> 08:46.090
before transplanting it here 
and sealing it away...

08:46.090 --> 08:48.450
Wait. Why would they do that?

08:48.450 --> 08:50.010
What do you mean, "why"?

08:50.010 --> 08:53.150
Doesn't the idea of a village with a 
Dark God sleeping beneath it sound cool?

08:53.150 --> 08:54.510
That should be obvious!

08:55.450 --> 08:59.850
There's other stuff, too, like ancient 
weapons that could destroy the world...

08:59.850 --> 09:03.020
And the goddess of vengeance and domination 
whose name has been forgotten.

09:03.020 --> 09:04.770
All kinds of sweet forbidden junk!

09:04.770 --> 09:07.030
As much trouble as they might cause,

09:07.030 --> 09:10.210
I have to admit forbidden weapons 
are quite the fascinating subject.

09:10.210 --> 09:11.190
Tell me about it!

09:11.500 --> 09:15.310
Huh? You think so? So am I the only one who...

09:17.830 --> 09:19.080
...doesn't get it.

09:27.130 --> 09:29.090
Komekko! I'm heading out.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.940
Have a good day!

09:30.940 --> 09:33.670
Be a good girl and watch the house, all right?

09:33.960 --> 09:35.280
'Kay!

09:54.700 --> 09:58.710
I really appreciate this, Yunyun. 
And I'll be sure to pay you back.

09:59.210 --> 10:02.330
Oh, come on, it's fine! 
We're f-friends, right?

10:02.890 --> 10:04.570
Class is starting.

10:04.570 --> 10:06.580
You can go on ahead, Yunyun.

10:06.580 --> 10:08.240
O-Okay.

10:12.060 --> 10:14.340
My conscience is bothering me a little...

10:14.340 --> 10:16.190
Yeah, I hear you.

10:17.980 --> 10:20.570
Then why ask for money in the first place?

10:21.210 --> 10:23.320
Megumin! How long have you been there?

10:23.320 --> 10:24.720
How much did you hear?

10:24.940 --> 10:27.820
Starting around where you extorted her 
to submit to your perverted demands

10:27.820 --> 10:30.980
in exchange for keeping 
her dangerous secrets.

10:30.980 --> 10:32.430
That's not what happened!

10:32.430 --> 10:36.840
Look, my brother is sick, 
and we can't afford his medicine...

10:36.840 --> 10:39.540
It's just a bit of fund-raising.

10:39.540 --> 10:43.140
Why not ask for my help, then?

10:43.740 --> 10:48.130
What? Are you that shocked at the 
idea I'd be willing to help others?

10:48.340 --> 10:52.900
It's just... y'know... 
you're super poor, right?

10:52.900 --> 10:55.750
Borrowing money from you 
is just a shade too far.

10:56.110 --> 10:57.530
You're dead!

10:58.410 --> 11:00.750
W-Well, then, do you have money to loan me?!

11:02.050 --> 11:05.390
Obviously I don't. Who in the world 
do you think you're talking to?

11:05.390 --> 11:07.250
This girl...

11:07.590 --> 11:10.040
It's just a matter of 
securing medication, yes?

11:10.040 --> 11:11.500
Do you have something in mind?

11:14.420 --> 11:18.280
A simple matter for the Crimson 
Demons' foremost prodigy!

11:20.900 --> 11:24.900
All right, time to begin magical 
item crafting class.

11:24.900 --> 11:28.580
You're free to improvise on the ingredients, 
but I want to see some potions.

11:36.340 --> 11:39.200
Behold my sorcerous craftsmanship!

11:44.050 --> 11:47.130
That looks interesting. I'd like to help.

11:47.350 --> 11:49.290
Did you finish already, Arue?

11:49.290 --> 11:50.530
I did.

11:50.530 --> 11:52.270
I'd appreciate the help, then.

12:00.240 --> 12:01.630
I won't let you!

12:01.630 --> 12:03.330
Would you get out of the way?

12:03.330 --> 12:05.670
But the duxion is so cute!

12:05.670 --> 12:08.520
Cute as it is, it's still a monster.

12:08.520 --> 12:12.500
Do you realize how many harmless-looking 
monsters are actually quite dangerous?

12:13.540 --> 12:15.610
I know, but...

12:16.040 --> 12:20.180
Calm down, now. All we really 
need is the onion on its back.

12:20.180 --> 12:22.250
Feeling better now?

12:23.300 --> 12:25.860
Onions are supposed to help with healing.

12:25.860 --> 12:30.230
And the onions from duxions are 
supposed to be of the finest quality.

12:35.430 --> 12:39.040
Honestly, what kind of 
monster do you think I am?

12:39.040 --> 12:41.960
Even I can appreciate the 
preciousness of cute life.

12:42.450 --> 12:45.220
I-I guess so. Sorry.

12:45.220 --> 12:50.920
It's just, duxions are rare monsters 
that offer a lot of experience...

12:50.920 --> 12:53.950
On top of being prized in gourmet cuisine.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.700
Megumin, you jerk!

13:07.440 --> 13:11.050
What do you want with us 
now, duxion slayer?

13:11.050 --> 13:14.050
Call me that again and you'll 
see just how much I can slay.

13:14.050 --> 13:18.320
Yunyun was sulking all day after 
what you pulled earlier.

13:18.320 --> 13:21.350
The two of you were the root cause 
of all this in the first place.

13:22.110 --> 13:24.680
A hand-made potion for treating illness.

13:26.140 --> 13:28.110
Go on, take it.

13:31.080 --> 13:34.700
This means you no longer need the 
money you borrowed from Yunyun, yes?

13:34.700 --> 13:38.090
H-Hang on a sec! There's no 
guarantee that this'll work...

13:38.090 --> 13:39.440
Doesn't matter.

13:39.440 --> 13:43.910
Frankly, I don't even care whether 
your little brother is sick or not.

13:43.910 --> 13:45.340
We weren't lying!

13:45.340 --> 13:49.740
The thing I take exception to is 
exploiting the conscience of a lonely girl

13:49.740 --> 13:51.720
who's desperate for friends.

13:52.290 --> 13:55.020
Her intelligence is second only to my own.

13:55.020 --> 13:57.090
She is fully aware of what you were doing.

13:58.040 --> 14:01.130
Don't get mad for real. You're scary.

14:01.130 --> 14:03.730
Here, you can have the money back.

14:06.640 --> 14:11.110
Please don't take advantage of her 
good nature and naiveté ever again.

14:11.110 --> 14:14.110
Wow, you must really like Yunyun.

14:14.700 --> 14:17.060
You seem to have misunderstood me.

14:17.060 --> 14:19.780
It's not like Yunyun and I are friends.

14:19.780 --> 14:21.720
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

14:21.720 --> 14:26.170
If you're that desperate not to be seen as 
friends, then what exactly is the deal?

14:26.960 --> 14:30.390
I'm not sure how to describe it. 
I suppose rivalry?

14:30.390 --> 14:34.860
Well, anyone else would think you 
two are pretty into each other.

14:34.860 --> 14:38.380
Megumin, your eyes are glowing again.

14:38.380 --> 14:42.810
Crimson Demons having a tell that shows 
our true feelings can be such a drag, huh?

14:43.400 --> 14:48.480
Look, we'll leave it at that for today, 
but don't get too big-headed, you hear?

14:51.280 --> 14:52.180
What?!

14:52.180 --> 14:55.650
Come on, that's a classic 
conversation-ender! Get a clue!

14:55.660 --> 14:57.410
<b>KONOSUBA - An Explosion on This Wonderful World!</b>

14:55.860 --> 14:57.170
Duxion!

15:06.610 --> 15:09.390
You left Inky all alone. Where did you go?

15:12.820 --> 15:14.210
Isn't this...

15:15.440 --> 15:19.400
Wait, that potion... 
Did you give it to them so—

15:19.400 --> 15:25.260
In what world would a pragmatist like 
myself engage in such philanthropy?

15:25.260 --> 15:28.520
That's a very convincing argument.

15:36.040 --> 15:39.820
Megumin, I was waiting for you! 
Don't leave without me.

15:41.670 --> 15:43.940
I'll treat you to something, 
to show my thanks.

15:50.330 --> 15:52.660
I-I know I said it was my treat...

15:52.660 --> 15:54.620
I realize that, but...

15:54.620 --> 15:56.400
Slide...

15:56.400 --> 15:58.230
I am called Torosuke!

15:58.230 --> 16:01.070
Foremost pancake chef among Crimson Demons,

16:01.070 --> 16:04.460
and he who would open a 
franchise with 500 locations!

16:04.460 --> 16:06.360
Now that is quite an appetite!

16:06.360 --> 16:09.860
It pleases me to see you enjoy it so much! 
A classy merçi to you, young lady!

16:09.860 --> 16:13.880
It's more that... I believe in getting 
your fill when the opportunity presents.

16:17.160 --> 16:19.500
Can we take a little break?

16:23.820 --> 16:27.620
One more skill-up potion, 
and I'll be ready to graduate.

16:27.620 --> 16:33.750
Huh? Megumin, I thought yesterday's potion left 
you with three points to go, the same as me...

16:33.750 --> 16:35.810
Wait, the duxion from this morning!

16:35.810 --> 16:40.360
With which I gained a level, 
and earned two skill points!

16:40.360 --> 16:42.610
A-Aw, no...

16:42.610 --> 16:45.530
I wanted us to graduate together.

16:45.530 --> 16:48.620
That's why I was trying to 
match your skill points...

16:49.870 --> 16:53.420
You were adjusting your points so 
that we could graduate together?

16:53.420 --> 16:56.660
Then you intentionally didn't 
score in the top three on the test?!

16:57.770 --> 17:00.140
How could you be so stupid?!

17:00.140 --> 17:02.020
If you wanted to graduate together,

17:02.020 --> 17:05.490
you could have just learned magic 
to use up the extra skill points!

17:05.490 --> 17:08.850
But you were so dead-set on 
learning advanced magic first,

17:08.850 --> 17:11.080
yet unable to just admit you 
wanted to graduate together!

17:11.080 --> 17:14.300
Just how awkward are you to 
even try something like this?!

17:14.300 --> 17:18.280
I-I mean, you're always so smug 
about being better than me,

17:18.280 --> 17:20.280
so if I were to pass you suddenly...

17:20.280 --> 17:22.150
Did you just suggest you've surpassed me?!

17:22.150 --> 17:24.620
You've done no such thing! At all!

17:24.620 --> 17:26.510
Let me make something quite clear:

17:26.510 --> 17:30.100
I have long since earned enough 
points to learn advanced magic!

17:30.100 --> 17:32.900
But I have no intention of doing that!

17:32.900 --> 17:36.870
I will be learning a far more 
powerful, surefire form of magic!

17:39.310 --> 17:44.090
Powerful, surefire magic? 
Are you talking about explosion magic?

17:44.090 --> 17:45.100
That's right.

17:45.100 --> 17:46.330
You were serious about that?

17:46.330 --> 17:47.550
And what if I was?

17:48.430 --> 17:50.620
You're calling me stupid?

17:50.620 --> 17:54.530
Even if you learn it, most people don't have 
enough magical power to actually cast it!

17:54.530 --> 17:58.110
And even when they can, the most they can 
manage is once a day! That's why it's joke magic!

17:58.110 --> 18:01.920
I know they say genius and madness are closely 
related, but are you really that crazy?!

18:01.920 --> 18:06.530
Any more insults, Yunyun, and don't 
expect the mercy I normally afford you.

18:06.530 --> 18:08.950
Believe me, I'm fully aware of the risks.

18:08.950 --> 18:12.620
I know more about explosion 
magic than anyone.

18:12.620 --> 18:14.280
And yet, I persist.

18:14.650 --> 18:15.870
But why?

18:16.130 --> 18:18.250
Because I love it, of course.

18:18.250 --> 18:21.360
I really do think you're crazy, 
and not a genius, Megumin.

18:21.360 --> 18:23.230
I warned you!

18:30.390 --> 18:33.870
I won! I beat Megumin for the first time!

18:33.870 --> 18:37.030
Well, I wasn't being serious, after all.

18:37.030 --> 18:39.390
And with the moon not being 
out, my power is weakened.

18:39.390 --> 18:43.400
You're not a literal demon! 
Just admit that you lost for once!

18:45.340 --> 18:48.900
Fine, I lose. Now, let me up.

18:52.800 --> 18:55.450
Still, given how stuffed I was,

18:55.450 --> 18:58.140
It's only natural I could only
use half of my full strength.

18:58.140 --> 19:00.660
No fair making excuses after I let you up!

19:03.220 --> 19:09.040
Come on... Are you really that obsessed with 
explosion magic just because you like it?

19:10.310 --> 19:12.710
Isn't there some other reason?

19:14.810 --> 19:19.960
If you must know, when I was younger, 
I was attacked by a magic beast.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.670
Rest, cloaked by the smoke of supremacy.

19:24.380 --> 19:26.310
Explosion!

19:26.310 --> 19:31.410
A mage who was passing by slew the beast...

19:31.410 --> 19:36.830
with explosion magic. And the destruction 
it caused... The overwhelming violence...

19:36.830 --> 19:40.490
The unassailable power...
It was absolutely breathtaking.

19:41.050 --> 19:44.150
Befitting of being known 
as the ultimate magic.

19:44.150 --> 19:48.830
Ever since that moment, I've had 
no interest in other magic.

19:49.550 --> 19:54.000
Once I learn it, I intend to seek 
that mage out and ask her...

19:54.650 --> 19:58.840
"What do you think of the 
explosion magic you taught me?"

20:02.450 --> 20:06.580
That being said, I'm sure you're glad to 
have won once before I leave on my journey.

20:07.190 --> 20:09.370
You're leaving once you graduate?

20:09.370 --> 20:10.080
Yes.

20:10.520 --> 20:14.090
Is there anyone you're going to travel with?

20:14.530 --> 20:17.850
Your magic power should be 
enough to use explosion magic,

20:17.850 --> 20:21.670
but you'd be helpless after using it. 
You need someone to look after you.

20:21.670 --> 20:24.600
One thing we have in common is that 
I obviously have no such help.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.470
Why do you sound so proud of that?

20:26.470 --> 20:29.540
And it's not like you're 
leaving right away, right?!

20:29.540 --> 20:32.300
Well, I can't leave my 
sister unaccounted for,

20:32.300 --> 20:34.770
so I'll be working around 
the village for a while.

20:34.770 --> 20:36.410
What about you, Yunyun?

20:37.520 --> 20:41.610
I'm going to be chief one day, so...

20:41.610 --> 20:44.720
I want to try and learn a lot of 
different things before then.

20:45.150 --> 20:50.050
I still need your help from time 
to time now, but one day...

20:56.200 --> 20:59.940
I want to be strong enough to help 
the helpless, like that duxion.

21:00.680 --> 21:03.190
Wait, why's there a duxion out here?

21:08.630 --> 21:11.460
"Megumin found tonight's dinner!"

21:13.430 --> 21:16.970
Megumin, you jerk!

21:27.140 --> 21:28.100
Megumin...

21:28.100 --> 21:31.170
Wasn't the Dark God supposed 
to have been resealed?

21:32.720 --> 21:34.330
Come with me, please!

21:53.500 --> 21:55.000
Komekko...

23:25.000 --> 23:40.010
<b>Next Episode Preview</b>

23:25.000 --> 23:40.010
<b>Episode 5: "Prelude to an Explosion of Madness"</b>

23:25.290 --> 23:26.850
Big trouble, Megumin!

23:26.850 --> 23:28.320
A swarm of monsters is after little Inky!

23:28.320 --> 23:29.870
She's done for. We have to leave her behind.

23:29.870 --> 23:30.760
Don't give up so fast!

23:30.760 --> 23:33.510
I'm more worried about Komekko! 
What's become of my sister?!

23:33.510 --> 23:36.430
Wait, I've got it! 
This entire mystery has been laid bare!

23:36.430 --> 23:38.900
Huh? N-Next time, we'll join your 
family meeting with an...

23:38.900 --> 23:40.010
Explosion!
