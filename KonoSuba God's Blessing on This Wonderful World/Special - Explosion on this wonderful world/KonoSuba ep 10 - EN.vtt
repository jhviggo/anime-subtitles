00:02.080 --> 00:03.550
This is a load of crap!

00:03.550 --> 00:06.770
How is someone from modern times 
supposed to sleep in a stable?!

00:06.770 --> 00:09.800
And you think this is what I wanted?!

00:09.800 --> 00:13.250
Well, we don't have any money, 
so we've got no options!

00:13.250 --> 00:17.640
Damn it all! This isn't the kind 
of life I wanted to live here!

00:17.640 --> 00:20.280
I should be saying that!

00:27.930 --> 00:29.960
Listen well, Yunyun.

00:29.960 --> 00:32.690
At times like these, the first 
impression is crucial.

00:32.690 --> 00:36.520
Given that we are newcomers, and 
young, we will be looked down upon.

00:36.520 --> 00:39.300
So when the door opens, we must 
declare ourselves in a grand fashion!

00:39.810 --> 00:42.380
Do we have to? It's gonna 
draw so much attention.

00:42.380 --> 00:44.420
We are doing it in order 
to attract attention!

00:44.420 --> 00:47.240
Crimson Demons cannot be 
the target of derision!

00:47.240 --> 00:48.740
Come, off we go!

00:49.730 --> 00:52.400
I hope we don't get mixed 
up with any scary people...

00:55.580 --> 00:57.120
I am called Megumin!

00:57.120 --> 00:59.780
Foremost spell caster among Crimson Demons,

00:59.780 --> 01:03.390
and wielder of... explosion...

01:06.870 --> 01:08.630
S-So embarrassing!

02:32.590 --> 02:39.470
<b>KONOSUBA - An Explosion on This Wonderful World!</b>

02:41.050 --> 02:44.970
<b>Episode 10:    Outlaws of the Town for Beginners</b>

02:41.570 --> 02:46.010
Apparently, there's a bulletin board at the 
Adventurer's Guild for soliciting party members.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.980
We should ask how to accept 
quests while we're at it.

02:49.980 --> 02:54.950
Good idea. We'll need to start by accepting 
quests to cover our daily necessities,

02:54.950 --> 02:58.660
and we need companions to do that.

02:59.020 --> 03:02.020
Oh! What brings you two by so early?

03:02.190 --> 03:03.820
H-Hello there.

03:03.820 --> 03:06.400
My name is Megumin, and I'm an arch wizard.

03:06.400 --> 03:10.430
So... this is my first time 
seeking work as an adventurer,

03:10.430 --> 03:12.410
and I'm not quite sure what to do.

03:12.410 --> 03:15.930
Oh, those eyes... 
You're Crimson Demons, aren't you?

03:15.930 --> 03:20.050
I believe you create your 
adventurer's card at school, right?

03:20.270 --> 03:24.120
I can explain how we use it 
over at the reception desk.

03:31.640 --> 03:35.570
Excuse me! Is it okay if I get 
the explanation a bit later?

03:36.610 --> 03:38.280
Well, I suppose that's fine...

03:38.280 --> 03:41.940
Wait, Megumin, you're not gonna hear her out?

03:41.940 --> 03:44.000
I'm gonna go ahead and hear about it now.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.110
Not a problem. I believe I'll wait 
until there are more people around.

03:53.550 --> 03:55.090
E-Excuse me...

03:59.530 --> 04:01.490
This should do nicely.

04:03.870 --> 04:05.840
Next person in line, please.

04:06.300 --> 04:08.900
Oh, it's the Crimson Demon from before.

04:08.900 --> 04:11.080
It's as you say. I am a Crimson Demon!

04:11.080 --> 04:14.280
Starting today, I will be 
operating in this town,

04:14.280 --> 04:16.480
so I have come for an explanation 
of the adventurer's card!

04:16.770 --> 04:18.040
A Crimson Demon?

04:18.040 --> 04:19.220
I've never seen one before.

04:19.580 --> 04:22.300
If you'll let me examine 
your card for a moment...

04:23.070 --> 04:24.770
O-Oh, my!

04:24.770 --> 04:27.790
This is remarkable! 
Crimson Demons live up to their reputation.

04:27.790 --> 04:29.870
Your intelligence and magic 
power stats are incredible!

04:31.140 --> 04:33.810
<i>Yes, this is what I was after!</i>

04:33.810 --> 04:37.640
<i>Now the adventurers of this town 
won't dare look down on me!</i>

04:37.640 --> 04:39.730
Not quite as much as the 
woman from yesterday,

04:39.730 --> 04:42.350
but your magic power is 
definitely remarkable.

04:42.350 --> 04:46.380
Here you go. The card is the genuine article, 
and there's no criminal record mentioned.

04:46.380 --> 04:49.720
You'll be able to accept work from now on.

04:49.720 --> 04:53.860
Wait, hang on. "Not as much 
as the woman from yesterday"?

04:53.860 --> 04:58.070
You're saying there's someone with 
even more magic power than me?!

04:58.070 --> 05:02.480
Yes. I helped her register as an adventurer...

05:02.480 --> 05:07.640
But her intelligence was too low 
to qualify for any mage classes.

05:07.640 --> 05:11.950
I believe she ended up as an arch priest.

05:12.550 --> 05:14.330
An arch priest...

05:16.210 --> 05:19.180
Hey. Haven't seen you around before.

05:20.510 --> 05:22.980
You looking for a crew?

05:23.960 --> 05:25.940
Indeed I am.

05:26.640 --> 05:29.880
You're gonna want to avoid those two, then.

05:29.880 --> 05:32.800
With them, all the luck in the 
world couldn't save your skin.

05:33.960 --> 05:36.070
He's right about that. Keep away from them.

05:36.070 --> 05:38.520
And one's an Axis cultist, of all things.

05:38.520 --> 05:41.840
She'd be pretty promising if every word 
out of her mouth wasn't so obnoxious.

05:41.840 --> 05:46.480
She's probably shouting that nonsense 
because she's an Axis cult priestess.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.480
Anyway, you wanna join our party?

05:48.480 --> 05:50.700
Whoa, hang on, no fair! I get to ask first!

05:50.700 --> 05:53.780
Our party has two members with advanced 
classes! What do you think?

05:53.790 --> 05:58.160
We've got advanced classes, too. 
She'd fit in great with us.

05:54.130 --> 05:59.370
Our old wizard suddenly switched 
classes, so we're kind of at a loss...

06:05.810 --> 06:08.670
My name's Ryze, and I'm a warrior!

06:08.670 --> 06:10.340
This is my little sister, Laina.

06:10.340 --> 06:12.300
I'm a thief. Nice to meet you.

06:12.300 --> 06:15.570
My name is Megumin. It's a pleasure.

06:16.130 --> 06:17.240
That's your real name?

06:17.240 --> 06:21.240
Indeed it is, and if you've got a 
problem with that, let's hear it.

06:21.520 --> 06:23.810
No! It's not a problem at all.

06:23.810 --> 06:26.330
Come to think of it, 
you <i>are</i> a Crimson Demon.

06:26.330 --> 06:29.000
R-Right. I think it's a lovely name.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.530
You're sure about wanting 
to join up with us?

06:31.530 --> 06:34.520
I would've thought you'd prefer a 
party with more advanced classes...

06:34.520 --> 06:37.500
The bigger the share of 
the rewards, the better.

06:37.500 --> 06:40.500
Don't worry! Consider yourselves in good hands.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.140
You sound pretty confident! That's reassuring.

06:43.140 --> 06:44.080
Yeah!

06:44.080 --> 06:47.400
I noticed there was a quest for 
exterminating chestnut rats posted.

06:47.400 --> 06:52.180
For now, let's go through a simple quest, 
and see how we work together as a party.

06:52.740 --> 06:55.410
Consider it a bit of a trial period!

06:59.430 --> 07:04.170
I'm almost out of money from paying 
off the chestnut trees I blew up...

07:29.280 --> 07:30.830
What do you think?

07:30.830 --> 07:33.050
Well, where do I begin?

07:33.050 --> 07:35.480
I don't think rookie adventurers like us

07:35.480 --> 07:39.010
could provide you with the kind of 
opportunities you deserve, Megumin!

07:39.010 --> 07:40.440
R-Right, exactly!

07:40.440 --> 07:43.130
You have this incredible explosion magic.

07:43.130 --> 07:47.010
You'd be wasting your 
potential in our party!

07:47.010 --> 07:49.420
I don't mind, really.

07:49.420 --> 07:52.020
We can all take our time growing together.

07:52.020 --> 07:55.540
No, we couldn't! Besides, 
we're only a duo, and just starting out.

07:55.540 --> 07:59.790
It was a presumptuous to try 
and recruit a Crimson Demon!

07:59.790 --> 08:03.460
Exactly! It's, like, a question of balance? 
We're just not on your level!

08:13.700 --> 08:15.760
How do you not know what a saury is?!

08:15.760 --> 08:17.790
What kind of life have you even lived?!

08:17.790 --> 08:21.910
All I asked was for you to grab two saury 
from the field behind the guild hall!

08:21.910 --> 08:23.290
Screw you, old timer!

08:23.290 --> 08:26.470
You think you can mess with me just 
because I'm a kid who's new in town?!

08:26.470 --> 08:29.850
Put a sock in it! And what the hell 
has your little buddy been doing?!

08:29.850 --> 08:31.610
Serving my customers that damned water!

08:31.610 --> 08:35.300
Where the hell is the booze I gave you?! 
Did you drink it all?! Is that it?!

08:35.300 --> 08:38.550
I-It's not like that! My fingers 
just happened to touch the liquor!

08:38.550 --> 08:40.480
I have a condition!

08:40.480 --> 08:42.550
The truth is, I'm the water goddess—

08:41.420 --> 08:44.250
I'll have Yunyun treat me to dinner.

08:42.550 --> 08:44.250
You're both fired!

08:50.410 --> 08:51.350
H-Hello!

08:51.350 --> 08:54.060
It's a pleasure to meet you. My name is Yunyun.

08:54.060 --> 08:58.170
I'm an arch wizard, but can only 
use intermediate magic so far...

09:00.620 --> 09:02.340
What kind of attitude is that?

09:02.340 --> 09:05.410
And here I thought I could 
do a favor for one of my kin,

09:05.410 --> 09:08.870
who was sulking by herself in the corner 
of a pub, by sharing a meal with her.

09:08.870 --> 09:11.940
Food? You want to eat with me?

09:12.290 --> 09:15.480
It's only been one day so far. A bit 
too early to start getting depressed.

09:16.100 --> 09:19.330
Ma'am! One salt-grilled saury dinner special!

09:19.330 --> 09:21.450
M-Make it two!

09:24.930 --> 09:25.910
Now, then...

09:26.410 --> 09:29.260
Let's try one of these today.

09:31.680 --> 09:33.920
<i>"Looking for party members.</i>

09:33.920 --> 09:37.280
<i>Wanted: kind people, people who 
will listen to boring stories,</i>

09:37.280 --> 09:39.360
<i>people who won't laugh at silly names,</i>

09:39.360 --> 09:41.600
<i>people who want to hang out 
even if there are no quests.</i>

09:41.600 --> 09:44.870
<i>Preferably close in age. 
All classes accepted.</i>

09:44.870 --> 09:46.740
<i>I am an arch wizard and—"</i>

09:54.370 --> 09:57.370
This is for Yunyun's own good.

09:58.060 --> 09:59.210
Now, then...

10:00.340 --> 10:03.430
"Searching for a blonde-haired, 
blue-eyed noble girl."

10:04.250 --> 10:06.590
That is quite the reward!

10:06.950 --> 10:09.800
Maybe I'll pursue it once I get 
closer to running out of money.

10:11.620 --> 10:13.630
This one is soliciting for...

10:13.630 --> 10:15.080
A spell caster!

10:18.150 --> 10:20.350
I see. So you're Megumin.

10:20.350 --> 10:22.610
That's a Crimson Demon 
name if I ever heard one.

10:22.610 --> 10:24.320
We're counting on you.

10:24.320 --> 10:25.850
It's a pleasure to join you.

10:25.850 --> 10:27.050
For now, let's—

10:26.450 --> 10:27.990
Just you wait, demon of the forest!

10:27.990 --> 10:30.520
I don't care what manner of 
shame is waiting for me.

10:30.810 --> 10:32.760
I am going to slay you!

10:32.760 --> 10:36.090
Come on, how many times do you plan on 
getting covered head to toe in goop?!

10:36.090 --> 10:40.020
In the name of the divine Eris, 
I am going to slaughter that demon!

10:40.020 --> 10:41.780
Oh, you're all sticky!

10:41.780 --> 10:43.830
Maybe you should get changed first? Come on!

10:42.440 --> 10:43.830
Don't mind me.

10:43.830 --> 10:45.170
Don't mind me—

10:43.830 --> 10:45.170
Come on! Please!

10:45.170 --> 10:48.630
Well, there's a feisty pair.

10:48.630 --> 10:52.720
Demonic monsters have been 
spotted in the area lately.

10:52.970 --> 10:55.090
We're supposed to be hunting 
one of them, but...

10:57.130 --> 11:01.410
Come on, we've got a Crimson Demon 
mage with us. We'll be fine.

11:01.410 --> 11:02.600
Indeed, you will!

11:02.930 --> 11:07.330
Demon or not, I'll defeat whatever 
it is in a single blow!

11:15.310 --> 11:17.270
Explosion!

11:34.990 --> 11:38.330
Damn, you Crimson Demons really earn 
your reputation! I'm impressed.

11:38.330 --> 11:42.220
You actually took out a slime, with all 
its magic resistance, in one shot.

11:42.220 --> 11:44.900
I dunno how to say this... 
I owe you an apology.

11:45.210 --> 11:49.850
I figured you were one of those mages 
that were all talk. I'm sorry.

11:51.040 --> 11:55.470
No, there's actually something 
I should come clean about.

11:55.470 --> 11:57.980
The apologies can wait until after that.

11:59.290 --> 12:03.490
The truth is, the explosion magic you saw 
earlier is the only spell I can cast.

12:03.490 --> 12:07.840
In other words, I can only use 
that spell, and only once a day.

12:07.840 --> 12:12.270
It's excellent for foes like the 
one from this afternoon, but...

12:12.270 --> 12:16.620
Does your party really contend with 
those kinds of threats every day?

12:17.030 --> 12:20.980
And you have... no other spells? 
Like intermediate magic?

12:20.980 --> 12:22.100
I do not.

12:22.460 --> 12:25.250
Well, even if you don't,

12:25.250 --> 12:30.270
we could help you level up, and then 
maybe learn some intermediate magic to—

12:30.270 --> 12:32.940
I have no intention of 
learning any skills that won't

12:32.940 --> 12:34.690
maximize the potency of my explosion magic.

12:37.390 --> 12:41.750
Sorry, but... you're gonna 
need to find another party.

12:44.890 --> 12:48.150
I thought I should've let 
them know early on...

12:48.150 --> 12:51.820
Could it be that I am not, 
in fact, a prodigy?

12:52.710 --> 12:54.260
Damn!

12:53.190 --> 12:56.720
How did she do that?! I've never 
seen a trick like that before!

12:56.720 --> 12:59.410
Hey, I want in on this! 
Gimme one of those bananas!

12:59.410 --> 13:00.570
Same here!

13:00.570 --> 13:01.430
I want some!

13:01.430 --> 13:03.090
Two bunches for me!

13:03.090 --> 13:04.920
Thank you so much!

13:04.920 --> 13:07.650
Hey, if this keeps up, we'll hit our quota easy!

13:07.650 --> 13:10.970
Come on, hand over those bananas that 
you hid. Let's make some money!

13:10.970 --> 13:14.970
What are you talking about? I made 
them disappear. They're gone.

13:14.970 --> 13:18.090
Come on, hand me some new 
bananas that we can sell!

13:18.090 --> 13:20.970
Are you freaking kidding me?! 
Stop spouting nonsense!

13:20.970 --> 13:22.070
Bananas, now—

13:22.930 --> 13:23.810
You're fired!

13:23.810 --> 13:25.660
Hang on a sec—

13:23.820 --> 13:26.460
Gimme my bananas back!

13:25.220 --> 13:27.150
You sure you didn't count them wrong?

13:27.150 --> 13:28.730
You'd better not have eaten them!

13:28.730 --> 13:29.700
We need this money!

13:29.700 --> 13:30.780
What did you say?!

13:30.780 --> 13:32.340
We're sleeping in the damned stables!

13:32.340 --> 13:33.270
I don't care!

13:33.270 --> 13:34.820
This is your fault, you useless goddess!

13:39.080 --> 13:42.710
Oh, welcome back, Megumin! 
I've got some bananas. Want any?

13:48.980 --> 13:52.470
So, how'd it go today? 
Did you find a nice party yet?

13:52.470 --> 13:55.730
No. We took on a quest together, but...

13:55.730 --> 14:01.100
They said that I was wasted on a party like 
theirs, and they declined me joining them.

14:01.100 --> 14:06.350
I see. Well, your magic is powerful, 
but only useful in certain situations.

14:06.560 --> 14:09.320
What about you, Yunyun? Any takers?

14:09.320 --> 14:11.360
You've been posting on 
the bulletin board, right?

14:11.590 --> 14:14.700
Someone did. But I'm not so sure...

14:14.700 --> 14:19.260
He was obviously about as old as my dad,

14:19.260 --> 14:21.380
but he said, "We're about 
the same age, aren't we?

14:21.380 --> 14:25.910
Leave it to me! I'll keep 
you safe, sweetheart."

14:26.230 --> 14:28.130
Your turn, Megumin.

14:28.130 --> 14:32.010
You turned him down, right? 
You had to have, yes?

14:32.010 --> 14:34.590
W-Well, yeah...

14:34.590 --> 14:39.040
But he was willing to chat 
with me and bought me lunch,

14:39.040 --> 14:40.930
and he seemed really nice.

14:40.930 --> 14:43.280
And he said he wanted 
to talk again sometime.

14:43.640 --> 14:45.620
And that's check.

14:45.620 --> 14:49.160
If I back off, her Swordmaster 
can charge in...

14:49.160 --> 14:52.400
But this piece is within 
her Archer's range, so...

14:53.280 --> 14:58.160
Do you think people are avoiding us 
because of how young we are?

14:58.160 --> 15:02.210
I haven't seen many mages around town,

15:02.510 --> 15:04.830
so there should be plenty of demand...

15:05.310 --> 15:07.840
No other options. Teleport!

15:09.350 --> 15:13.180
You underestimated me because the 
Adventurer is the weakest piece, didn't you?

15:13.180 --> 15:15.210
Well, this one is changing 
classes to Swordmaster!

15:15.210 --> 15:17.730
Looks like the game's just about over!

15:22.220 --> 15:23.800
Explosion!

15:24.980 --> 15:28.730
Come now, Yunyun, let's get to bed 
so we can be ready for another day!

15:28.730 --> 15:32.760
Hey! Don't sleep already! 
You didn't let me avenge my loss!

15:32.760 --> 15:36.500
Aw come on, no fair! 
Let's play again! Again!

15:33.310 --> 15:35.670
<i>Tomorrow, I </i>will<i> have my companions.</i>

15:41.290 --> 15:43.250
Explosion!

15:56.300 --> 16:02.180
<i>For this entire week, I've been joining and 
completing quests with assorted parties...</i>

16:02.810 --> 16:04.470
<i>And every time,</i>

16:04.470 --> 16:09.020
<i>once the job is done, they put me 
at arm's length and break our contact.</i>

16:09.560 --> 16:13.780
<i>It seems a mage who can only use 
explosion magic is of little use.</i>

16:14.220 --> 16:16.680
<i>They're acting like I'm not needed...</i>

16:17.170 --> 16:20.530
<i>Me... the child prodigy...</i>

16:21.570 --> 16:22.500
<i>Me...</i>

16:23.300 --> 16:26.370
They're treating <i>me</i> like that!

16:29.410 --> 16:32.170
You again?!

16:33.600 --> 16:37.600
My apologies. I'll be in need 
of your help again today.

16:40.600 --> 16:44.370
You get the amount of work it takes 
to fill these craters, right?

16:44.370 --> 16:49.320
Use that spell of yours further away from 
town next time, on a strong monster.

16:49.320 --> 16:53.080
After using my magic, I'm rendered 
immobile due to magic power depletion.

16:49.640 --> 16:52.950
Unbelievable! Why is a divine 
water goddess like me

16:52.950 --> 16:55.370
having to do infrastructure crap like this?!

16:53.080 --> 16:55.980
If I were unable to move 
while far away from town,

16:55.370 --> 16:57.040
It doesn't even have anything to do with water!

16:55.980 --> 16:59.310
I'd be devoured by a swarm 
of monsters in short order.

16:57.040 --> 16:58.870
Because we've run out of 
jobs that don't involve

16:58.870 --> 17:01.550
sweating our asses off under the 
glaring sun! Besides, it's easy!

16:59.310 --> 17:01.820
That's just how explosion magic works.

17:01.550 --> 17:04.510
I wanna do sales again! 
Let me try one more time!

17:01.820 --> 17:04.490
That magic of yours sure 
doesn't sound very convenient.

17:04.490 --> 17:07.710
Come to think of it, that poor 
shopkeeper could use it, too.

17:04.510 --> 17:06.840
I think I've got it figured out this time!

17:06.840 --> 17:09.270
Where is all this confidence coming from?!

17:07.710 --> 17:09.200
What poor shopkeeper?

17:09.200 --> 17:13.240
She runs a famous magic item shop in town.

17:09.270 --> 17:12.460
Quit whining already and get to work!

17:12.460 --> 17:14.770
It's time to surpass our physical limits!

17:13.240 --> 17:15.200
Used to be an adventurer.

17:14.770 --> 17:19.590
Ew! You're a shut-in NEET! 
Where is all this positivity coming from?!

17:15.200 --> 17:18.100
I heard she was a hell of a spell caster, 
with a hell of a rack to boot...

17:18.100 --> 17:20.570
But doesn't have a clue 
about running a business.

17:19.590 --> 17:20.580
I am not...

17:22.970 --> 17:25.600
Finally, a clue to her whereabouts.

17:31.850 --> 17:36.140
Well, if I were you, I'd scare up some 
companions before anything else.

17:38.470 --> 17:42.680
At least now... I know I can 
see her when I'm ready.

17:45.020 --> 17:51.580
But first, I need to sort myself out 
as a proper adventurer in this town!

18:05.640 --> 18:07.380
Down this goes...

18:08.440 --> 18:09.800
Excuse me.

18:09.800 --> 18:11.840
Y-Yes?! How can I help you?!

18:11.840 --> 18:15.930
I was hoping to get a look at 
the notice you just took down.

18:15.930 --> 18:16.920
I'd rather you didn't.

18:17.780 --> 18:18.880
Give it!

18:21.360 --> 18:24.810
"Spell caster classes wanted. 
No magic specification necessary."

18:24.810 --> 18:27.630
Well, this certainly is convenient!

18:27.630 --> 18:30.330
I just so happen to be a mage 
who's free at the moment...

18:30.330 --> 18:32.990
S-Sorry, the position's been filled!

18:32.990 --> 18:34.960
Just a few moments ago, actually...

18:34.960 --> 18:37.020
That's why I was taking it down—

18:37.840 --> 18:40.040
I've had enough of these excuses.

18:40.040 --> 18:42.990
What is this? Some sort of 
explosion magic prejudice?

18:42.990 --> 18:46.640
Has the entire guild decided to cancel me?

18:47.440 --> 18:49.370
What are you doing?! Quit it!

18:49.370 --> 18:52.680
What's all this about?! Settle down!

18:54.590 --> 18:58.690
Megumin, you can't be 
fighting in the guild hall!

18:58.690 --> 19:00.570
If you're going to fight, take it outside!

19:01.160 --> 19:02.730
Fine.

19:02.730 --> 19:04.700
I'm begging you!

19:04.700 --> 19:09.420
Even a date would be fine... just 
for an hour! Even thirty minutes!

19:09.420 --> 19:12.420
But that's not really what I'm here for...

19:12.420 --> 19:15.910
Please! Please! Please! Please!

19:15.910 --> 19:19.420
You're the only one I can turn to, Yunyun!

19:20.620 --> 19:24.800
I-In that case... I guess just 
a little while would be fine...

19:24.800 --> 19:26.310
Really?!

19:28.420 --> 19:30.040
Like hell it would!

19:31.350 --> 19:33.700
What in the world are you doing?!

19:33.700 --> 19:37.610
B-But he said he needs money, and a 
fake girlfriend, for his sick mom...

19:37.610 --> 19:39.980
Those are obviously total lies!

19:39.980 --> 19:42.290
Just how easily duped can one girl be?

19:42.290 --> 19:47.620
What else?! Have any other weirdos made 
bizarre requests of you while I was gone?

19:47.620 --> 19:50.380
N-Nothing bizarre, no.

19:50.380 --> 19:53.710
But the old man who's 
always day drinking here

19:53.710 --> 19:59.050
asked me to start calling him "Daddy," 
and offered me some allowance money...

19:59.050 --> 20:00.370
And you took it?!

20:00.370 --> 20:05.390
No. I actually gave him some of mine, 
since he seemed to be down on his luck...

20:05.390 --> 20:07.170
You gave him money?!

20:07.170 --> 20:09.300
Wh-What else could I have done?

20:09.300 --> 20:12.380
He's drinking here by himself every single day!

20:12.380 --> 20:16.400
When he talked to me, he said he was 
gathering alms for the Axis sect...

20:16.730 --> 20:20.730
Why do you even have that?! 
Throw it away right now!

20:22.430 --> 20:24.030
Unbelievable!

20:24.030 --> 20:27.150
I tried leaving you be, hoping it'd help 
you grow out of your awkwardness,

20:27.150 --> 20:31.710
but it's gotten so much worse, you're 
approaching a dangerous threshold!

20:32.120 --> 20:34.520
Then again, there's my own lack of funds

20:34.520 --> 20:37.630
and difficulty in finding 
adventuring companions...

20:38.920 --> 20:40.170
I've got it!

20:40.670 --> 20:45.090
What do you say? Until we 
each find new party members,

20:45.090 --> 20:48.100
we could temporarily form a party.

20:49.930 --> 20:51.950
What?!

20:51.950 --> 20:54.880
I only offered to form a party.

20:54.880 --> 20:56.950
Why are you so shocked?

20:57.610 --> 20:59.640
S-Say, Megumin...

20:59.640 --> 21:03.970
Do you remember what I told 
you the other day? Y'know...

21:03.970 --> 21:08.570
About us settling things once 
I've learned advanced magic?

21:08.570 --> 21:13.900
Oh, when you were mumbling in 
the coach after I beat Arnes?

21:13.900 --> 21:15.050
What of it?

21:15.050 --> 21:17.250
"What of it"?

21:17.570 --> 21:20.420
How could you?!

21:20.800 --> 21:24.030
Did that promise seriously 
just slip off your brain?!

21:24.030 --> 21:28.230
Is your memory shot?! Have the shock waves 
from explosion magic ruined your brain?!

21:28.230 --> 21:30.920
I have no idea what you're talking about!

21:30.920 --> 21:33.970
Let's take on some quests and earn money,

21:33.970 --> 21:35.990
or we won't even be able 
to afford lodging tonight!

21:38.050 --> 21:42.160
W-Wait, are we about to 
be stuck in the stables?

21:43.850 --> 21:48.490
Megumin! Yunyun! 
I can't have you fighting in here!

21:50.300 --> 21:52.010
Miss...

21:52.510 --> 21:54.340
We need work!

<b>Episode 11: "The Explosion Girl and the Forest Irregularity"</b>

23:25.350 --> 23:26.890
Big trouble, Megumin!

23:26.890 --> 23:29.210
This is a town full of beginners, 
but a serious threat just appeared!

23:29.210 --> 23:31.500
A striking performance here will have 
people begging us to join them!

23:31.500 --> 23:34.080
It's time to make everyone who cast 
me aside regret their foolishness!

23:34.080 --> 23:36.540
But this demon is supposed 
to be really, really strong!

23:36.540 --> 23:38.640
N-Next time, we'll light up your 
need for validation with an...

23:38.640 --> 23:40.640
Explosion!
