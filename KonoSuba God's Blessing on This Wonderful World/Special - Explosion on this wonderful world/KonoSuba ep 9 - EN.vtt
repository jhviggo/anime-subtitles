00:14.370 --> 00:16.280
Things sure are peaceful.

00:16.280 --> 00:18.320
When you see scenery like this,

00:18.320 --> 00:21.860
it's hard to believe the Devil King's army 
is causing trouble in the capital.

00:23.550 --> 00:29.410
If things proceed with no trouble, we should 
be in Axel in time for lunch tomorrow.

00:29.410 --> 00:33.040
I know they taught you not to say stuff 
that sets flags like that at school!

00:33.040 --> 00:35.290
It was even in a collection 
of phrases to avoid!

00:35.290 --> 00:36.790
I wouldn't worry.

00:36.790 --> 00:42.290
By my calculations, we have less than a
0.1% chance of being attacked by monsters.

00:42.290 --> 00:44.050
I just told you to stop!

00:44.050 --> 00:46.130
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

00:46.130 --> 00:50.040
I honestly don't think there's 
anything to worry about.

00:50.040 --> 00:53.450
Most monsters wouldn't dare 
attack a group this large.

00:53.800 --> 00:56.570
I-I guess you're right.

02:23.580 --> 02:30.460
<b>KONOSUBA - An Explosion on This Wonderful World!</b>

02:32.040 --> 02:36.300
<b>Episode 9: Destroyer from the Crimson Demon Village</b>

02:34.930 --> 02:38.500
Hey, Megumin, let me sit by the window, too.

02:38.500 --> 02:42.580
You are so excited. 
That's rather childish, Yunyun.

02:42.580 --> 02:47.550
But we agreed to swap spots every 
hour, and you haven't budged once!

02:47.550 --> 02:51.060
I've only experienced about 
ten minutes of time passing.

02:51.060 --> 02:52.280
What sense does that make?!

02:52.280 --> 02:56.570
Wow! A bunch of Lizard Runners are 
fighting over a female by racing!

02:56.570 --> 02:58.420
Let's see which one comes out on top!

02:57.730 --> 02:59.400
Come on, switch with me!

02:59.400 --> 03:04.880
Come on, come on, come on, come on, 
switch, please! I wanna see, too!

03:02.660 --> 03:05.330
Would you please control yourself?!

03:04.880 --> 03:07.620
Miss, would you like to switch seats with me?

03:11.670 --> 03:14.420
<b>KONOSUBA - An Explosion on This Wonderful World!</b>

03:17.030 --> 03:19.130
Are you two headed for Axel?

03:19.130 --> 03:20.770
Y-Yes.

03:20.770 --> 03:25.390
If that's where you're going, I take 
it you both want to be adventurers?

03:25.710 --> 03:27.100
Yes, I do.

03:28.310 --> 03:31.480
Wait, Yunyun, are you planning 
on becoming an adventurer?

03:31.480 --> 03:33.280
You mentioned training before...

03:33.760 --> 03:37.730
I-I guess so? That's probably 
the way to go about it...

03:37.730 --> 03:40.320
First thing will be finding 
companions, then.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.990
That's a must for us.

03:43.030 --> 03:46.670
I-I-It can be kind of inconvenient 
on your own, yeah.

03:47.110 --> 03:49.570
S-So, Megumin...

03:49.570 --> 03:51.420
W-Would...

03:51.420 --> 03:56.240
Having two spell casters in the same 
party is a bit unbalanced, though.

03:56.710 --> 03:59.420
R-Right? It wouldn't be balanced!

03:59.420 --> 04:03.100
Here's hoping we can both find good parties.

04:03.100 --> 04:07.120
Y-Yeah! Here's hoping! That'd be nice.

04:08.700 --> 04:11.100
You girls seem like such good friends.

04:11.100 --> 04:12.880
We've just been stuck together, that's all.

04:13.590 --> 04:16.830
Those red eyes... 
Are you two Crimson Demons?

04:16.830 --> 04:20.000
I wouldn't worry. You'll have 
your pick of the crowd in Axel.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.350
Crimson Demons?

04:21.350 --> 04:25.620
They have a lot of magic power, 
and use really amazing magic!

04:25.620 --> 04:27.530
Wow, you're amazing?

04:27.840 --> 04:29.230
Indeed!

04:29.230 --> 04:33.540
I, in particular, am an arch wizard known as 
the foremost prodigy among the Crimson Demons!

04:33.870 --> 04:39.050
Even if we come under monster attack, 
you can consider yourselves in good hands!

04:42.150 --> 04:45.200
Seriously... I keep asking you not to set—

04:48.500 --> 04:50.740
We've got monsters!

04:50.740 --> 04:52.280
What did I tell you?!

04:52.280 --> 04:54.310
I asked you not to set flags like that!

04:54.310 --> 04:56.770
Th-This is not my fault!

04:56.770 --> 04:58.070
Sorry to bother you!

04:58.360 --> 05:00.520
You girls are Crimson Demons, right?

05:00.520 --> 05:01.860
We could use your help!

05:02.980 --> 05:04.990
There are lot of monsters out here.

05:04.990 --> 05:07.250
We could use help from some 
Crimson Demon masters!

05:07.250 --> 05:08.360
"Master"?!

05:09.480 --> 05:12.870
Very well! I'll make quick 
work of these monsters!

05:12.870 --> 05:15.280
Wha—Why are you suddenly so fired up?!

05:15.280 --> 05:19.280
He called us masters! It makes 
us sound like expert bodyguards!

05:19.280 --> 05:21.190
All right, masters, we're counting on you!

05:21.190 --> 05:24.660
There's a whole bunch of them, but they 
should be a cinch for masters like you!

05:24.660 --> 05:28.650
We're fighting for the dignity 
of the Crimson Demons.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.350
Come, let the battle be joined!

05:35.280 --> 05:39.240
I am called Megumin! Let all who wish 
to be reduced to a crater step—

05:47.560 --> 05:50.250
That's a giant earthworm, a weak monster!

05:50.250 --> 05:54.050
Its attacks are weak, but it's 
resilient and hard to kill.

05:54.050 --> 05:55.740
As long as you don't get swallowed whole—

05:59.960 --> 06:04.070
Nightfall that foretells the final 
twilight of all creation...

06:04.070 --> 06:07.160
Let the imprisonment of annihilation—

06:05.710 --> 06:07.160
H-Hang on!

06:07.160 --> 06:09.680
I get how you feel, I really do,

06:09.680 --> 06:11.220
but you'll hit everyone else, too!

06:11.220 --> 06:14.720
Please, let me go! Let me 
obliterate these freaky things!

06:14.720 --> 06:17.360
It's looking right at us! 
It's heading this way!

06:17.360 --> 06:20.140
I-I-I'll figure something out!

06:19.300 --> 06:21.370
It's coming right for us!

06:21.370 --> 06:23.180
Fireball!

06:26.180 --> 06:28.570
With a single attack? Damn!

06:29.870 --> 06:31.670
This should be easy!

06:31.670 --> 06:35.150
There are lots more left, 
so we're counting on you!

06:42.670 --> 06:48.840
M-M-M-Monsters like this are no match 
for a sorcerer of my caliber!

06:48.840 --> 06:50.600
Guess I'll go protect the coach...

06:52.300 --> 06:55.300
Can't a sorcerer of your caliber 
do something about this?!

06:55.300 --> 06:57.030
Ew! There are so many!

06:57.030 --> 07:01.220
Come on, Megumin! 
Please, Megumin! Don't leave—

07:10.060 --> 07:12.700
Now that was a performance 
worthy of a Crimson Demon.

07:12.700 --> 07:14.020
Tell me about it.

07:14.020 --> 07:15.960
N-No, it wasn't anything special...

07:15.960 --> 07:19.420
You've been a genuine 
lifesaver, Miss Yunyun.

07:19.420 --> 07:22.700
I'd love to thank you once we reach Axel.

07:22.700 --> 07:25.010
I-I didn't do that much...

07:25.960 --> 07:30.760
Here you go, Master! Eat plenty 
and recover your magic power!

07:30.760 --> 07:33.260
Th-Thank you very much.

07:33.260 --> 07:36.930
I gotta say, your magic was 
really something, Yunyun!

07:36.930 --> 07:40.020
Maybe you should start calling 
yourself the foremost spell caster

07:40.020 --> 07:42.170
among the Crimson Demons!

07:45.190 --> 07:48.940
Are you okay, miss? Were you hurt?

07:48.940 --> 07:50.320
Oh, no.

07:50.570 --> 07:55.200
Hey, you're actually stronger 
than the ribbon lady, right?

07:55.510 --> 07:56.700
That's right.

07:56.700 --> 08:00.790
Then we'll be okay even if more, 
stronger monsters show up!

08:00.790 --> 08:05.160
Indeed! If that happens, I'll show 
you magic that guarantees victory!

08:05.900 --> 08:07.740
I can't wait to see that!

08:23.090 --> 08:24.930
What are you doing?

08:25.630 --> 08:26.850
Megumin.

08:26.850 --> 08:29.120
I'm... helping keep watch.

08:29.120 --> 08:30.240
Is that right?

08:33.490 --> 08:37.400
Hey, I did a pretty good job today, right?

08:38.770 --> 08:42.290
Are you mocking my complete 
lack of contribution?

08:42.290 --> 08:44.280
N-No!

08:44.280 --> 08:49.040
It's just, y'know, I didn't stand 
out much in the village, right?

08:49.270 --> 08:55.000
Correct. I often wondered if you were 
using a Lurk skill, to be honest.

08:55.580 --> 08:57.520
You are just...

08:57.520 --> 09:04.480
Well, my point is, after helping out today 
and having people rely on me...

09:04.850 --> 09:07.410
I feel a little more confident.

09:14.290 --> 09:18.570
I wanted to wait until I learned 
advanced magic before asking, but...

09:19.030 --> 09:23.790
Hey, Megumin, if you don't 
mind... would you...

09:24.340 --> 09:28.250
like to join me in a—

09:33.030 --> 09:36.130
Well, she sure was carried away with ease.

09:36.130 --> 09:37.830
Do you think it'd work in a dating context?

09:37.830 --> 09:39.230
Obviously not!

09:39.910 --> 09:42.990
Giant Bats! It's a whole 
colony of Giant Bats!

09:43.720 --> 09:45.730
<b>KONOSUBA - An Explosion on This Wonderful World!</b>

09:49.340 --> 09:51.310
That was a close one.

09:51.890 --> 09:56.060
M-Magic power... No more magic power...

09:58.680 --> 09:59.960
Well done.

10:00.250 --> 10:02.400
You certainly stole the show, didn't you?

10:02.400 --> 10:05.400
Could you... help out... a little?

10:05.730 --> 10:10.540
You've saved us all again, Miss Yunyun!

10:10.540 --> 10:14.430
If you're going to Axel, that means 
you're looking for a party, right?

10:14.430 --> 10:17.210
Would you care to join ours?

10:17.210 --> 10:18.870
H-Huh?

10:18.870 --> 10:21.990
Looks like your party problem 
has already been solved.

10:21.990 --> 10:23.220
Good for you.

10:23.220 --> 10:26.090
B-But I...

10:26.090 --> 10:28.720
What was the other Crimson Demon girl doing?

10:29.220 --> 10:32.530
She was just loafing around 
this afternoon, too...

10:29.620 --> 10:35.010
Since we're both Crimson Demons... 
And we know each other pretty well...

10:32.530 --> 10:35.600
I'm sure she was just 
protecting the carriages.

10:35.600 --> 10:38.110
But don't you think she would've 
fired off at least one spell?

10:36.020 --> 10:38.990
Plus, you're gonna be all 
alone at this rate...

10:39.500 --> 10:41.910
If you don't mind, Megumin,

10:41.910 --> 10:44.860
I wouldn't have any problems with 
us being in the same party...

10:44.860 --> 10:45.910
I'm going to bed now.

10:46.370 --> 10:48.570
Would you just listen to me?!

10:48.570 --> 10:51.210
Megumin!

11:01.790 --> 11:03.570
Such bad manners.

11:03.570 --> 11:07.850
I don't have all my magic power back 
yet... What do you want from me?

11:07.850 --> 11:11.000
Some more monsters attacked 
last night, right?

11:11.000 --> 11:12.870
Did you fight, too?

11:12.870 --> 11:16.230
I'm something of a weapon 
of last resort, you see.

11:16.230 --> 11:19.700
I'll be up once a real threat appears!

11:19.700 --> 11:23.590
Which is why I had my underling 
clear out the weaklings last night.

11:23.590 --> 11:25.070
I'm not your underling!

11:25.380 --> 11:29.720
But I'm pretty certain there won't 
be further monster attacks.

11:29.720 --> 11:33.840
Why, I'd wager we're more likely to see 
jelly slime rain from the sky first.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.340
Seriously, cut it out.

11:35.340 --> 11:37.960
Haven't you ever heard "If it happens 
twice, it can happen a third time"?

11:39.170 --> 11:41.670
Ever the worrywart, Yunyun.

11:43.520 --> 11:45.850
G-Goblins! It's a gaggle of goblins!

11:45.850 --> 11:46.770
Let the master know!

11:46.770 --> 11:48.090
Get her, quickly!

11:48.090 --> 11:49.800
You're up, master!

11:49.800 --> 11:52.910
Master! Master! Master!

11:52.890 --> 11:55.900
<b>KONOSUBA - An Explosion on This Wonderful World!</b>

11:53.800 --> 11:55.390
Here we go...

12:03.100 --> 12:07.030
N-No more... I seriously can't keep this up...

12:08.240 --> 12:11.820
A force like this stood little 
chance against us Crimson Demons.

12:11.820 --> 12:16.550
Don't try to sum it up like you helped! 
Not when I'm totally exhausted!

12:17.230 --> 12:21.930
So many attacks in such 
a short period of time...

12:21.930 --> 12:25.580
Still, we're nearly to 
our destination, Axel.

12:25.580 --> 12:28.330
We should be able to relax from here on out.

12:28.330 --> 12:30.950
When you say stuff like that...

12:30.950 --> 12:33.730
Cursed Lightning!

12:36.640 --> 12:38.270
Wh-What was that?!

12:41.300 --> 12:43.850
You seem awfully tired.

12:44.700 --> 12:49.210
This time, Lady Wolbach is coming with me!

12:52.540 --> 12:53.730
Arnes!

12:53.730 --> 12:55.400
Obstinate to a fault.

12:55.400 --> 12:59.670
This cat's name is Chomusuke, and it's mine. 
Why not just give up already?

12:59.670 --> 13:01.940
You're the only one who 
should give anything up.

13:01.940 --> 13:04.880
And since we've already made an exchange,

13:04.880 --> 13:08.420
if you refuse to return Lady Wolbach, 
you should give my money back.

13:08.420 --> 13:11.840
I-I-I-I will not be extorted 
by the likes of you!

13:11.840 --> 13:15.450
The Axis sect taught me that it's totally 
fine to ignore and otherwise break

13:15.450 --> 13:17.320
any kind of bargains involving demons!

13:18.490 --> 13:21.080
That was low, even for you.

13:21.080 --> 13:24.540
This is why humans can't be trusted.

13:24.540 --> 13:29.830
There used to be a service where we 
would exchange services for souls,

13:30.090 --> 13:32.940
but you people would always come 
up with some ridiculous excuse

13:32.940 --> 13:36.140
to get out of paying after 
your wish was granted...

13:36.140 --> 13:38.870
Or you would ask for something 
ridiculous in the first place.

13:39.330 --> 13:42.440
Humans should live more honest lives!

13:44.100 --> 13:47.160
Didn't expect a demon to 
take the moral high ground.

13:47.160 --> 13:50.510
Honestly, the money wouldn't 
make a difference.

13:50.840 --> 13:55.840
I have a mission that means I must take Lady 
Wolbach back, by any means necessary.

13:59.010 --> 14:00.680
Say your prayers.

14:00.940 --> 14:02.150
Surround her!

14:06.850 --> 14:07.960
Stand aside.

14:11.730 --> 14:13.750
I have no use for you pests.

14:15.270 --> 14:18.400
I-I won't let you hurt them!

14:18.700 --> 14:21.320
Spare me the transparent bravado.

14:21.320 --> 14:24.580
I've already confirmed your 
magic power is spent.

14:25.460 --> 14:29.340
Then those giant worms, 
and all the other monsters...

14:29.340 --> 14:31.370
You noticed?

14:31.370 --> 14:34.140
Yes, those were just my 
way of paying you back!

14:34.140 --> 14:38.510
Damn you! People thought I was 
useless because of that!

14:41.150 --> 14:44.260
Yes, that's what I've been wanting to see!

14:44.260 --> 14:48.400
After the humiliation 
you've put me through...

14:48.400 --> 14:51.370
It's time to finally settle the score!

14:51.370 --> 14:53.460
That's one thing we agree on!

14:53.460 --> 14:56.000
And now you're going to taste my fury!

14:56.330 --> 14:57.720
How, exactly?

14:57.720 --> 15:00.120
You're a runt who can't even use magic.

15:01.320 --> 15:05.530
A little more clever than 
most, but that's all.

15:05.530 --> 15:08.570
A runt—no, less than that. You're useless!

15:08.570 --> 15:10.260
A Crimson Demon in name only!

15:11.070 --> 15:15.770
Megumin isn't useless! 
She's way more amazing than me!

15:15.770 --> 15:17.150
Sh-She'll defeat you!

15:17.870 --> 15:20.520
The useful one is out of magic power,

15:20.520 --> 15:23.620
and I don't sense any useless 
men that can darken my day.

15:23.620 --> 15:27.890
There is no chance at all of a Crimson 
Demon-in-name-only having a chance

15:27.890 --> 15:29.260
against me at my best—

15:29.260 --> 15:30.480
I wouldn't say that.

15:31.080 --> 15:35.440
Saying things like "There's no way 
I can lose" sets a flag, apparently.

15:35.440 --> 15:38.590
A clichéd one spouted by only the 
most pitiful weaklings, at that.

15:39.490 --> 15:40.970
Where's this bluster come from?

15:40.970 --> 15:44.740
You think I'm all talk? 
Then I'll have to show you otherwise!

15:46.130 --> 15:50.060
You need Chomusuke no matter what, right?

15:50.060 --> 15:52.130
Well, if you want her so bad...

15:58.140 --> 16:01.680
Go get her!

16:05.900 --> 16:08.400
What is wrong with you?!

16:06.350 --> 16:08.400
Lady Wolbach!

16:15.030 --> 16:17.420
Light of dawn that pierces the gray.

16:18.030 --> 16:20.360
Breath of giants that sweeps the wilderness.

16:20.660 --> 16:24.320
In accordance with my pact, 
let the crimson sinner—

16:23.230 --> 16:26.140
Don't! Stop!

16:26.140 --> 16:30.000
Get off me! You're keeping me from 
blowing away that chunky demon!

16:30.000 --> 16:32.380
No! You're gonna blow Chomusuke away, too!

16:32.380 --> 16:34.930
She's my familiar!

16:34.930 --> 16:37.730
It's natural that she be 
sacrificed to save her master!

16:37.730 --> 16:38.880
We can make a grave later—

16:38.880 --> 16:43.390
I am not letting go! Never! 
Megumin, you monster!

16:46.180 --> 16:50.300
O my dark goddess, 
mistress of sloth and violence...

16:50.300 --> 16:52.730
From beyond the seven doors of the abyss,

16:52.730 --> 16:56.790
grant me the power to sink the sky!

17:02.630 --> 17:03.510
Huh?

17:03.930 --> 17:05.380
That bracelet...

17:07.260 --> 17:10.160
That's one of my father's!

17:10.160 --> 17:13.160
Thank you for your purchase!

17:22.550 --> 17:23.730
Is it this?

17:23.730 --> 17:25.940
Is it because of this thing?!

17:25.940 --> 17:29.650
Thanks for your purchase!

17:30.240 --> 17:32.060
You wretch...

17:33.300 --> 17:37.000
You're <i>their</i> daughter?!

17:40.410 --> 17:43.350
You stupid, stupid, stupid Megumin!

17:43.350 --> 17:44.590
You made it even worse!

17:44.590 --> 17:47.910
I-I'm just trying to be a 
grateful Crimson Demon!

17:47.910 --> 17:49.930
I will never let you escape!

17:49.930 --> 17:52.560
I'll see your soul reduced to cinders!

17:52.560 --> 17:55.250
There's nothing we can do about that!

17:57.090 --> 18:00.420
Oh god, or gods! Goddess of luck, Eris!

18:01.200 --> 18:04.270
You're a Crimson Demon! 
Pray to a destroyer god or something!

18:04.770 --> 18:09.860
Cowardly and repugnant humans! 
You will pay for your sins!

18:09.860 --> 18:12.580
Gods, if we can all survive this,

18:12.580 --> 18:15.900
I swear I'll find a way to teach Megumin 
how to act like a human being!

18:15.900 --> 18:16.630
I'm begging you—

18:16.630 --> 18:20.710
Cut that out! The world isn't convenient 
enough for that kind of last-minute nonsense!

18:20.710 --> 18:22.930
Please! Please, save us!

18:22.930 --> 18:26.130
The nameless evil god sealed in 
the village! Destroyer gods!

18:26.130 --> 18:28.240
And divine Eris!

18:28.240 --> 18:32.240
Even the goddess of water, Aqua!

18:43.070 --> 18:45.930
Wh-What is this incredible magic power?

18:45.930 --> 18:48.780
No... it's a divine aura.

18:52.270 --> 18:56.600
So much divinity... I-It couldn't be...

18:56.600 --> 18:58.650
I-Impossible!

19:00.020 --> 19:00.850
Ow.

19:16.660 --> 19:18.090
Wh-What?

19:18.650 --> 19:19.970
That's...

19:21.080 --> 19:23.890
The greatest and most 
powerful spell of all...

19:23.890 --> 19:25.690
Explosion magic.

19:26.960 --> 19:31.340
Well, I should apologize for 
saying you're all talk.

19:31.740 --> 19:34.930
Why don't you tell me your name, young lady?

19:34.930 --> 19:36.810
I am called Megumin!

19:36.810 --> 19:40.820
The foremost prodigy and spell caster 
among Crimson Demons,

19:40.820 --> 19:43.460
wielder of explosion magic!

19:44.020 --> 19:45.500
I see.

19:45.500 --> 19:48.200
You really are an oddball, aren't you?!

19:48.200 --> 19:51.390
Cursed Lightning!

19:52.490 --> 19:54.860
Explosion!

20:23.610 --> 20:27.330
This hell ends now, Arnes!

20:34.950 --> 20:38.450
<i>Forgive me, my mistress.</i>

20:39.090 --> 20:43.600
<i>But I know you will be restored one day.</i>

21:10.860 --> 21:13.880
M-Megumin!

21:23.330 --> 21:26.260
Now that was quite the display!

21:26.260 --> 21:33.010
Yes, I was certain all along that you 
were a master magus, Miss Megumin!

21:33.340 --> 21:39.770
Oh, of course. I truly am the foremost 
Crimson Demon spell caster.

21:39.770 --> 21:44.530
You really are amazing, 
lady! That was so cool!

21:46.100 --> 21:49.730
Thank you for saving my 
mom and everyone else!

21:52.130 --> 21:53.100
Sure.

21:56.860 --> 22:00.540
What is it? Why are you staring?

22:01.130 --> 22:03.790
You really are impressive, Megumin.

22:04.320 --> 22:05.920
What brought that on?

22:06.260 --> 22:10.460
Because it's true. 
Beating a demon like that...

22:12.470 --> 22:15.470
It should be obvious that I'm impressive.

22:16.910 --> 22:22.660
Y'know, I think you should forget 
about that stuff I said last night.

22:23.020 --> 22:23.850
What?

22:23.850 --> 22:29.310
D-Don't get me wrong! It's not that 
I don't want to be in the same party!

22:29.310 --> 22:30.930
It's just that...

22:31.380 --> 22:36.050
I feel like I'm just gonna be 
in your way at this rate.

22:36.560 --> 22:37.610
Which is why...

22:38.750 --> 22:45.080
I'm going to train a lot, and once I learn 
advanced magic, then we can settle things!

22:45.480 --> 22:46.710
And then...

22:47.240 --> 22:48.570
That's fine by me.

22:50.320 --> 22:52.960
Granted, no amount of training

22:52.960 --> 22:56.560
will result in anything other than 
you crying tears of frustration.

22:56.560 --> 22:57.930
Keep talking!

22:57.930 --> 23:02.240
I'm gonna get so strong, 
you'll be asking for my help!

23:04.820 --> 23:07.740
There it is, folks!

23:11.830 --> 23:14.990
This is where it starts for us.

23:16.110 --> 23:19.590
The town for beginner adventurers, Axel!

23:25.650 --> 23:27.430
Big trouble, Megumin...

23:27.430 --> 23:29.200
Finding companions is seriously big trouble.

23:29.200 --> 23:31.940
It seems making your debut as an adventurer 
is more complicated than I imagined.

23:31.940 --> 23:34.120
How is having powerful magic a problem?!

23:34.120 --> 23:35.190
Usability, for one thing.

23:35.800 --> 23:38.550
N-Next time, we'll hit your ennui with an...

23:38.550 --> 23:40.080
Explosion!
