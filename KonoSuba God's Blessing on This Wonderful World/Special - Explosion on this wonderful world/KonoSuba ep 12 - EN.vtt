WEBVTT

00:00.840 --> 00:05.080
And with that being the case, the demon 
in question defeated all three of them.

00:08.370 --> 00:11.360
What now?!

00:11.360 --> 00:13.040
What are we gonna do?!

00:13.640 --> 00:14.980
Crap... Oh, crap!

00:15.600 --> 00:17.180
Our best option would then be...

00:21.750 --> 00:25.550
I am not letting you hand Chomusuke over! 
That is off the table!

00:25.550 --> 00:28.540
I'm way too attached to her at this point!

00:29.940 --> 00:33.340
I never said a word about 
agreeing to the deal.

00:34.230 --> 00:39.040
Do I really seem the type to 
acquiesce when threatened?

00:39.040 --> 00:42.930
Crimson Demons accept 
any and all challenges.

00:43.160 --> 00:46.620
Well, I know you're just shy 
of actually being stupid,

00:46.620 --> 00:48.890
so you must know what kind 
of enemy you're facing here.

00:48.890 --> 00:51.320
That was quite a barbed way of putting it.

00:51.320 --> 00:55.280
Regardless, with the arch priest in 
question having never been found,

00:55.280 --> 00:59.600
I would say that I'm the only one in town 
with the means to deal with this demon.

01:00.510 --> 01:02.790
Fine, do what you want.

01:09.370 --> 01:13.340
We're... friends, aren't we?

01:17.270 --> 01:18.670
You want my help?!

01:18.670 --> 01:22.000
If you think I'll do as you ask just because 
you say we're friends, you're dead wrong!

01:22.590 --> 01:25.620
And yet I can't deny hearing 
that made me kinda happy!

01:28.020 --> 01:32.940
<b>Episode 12: An Explosion on This Wonderful World!</b>

01:38.120 --> 01:41.670
I thought I said you were free 
to occupy yourself for a while.

01:41.670 --> 01:44.630
Well, you went into the inn 
after mentioning you were going

01:44.630 --> 01:47.240
to get funds for your plan, so I was worried.

01:48.140 --> 01:49.990
I have 10,000,000 eris here.

01:49.990 --> 01:53.140
How in the world did you 
make that kind of money?!

01:53.140 --> 01:54.890
What happened in there?!

01:56.690 --> 01:58.120
I'd rather not say.

01:58.120 --> 02:00.800
Megumin! You've really crossed a line!

02:01.150 --> 02:02.630
More importantly,

02:02.630 --> 02:06.480
we need to put this war chest to use 
and raise our combat efficacy.

02:06.840 --> 02:11.720
Head to the magic item store, 
and buy anything that looks useful.

02:11.720 --> 02:13.020
O-Okay.

02:13.020 --> 02:17.570
Also, we'll need a stuffed black cat toy. 
Make sure to buy one.

02:17.570 --> 02:19.030
A stuffed toy?

02:23.640 --> 02:27.080
These were all made in the 
Crimson Demon village.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.960
Oh, excellent work!

02:28.960 --> 02:31.920
This is a Scroll of Concealment!

02:31.920 --> 02:35.690
It should make things simple, 
even without front line fighter allies.

02:35.690 --> 02:36.720
There's also...

02:37.220 --> 02:39.960
The stuffed black cat you asked for.

02:40.280 --> 02:42.960
I don't know what you have 
in mind for it, but...

02:44.720 --> 02:45.640
Hey!

02:45.640 --> 02:47.600
And now, with a little bit of time,

02:48.180 --> 02:51.490
Chomusuke's scent will rub 
off on the stuffed cat.

02:51.490 --> 02:55.310
We'll use it as bait, 
conceal ourselves with the scroll,

02:55.550 --> 02:58.150
and once he arrives in 
his ignorance, ka-boom.

02:58.150 --> 03:01.480
D-Do you really think this plan's gonna work?

03:02.040 --> 03:03.900
We'll have to make it work.

03:04.390 --> 03:10.310
You're not the only one who's grown 
attached to this impudent little furball.

03:10.580 --> 03:13.910
Besides, we may have only 
worked together briefly,

03:13.910 --> 03:16.990
but this village is full of people 
I've gone on adventures with.

03:16.990 --> 03:20.940
And since fuzzy here and I are 
responsible for this matter,

03:23.950 --> 03:26.410
I intend to see it resolved in full.

03:28.090 --> 03:31.820
Recklessly and stubbornly 
acting tough, like always.

03:31.820 --> 03:33.180
Pipe down.

03:33.180 --> 03:37.070
It's not like you've changed your timid, 
conflict-averse tendencies, either.

03:39.310 --> 03:44.830
<i>What has changed is that she's become a lot 
less selfish and indifferent in the last year.</i>

03:57.610 --> 04:00.380
<i>I'm feeling far too awake to sleep.</i>

04:00.380 --> 04:03.660
<i>I can't believe I'm actually 
nervous before a battle...</i>

04:06.180 --> 04:08.800
I forgot to fire off my 
daily explosion magic!

04:08.800 --> 04:11.740
That explains this unease! 
How could I have been so careless?!

04:11.740 --> 04:12.920
Unlock.

04:23.450 --> 04:25.730
<i>Who would come by so late?</i>

04:26.180 --> 04:27.630
<i>What pervert is this?</i>

04:29.730 --> 04:32.260
You're asleep, right, Megumin?

04:39.140 --> 04:41.340
You're really amazing, you know.

04:41.780 --> 04:45.450
It never even occurred to you to 
run from a scary demon like that.

04:45.450 --> 04:49.600
I think I'd be too anxious 
to sleep if I were you.

04:49.600 --> 04:53.610
<i>This is making it far too awkward 
to pretend to wake up now.</i>

04:53.610 --> 04:55.420
If I'm being honest...

04:55.420 --> 04:57.870
When you learned explosion magic,

04:57.870 --> 05:01.750
I had to wonder how the top of our 
class could do something so stupid.

05:02.430 --> 05:09.200
And when I saw you helping with the Axis 
sect's ridiculous recruiting in Arcanretia...

05:09.200 --> 05:10.710
Wow. I was just speechless.

05:12.500 --> 05:13.360
But...

05:14.250 --> 05:17.610
But with just the joke 
they call explosion magic,

05:17.610 --> 05:21.310
you were able to slay the Devil 
King's minions and defeat Arnes,

05:21.310 --> 05:25.110
and now you're about to take on this demon.

05:28.070 --> 05:31.020
I think that's really cool, and incredible.

05:38.170 --> 05:40.390
But I'm sure you know the truth.

05:40.390 --> 05:44.540
Even with a Scroll of Concealment, 
when you start to cast explosion magic,

05:44.540 --> 05:47.050
the flow of magic power will 
make your position obvious.

05:47.050 --> 05:50.750
<i>I didn't think that far ahead... 
and I don't dare admit that.</i>

05:51.150 --> 05:56.840
Which is why, y'know... to make 
sure I can continue being your rival,

05:56.840 --> 05:58.970
I'm going to borrow this.

06:00.410 --> 06:04.430
To be honest, I was at the guild before now,

06:04.870 --> 06:08.580
and for the first time, I asked
people to form a party with me.

06:09.360 --> 06:10.980
Rex and his friends.

06:10.980 --> 06:15.450
When I asked them if they wanted revenge 
on the demon, they were happy to agree.

06:16.260 --> 06:18.940
<i>Weren't they badly injured?</i>

06:19.930 --> 06:24.020
I would've been too afraid 
to try anything by myself.

06:24.020 --> 06:25.500
But now, I'm sure...

06:26.980 --> 06:31.230
I can't let you try this plan 
when I know it won't work.

06:32.980 --> 06:36.730
Because you're my best 
friend in the whole world.

06:37.640 --> 06:38.640
And that's why...

06:38.990 --> 06:40.070
Sleep.

06:48.570 --> 06:49.730
Megumin...

06:51.240 --> 06:52.420
I'm sorry.

06:58.390 --> 07:00.250
Yunyun!

07:06.620 --> 07:09.290
How dare she entrap me like this?!

07:09.290 --> 07:13.980
There is no greater shame for a Crimson 
Demon than to have their spotlight stolen!

07:14.350 --> 07:17.000
Well, this simply will not stand!

07:17.890 --> 07:19.040
Miss?!

07:19.040 --> 07:21.900
Sorry, I have a bit of an emergency 
situation, and was in a rush.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.180
Some other time, maybe.

07:23.180 --> 07:26.500
What in the world happened? 
You look so worried.

07:26.500 --> 07:31.660
Well, I'm not sure how, but Yunyun has 
apparently found a party out of the blue...

07:31.660 --> 07:34.990
Oh, would that be the group 
with that Rex fellow?

07:34.990 --> 07:37.350
Huh? Yes. How did you know?

07:37.350 --> 07:40.450
Because I healed them!

07:41.280 --> 07:41.990
Huh?

07:41.990 --> 07:47.190
I said I healed them! They were in front 
of the church, and obviously in pain.

07:47.190 --> 07:50.830
You should have seen how jealous 
the Eris sect was when I did it!

07:50.830 --> 07:53.640
You're responsible for this 
annoying turn of events?!

07:53.640 --> 07:56.450
I don't have time for this! I need to go!

07:57.580 --> 08:00.980
Miss, I genuinely do not have 
time to fool around right now...

08:04.860 --> 08:07.250
May the divine Aqua offer her protection.

08:08.420 --> 08:09.790
Blessing.

08:16.030 --> 08:19.480
I barely remember the incantations for 
anything other than healing magic.

08:19.480 --> 08:21.320
I'm glad it actually worked.

08:22.930 --> 08:25.550
I am a holy woman, in spite of it all.

08:25.550 --> 08:28.200
And I think I've got a 
good eye for people, too.

08:28.200 --> 08:30.990
Don't worry. I know you can win.

08:30.990 --> 08:36.210
I mean, how could my adorable, 
helpful Megumin lose to some rotten devil?

08:36.680 --> 08:37.880
Miss...

08:38.680 --> 08:42.590
Just this once, it'd be nice 
if you'd call me "big sister"!

08:44.890 --> 08:46.570
Well, then, Big Sister Cecily...

08:47.680 --> 08:48.760
I'm off!

08:51.220 --> 08:53.190
Good luck!

09:07.520 --> 09:09.380
We'll keep him occupied somehow.

09:09.380 --> 09:11.470
You hit him with that magic from before!

09:11.470 --> 09:12.940
U-Understood!

09:12.940 --> 09:15.690
Aw, damn it, what the hell?

09:15.690 --> 09:19.290
You twerps are starting to get on my nerves!

09:23.450 --> 09:25.460
I have to do it! I have to pull this off!

09:25.780 --> 09:28.380
Time to die! Inferno!

09:29.780 --> 09:32.470
Magic Canceler!

09:35.830 --> 09:37.800
Blade of Wind!

09:43.690 --> 09:45.820
That worked! Keep it up!

09:45.820 --> 09:46.810
Right!

09:49.790 --> 09:53.780
Well, this is a surprise... 
They're holding their own.

09:53.780 --> 09:55.570
It'd be one thing if they were in danger,

09:55.570 --> 09:59.810
but crashing the party when the battle 
might be won isn't to my liking.

10:00.550 --> 10:02.240
Lightning!

10:06.010 --> 10:08.040
I am getting fed up over here.

10:08.520 --> 10:11.830
This is why I didn't want to 
mess with Crimson Demons!

10:12.530 --> 10:17.250
Damn it, enough's enough. 
Time to wrap this up the hard way!

10:18.290 --> 10:19.930
Everyone, it's time!

10:19.930 --> 10:22.010
Another little trick?

10:22.010 --> 10:23.640
Let's see what you've got!

10:25.100 --> 10:26.420
Flash!

10:29.560 --> 10:32.900
Demons don't see with their eyes, girlie!

10:32.900 --> 10:35.710
This trick of yours isn't gonna do squat!

10:36.530 --> 10:38.860
My eyes! My eyes!

10:42.040 --> 10:46.380
Damn it, that didn't work. Even though 
I know I heard a tiny scream...

10:48.950 --> 10:52.580
Looks like that leaves just the two of you.

10:52.580 --> 10:54.860
Any more tricks up your sleeve?

10:58.430 --> 10:59.380
Host!

11:09.540 --> 11:11.720
You think this is gonna buy you time?

11:14.350 --> 11:15.850
Paralyze!

11:18.990 --> 11:22.000
I figured a Crimson Demon would know better!

11:22.000 --> 11:23.960
Paralyze isn't gonna work on a dem—

11:25.340 --> 11:28.570
I'm well aware that paralysis 
magic doesn't work on demons.

11:28.850 --> 11:32.740
But this magic potion was to 
increase the power of my spell.

11:32.740 --> 11:37.060
Granted, it was a gamble on whether 
or not it'd actually work!

11:38.010 --> 11:40.150
You actually managed to restrain me...

11:40.150 --> 11:42.890
That must've been one 
hell of a magic potion.

11:43.330 --> 11:46.940
But I bet it took a big chunk 
of your magic power, huh?

11:48.060 --> 11:51.990
Paralyze only lasts for 
a few minutes at max.

11:51.990 --> 11:55.400
You really think you can finish 
me off with what you've got left?

11:55.930 --> 11:58.920
That's why I'll make you an offer.

11:58.920 --> 12:01.490
How about we both give it a rest for today?

12:01.490 --> 12:05.230
I'm sure you wanna heal your 
buddies on the ground over there.

12:05.480 --> 12:11.000
If you agree, I promise not to lay 
a claw on any of you for today.

12:12.000 --> 12:18.890
You know that demons don't ever break 
promises or bargains, don't you?

12:20.370 --> 12:23.970
I-I'm willing to consider your offer.

12:23.970 --> 12:27.210
We can both take our leave for today.

12:27.750 --> 12:28.960
Hey, wait!

12:28.960 --> 12:32.360
Yunyun, don't worry about us!

12:32.360 --> 12:34.890
We'll be fine.

12:34.890 --> 12:37.490
Just hurry and finish him off!

12:37.770 --> 12:42.000
I-It's not that... s-see, 
the th-th-thing is...

12:42.610 --> 12:45.680
Wait, hang on a sec. Girl, did you...

12:46.120 --> 12:47.860
Don't tell me...

12:48.720 --> 12:50.960
You can't move either, can you?

12:57.120 --> 13:01.170
You Crimson Demons might be a pain to 
deal with, but I like you all the same!

13:01.170 --> 13:05.970
What kind of goofy spell-casting 
makes Paralyze affect the caster?!

13:05.970 --> 13:08.360
I don't know either, okay?!

13:08.850 --> 13:15.040
This potion is guaranteed to increase the 
strength and affected area for Paralyze!

13:15.480 --> 13:20.240
And then the pretty lady sold 
it to me at a great price!

13:20.240 --> 13:22.410
Oh, what a riot.

13:22.410 --> 13:26.590
So, now what? Since you gave me a real laugh,

13:26.590 --> 13:30.310
I'm still willing to let you off 
if you wanna make a deal.

13:31.490 --> 13:34.050
A-Are you trying to pick a fight with me?!

13:34.050 --> 13:38.010
C-Crimson Demons always 
accept a-all challenges!

13:38.010 --> 13:40.650
So, it seems none of you can move!

13:49.510 --> 13:50.480
You!

13:50.480 --> 13:53.880
Greetings. I happen to be a sorceress 
supreme who was just passing through.

13:53.880 --> 13:57.980
It seems you've all had quite the 
little encounter in my absence.

13:58.450 --> 14:00.110
Megumin...

14:00.110 --> 14:02.500
Last night, when I was about to get up

14:02.500 --> 14:06.010
after realizing I had not performed 
my daily explosion magic,

14:06.010 --> 14:08.520
an unknown assailant cast 
Sleep magic on me...

14:08.520 --> 14:10.510
Wait, y-you were awake?!

14:10.510 --> 14:12.830
Hang on, you were awake back then?!

14:12.830 --> 14:17.420
And now, with an overflowing amount of 
magic power carried over from yesterday,

14:17.420 --> 14:21.830
who should I happen upon in 
my search for a good target?!

14:24.330 --> 14:26.900
Whoa! Your eyes!

14:26.900 --> 14:31.040
H-Hang on a sec! I get it, I do. 
Let's all just calm down...

14:29.930 --> 14:33.450
I-If you were awake, 
you should have said something!

14:33.450 --> 14:36.100
I would've cast Sleep the second 
I came into the room!

14:36.100 --> 14:38.830
When did you wake up?! 
How much did you hear?!

14:38.830 --> 14:43.070
Well, if you're curious, around the time you 
unlocked the door to my room with magic,

14:43.070 --> 14:46.850
and asked, "You're asleep, right, Megumin?"

14:46.850 --> 14:48.320
No!

14:48.320 --> 14:52.830
Now, then, am I to understand 
you've harmed my amusing comrade

14:52.830 --> 14:55.590
who was silly enough to monologue 
at someone who was wide awake,

14:55.590 --> 14:57.450
and then cast Paralyze on herself?

14:57.450 --> 14:59.660
No! No more! Please stop!

14:59.660 --> 15:02.950
I apologize, so stop! 
I'm sorry, so please, no more!

15:02.950 --> 15:05.150
Now, she may be the 
embarrassing type who says,

15:05.150 --> 15:10.730
"I think you're really cool and incredible, 
Megumin," when she thinks no one is listening...

15:10.730 --> 15:12.590
No!

15:12.590 --> 15:16.410
And, "You're my best friend 
in the whole world."

15:16.800 --> 15:19.960
But after hearing all that...

15:20.550 --> 15:23.800
I can hardly ignore her suffering, can I?!

15:23.800 --> 15:25.060
Kill me!

15:25.060 --> 15:28.920
I can't move, so I can't run or do it myself! 
End my suffering now, please!

15:28.920 --> 15:31.170
I can't go on living like this! 
I'd be better off dead!

15:31.170 --> 15:34.300
Hey! How long are you going to goof around?!

15:37.070 --> 15:38.270
What the...

15:38.880 --> 15:41.510
I am going to fire my great spell.

15:42.030 --> 15:45.710
The same instant victory magic that 
defeated your comrade, Arnes!

15:46.810 --> 15:50.080
Huh, you're the one who did her in?

15:50.710 --> 15:52.940
Well, seeing the kind of 
magic power you're packing,

15:52.940 --> 15:54.980
it makes sense that she couldn't survive it.

16:00.930 --> 16:05.080
The sparks of genesis. 
The embers of oblivion.

16:05.080 --> 16:09.140
Past, present, and future, a forbidden 
force that subsumes all creation.

16:09.140 --> 16:11.370
Flame, I am become destruction, 
without mercy.

16:11.370 --> 16:12.920
This is not my day, man.

16:11.370 --> 16:17.740
By my blood, by my flesh, the commandments 
set by the gods are now shattered!

16:13.300 --> 16:17.250
I probably could've survived this 
if I was at full strength, y'know.

16:17.250 --> 16:21.380
But I had a run-in with 
those weirdos yesterday...

16:21.380 --> 16:24.330
The stupidly durable Crusader 
and the thief in the shorts.

16:24.330 --> 16:27.980
And then, when I was gonna attack 
the town to let off some steam,

16:27.980 --> 16:30.730
that weird broad who was doing 
maintenance on the walls

16:30.730 --> 16:34.230
blasts me with some seriously 
nasty evil-banishing magic...

16:35.210 --> 16:37.630
Explosion!

16:39.490 --> 16:43.440
I guess this is one life wasted.

16:43.690 --> 16:46.360
What a mess. If I don't 
turn things around soon,

16:46.360 --> 16:50.840
that little kid's gonna actually gonna 
end up summoning me as her familiar...

17:11.830 --> 17:15.380
I knew it! I had absolute 
faith in you, Megumin!

17:15.380 --> 17:18.800
Your big sister knew you were gonna win!

17:18.800 --> 17:23.150
Miss, this is actually very uncomfortable, 
so please put me down...

17:25.030 --> 17:27.060
Aw, I know you're just playing hard-to-get!

17:27.460 --> 17:29.190
Now, then.

17:29.190 --> 17:31.300
I hate to say goodbye, but...

17:31.300 --> 17:34.330
Are you headed back to Arcanretia?

17:34.330 --> 17:37.460
No. I'm going on a journey.

17:37.940 --> 17:40.420
This experience taught me something.

17:40.420 --> 17:42.980
Healing magic by itself isn't enough.

17:42.980 --> 17:49.250
When I cast Bless on Megumin, like a 
proper priest should, it occurred to me...

17:49.250 --> 17:50.810
Wouldn't it be better

17:50.810 --> 17:54.710
if I wasn't just "beautiful," 
but "the beautiful, skilled priest"?

17:54.710 --> 17:57.100
I hardly see how that matters at all.

17:57.100 --> 17:59.640
Besides, once I hit a certain level,

17:59.640 --> 18:03.590
I'll be eligible to take over the 
local church of any town I want!

18:04.000 --> 18:08.480
Miss, are you... plotting to take over this town?

18:09.080 --> 18:10.190
That's a secret!

18:11.220 --> 18:13.160
Sure seems like she is.

18:16.270 --> 18:18.120
Goodbye!

18:19.150 --> 18:21.110
Take care!

18:21.110 --> 18:23.450
Call me "big sister" one last time, maybe?!

18:27.230 --> 18:28.790
Hey, Megumin...

18:30.380 --> 18:32.330
Would you come with me for a sec?

18:44.160 --> 18:49.390
My nemesis, and most renowned 
of Crimson Demons, Megumin!

18:51.870 --> 18:54.790
I... I am called Yunyun!

18:54.790 --> 18:57.930
Arch wizard, and wielder 
of intermediate magic!

18:57.930 --> 19:00.890
She who will one day be chief 
of the Crimson Demons!

19:00.890 --> 19:02.870
I intend to go on a journey.

19:02.870 --> 19:08.360
Yes, a journey to master advanced magic, 
so that I might defeat you, my rival!

19:08.660 --> 19:11.990
But the other day, I wasn't your rival,

19:11.990 --> 19:14.710
but your "best friend in the whole world."

19:14.710 --> 19:16.630
I'm not listening! I'm not listening!

19:16.630 --> 19:19.800
Don't tell me that after that 
embarrassing little confession,

19:19.800 --> 19:22.090
you plan on getting out of 
town until things calm down?

19:22.090 --> 19:25.100
I know what you're thinking, 
but no, I'm not that stupid!

19:25.390 --> 19:30.030
I mean, i-it's only gonna 
be for a while, so...

19:30.400 --> 19:31.840
A-Anyway,

19:32.350 --> 19:36.650
I hate to admit it, but you did 
end up beating that demon.

19:36.650 --> 19:40.320
So I have to admit that, as I 
am now, I just can't beat you.

19:40.320 --> 19:44.740
And if I stay with you, I doubt 
I'll be able to surpass you.

19:44.740 --> 19:47.080
I think that won't change even if you leave,

19:47.080 --> 19:50.840
considering I've got a nearly 
perfect record of beating you.

19:50.840 --> 19:54.760
O-Oh, pipe down! I'm trying to be 
serious here, so don't butt in!

19:54.960 --> 19:56.750
Anyway, what do you say?

19:56.750 --> 20:00.620
After I learn advanced magic, 
do you want to settle things?

20:01.190 --> 20:02.280
By all means.

20:02.830 --> 20:07.180
When that happens, let's see who's truly 
greater, with no tricks or schemes.

21:32.160 --> 21:36.250
We have three more spots for 
front-line classes over here!

21:36.250 --> 21:37.960
Any priests around?

21:37.960 --> 21:40.180
The job's a goblin hunt, 
and it pays pretty well.

21:40.470 --> 21:42.300
We're looking for one more member!

21:44.140 --> 21:45.130
Stare...

21:48.360 --> 21:50.950
I think our spots just got filled!

21:53.820 --> 21:59.220
<i>I shouldn't have tried to look cool by 
handing my remaining funds to Yunyun.</i>

22:00.100 --> 22:01.820
<i>No, that's not it.</i>

22:01.820 --> 22:06.540
<i>I was so sure that there'd be 
parties fighting to recruit me.</i>

22:07.340 --> 22:11.290
"Immediate opening! 
We're a cozy, harmonious party."

22:11.290 --> 22:13.360
"I've been happy every day 
since I joined this party."

22:13.360 --> 22:16.340
"I got over my illness and became popular."

22:16.340 --> 22:19.990
What in the world is this? 
It definitely gives me a bad feeling...

22:21.130 --> 22:26.540
"Advanced job classes only"? 
I wonder what kind of party they are.

22:27.510 --> 22:30.380
Hey, let's lower the bar a little.

22:30.380 --> 22:33.880
Recruiting only members in 
advanced classes is way too strict.

22:34.790 --> 22:36.990
But... But...

22:41.740 --> 22:44.260
At this rate, not a single person will come.

22:44.570 --> 22:49.110
I mean, you might have an advanced class, 
but I'm still in the weakest.

22:49.110 --> 22:52.260
I'll feel ashamed if I'm completely 
surrounded by the elite.

22:52.260 --> 22:55.150
I happened to notice your 
recruitment poster.

22:58.610 --> 23:01.890
That we would meet is a fate 
chosen by the world itself.

23:01.890 --> 23:06.510
I have anxiously awaited the arrival 
of those such as yourselves.

23:10.510 --> 23:12.380
I am called Megumin!

23:12.380 --> 23:14.440
My calling is that of an arch wizard,

23:14.440 --> 23:18.750
and one who controls explosion magic, 
the strongest of all offensive magic!

23:20.540 --> 23:24.750
<i>This is the story of the girl known to
some as a mage of exceptional quality,</i>

23:24.750 --> 23:31.920
<i>but more commonly known as a deranged 
user of explosion magic, and her companions.</i>

23:32.740 --> 23:36.240
<i>A grand new adventure is about to begin!</i>
