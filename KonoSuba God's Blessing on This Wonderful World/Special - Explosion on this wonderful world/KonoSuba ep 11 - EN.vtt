00:14.350 --> 00:21.610
What the hell was I thinking when I said I'd 
become that freaky little kid's familiar?

00:22.560 --> 00:27.650
The town of Axel... I'm pretty sure 
that's where I can find Lady Wolbach.

01:50.630 --> 01:57.510
<b>KONOSUBA - An Explosion on This Wonderful World!</b>

01:59.140 --> 02:03.060
<b>Episode 11: The Explosion Girl and the Forest Irregularity</b>

02:00.900 --> 02:02.640
Fireball!

02:12.910 --> 02:16.730
It's 5,000 eris for each one, 
so this 15,000 total.

02:16.730 --> 02:20.160
Two more and we'll get a bonus of 10,000...

02:20.160 --> 02:21.780
We should move on to the woods.

02:22.050 --> 02:23.290
Already?

02:23.290 --> 02:26.970
Fighting these bottom-feeders isn't 
doing much to raise our levels.

02:27.990 --> 02:30.150
I believe we should focus on efficiency.

02:33.550 --> 02:36.250
H-Hey there, boss man...

02:37.000 --> 02:38.340
See you tomorrow.

02:38.340 --> 02:40.770
See you tomorrow, boss man!

02:42.720 --> 02:46.100
Hey, you wanna look for a 
different job tomorrow?

02:46.100 --> 02:48.170
I don't think I'm cut out for manual labor.

02:48.170 --> 02:51.640
What are you whining about now? 
This is the problem with you shut-in NEETs.

02:51.640 --> 02:52.330
I am not.

02:52.330 --> 02:54.760
Nothing good comes of quitting 
a job you just got.

02:54.760 --> 02:57.700
Come on, let's take our pay, 
wash off in the bath,

02:57.700 --> 03:01.330
eat something yummy, and give 
it another shot tomorrow!

03:00.290 --> 03:02.400
Megumin? Something wrong?

03:03.310 --> 03:04.380
Oh, no.

03:09.530 --> 03:13.050
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, 
stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid!

03:13.050 --> 03:15.160
How stupid do you have to be to pick a fight

03:15.160 --> 03:17.590
with a huge colony like this, 
just for the payout?!

03:17.590 --> 03:19.350
Just who are you calling stupid?!

03:19.350 --> 03:20.620
Are you trying to start a fight?!

03:20.620 --> 03:23.460
Very well! Consider that challenge accepted!

03:23.460 --> 03:25.440
Duck and cover, Yunyun!

03:26.210 --> 03:28.320
Explosion!

03:33.720 --> 03:37.170
Hey, human. You alive?

03:41.270 --> 03:42.970
Looks like you're awake.

03:43.320 --> 03:44.280
Yes...

03:55.320 --> 04:00.160
So, I'm looking for a giant, 
ebon magic beast and—

04:00.800 --> 04:03.060
You... Those eyes...

04:04.040 --> 04:06.350
I am called Host!

04:06.350 --> 04:10.220
And I am not a giant goblin, 
but a high-ranked demon,

04:10.220 --> 04:14.430
and he who will be in the employ 
of a certain kid someday!

04:15.230 --> 04:18.030
How'd you like my little introduction?

04:18.030 --> 04:21.170
You Crimson Demons love this kinda...

04:26.610 --> 04:29.200
You encountered a high-ranked 
demon in the woods?

04:29.200 --> 04:33.000
Yes. He said he was looking for 
a giant, ebon magic beast...

04:33.000 --> 04:36.610
I think I might know what he's talking about.

04:36.610 --> 04:40.420
It's a very dangerous monster 
that's called a Rookie Slayer.

04:40.420 --> 04:44.040
Why would this demon be 
searching for it, though?

04:46.740 --> 04:49.590
I appreciate you two sharing this with me.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.550
This is a very dangerous situation...

04:55.870 --> 04:58.810
This sure has escalated, hasn't it?

04:59.060 --> 05:02.100
We ran into him at an unfortunate time.

05:02.100 --> 05:04.470
Considering I had just spent 
all my magic power...

05:04.470 --> 05:08.020
Otherwise, I could have given 
him a rather incendiary hello!

05:08.020 --> 05:11.170
Stop it! I don't think there's 
any beating that thing.

05:11.170 --> 05:14.940
That demon seems like he could 
even withstand explosion magic.

05:15.750 --> 05:18.730
Should I interpret that as a challenge?

05:18.730 --> 05:22.010
Very well! Let's change our plans for 
tomorrow and head back to the woods—

05:22.010 --> 05:24.680
No way! I am not going back to the woods!

05:24.680 --> 05:26.830
If you want to do it, do it yourself!

05:29.370 --> 05:31.500
We need a priest for our group!

05:31.500 --> 05:35.980
Any mages around? If you can make 
potions, we could use your help!

05:36.470 --> 05:38.600
I've got some complimentary potions here.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.270
What a relief!

05:41.270 --> 05:45.040
Since the entire guild is getting 
involved, I wanted to help out.

05:45.040 --> 05:48.220
You might not do a lot of business, pretty 
lady, but your potions really hit the spot.

05:48.220 --> 05:50.110
If you're feeling generous, how about a date?

05:52.250 --> 05:53.860
Huh? All gone already?

05:54.220 --> 05:56.880
I'll head to the shop and bring some more!

05:56.880 --> 05:58.430
Guess we'll eat first.

05:58.430 --> 05:59.250
We're counting on you!

06:00.390 --> 06:02.220
I'm gonna need to buy more ingredients...

06:02.220 --> 06:05.860
Guess I'll be eating bread crusts and 
drinking sugar water for a while.

06:06.830 --> 06:08.780
Things seem quite lively!

06:08.780 --> 06:12.070
Well, the guild wants to 
hunt this demon down...

06:12.070 --> 06:14.590
Wait, Megumin! What are you so excited about?

06:14.590 --> 06:16.260
You saw how scary he was!

06:16.260 --> 06:20.260
We don't even get monsters that 
dangerous back home at the village!

06:20.260 --> 06:23.720
If you're feeling worried,
by all means, you can wait here.

06:24.130 --> 06:27.950
They're offering a reward just 
for participating in the hunt.

06:27.950 --> 06:31.350
There's no way I'm missing an 
opportunity to get paid just for

06:31.350 --> 06:33.190
hanging around at the back of a crowd.

06:33.190 --> 06:37.170
Well, i-if you're going, 
I can't let you do it alone...

06:37.170 --> 06:39.770
Did you say something? I'm sure you did.

06:39.770 --> 06:42.960
Go on, let's hear it a bit more loudly!

06:42.960 --> 06:44.230
I know you heard me!

06:44.230 --> 06:47.170
You heard me and just want me 
to say it again, don't you?!

06:47.420 --> 06:51.650
Granted, I'm not purely 
in this for the reward.

06:52.600 --> 06:55.830
Think for a second. 
A striking performance here

06:55.830 --> 06:59.580
will have people begging <i>us</i> to join their 
parties, and not the other way around.

06:59.580 --> 07:01.600
We'll be fighting off offers!

07:08.210 --> 07:09.990
Fireball!

07:18.450 --> 07:19.760
Well, damn!

07:19.760 --> 07:21.140
Impressive.

07:21.140 --> 07:23.100
Isn't that girl... you know, the one

07:23.100 --> 07:25.600
who's always playing cards 
in a corner of the guild?

07:26.990 --> 07:29.210
Very impressive, Yunyun.

07:31.400 --> 07:32.920
What the?!

07:33.660 --> 07:34.940
Clear a path!

07:35.560 --> 07:39.140
It's him! The hero with the cursed 
sword who was taking point!

07:39.770 --> 07:42.050
Let me down! I can still fight!

07:42.400 --> 07:44.350
I can't give up... Not now!

07:44.350 --> 07:46.140
Please, don't talk!

07:48.030 --> 07:51.160
I'm not done... I can still fight!

07:48.970 --> 07:51.150
A hero with a cursed sword got beat...

07:51.420 --> 07:53.650
It's no good. There's no way we can do this!

07:52.030 --> 07:54.650
Put me down!

07:53.650 --> 07:55.950
It's as strong as one of the 
Devil King's Army generals!

07:55.950 --> 07:57.650
Retreat!

07:57.650 --> 07:59.780
Retreat now! Everybody, fall back!

07:59.780 --> 08:04.050
Please! Damn it!

08:06.670 --> 08:10.540
I've been informed how 
the hunt went, everyone.

08:10.540 --> 08:12.710
It seems this is quite the dangerous foe.

08:13.090 --> 08:17.230
And the famed cursed sword adventurer 
has apparently been seriously injured.

08:17.490 --> 08:22.640
The bottom line is, if he got beaten 
that badly, none of us stand a chance.

08:22.640 --> 08:26.150
You guys are the toughest party 
in town! Is it really that bad?

08:26.150 --> 08:29.280
Well, a couple dozen from our main 
fighting force have been injured,

08:29.280 --> 08:33.680
and even with the priests using 
healing magic and potions on them...

08:33.680 --> 08:35.660
It'll be a while before we can try again.

08:35.660 --> 08:39.760
So what now?! We just wait around 
for this thing to kill us?!

08:39.760 --> 08:41.410
Is there really nothing we can do?

08:41.410 --> 08:43.450
I can think of one possible solution!

08:44.460 --> 08:47.930
There's someone who registered 
as an adventurer recently...

08:47.930 --> 08:51.440
And, apparently, Axel is now 
host to an expert exorcist

08:51.440 --> 08:54.290
with the rare class of arch priest!

08:54.290 --> 08:55.280
What?!

08:55.280 --> 08:58.270
You mean the one said to be 
the natural enemy of all demons?

08:58.270 --> 09:02.810
Wait, if they just registered, 
they'd still only be level 1, right?

09:02.810 --> 09:04.660
But here's the interesting thing.

09:04.660 --> 09:08.690
With a few exceptions, all of 
her stats are off the charts!

09:08.690 --> 09:11.470
Not only that, but she's 
such a gifted arch priest,

09:11.470 --> 09:13.570
she already knows all the class skills!

09:13.570 --> 09:14.760
Are you serious?

09:14.760 --> 09:17.280
She may even be able to beat that demon...

09:17.280 --> 09:20.730
The only problem is, I haven't 
seen her around the guild lately.

09:20.730 --> 09:22.960
I think she's still in town, but...

09:22.960 --> 09:24.630
Hey, what's she look like?!

09:24.630 --> 09:27.340
We've gotta find this arch priest, 
so give us a description!

09:28.650 --> 09:31.430
She has striking blue hair...

09:31.430 --> 09:34.510
and beauty akin to a goddess!

09:42.700 --> 09:44.620
They all ran off, huh?

09:44.620 --> 09:47.440
What do you think? 
Should we look for her, too?

09:47.440 --> 09:51.240
They seem desperate enough 
to find her in short order.

09:51.460 --> 09:53.500
I'm feeling exhausted, for some reason...

09:53.500 --> 09:54.470
Really?

09:55.560 --> 09:58.730
I think I'll stick around a bit longer.

09:58.730 --> 10:02.530
Oh, I see. Waiting to be scouted 
by another party, is that it?

10:02.530 --> 10:04.370
That's not it, I swear!

10:04.370 --> 10:07.910
Sure, sure, just don't stay 
out too late tonight.

10:07.910 --> 10:11.060
Got it! Don't worry, I'll be back before dawn.

10:11.060 --> 10:12.650
Sooner than that, please!

10:14.030 --> 10:16.430
Find the blue-haired goddess!

10:19.930 --> 10:21.140
Hey!

10:21.920 --> 10:25.550
Would you pay attention?! Thanks to you,

10:25.550 --> 10:28.840
I dropped my pay, and now that's 
10,000 eris all over the ground!

10:28.840 --> 10:30.850
Hurry and pick it up already!

10:30.850 --> 10:33.510
And if I find any missing, 
you'll be making up the difference!

10:33.510 --> 10:35.380
L-Look, I'm sorry.

10:35.380 --> 10:38.740
But that definitely doesn't 
look like a whole 10,000 eris.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.190
Wait, your hair...

10:41.190 --> 10:43.650
What?! You got a problem?

10:44.470 --> 10:46.540
It couldn't be...

10:46.540 --> 10:48.160
<i>She's kinda shabby-looking, too...</i>

10:48.160 --> 10:52.040
<i>And I doubt high-ranked clergy 
would try to scam someone like this.</i>

10:52.040 --> 10:53.080
You say something?!

10:53.080 --> 10:55.970
No! And anyway, I'm in a hurry!

10:55.970 --> 10:58.230
You can have this, so let me go!

10:59.320 --> 11:02.420
Awesome! I really used my head this time!

11:02.420 --> 11:06.330
Come on, help me pick up the 
cash that's on the ground!

11:06.740 --> 11:08.910
Wait, why are you crying?

11:08.910 --> 11:12.100
It's just... you're a such a...

11:13.690 --> 11:17.340
No. There's no way that's her.

11:23.960 --> 11:26.060
Welcome home, Megumin!

11:26.060 --> 11:28.640
Would you like to take a bath? Or take me?

11:28.640 --> 11:31.170
Or take the Axis Sect into your life?

11:36.050 --> 11:39.200
There are a lot of questions 
I could ask you, miss...

11:39.200 --> 11:40.260
It's Cecily!

11:40.260 --> 11:42.980
I think it's time we consider 
moving our relationship

11:42.980 --> 11:45.040
to the stage where we 
call each other by name.

11:45.040 --> 11:47.840
What are you doing here, miss?

11:47.840 --> 11:49.370
It's Cecily!

11:49.370 --> 11:53.310
And, well, that's a bit of a long story...

11:53.310 --> 11:57.560
Explaining would be a drag, so let's just 
say it was Divine Aqua's providence.

11:57.980 --> 11:59.730
That's no explanation at all.

11:59.730 --> 12:03.080
And how did you even get in 
here when it was locked?

12:03.440 --> 12:08.320
To be honest... I'm in need 
of your help, Megumin.

12:08.590 --> 12:11.900
I hope you don't think you can fool 
me by acting serious all of a sudden.

12:11.900 --> 12:15.830
Father Zesta heard the 
goddess Aqua's holy voice.

12:16.680 --> 12:18.210
"My name is Aqua."

12:18.210 --> 12:23.030
"Yes, the patron deity of the 
Axis Order, Aqua the goddess!"

12:23.030 --> 12:25.220
"And if you believe in me..."

12:25.840 --> 12:28.310
"I'd appreciate it if I could 
borrow some money!"

12:28.310 --> 12:29.300
...it said.

12:29.880 --> 12:32.300
Well, every bit of that sounds suspicious.

12:32.300 --> 12:36.600
Not only that, but he heard the 
voice from right here in Axel.

12:36.600 --> 12:39.570
And so, the Axis Order's beautiful priest

12:39.570 --> 12:43.760
was dispatched to investigate 
the source of this oracle.

12:44.420 --> 12:48.110
Your sect really must have 
nothing better to do.

12:49.860 --> 12:54.270
But after coming here, I think I understand 
part of what the oracle was about.

12:54.270 --> 12:59.330
I hear this place is being threatened 
by the enemies of our order—a demon.

12:59.860 --> 13:02.240
So I've come to interpret the oracle

13:02.240 --> 13:05.930
as orders for me to use the 
order's funds to hire people

13:05.930 --> 13:09.130
so that they can kill the demon 
who has appeared in this town.

13:09.470 --> 13:12.520
That seems like a very 
liberal interpretation.

13:12.520 --> 13:15.170
And could you move, please?

13:15.170 --> 13:18.230
This is my room, and that's my bed—

13:19.140 --> 13:21.930
The first thing that came to mind 
after getting to town was...

13:23.230 --> 13:24.850
the help of one who'd been our ally before...

13:26.340 --> 13:28.240
and that's you, Megumin.

13:28.240 --> 13:31.800
Whatever! I don't care anymore! 
Just get out of there, now!

13:31.800 --> 13:34.230
There are so few Axis faithful in town!

13:34.230 --> 13:36.750
The local church is barely functioning,

13:36.750 --> 13:38.700
so I can't afford to hire anyone else!

13:38.700 --> 13:41.440
I don't care! I sincerely don't care!

13:41.440 --> 13:44.640
And I would rather have nothing 
to do with you people ever again!

13:44.640 --> 13:47.520
And for pity's sake, 
stop trying to sniff my sheets!

13:47.870 --> 13:49.240
Stop panting!

13:49.900 --> 13:52.390
I have 5,000,000 for you

13:52.390 --> 13:56.390
if you'll help me find the arch priest 
that's supposed to live here.

13:59.070 --> 14:01.980
And if we slay the demon, 
I'll make it 10,000,000.

14:04.020 --> 14:05.110
I'm in.

14:08.700 --> 14:10.560
Hey, any luck? You find her?

14:10.560 --> 14:15.290
Nothing! Although I did see a drunk 
street performer with blue hair.

14:15.290 --> 14:19.890
Damn it, where did that amazing 
blue-haired arch priest get to?

14:20.970 --> 14:24.430
Do you really think it's 
likely we'll find someone

14:24.430 --> 14:27.460
that they've already scoured the town for?

14:28.930 --> 14:33.560
We're dealing with an arch priest.
Could she be praying in a church?

14:33.560 --> 14:39.190
Or maybe she's at a public cemetery, 
helping lost souls find rest?

14:39.420 --> 14:41.150
If it were me...

14:41.150 --> 14:44.970
First, I'd rush the public bath so 
that I can get in before anyone else,

14:44.970 --> 14:49.000
then munch on some fried frogs 
washed down with crimson beer,

14:49.000 --> 14:50.810
then get into a brawl with the drunks who

14:50.810 --> 14:53.000
lash my luscious body 
with their lascivious looks,

14:53.000 --> 14:57.060
and finally toss rocks at the local 
Eris church, and go home satisfied!

14:57.410 --> 15:00.090
I was a fool to even ask you.

15:00.450 --> 15:02.640
Come on, Megumin!

15:02.640 --> 15:06.270
We can search tomorrow! Tonight, 
let's hit the baths together!

15:06.270 --> 15:08.200
We can wash each other!

15:08.200 --> 15:11.220
I can go home if you don't intend to find her.

15:11.870 --> 15:13.170
What is this?

15:13.800 --> 15:17.070
I thought it was extremely unlikely 
that such a powerful arch priest

15:17.070 --> 15:20.550
would be a member of the Axis sect, 
so visiting an Eris church might be—

15:20.550 --> 15:22.260
Open the hell up!

15:22.260 --> 15:26.450
We know you're hiding this arch priest 
that can take care of this demon hunt!

15:26.450 --> 15:29.200
Open the damn door unless 
you want it kicked in!

15:29.200 --> 15:31.050
There's no one like that there!

15:31.050 --> 15:34.970
This church reserves the right to bar 
members of the Axis sect from entering!

15:34.970 --> 15:36.280
Please leave, now!

15:37.510 --> 15:42.210
Megumin, you're up. Go ahead and 
obliterate this church, please.

15:42.210 --> 15:43.750
I will do no such thing!

15:45.870 --> 15:49.770
This is already annoying enough. Please 
don't make it any more complicated...

15:54.860 --> 15:56.120
Strike!

15:56.510 --> 15:58.770
<b>KONOSUBA - An Explosion on This Wonderful World!</b>

15:57.020 --> 15:58.380
Out!

15:58.760 --> 16:03.260
Are you insane?! What in the world 
motivated you to do such a thing?!

16:03.490 --> 16:05.940
To be honest, it is a little odd!

16:05.940 --> 16:08.910
I've been feeling weirdly 
excited ever since I got here!

16:08.910 --> 16:11.270
Maybe it's a blessing 
from holy Aqua herself?

16:11.500 --> 16:13.480
If that's her idea of a blessing,

16:13.480 --> 16:18.470
then if I ever encounter this goddess Aqua, 
the first thing I do will be to attack her.

16:32.710 --> 16:35.270
Wh-What is it?!

16:36.300 --> 16:39.490
Megumin, you seriously screamed, "Hwah!"

16:39.490 --> 16:41.300
How absolutely adorable!

16:41.300 --> 16:44.700
Okay, okay, I'm sorry! I won't do it again!

16:51.380 --> 16:53.550
Shall we turn around on three?

16:53.940 --> 16:56.210
Sounds good. We'll turn 
around at the same time,

16:56.210 --> 16:58.400
and if there's anything there, 
we fight it together.

16:58.400 --> 16:58.950
Okay?

16:59.310 --> 17:00.410
Understood.

17:01.110 --> 17:02.740
One, two...

17:03.480 --> 17:05.960
Hey! This isn't what we agreed on!

17:05.960 --> 17:07.750
I should be saying that!

17:07.960 --> 17:10.910
I am technically your boss 
on this outing, you realize!

17:10.910 --> 17:12.420
I haven't been paid yet!

17:12.420 --> 17:14.730
And I'm helping you find someone, 
not acting as your bodyguard!

17:20.380 --> 17:25.140
Things sure have gotten pretty 
lively around Axel lately.

17:38.180 --> 17:39.660
Yunyun...

17:44.720 --> 17:48.090
Thanks. You're trying to 
cheer me up, aren't you?

17:56.390 --> 17:58.410
I thought about going home, of course!

17:58.410 --> 18:00.470
It's just, then I thought,

18:00.470 --> 18:05.250
"What if someone shows up to ask 
me to join them after I've left?"

18:05.250 --> 18:06.950
And then I couldn't leave!

18:09.390 --> 18:11.990
You seem really tired too, Megumin.

18:12.490 --> 18:14.420
I've just been rather busy...

18:14.420 --> 18:16.680
Hey there, Crimson Demon gals.

18:17.460 --> 18:19.840
You two are arch wizards, right?

18:19.840 --> 18:21.570
Yes, we are. Can I help you?

18:21.570 --> 18:26.350
My name is Rex, and we've cooked 
up a pretty great plan.

18:26.350 --> 18:30.070
But we're gonna need some 
spell casters to pull it off.

18:31.340 --> 18:34.460
So, would you like to work with us?

18:39.980 --> 18:40.970
Sleep!

18:51.990 --> 18:54.800
That was really impressive, Yunyun!

18:54.800 --> 18:58.140
How about it? You wanna join our party?

18:58.660 --> 19:00.480
You want me?

19:00.480 --> 19:03.840
Well, we can discuss it 
in detail back at town.

19:03.840 --> 19:06.490
First, let's drag this thing 
back and celebrate!

19:06.490 --> 19:07.630
O-Okay!

19:08.540 --> 19:14.080
Since the demon is looking for a black 
magic beast, it's gotta be this thing.

19:14.080 --> 19:18.500
Once it's caged up, maybe the demon 
will approach us to negotiate.

19:18.500 --> 19:21.300
<i>Something... seems off about this.</i>

19:23.120 --> 19:27.050
There you are!

19:27.050 --> 19:32.980
What the hell did you punks 
do to Lady Wolbach?!

19:36.670 --> 19:38.000
Lady Wolbach!

19:39.500 --> 19:42.490
H-Hey, Megumin! Aren't we in 
serious trouble right now?!

19:42.490 --> 19:46.000
Shh! Let's evaluate the situation 
while slowly getting some distance.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.690
Whoa, now, this is just a Rookie Slayer.

19:51.450 --> 19:53.010
Hey, you two!

19:53.390 --> 19:58.070
I rushed here because I caught the 
familiar scent of Lady Wolbach...

19:58.070 --> 20:01.300
So how come I can smell it on you two?

20:01.590 --> 20:06.980
<i>I'm certain now. This demon is 
after my familiar, Chomusuke!</i>

20:07.530 --> 20:11.990
Seems to be particularly strong on you, too.

20:12.640 --> 20:15.150
Well? Care to explain?

20:15.650 --> 20:19.410
Come to think of it, you're the Crimson 
Demons I saw in the forest, right?

20:20.900 --> 20:23.770
There's no way that you 
don't know Lady Wolbach.

20:26.100 --> 20:31.980
Wh-Why do you all seem to call my 
Chomusuke this bizarre name, "Wolbach"?

20:31.980 --> 20:33.790
I'm sure you've got the wrong cat!

20:33.790 --> 20:37.340
If you'd like, I can get you 
another cute black kitten!

20:37.340 --> 20:40.420
So, please, stop harassing my Chomusuke!

20:40.420 --> 20:42.940
Chomusuke? What's that supposed to be?

20:42.940 --> 20:45.820
Actually, I've heard the name before...

20:45.820 --> 20:47.820
I think the shrimp mentioned it.

20:48.390 --> 20:50.690
Come to think of it, 
you kinda look like her...

20:51.010 --> 20:52.190
What shrimp?

20:52.590 --> 20:56.050
I don't wanna get into a beef 
with any Crimson Demons.

20:56.050 --> 21:02.190
Think of it as a deal. You hand Lady 
Wolbach over, and I won't harm you.

21:02.610 --> 21:04.460
Or the town, for that matter.

21:04.460 --> 21:07.150
You expect us to believe a demon?!

21:07.380 --> 21:10.390
Demons always deliver on a deal.

21:10.390 --> 21:13.160
They're absolute for us, 
and totally unbreakable.

21:13.160 --> 21:14.880
So, what's it gonna be?

21:26.630 --> 21:30.750
What do we do? Make a deal with that demon?

21:31.130 --> 21:32.920
I'm not sure yet.

21:33.260 --> 21:38.170
But if handing the furball over actually 
resolves this, it might be a good idea.

21:38.170 --> 21:41.060
You can't believe what that demon says!

21:41.420 --> 21:45.270
Besides, I know they say 
this town is for beginners,

21:45.270 --> 21:47.680
but there are plenty of proper adventurers.

21:47.980 --> 21:49.220
I'm sure someone...
