00:00.760 --> 00:03.680
Now that I have mastered explosion magic,

00:03.680 --> 00:07.370
the time has come to inform
the world of my greatness!

00:07.740 --> 00:12.530
Yes, let the smoke from my explosion
be a signal to the world's mightiest!

00:17.520 --> 00:19.220
W-Wait on a second, please!

00:19.220 --> 00:20.700
Could I have another chance?

00:20.920 --> 00:25.090
Sorry, no. Not looking to
have my store get blown up.

00:25.090 --> 00:27.320
I did it exactly as you said!

00:27.760 --> 00:30.470
Please, I need this job!

00:30.470 --> 00:33.980
I'm running out of options!
Don't turn me away!

01:57.630 --> 02:04.510
<b>KONOSUBA - An Explosion on This Wonderful World!</b>

02:06.020 --> 02:10.310
<b>Episode 6: The Raison D'être of an Explosive NEET</b>

02:08.720 --> 02:10.990
Chekera's place didn't work out, either.

02:11.350 --> 02:14.470
The ticket to Arcanretia is 300,000 eris...

02:14.770 --> 02:16.800
I'm not even close yet.

02:16.800 --> 02:18.160
Hey there, Megumin.

02:18.710 --> 02:20.820
Another day of looking for work?

02:20.820 --> 02:22.490
Why not just give up already?

02:22.490 --> 02:25.520
Why not find a job yourself, Bukkorori?

02:26.320 --> 02:30.080
In time, a battle requiring
my great talents will dawn.

02:30.080 --> 02:32.200
I must sharpen my fangs until then!

02:32.510 --> 02:33.370
See ya.

02:33.710 --> 02:37.500
If you need any kind of help other
than financial, just let me know.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.750
Since we're both NEETs, after all.

02:45.380 --> 02:47.670
I am not a NEET.

02:47.670 --> 02:51.050
A NEET refers to the kind of failure
who has no intention of getting a job.

02:51.050 --> 02:54.380
Someone who wants to work,
but is unable to, is not a NEET!

02:54.380 --> 02:56.850
Right. I'm a job-hunter!

02:59.870 --> 03:01.710
I have returned.

03:02.620 --> 03:04.140
Welcome home!

03:04.860 --> 03:07.590
Hey, Sis, gimme food, please!

03:16.330 --> 03:17.570
It's the Mad Exploder!

03:17.570 --> 03:19.130
The Demon King's army is attacking!

03:19.130 --> 03:21.590
Damn it, he's not escaping tonight!

03:35.670 --> 03:37.940
Megumin!

03:39.450 --> 03:41.550
It's too early for this commotion.

03:41.550 --> 03:44.370
Don't you consider the nuisance
you're being to your neighbors?

03:44.370 --> 03:46.330
How dare you of all people say that?!

03:46.330 --> 03:48.310
What was that explosion last night?!

03:48.310 --> 03:52.460
I'm not sure why you're asking me.
I heard it was the Demon King's army.

03:52.460 --> 03:53.430
Stop playing dumb!

03:53.430 --> 03:57.080
This was the same night after you
got rejected from all those jobs!

03:57.080 --> 04:01.170
Wait, what is this?!
Are you seriously accusing me?

04:01.170 --> 04:04.800
I'm shocked! And I thought
we were friends, Yunyun.

04:05.890 --> 04:10.290
You can't just say that we're friends
and expect me to let anything slide!

04:11.120 --> 04:12.640
Stop it, please!

04:12.640 --> 04:15.970
Fine! I understand!
My brain! My poor brain!

04:16.340 --> 04:20.490
What is wrong with you, firing off
explosion magic inside the village?!

04:16.730 --> 04:17.820
Does this hurt?

04:18.200 --> 04:19.400
How about this?

04:19.760 --> 04:20.490
This hurt?

04:20.490 --> 04:22.470
It's not my fault!

04:20.820 --> 04:21.870
Like this?

04:22.470 --> 04:25.330
Society's to blame for not being
able to utilize my gifts!

04:22.480 --> 04:23.490
That hurt?

04:25.330 --> 04:27.190
How long are you going to use that excuse?

04:26.440 --> 04:28.910
Does it hurt? How about this?

04:27.190 --> 04:29.510
Stop thinking that you're
going to get rich quick,

04:29.510 --> 04:31.380
and start actually working to save money!

04:31.380 --> 04:33.210
I tried my best, okay?!

04:33.210 --> 04:34.930
But it didn't work!

04:33.400 --> 04:34.670
What about this?

04:35.860 --> 04:37.620
What if I pull here?

04:37.560 --> 04:40.220
Oh, fine, then...

04:39.380 --> 04:41.560
Does this hurt? Maybe here?

04:40.220 --> 04:42.630
I've got a few ideas in mind.

04:43.260 --> 04:47.360
A-And I don't want you blowing stuff
up just to let off some steam!

04:47.360 --> 04:49.250
Come on, let's go.

05:18.600 --> 05:21.620
I don't want to see potatoes
again for a long time.

05:26.060 --> 05:28.260
I've had enough of this!

05:28.590 --> 05:31.780
I'm a prodigious magus!

05:31.780 --> 05:35.700
There are as many adventurers
in this wide world

05:35.700 --> 05:38.010
thirsting for my talents as
there are stars in the sky!

05:39.980 --> 05:44.070
How long must I be trapped in this village?

05:44.070 --> 05:45.550
Megumin...

05:45.550 --> 05:50.290
I'll try and find some 
better-paying jobs, so don't—

05:50.290 --> 05:53.180
Yunyun, I need to ask a favor.

05:53.180 --> 05:54.530
What's that?

05:54.870 --> 05:58.190
Care to go on a little date?

05:59.070 --> 06:00.050
Huh?

06:01.230 --> 06:04.560
Explosion!

06:10.960 --> 06:14.370
Another day, another nice explosion.

06:15.300 --> 06:16.980
Wh-What are you doing?!

06:16.980 --> 06:19.280
What do you mean? It's part of my routine.

06:19.280 --> 06:23.290
I need to use my explosion
magic once a day or I die.

06:23.290 --> 06:24.490
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

06:24.490 --> 06:25.910
Stupid Megumin!

06:25.910 --> 06:27.990
Now, Yunyun, please carry me home.

06:27.990 --> 06:28.620
What?!

06:28.620 --> 06:32.850
Right now, I'm as helpless
as a newborn infant.

06:32.850 --> 06:34.290
Now, carry me, please!

06:34.290 --> 06:37.150
I'm going to throttle you if
you don't stop being stupid!

06:39.550 --> 06:42.370
What're you two doing out here?

06:42.620 --> 06:44.290
B-Bukkorori?

06:44.290 --> 06:46.580
What brings you here?

06:46.580 --> 06:49.350
You two heard all that noise, right?

06:49.350 --> 06:52.590
I thought it might be the Mad Exploder,
so I rushed over here.

06:53.040 --> 06:54.660
Did you see him?

06:54.660 --> 06:57.420
And why is Megumin lying on the ground?

06:57.420 --> 06:59.970
W-Well... because...

06:59.970 --> 07:01.610
I saw the Mad Exploder!

07:02.650 --> 07:08.430
We were gaining levels by fighting monsters
in the woods when we had an encounter!

07:08.430 --> 07:09.470
That kind of strength...

07:09.470 --> 07:12.310
I'm certain they must be one of
the the Demon King's enforcers!

07:12.310 --> 07:15.490
Sadly, they escaped after
our valiant struggle...

07:15.490 --> 07:17.980
So that's why you look so ridiculous.

07:17.980 --> 07:19.800
They must've been a truly fearsome foe.

07:19.800 --> 07:22.080
Yes. Most likely a demon.

07:22.080 --> 07:26.000
It was a... demon woman, with a
really luscious body and big horns.

07:26.530 --> 07:29.500
<i>H-How can she just lie like that?</i>

07:35.810 --> 07:37.520
Whew. I'm exhausted.

07:38.260 --> 07:42.390
S-So... for t-tomorrow... um...

07:42.390 --> 07:46.010
Right. I'd appreciate your help in
job searching tomorrow, as well.

07:46.010 --> 07:47.850
O-Okay! See you then.

07:51.930 --> 07:53.200
Good grief...

08:00.250 --> 08:02.670
Chomusuke, I'm home.

08:03.260 --> 08:05.110
What's that look for?

08:06.100 --> 08:09.550
Here now... Is that good?
Is that where you like it?

08:11.040 --> 08:14.980
You're a needy little thing,
aren't you? How about—

08:14.980 --> 08:17.000
Okay, not there!

08:19.110 --> 08:23.010
I apologize for dropping by
so late. Is anyone home?

08:23.010 --> 08:24.810
The door's open. Come right in.

08:33.440 --> 08:35.170
Who might you be?

08:40.850 --> 08:44.740
It's been so long, but I've found you at last,

08:44.740 --> 08:46.300
my glorious mistress.

08:47.980 --> 08:52.080
When I learned the seal had been broken,
I made a great journey to reach this place.

08:53.590 --> 08:55.640
I am called Arnes.

08:55.640 --> 09:00.910
I will serve as an extension of your will,
dedicating my life to your protection.

09:02.610 --> 09:05.970
I knew a day like this would come.

09:07.220 --> 09:10.400
The age of chaos draws near.

09:10.400 --> 09:13.360
You will stand at my side, my servant!

09:15.600 --> 09:19.920
I don't know who you are,
but I appreciate what you've done.

09:19.920 --> 09:22.440
I will attend to my mistress from now on.

09:22.440 --> 09:25.810
Wait. I thought you were talking about me?

09:25.810 --> 09:26.880
No.

09:26.880 --> 09:28.830
Then you're here for...

09:28.830 --> 09:30.000
The one on top of you.

09:34.450 --> 09:35.370
Oh, her.

09:35.800 --> 09:39.500
My glorious mistress,
whose domain is sloth and violence...

09:39.500 --> 09:41.130
Come, let us be on our way.

09:43.020 --> 09:45.000
I don't think she's interested.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.140
You should go now.

09:46.140 --> 09:48.030
W-Wait just a minute!

09:48.030 --> 09:51.110
Lady Wolbach, it's me! Arnes!

09:51.110 --> 09:52.820
Come on! Let's head home together.

09:52.820 --> 09:56.400
I've been through so much
trying to find you!

09:56.400 --> 09:58.060
You're a stubborn one, aren't you?

09:58.060 --> 10:01.390
She doesn't want to go, so that's that.

10:01.390 --> 10:03.810
I-I would never leave your
kindness unrewarded.

10:03.810 --> 10:05.170
I'm prepared to show my gratitude...

10:05.460 --> 10:08.670
What is this? Chomusuke is a
beloved member of this family.

10:08.670 --> 10:10.900
You can't expect money to be enough...

10:12.100 --> 10:15.170
I only have 300,000 eris
on me at the moment.

10:15.170 --> 10:16.880
Three hundred thousand eris?!

10:17.350 --> 10:20.200
You'll have to forgive the paltry sum...

10:20.200 --> 10:23.000
No apologies necessary!
You can have her back right now.

10:23.400 --> 10:24.770
Thank you so much!

10:24.770 --> 10:27.990
Look here! It's your new guardian!

10:27.990 --> 10:29.860
Take care now!

10:30.710 --> 10:31.660
Let go!

10:31.660 --> 10:35.810
U-Um... My mistress seems rather reluctant,

10:35.810 --> 10:37.580
and I'm sure you need to say your goodbyes.

10:37.900 --> 10:39.650
I'll come by again tomorrow.

10:41.270 --> 10:43.410
Sorry about this. Until tomorrow, then.

10:45.590 --> 10:48.230
It's a promise.

10:53.550 --> 10:57.850
Right, so, Chomusuke is going
to be leaving us today.

10:57.850 --> 11:00.300
You mean to tell me you sold her?

11:00.300 --> 11:02.320
The same cat you've been
taking such good care of?!

11:02.320 --> 11:03.310
Unbelievable!

11:03.310 --> 11:07.910
You don't understand! It's tearing
me apart, too! I feel so sad!

11:07.910 --> 11:10.190
But I want that 300,000 eris!

11:11.930 --> 11:15.440
I'm here to retrieve my
mistress, as promised.

11:15.440 --> 11:16.780
Miss Arnes!

11:18.500 --> 11:21.950
Excuse me... What do you mean
when you call her that?

11:21.950 --> 11:25.910
You have my thanks for seeing
to her care all this time.

11:25.910 --> 11:29.660
But it would be wise to not
ask any further questions.

11:30.980 --> 11:31.670
Now...

11:31.670 --> 11:34.010
Let's be on our way, Lady Wolbach.

11:36.460 --> 11:39.240
Ow, ow, ow!
P-Please, cease this horseplay!

11:39.240 --> 11:40.850
Chomusuke, stop it!

11:48.640 --> 11:50.280
A demon?!

11:50.970 --> 11:52.650
So, you've seen.

11:52.650 --> 11:54.540
And a high-ranked demon?

11:54.540 --> 11:56.200
What are you doing here?

11:56.470 --> 12:01.070
You need not worry.
I'm only here for Lady Wolbach.

12:01.070 --> 12:04.730
Hand her over without any trouble,
and you won't be harmed.

12:04.730 --> 12:05.960
I promise.

12:05.960 --> 12:08.740
L-Like we can trust the words of a demon.

12:08.740 --> 12:09.840
That's right!

12:09.840 --> 12:13.090
You're sure to chow down on Chomusuke
as soon as we hand her over!

12:13.090 --> 12:16.730
How impudent. I'll have you know that
demons never break our promises—

12:19.010 --> 12:22.050
P-Promises?

12:23.010 --> 12:24.360
Promises...

12:24.360 --> 12:26.150
Wh-What's wrong?

12:29.010 --> 12:33.050
Promises!

12:39.340 --> 12:40.700
It's not very good tea.

12:43.640 --> 12:44.940
Thank you.

12:45.270 --> 12:48.270
And I apologize for losing
my composure like that.

12:48.270 --> 12:51.190
Um... are you okay?

12:51.190 --> 12:53.460
Yes, I'm feeling a bit better.

12:53.460 --> 12:56.800
You seem to have been through quite a lot.

12:56.800 --> 12:57.710
That's right.

12:58.290 --> 13:02.900
Lately, I seem to be trapped 
in this bizarre energy field...

13:02.900 --> 13:04.230
E-Energy?

13:04.500 --> 13:06.790
And something about it seems to attract men

13:06.790 --> 13:09.530
that are like crystallized
embodiments of trash!

13:09.530 --> 13:12.910
I've been lied to, betrayed, and 
had every promise to me broken!

13:13.230 --> 13:16.570
I've grown quite accustomed
to it at this point...

13:16.570 --> 13:19.980
The bitter taste of deception.

13:20.170 --> 13:22.070
W-Well...

13:22.070 --> 13:23.730
It's fine, though.

13:24.030 --> 13:26.830
Now that I'm safely reunited
with my mistress,

13:26.830 --> 13:29.710
all those tearful days can finally end!

13:29.710 --> 13:32.760
Now, Lady Wolbach, come with me!

13:33.480 --> 13:36.510
W-Well, Chomusuke doesn't
seem to want to leave,

13:36.510 --> 13:38.470
so maybe you could just forget about—

13:38.470 --> 13:41.600
What?! Are you humans breaking 
yet another promise to me?!

13:41.600 --> 13:43.130
Not exactly...

13:43.130 --> 13:45.950
Hey, Megumin. Pardon the intrusion.

13:45.950 --> 13:46.970
Bukkorori?

13:46.970 --> 13:48.380
Wh-What are you doing here?

13:49.760 --> 13:54.010
I could feel this extremely attractive
energy calling to me, so here I am.

13:54.010 --> 13:55.290
Energy...

13:55.650 --> 13:59.650
<i>I can feel it! I sense the energy
of an extremely trashy man!</i>

13:59.870 --> 14:04.170
Hey, Megumin. Is this demon the 
Mad Exploder that's been causing trouble?

14:04.660 --> 14:05.390
That's right!

14:05.390 --> 14:07.150
She's the one who did it!

14:07.150 --> 14:10.530
I see! Here for revenge, huh, 
you treacherous fiend?!

14:10.530 --> 14:11.980
What are you talking about?!

14:11.980 --> 14:14.740
Assemble, my crimson bestial brethren!

14:14.740 --> 14:16.910
The time has come to bear your razor fangs!

14:19.130 --> 14:22.160
Hey! You do realize I have 
to live here, don't you?!

14:24.080 --> 14:25.920
I feel them!

14:28.990 --> 14:33.130
This energy resonating with the abyssal
depths of our souls drives us onward!

14:33.130 --> 14:36.190
My precious students, we're on the way!

14:38.210 --> 14:42.340
I-I can sense it... The energy
of a mass of worthless men...

14:42.860 --> 14:45.840
No more! I can't do this!

14:48.420 --> 14:49.320
You won't escape!

14:58.700 --> 15:01.270
A curse upon humanity!

15:01.270 --> 15:05.530
And death to all worthless men!

15:11.850 --> 15:15.050
I feel kind of bad for that demon,

15:15.410 --> 15:17.860
but at least she didn't take Chomusuke away.

15:17.860 --> 15:23.370
Yes. I was wondering, could you take
care of Chomusuke at your place?

15:23.370 --> 15:25.600
Huh? Where'd that come from?!

15:25.600 --> 15:28.660
I'm thinking of leaving
for my journey tomorrow.

15:28.660 --> 15:29.240
So soon?!

15:29.240 --> 15:30.870
And what about the money?

15:32.080 --> 15:34.840
This should cover the cost of teleportation.

15:34.840 --> 15:35.960
Th-That's so mean!

15:35.960 --> 15:38.080
You're really going to spend it, 
after all that's happened?

15:38.080 --> 15:40.170
Crimson Demons are solitary creatures.

15:40.170 --> 15:43.240
I'm sure we'll meet again,
if it's fated to happen.

15:43.240 --> 15:45.550
Did you tell your parents?

15:45.550 --> 15:50.370
I've told my mother and father that I would
leave when the time is right long ago.

15:50.610 --> 15:51.580
But...

15:52.330 --> 15:54.970
You could take your time.

15:55.770 --> 15:57.400
This is so sudden.

15:57.770 --> 15:59.720
It's not sudden at all.

16:01.080 --> 16:03.620
I've been waiting for over half a year.

16:06.870 --> 16:10.370
That being the case, 
please take care of this furball.

16:17.760 --> 16:21.520
Megumin... You're gonna
come back to the village

16:21.520 --> 16:23.510
once you find that robed woman, right?

16:23.510 --> 16:25.590
No, I won't.

16:25.590 --> 16:29.220
Once I'm out in the world and
have reliable companions,

16:29.220 --> 16:32.990
I may as well slay the Demon King, 
and ascend his throne!

16:32.990 --> 16:35.720
When that happens, 
I'll make you one of my generals.

16:35.720 --> 16:37.060
That is not going to happen!

16:37.060 --> 16:39.510
Why do we have to be bad guys?

16:40.450 --> 16:44.510
You're going to become village chief once
you've learned advanced magic, right?

16:44.510 --> 16:45.750
That's right.

16:46.220 --> 16:50.010
But I don't think that's
gonna happen for a while.

16:50.700 --> 16:53.020
So... y'know...

17:01.470 --> 17:05.220
Well, Yunyun, as my self-proclaimed
rival, I wish you good luck.

17:05.670 --> 17:08.080
But if you try to become one of my generals

17:08.080 --> 17:10.430
after I've already conquered
the world, it'll be too late.

17:10.430 --> 17:12.310
I would never ask for that!

17:12.310 --> 17:15.670
If you become the Demon King, 
I'll come and defeat you!

17:17.490 --> 17:19.180
Until we meet again.

17:20.130 --> 17:22.620
Yeah... See you then.

17:28.190 --> 17:30.430
H-Hey, Megumin!

17:30.430 --> 17:32.470
W-Wait just a sec, okay?

17:50.540 --> 17:56.460
Komekko, if anything happens while I'm
gone, be sure to tell the adults, all right?

17:56.760 --> 17:57.980
Okay, I will.

17:58.420 --> 18:03.150
He might not seem like much, but if you
need help, you can talk to Bukkorori.

18:03.150 --> 18:05.720
He probably won't have
anything better to do.

18:05.720 --> 18:06.990
Okay, I will.

18:06.990 --> 18:09.930
If you get lonely, you should visit Yunyun.

18:09.930 --> 18:11.730
I'm sure she'll be glad to see you.

18:11.730 --> 18:15.830
If anything, she'll probably
be lonelier than you,

18:15.830 --> 18:17.980
so you should check on
her from time to time.

18:18.220 --> 18:19.480
Okay, I will.

18:19.480 --> 18:22.860
My little sister is so clever, and so strong.

18:31.370 --> 18:35.320
Good luck, Sis. Become the 
strongest ever, okay?

18:35.320 --> 18:36.660
Understood.

18:36.660 --> 18:39.100
Consider it a promise, my dear sister.

18:39.100 --> 18:42.900
Once day, I'll be renowned as the
most powerful mage in the world.

18:42.900 --> 18:44.720
Beat up the Demon King, okay?

18:44.720 --> 18:47.350
The... Demon King? That's a little...

18:47.350 --> 18:48.970
Beat him up, okay?

18:48.970 --> 18:50.200
I'll do my best.

18:51.310 --> 18:52.470
Sis?

18:52.470 --> 18:53.490
What is it?

18:54.570 --> 18:56.480
Come home soon, okay?

19:05.480 --> 19:08.160
She should be coming any time now...

19:08.160 --> 19:09.510
What kept you?

19:09.510 --> 19:12.240
Would it kill you to think about those
of us who were waiting all morning?

19:13.440 --> 19:15.390
You all really have nothing better to do?

19:15.390 --> 19:17.870
Just for once, could you
maybe say "thank you"?

19:18.910 --> 19:20.680
Yunyun won't be coming.

19:20.680 --> 19:23.070
She had some important 
discussion with her parents.

19:23.070 --> 19:24.150
I see.

19:24.150 --> 19:25.930
Huh? You're not sad?

19:25.930 --> 19:26.800
Not really.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.590
Not that you'd admit it, anyway.

19:28.590 --> 19:30.760
Whatever. Here you go.

19:30.760 --> 19:31.530
What is it?

19:31.530 --> 19:35.490
A parting gift. A staff made by Funifura's dad.

19:35.490 --> 19:38.150
Thank you. I'll take good care of it.

19:38.150 --> 19:41.670
But what brought this on?
Some sort of tsundere thing?

19:41.670 --> 19:42.920
Of course not!

19:42.920 --> 19:45.560
I just don't like leaving debts unpaid!

19:45.560 --> 19:50.350
Funifura was really grateful for
that medicine you made, Megumin.

19:50.350 --> 19:53.830
What? You mean to tell me your
little brother was <i>actually</i> sick?

19:53.830 --> 19:57.720
I was sure you'd just made up
a story to fleece Yunyun...

19:57.720 --> 19:59.820
I wouldn't go that far!

19:59.820 --> 20:03.600
As creepily obsessed with her brother
as she is, Funifura isn't a bad person!

20:03.600 --> 20:04.420
Hey!

20:05.280 --> 20:08.680
Next is from me. A one-of-a-kind treasure.

20:09.340 --> 20:10.890
Whoa, your eyepatch?

20:11.130 --> 20:14.900
Isn't this the first time
you've taken it off, Arue?

20:14.900 --> 20:16.430
Th-This is a really big deal, actually!

20:16.430 --> 20:19.000
It's a magic item that helps
restrain my magic power.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.810
I was born with more power
than I could control,

20:21.810 --> 20:24.790
so I've been wearing this since I was young.

20:24.790 --> 20:28.460
And you're just gonna give it to Megumin?

20:28.460 --> 20:31.490
It's fine. My dream is to 
become a writer, after all.

20:31.490 --> 20:35.300
I want to write stories
that make people happy.

20:35.300 --> 20:38.920
I'd love to hear about your
adventures someday, Megumin.

20:39.300 --> 20:42.080
Th-That was a lot more
profound than I expected...

20:42.080 --> 20:44.550
Makes the staff seem kinda lame.

20:47.620 --> 20:51.190
I'll treasure all of it just the same.

20:51.460 --> 20:52.770
That's good to know.

20:52.770 --> 20:57.430
Considering that's just a fashion eye
patch with nothing special about it.

20:57.430 --> 20:58.110
Come on!

20:58.110 --> 21:01.320
Authors make up stories. It's what we do.

21:01.630 --> 21:05.580
The teleportation to Arcanretia
is about to activate.

21:05.580 --> 21:08.570
If you're going to be leaving,
please get into position.

21:24.860 --> 21:26.260
Have a good trip.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.240
I'm heading out!

21:35.380 --> 21:37.360
May your journey be blessed!

21:37.360 --> 21:38.390
Teleport!

21:42.170 --> 21:43.910
<i>I am called Megumin.</i>

21:44.270 --> 21:47.000
<i>She who was born in the
village of Crimson Demons...</i>

21:47.000 --> 21:51.180
<i>And she who will, one day,
perfect explosion magic!</i>

23:25.000 --> 23:40.010
<b>Episode 7: "Troublemakers of the City of Water"</b>

23:25.320 --> 23:27.000
Big trouble, Megumin!

23:27.000 --> 23:30.230
You were so excited to leave, but now you're
back to looking for work all the time!

23:30.230 --> 23:32.060
And what do you think you
know about my situation?!

23:32.060 --> 23:35.180
I just hope you don't get so isolated that
you end up joining a weird cult...

23:35.180 --> 23:36.010
That's not happening!

23:36.010 --> 23:38.160
N-Next time, we'll join you for
a business meeting with an...

23:38.160 --> 23:39.570
Explosion!
