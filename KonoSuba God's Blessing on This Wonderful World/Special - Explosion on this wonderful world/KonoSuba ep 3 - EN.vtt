WEBVTT

00:13.490 --> 00:15.300
Aw, I knew it!

00:15.300 --> 00:17.000
I guess I lose again today.

00:23.350 --> 00:24.490
Ow!

00:24.490 --> 00:25.910
What was that for?!

00:25.910 --> 00:28.170
You're the one who wanted to compete to see

00:28.170 --> 00:31.400
who was the more compact, 
environmentally-friendly girl, Megumin!

00:31.400 --> 00:34.480
Perhaps you should ask your own 
blighted heart that question!

00:34.480 --> 00:38.560
M-Megumin, stress isn't great 
for growth, you know.

00:39.980 --> 00:42.420
Oh! You're here, too, Megumin.

00:43.430 --> 00:46.930
One second. I've got something 
nice for you to eat.

00:46.930 --> 00:49.310
Megumin is as cute as ever today.

00:50.190 --> 00:52.880
And Megumin is so fluffy, too.

00:53.200 --> 00:54.820
Okay, here you go.

01:02.090 --> 01:05.090
Aw, you're such a cutie, Megumin!

01:05.790 --> 01:06.950
Come on!

02:28.540 --> 02:35.420
<b>KONOSUBA - An Explosion on This Wonderful World!</b>

02:37.050 --> 02:41.340
<b>Episode 2: Guardians of the Crimson Demon Village</b>

02:39.950 --> 02:42.750
Would someone please give 
this thing a name already?!

02:43.090 --> 02:45.160
I-I get what you mean,

02:45.160 --> 02:48.710
but we've kind of already got it 
in our heads that this is Megumin.

02:48.710 --> 02:53.390
See? She's even warmed up to me 
enough that I can pick her up.

02:53.630 --> 02:57.650
Maybe it'd be better if you were
the one to change your name inste—

02:57.650 --> 02:59.640
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

02:59.640 --> 03:03.270
You traitor! You don't care if your 
rival's name changes, is that it?!

03:03.650 --> 03:08.630
Then how about Ink? 
Little Ink.... H-How's that sound?

03:08.630 --> 03:11.370
Because, y'know... she's a black cat.

03:15.470 --> 03:16.660
No?

03:16.960 --> 03:20.190
Might be a good idea. Weird 
names are easier to remember.

03:20.190 --> 03:21.920
Yeah, as weird as it is.

03:21.920 --> 03:23.550
I-It's weird?

03:23.910 --> 03:28.840
Well, I suppose this freakish "Ink" 
will serve as a label for now.

03:28.840 --> 03:31.990
And should you ever actually 
become my familiar,

03:31.990 --> 03:34.990
I'll provide you with a 
nicer, more sensible name.

03:35.930 --> 03:37.000
Attention!

03:37.000 --> 03:41.180
We've got word that the monsters in 
the area are getting ornery again.

03:41.180 --> 03:43.830
All the adults are going to 
be investigating that today,

03:43.830 --> 03:46.560
so afternoon class will be free 
study in the library! That is all!

04:01.460 --> 04:05.440
Study sessions don't earn you any skill points, 
so they feel like such a waste of time.

04:05.440 --> 04:07.860
I can't wait to learn magic.

04:07.860 --> 04:10.220
Like the adults used the other day.

04:12.500 --> 04:15.680
Knowing you, Arue, I bet you have 
enough skill points saved up

04:15.680 --> 04:17.670
to use advanced magic already.

04:17.670 --> 04:19.520
Not quite yet, no.

04:19.520 --> 04:21.910
But maybe Megumin...

04:24.080 --> 04:29.360
"Users of explosion magic are 
often called 'landmine mages,'

04:29.360 --> 04:32.700
and are frequently excluded 
from adventuring parties."

04:35.060 --> 04:40.330
I've come here so many times, and at some 
point learned everything there is within.

04:46.440 --> 04:48.380
<i>The Unfettered Lord</i>?

04:53.170 --> 04:54.180
Yunyun.

04:55.140 --> 04:58.810
Could you hand that book over to me?

04:58.810 --> 05:03.150
Well, I don't mind, but I didn't 
know you read stuff like this.

05:04.140 --> 05:06.910
<i>Fish Are Friends</i>?

05:06.910 --> 05:09.280
This is clearly not what I meant!

05:09.280 --> 05:11.090
I was talking about <i>The Unfettered Lord</i>!

05:11.090 --> 05:13.590
What? You like this series, too?

05:13.590 --> 05:17.350
It's such a treat! 
I've read it so many times!

05:17.350 --> 05:18.500
Volume two's climax is so—

05:18.500 --> 05:20.300
Cease with the spoilers, please!

05:20.300 --> 05:23.420
And why are you even 
looking at the other one?

05:23.420 --> 05:25.430
Was there nothing that 
applied to mammals, at least?

05:25.430 --> 05:27.410
But look here!

05:27.410 --> 05:30.200
It says that cacti have hearts, too!

05:30.200 --> 05:32.920
That means you can be friends with plants...

05:33.430 --> 05:37.560
Cut it out! What did I do 
to earn that pitying gaze?!

05:37.850 --> 05:41.610
Honestly... If you're that 
desperate for friends,

05:41.610 --> 05:44.150
just take back that claim 
of being my rival, and...

05:44.530 --> 05:47.980
Hey, Yunyun, are you reading 
those weird books again?

05:48.530 --> 05:52.030
If you want friends that bad, how about us?

05:52.800 --> 05:53.870
What did you just say?!

05:53.870 --> 05:55.780
Just now! Say that again?!

05:55.130 --> 05:57.690
Okay, that's close! Too close!

05:57.690 --> 06:00.680
I-I'm just suggesting we could be friends...

06:01.540 --> 06:03.970
If it isn't Funikura and Dodonko.

06:03.970 --> 06:07.060
A friend isn't something 
you can just decide to be.

06:07.060 --> 06:08.800
Friendship happens naturally.

06:08.800 --> 06:12.820
My name is Funifura! Would it kill 
you to learn your classmates' names?

06:12.820 --> 06:17.000
I-It's an honor to be joining you! 
Please, treat me kindly!

06:16.350 --> 06:19.570
Uh, do you... understand 
how friendship works?

06:19.570 --> 06:21.030
You do, don't you?

06:23.180 --> 06:27.780
Anyway, I'm pretty sure this guy is into me.

06:27.780 --> 06:32.020
But the thing is, there's this guy 
from my past life that I promised

06:32.020 --> 06:33.790
to be with if we were reborn, right?

06:33.790 --> 06:36.090
So wouldn't that be, like, cheating?

06:36.090 --> 06:37.790
Oh, it's fine!

06:37.790 --> 06:40.320
I came up with a scenario 
where my prince charming

06:40.320 --> 06:42.700
is imprisoned at the bottom 
of the deepest dungeon...

06:42.700 --> 06:44.590
Er, I mean, I'm pretty sure he <i>is</i> there,

06:44.590 --> 06:48.080
so I want to learn magic fast 
so I can go and save him.

06:48.780 --> 06:52.220
<i>There is something incredibly 
cringeworthy about this conversation.</i>

06:52.220 --> 06:54.210
I-I had no idea.

06:54.210 --> 06:55.720
You two are amazing!

06:56.850 --> 06:59.120
<i>Eh, I'll leave it be.</i>

07:16.630 --> 07:17.370
You little—

07:19.420 --> 07:20.840
How about you, Yunyun?

07:20.840 --> 07:22.240
Do you have a type—

07:22.240 --> 07:25.480
I mean, what was your lover 
like in your past life?

07:25.480 --> 07:26.520
Me?

07:26.520 --> 07:29.880
I-I think I'd like someone 
quiet and mild-mannered,

07:29.880 --> 07:34.440
who's nice enough to hear 
me out and really listen.

07:34.440 --> 07:35.500
Well, that's bland.

07:35.500 --> 07:36.800
It really is.

07:37.230 --> 07:39.150
Huh? Where'd the hair tie go?

07:44.600 --> 07:45.780
Need ammo...

07:49.560 --> 07:50.850
Gonna borrow this!

08:01.740 --> 08:03.090
Victory is mine!

08:03.090 --> 08:04.380
Megumin!

08:04.380 --> 08:06.120
<b>KONOSUBA - An Explosion on This Wonderful World!</b>

08:08.390 --> 08:11.720
Were you seriously snapping hair 
ties for fun?! Are you a child?!

08:11.720 --> 08:13.690
You've got it all wrong! There was a spider!

08:13.690 --> 08:16.500
He captured my attention with 
his taunting, and, well...

08:16.500 --> 08:17.940
"Well" what?!

08:18.530 --> 08:21.820
I've never had a friend do my hair before!

08:21.820 --> 08:26.940
L-Look, Megumin does seem sorry, 
and we can always do your hair again...

08:26.940 --> 08:28.400
I'm so sorry, Funifura!

08:28.400 --> 08:32.930
You did such a wonderful job... I was 
ready to never change my hair again...

08:32.930 --> 08:35.180
Th-There's no need for that, seriously!

08:35.180 --> 08:37.350
It's too much! A little too much attachment!

08:39.340 --> 08:42.470
You girls seem to be enjoying 
your adolescence.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.590
Bukkorori?

08:46.000 --> 08:48.330
What's the village NEET doing here?

08:48.330 --> 08:50.610
You managed to learn Teleport, then?

08:50.610 --> 08:51.590
Indeed!

08:51.590 --> 08:56.340
All thanks to you girls leaving me to 
struggle with that extreme situation.

08:56.340 --> 08:59.610
On that day, something within me awakened...

08:59.970 --> 09:03.490
But wait, in terms of 
Teleport destinations...

09:03.490 --> 09:07.090
Right. You can only register three 
readily-available locations.

09:07.090 --> 09:08.920
So why the library?

09:09.440 --> 09:11.130
Nostalgia, mostly.

09:11.130 --> 09:17.890
I used to subtly check out the books 
that I knew Soketto had checked out.

09:17.890 --> 09:20.420
She's quite an enthusiastic learner, you see.

09:20.420 --> 09:22.110
So in addition to fortune-telling books,

09:22.110 --> 09:24.430
she'd read self-improvement, 
and romance novels...

09:24.430 --> 09:27.990
And a few titles I'd be embarrassed 
to mention out loud.

09:27.990 --> 09:32.680
But one day, she suddenly 
stopped visiting the library.

09:32.680 --> 09:37.080
It seems she was heading into the woods to 
train every day, so I started doing the same.

09:37.080 --> 09:41.370
Oh, but of course, my other Teleport 
location is in front of her house!

09:41.370 --> 09:43.260
I can't exactly go inside, after all!

09:43.740 --> 09:46.140
Wait... So he's a stalker?

09:46.140 --> 09:47.890
We've gotta tell someone! Report him!

09:47.890 --> 09:51.530
B-But the adults are all busy 
with the investigation...

09:51.530 --> 09:54.980
Investigation? What investigation? 
No one told me anything.

09:55.280 --> 09:57.980
Anyway, I'm here today to 
ask you girls for advice—

09:59.370 --> 10:01.500
Forget about it, and rest. Eternally.

10:01.500 --> 10:03.460
Let's bury him!

10:03.460 --> 10:05.080
Now, hang on—

10:05.360 --> 10:07.260
Whoa, that's—

10:07.260 --> 10:10.110
That's a lot! That's a lot of books! 
Too many!

10:10.110 --> 10:12.500
I didn't want to get lost 
in the stacks like this!

10:12.500 --> 10:16.830
Just wait a sec! Hear me out!

10:22.200 --> 10:25.410
I've known Bukkorori since I was little,

10:25.410 --> 10:27.880
and he has always been 
worthless to the core.

10:27.880 --> 10:32.720
Doesn't that make him kind 
of like a brother to you?

10:32.720 --> 10:34.090
Aren't you a little attached?

10:34.090 --> 10:35.070
Not at all, no.

10:37.320 --> 10:41.020
My soul sisters...

10:51.540 --> 10:54.030
Soketto is as beautiful as ever today.

10:54.030 --> 10:57.480
I wish I was trash so that 
I could be swept up at her feet.

10:57.480 --> 11:00.290
As a NEET, aren't you 
basically trash already?

11:00.290 --> 11:01.470
M-Megumin!

11:01.470 --> 11:04.600
And to be hung up on the Crimson 
Demon's foremost beauty,

11:04.600 --> 11:08.300
when you're nothing but a 
completely unremarkable NEET.

11:08.300 --> 11:11.200
We should go. There's no hope here.

11:11.200 --> 11:13.560
I'm begging you two!

11:13.560 --> 11:16.690
Go and ask Soketto what her type is for me!

11:16.690 --> 11:21.950
She's a fortune-teller! Just have 
her read your romantic fortune!

11:21.950 --> 11:23.410
Is that some kind of NEETist joke?!

11:23.410 --> 11:26.890
If I could afford it, I'd get my 
fortune read every damn day!

11:26.890 --> 11:30.950
Look, I'll treat you! Next time I get 
some cash, I'll treat you to a meal!

11:30.950 --> 11:33.120
Um, that really isn't the issue...

11:33.120 --> 11:34.550
And you'll treat Komekko, too?

11:34.550 --> 11:36.330
But of course, my sister!

11:36.330 --> 11:37.210
Megumin?!

11:37.500 --> 11:41.230
I think the trick is just creating 
the initial opportunity.

11:57.200 --> 11:58.370
Listen well.

11:58.370 --> 12:00.940
First, Yunyun, you'll threaten Soketto

12:00.940 --> 12:04.400
with that almost entirely 
ornamental dagger of yours.

12:04.400 --> 12:06.860
That's when Bukkorori, 
who is coincidentally walking by...

12:06.860 --> 12:08.610
...saves her in the nick of time!

12:10.130 --> 12:13.180
No way! This is stupid! Are you stupid?!

12:13.180 --> 12:15.280
Then the dagger is completely ornamental?

12:15.280 --> 12:17.870
If you're not going to use it, it'll just rust.

12:17.870 --> 12:20.480
I-I just don't see the need!

12:20.480 --> 12:23.810
Beating monsters in this area 
offers a pretty high bounty,

12:23.810 --> 12:26.540
so he could use that money to 
have her read his fortune...

12:26.540 --> 12:27.350
Rejected.

12:27.730 --> 12:30.790
As Crimson Demons, we must strive 
for the cooler alternative.

12:30.790 --> 12:31.730
Bingo.

12:34.720 --> 12:35.490
Here.

12:38.780 --> 12:40.660
Light of Reflection!

12:43.020 --> 12:44.790
Okay, I'm counting on you!

12:45.010 --> 12:46.880
Why go invisible?!

12:46.880 --> 12:51.170
Obviously so he can save her with 
the coolest timing possible.

13:01.860 --> 13:04.030
I-Is that NEET...

13:26.330 --> 13:29.230
What is your problem?! 
Day after day, you do this!

13:29.230 --> 13:32.720
I-I promise, it wasn't anything untoward!

13:32.720 --> 13:35.800
It was genuine intellectual 
curiosity, as a mage,

13:35.800 --> 13:38.870
to know which colors are popular 
among Crimson Demon women!

13:38.870 --> 13:42.340
Bukkorori has something he 
wants to tell you, Soketto.

13:42.340 --> 13:42.890
Wha—

13:42.890 --> 13:47.780
Really? What a coincidence. 
I wanted to tell you something, too.

13:49.250 --> 13:52.190
M-Me, too... Soketto, I've always—

13:52.190 --> 13:54.780
I had no idea you hated me so much!

13:54.780 --> 13:56.970
You should've said something sooner!

13:57.970 --> 14:00.500
I don't know what it is 
that bothers you so much,

14:00.500 --> 14:02.800
but it's cowardly how you 
follow me around everywhere!

14:02.800 --> 14:05.310
And to go so far as to try to ambush me?!

14:05.310 --> 14:07.800
N-No! This... It's not what you...

14:19.820 --> 14:22.110
One-Punch Bears don't usually travel in packs!

14:22.110 --> 14:25.360
Th-They said that the monsters 
have become more active

14:25.360 --> 14:27.330
since the seal on the Dark God is weakening!

14:28.090 --> 14:32.430
Now, Yunyun, the time has come for that 
stylish dagger of yours to go to work.

14:32.430 --> 14:33.590
Megumin?!

14:33.590 --> 14:34.840
It's all right.

14:35.310 --> 14:37.320
You two stay behind me.

14:38.100 --> 14:39.390
I've got this.

14:44.090 --> 14:46.900
I want to protect your smile.

14:48.440 --> 14:51.110
Diabolic flames, run wild!

14:51.110 --> 14:53.060
Inferno!

15:02.460 --> 15:05.420
Soketto?!

15:05.680 --> 15:07.430
How stupid can you be?!

15:07.430 --> 15:10.930
I mean, I only know advanced magic, 
so it's hard to hold back!

15:16.440 --> 15:20.610
Every single day with you...

15:20.610 --> 15:23.750
But this time, it ends.

15:28.280 --> 15:29.330
Honestly...

15:30.050 --> 15:34.250
If you were desperate enough to enter the 
woods to earn cash for a fortune-reading,

15:34.250 --> 15:37.930
you could have just told me, and I would've 
given you your first session for free.

15:37.930 --> 15:39.460
Really?!

15:45.610 --> 15:48.570
Well, I was almost burnt 
to death in the process,

15:48.570 --> 15:52.330
but you did technically save 
me from a pack of monsters.

15:52.330 --> 15:55.490
So, what did you want to know about?

15:55.720 --> 15:59.970
W-Well, I was thinking... 
my future girlfriend...

15:59.970 --> 16:01.540
No, wife!

16:01.540 --> 16:04.900
Or maybe, the person who'll 
fall in love with me?

16:04.900 --> 16:07.100
Oh, I don't know which to choose!

16:07.390 --> 16:09.620
Your future lover, in other words.

16:10.520 --> 16:15.590
The woman you're likely to end up with 
should appear in the crystal ball soon.

16:19.440 --> 16:22.400
It shouldn't be long now...

16:27.970 --> 16:30.070
I don't see anything...

16:30.070 --> 16:31.330
H-Huh?

16:32.740 --> 16:39.340
That's odd. Everyone usually has 
at least <i>one</i> person who appears...

16:41.600 --> 16:47.100
Wh-What is this? It hurts way worse 
than if she had just rejected me!

16:47.100 --> 16:50.760
I know he's a NEET, but even I feel bad now.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.150
What should we do? 
I wasn't expecting it to be this bad.

16:53.150 --> 16:54.940
I can hear you both, y'know!

16:54.940 --> 16:59.460
Could you rake my soul over hot coals 
somewhere I don't have to hear it?!

16:59.460 --> 17:04.370
I-It's all right! 
My fortunes aren't always correct.

17:04.370 --> 17:06.960
I tried to predict the weather 
once, when I was little,

17:06.960 --> 17:10.050
and even though I got "mostly cloudy," five 
minutes later, there was a slight drizzle...

17:10.950 --> 17:16.990
The world sucks!

17:19.680 --> 17:23.140
As much of a failure as he is, 
he seems kind of interesting.

17:23.610 --> 17:24.930
It's strange.

17:25.460 --> 17:27.190
Um...

17:27.190 --> 17:28.420
What is it?

17:28.420 --> 17:33.340
U-Um, have you ever read your 
own fortune, Soketto?

17:33.340 --> 17:35.080
About your destined mate, for example...

17:35.320 --> 17:39.080
Fortune-tellers can't 
predict their own future.

17:40.240 --> 17:44.960
When it comes to my own fate, 
the crystal ball won't show anything.

17:45.810 --> 17:47.070
Why do you ask?

17:47.070 --> 17:48.310
N-No reason.

17:48.920 --> 17:53.470
I'm just struck by how, sometimes, 
you really have to put things into words.

17:57.480 --> 18:00.420
Am I the only one who gets 
really hungry right about now?

17:59.620 --> 18:01.580
Tell me about it!

18:02.350 --> 18:04.970
I want something soft to eat...

18:04.020 --> 18:05.540
You need only express how you feel!

18:05.540 --> 18:06.260
Got it!

18:06.260 --> 18:10.490
Do you think things will work 
out for those two someday?

18:11.530 --> 18:17.660
Hard to say. Soketto's fortunes do tend to 
come true, but the future is malleable.

18:18.010 --> 18:22.250
If only he could be honest and 
say he wants to get to know her.

18:22.940 --> 18:27.620
I honestly think Bukkorori needs to 
find a job before anything else.

18:27.620 --> 18:29.990
He still owes me a meal.

18:30.320 --> 18:34.620
I've always wanted to ask, Megumin. 
Is food really all you want?

18:34.620 --> 18:38.260
Have you never thought about 
finding someone nice?

18:38.260 --> 18:43.110
I have grand ambitions. That doesn't 
afford time for romantic tomfoolery.

18:43.110 --> 18:46.470
But you want to be an adventurer, right?

18:46.470 --> 18:50.910
If you spend all your time with someone 
from your party, helping each other out...

18:50.910 --> 18:55.390
True enough. And I do hear that's 
how a lot of marriages come to be.

18:55.390 --> 18:58.930
Whatever the case, 
if I were to fall for someone,

18:58.930 --> 19:03.360
I'm sure he'd be a dashing, peerless hero!

19:03.700 --> 19:07.780
I wouldn't be too surprised if you 
ended up with someone normal.

19:10.640 --> 19:11.450
Attention!

19:11.450 --> 19:13.700
So, after examining the Dark God's tomb,

19:13.700 --> 19:16.570
we've learned that lower level monsters 
have begun to wander the vicinity!

19:16.570 --> 19:20.890
Until the seal is fully restored, nobody 
walks home alone! Use the buddy system!

19:20.890 --> 19:22.050
That is all!

19:22.480 --> 19:25.130
Huh? W-Walking home with someone?

19:30.870 --> 19:32.680
If you insist...

19:32.680 --> 19:35.460
Hey, Yunyun. You're probably 
headed home alone, right?

19:35.460 --> 19:36.850
Wanna walk with us?

19:36.850 --> 19:41.460
You're the only one with a weapon, after all. 
I'd feel better knowing you're there.

19:54.490 --> 19:56.650
M-Megumin!

20:01.880 --> 20:05.050
Weren't you going home with 
Funifura and Dodonko?

20:05.050 --> 20:08.390
W-Well, you know... The monsters!

20:08.390 --> 20:13.230
It's dangerous to go home alone. 
So I thought... w-we could...

20:14.050 --> 20:17.840
Are you serious about protecting 
me with that dagger?

20:17.840 --> 20:19.980
Huh? Oh... Yeah! I am!

20:21.060 --> 20:24.280
I am the foremost prodigy 
among the Crimson Demons.

20:24.280 --> 20:26.680
And far more talented than you, Yunyun.

20:26.680 --> 20:28.370
I'd rather you not underestimate me.

20:28.370 --> 20:29.880
Wh-What's the attitude for?

20:29.880 --> 20:33.370
You used me as a shield from those 
One-Punch Bears the other day!

20:41.030 --> 20:43.990
Very well! It's time I settled 
things once and for all

20:43.990 --> 20:46.390
with my self-proclaimed rival, Yunyun!

20:46.390 --> 20:47.700
S-Self-proclaimed?!

20:47.700 --> 20:49.330
I mean, I can't deny that...

20:49.330 --> 20:53.600
Okay, then! You can decide the 
contest, as usual, Megumin!

21:03.400 --> 21:06.560
She scared me. It was just Ink, huh?

21:08.240 --> 21:09.740
She's lost some weight.

21:09.740 --> 21:12.620
I doubt I have to worry about 
Komekko trying to eat her anymore.

21:21.110 --> 21:22.210
Yunyun.

21:24.880 --> 21:29.720
Let's walk home together. We can 
pick up something to eat on the way.

21:31.820 --> 21:33.220
R-Really?!

21:33.990 --> 21:37.090
B-But we're rivals!

21:37.090 --> 21:39.480
Rivals going home together 
would be weird, right?

21:39.480 --> 21:44.350
B-Besides, you make it sound nice, 
but I know you'll just be after my food!

21:45.970 --> 21:47.330
Never mind, then.

21:47.330 --> 21:48.690
Hey, wait!

21:48.690 --> 21:53.690
T-Tomorrow! We can resume 
the rivalry tomorrow!

23:25.000 --> 23:40.020

23:25.270 --> 23:27.130
Big trouble, Megumin!

23:27.130 --> 23:29.130
Funifura's little brother is sick!

23:29.130 --> 23:30.370
There's talk about raising funds for him.

23:30.370 --> 23:30.960
Very well!

23:30.960 --> 23:33.260
Then let's mask up and rob 
the local apothecary.

23:33.260 --> 23:34.130
As her friends!

23:34.130 --> 23:36.480
That'd be criminal! 
And it wouldn't solve the problem!

23:36.480 --> 23:38.590
N-Next time, we'll be at your job with an...

23:38.590 --> 23:40.590
Explosion!
