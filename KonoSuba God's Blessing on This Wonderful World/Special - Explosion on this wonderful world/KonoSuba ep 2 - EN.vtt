00:03.920 --> 00:05.100
Hey, hey!

00:05.100 --> 00:08.210
You gals on your way back from 
school? I've got great low prices.

00:08.210 --> 00:10.520
Take a look! These deals are today only.

00:13.770 --> 00:15.850
I was wondering what you wanted...

00:15.850 --> 00:20.140
But "I've always dreamed of shopping for 
cute trinkets with a friend after school"?

00:21.130 --> 00:23.930
So mean! Why would you say that?

00:23.930 --> 00:25.620
For one thing, we're not friends.

00:30.020 --> 00:32.220
What? The daggers?

00:32.220 --> 00:34.350
Yeah. They're so pretty.

00:34.350 --> 00:35.960
You want one?

00:35.960 --> 00:37.040
Yeah.

00:39.850 --> 00:43.350
And Megumin picked it out for you? Wow.

00:43.590 --> 00:45.820
Yeah! She said this one was better!

00:46.310 --> 00:48.210
Don't get the wrong idea!

00:48.210 --> 00:50.990
You were taking way too long 
to make up your mind,

00:50.990 --> 00:54.700
so I simply pointed at the 
one I thought was the best!

00:56.150 --> 00:58.510
What is with you today? Honestly!

00:59.460 --> 01:00.620
Now, Yunyun...

01:00.620 --> 01:03.980
I bet you're going to say, 
"Time for another duel!" again today.

01:03.980 --> 01:06.550
Well, I've thought up a delightful game!

01:12.580 --> 01:14.710
Take your precious dagger,

01:14.710 --> 01:18.380
and stab between my fingers as many 
times and as quickly as possible!

01:18.380 --> 01:19.050
What?!

01:19.050 --> 01:21.140
Go on! Get to it!

01:21.140 --> 01:22.800
Ready, go!

01:22.800 --> 01:25.100
One... two...

01:25.330 --> 01:27.400
Whoa! H-Hang on! Just hold on a sec!

01:27.400 --> 01:29.220
I can't do this! No way!

01:29.220 --> 01:30.580
What's the matter?

01:30.580 --> 01:33.970
If you can't stab between every 
finger before I count to ten,

01:33.970 --> 01:36.230
you'll have lost, Yunyun!

01:36.540 --> 01:40.560
Five... six... seven...

01:40.560 --> 01:44.260
I don't care, then! 
Let's just say I lost today! Again!

01:44.260 --> 01:46.720
I'll give you my lunch, too!

03:21.010 --> 03:24.090
<b>Episode 2: The Magic Academy's Taboo</b>

03:22.590 --> 03:24.100
I'm home!

03:25.140 --> 03:27.100
Welcome home, Sis!

03:28.570 --> 03:31.490
Oh, my! You're covered in dirt.

03:32.820 --> 03:35.460
I thought you were supposed 
to watch the house.

03:35.460 --> 03:37.810
Were you playing outside again?

03:37.810 --> 03:43.020
Yep! I beat up the newspaper guy, 
and then I went and played.

03:43.580 --> 03:46.980
Another victory? As befits my little sister.

03:46.980 --> 03:50.250
I found a toy, too, 
so I've been playing with it!

03:50.250 --> 03:51.670
You wanna try?

03:51.670 --> 03:52.870
A toy?

03:54.710 --> 03:56.940
Something on you smells good, Sis!

03:56.940 --> 03:59.390
Ah, as perceptive as ever, little sister.

04:00.680 --> 04:02.070
I brought you something.

04:02.070 --> 04:05.390
An offering to the magical deity: 
a lamb sandwich!

04:06.090 --> 04:09.400
Now, feast until your stomach bursts!

04:12.900 --> 04:15.850
Wow! I feel like the Devil King himself!

04:15.850 --> 04:19.640
Let's save the dinner I 
caught for tomorrow, then.

04:20.520 --> 04:22.460
You caught something?

04:22.460 --> 04:23.860
Yep! A big one.

04:23.860 --> 04:26.070
Such familial piety!

04:26.070 --> 04:27.850
Well done, Komekko.

04:30.320 --> 04:31.960
Hang on a sec!

04:33.600 --> 04:36.740
<i>I wonder what she caught.</i>

04:36.740 --> 04:39.310
<i>Cicadas? Or crickets, perhaps?</i>

04:39.310 --> 04:42.450
<i>Beetles are a little earthy for my liking,</i>

04:42.450 --> 04:44.510
<i>but that can be fixed with deep-frying.</i>

04:47.240 --> 04:48.270
That's...

04:48.270 --> 04:53.260
Look! A fierce ebon beast that I 
felled after a battle to the death!

04:56.270 --> 05:00.130
Well, you certainly did catch a big one.

05:00.130 --> 05:01.860
Yep! I worked hard!

05:01.860 --> 05:05.470
It fought back at first, 
but it settled down after I bit it!

05:07.740 --> 05:13.210
I'm glad you won the battle, but you really 
shouldn't go around biting things randomly.

05:13.210 --> 05:14.460
I shouldn't?

05:22.580 --> 05:23.870
Want some?

05:23.870 --> 05:28.180
I'm full, so you can have it all.

05:28.180 --> 05:31.850
More importantly, will you 
relinquish this furball to me?

05:31.850 --> 05:32.700
Okay!

05:33.860 --> 05:37.230
<i>Well, now, what am I going to do with you?</i>

05:47.260 --> 05:48.570
Megumin...

05:49.570 --> 05:51.570
M-Megumin!

05:51.570 --> 05:55.460
Good morning. What's that 
concerned look for?

05:55.880 --> 05:57.180
Where'd she come from?

05:57.180 --> 05:58.040
She's my familiar.

05:58.040 --> 05:59.330
A familiar?!

05:59.330 --> 06:04.450
I thought wizards with familiars 
were strictly a fairy tale thing!

06:06.100 --> 06:09.390
Look! It's making such an 
adorable, but impudent face!

06:09.390 --> 06:12.050
It's terrifying! A perfect innocent-kitty act

06:12.050 --> 06:14.930
to hide her intention to steal 
our lunches for her mistress!

06:16.910 --> 06:20.000
I hate to do it! But here's my lunch...

06:20.000 --> 06:23.350
<i>That should make feeding 
her a lot more affordable.</i>

06:23.650 --> 06:27.820
<i>This level of popularity, though... 
Maybe she has some kind of charm magic?</i>

06:30.100 --> 06:31.620
She's so fluffy...

06:35.730 --> 06:38.650
So, did you name her yet?

06:38.650 --> 06:39.970
Not yet, no.

06:39.970 --> 06:43.340
Familiar or not, are you sure it was 
a good idea to bring her to school?

06:43.340 --> 06:45.680
My home environment poses some threats

06:45.680 --> 06:48.370
that make me uncomfortable 
leaving her there alone.

06:48.370 --> 06:49.620
Wait, what threats?

06:49.940 --> 06:53.380
She's so cute... but will 
our teacher say it's okay?

06:56.530 --> 06:57.890
Denied.

06:57.890 --> 07:02.140
Sir, this cat is my familiar, 
who feeds off of my magical power!

07:02.140 --> 07:04.400
If we're separated, 
she'll die in short order.

07:04.400 --> 07:08.940
Denied. You can't even use magic, 
and you're claiming to have a familiar?

07:08.940 --> 07:11.790
The school's rules say no 
familiars and no snacks.

07:11.790 --> 07:14.040
Go on, take it back to where you found it.

07:14.040 --> 07:17.220
Sir! You are looking at a 
fragmented aspect of my soul,

07:17.220 --> 07:18.870
the incarnation of my dark side!

07:18.870 --> 07:21.120
We cannot be separated!

07:21.480 --> 07:24.750
What? A fragmented aspect of your soul?

07:24.750 --> 07:29.290
Not only that, but if we're separated, 
she'll go berserk, grow gigantic, and—

07:29.290 --> 07:30.430
All right, I'll allow it!

07:30.430 --> 07:33.430
Yes, she'll unleash a mysterious 
dark matter on the—

07:33.740 --> 07:35.370
Wait, really?

07:35.370 --> 07:38.100
That one sounded pretty good, after all.

07:38.100 --> 07:40.150
Megumin, you get ten points!

07:40.950 --> 07:45.020
Besides, I've got a feeling this 
will be good, so I'll allow it.

07:45.470 --> 07:48.060
Well, thank you very much.

07:48.570 --> 07:52.900
Now that we've settled this familiar 
matter, let's begin class...

07:53.280 --> 07:57.650
is what I'd normally say, but today's 
lesson will be a little special.

07:57.880 --> 07:59.410
A special lesson?

07:59.630 --> 08:02.270
The seal on one of our 
village's tourist attractions,

08:02.270 --> 08:04.850
the tomb of the Dark God, is weakening.

08:04.850 --> 08:07.740
This has caused the monsters in 
the area to become more active.

08:08.590 --> 08:10.320
Simmer down, now!

08:10.320 --> 08:12.650
The village's unemployed...

08:12.650 --> 08:15.000
I mean, our brave and otherwise 
unoccupied residents

08:15.000 --> 08:16.640
have dealt with the dangerous monsters.

08:16.640 --> 08:19.270
Any that are left will be on the weak side.

08:19.270 --> 08:20.050
Which is why...

08:22.090 --> 08:24.730
You will all take part in the traditional

08:24.730 --> 08:28.540
Crimson Demon augmentation surge, 
in order to raise your levels quickly!

08:28.540 --> 08:32.060
I expect to see you all in 
the courtyard in 30 minutes!

08:32.060 --> 08:35.580
Figure out your groups 
beforehand, also! That is all!

08:38.280 --> 08:40.990
I guess we've gotta make groups...

08:40.010 --> 08:42.440
With only 30 minutes to figure 
it out? Better be quick.

08:43.610 --> 08:44.980
What is it?

08:44.980 --> 08:48.620
W-Well.... it's a group 
activity, apparently...

08:48.620 --> 08:49.980
And what of it?

08:50.330 --> 08:52.960
Well... you see...

08:53.710 --> 08:57.580
Megumin, if you don't have a partner, 
would you care to join me?

08:57.580 --> 08:58.610
That's fine.

09:02.460 --> 09:05.460
Good grief... Yunyun, this time—

09:05.460 --> 09:08.070
Hey, Yunyun! Wanna be in our group?

09:08.430 --> 09:11.590
You're usually left out. You should join us.

09:11.590 --> 09:13.040
A-Are you sure?

09:13.040 --> 09:14.880
Of course. You're our classmate, right?

09:14.880 --> 09:16.370
So we're basically friends.

09:16.370 --> 09:17.870
F-Friends?!

09:17.870 --> 09:19.160
Come on, let's go.

09:19.160 --> 09:20.330
Sure!

09:25.610 --> 09:26.820
So this...

09:27.480 --> 09:28.310
is cuckolding.

09:28.310 --> 09:29.720
That's not what it is!

09:32.760 --> 09:35.390
All right, time for the 
special lesson to begin.

09:35.640 --> 09:38.740
If you don't have your own 
weapon, use one of these.

09:46.380 --> 09:52.260
We Crimson Demons can use our magical power 
to temporarily amplify our body's strength!

09:52.520 --> 09:56.270
As long as you focus your mind, 
this ability should come naturally.

09:56.580 --> 09:58.820
You go first, Arue.

10:00.550 --> 10:04.230
Magical power within... 
travel the paths of my blood,

10:04.230 --> 10:06.710
and grant my limbs great strength!

10:10.000 --> 10:11.800
Wow!

10:14.120 --> 10:18.410
S-Sir! These are all hollow, 
and really light.

10:20.260 --> 10:22.280
Minus five points, Yunyun.

10:27.530 --> 10:31.360
We will now perform the 
Crimson Demon secret rite,

10:31.360 --> 10:32.680
the augmentation surge.

10:32.930 --> 10:34.490
Freeze Bind!

10:40.070 --> 10:42.830
All right, now slay this thing.

10:43.060 --> 10:44.600
Augmentation surge?

10:44.600 --> 10:48.030
And it's just... beating a 
monster that's held in place?

10:48.260 --> 10:52.130
It's on the verge of dying thanks 
to my magic anyway. Relax!

10:52.130 --> 10:58.040
Now, who will be the champion to claim 
victory over this abominable monster?!

11:03.240 --> 11:06.740
The first blow should be struck 
by the most prodigious.

11:06.740 --> 11:08.340
Consider it done!

11:08.340 --> 11:09.300
Megumin!

11:09.300 --> 11:13.410
That's the spirit. No wonder 
you're top of the class.

11:13.410 --> 11:16.460
All right, I need to prepare 
the rest of the ritual,

11:16.460 --> 11:18.450
so make sure to boost those levels.

11:20.520 --> 11:23.370
H-Hey... Are you really going to do this?

11:23.370 --> 11:24.760
As sad as it makes me,

11:24.760 --> 11:27.840
this is our fate as Crimson Demons, 
whose lives are a battlefield.

11:27.840 --> 11:31.940
<i>Being able to level up just by 
finishing off a near-dead monster...</i>

11:31.940 --> 11:32.840
<i>Easy!</i>

11:34.040 --> 11:38.090
Now, servant of great evil. 
Open your ears to my requiem,

11:38.420 --> 11:40.970
and fall into eternal slumber!

11:46.270 --> 11:49.180
W-Wait! It's not weakened at all!

11:50.200 --> 11:52.950
Damn you! Insolent cold-blooded fiend!

11:52.950 --> 11:55.510
Hear the primal cry of my physical verbiage!

12:00.690 --> 12:03.060
I-I win!

12:03.450 --> 12:05.200
<b>KONOSUBA - An Explosion on This Wonderful World!</b>

12:10.710 --> 12:13.230
Y-Yunyun, hurry up and do it!

12:13.230 --> 12:15.240
We need to finish here and 
move on to the next one!

12:15.240 --> 12:18.640
B-But... it looked me right in the eye...

12:18.640 --> 12:22.430
You're the second-ranked honor 
student! Show us how it's done!

12:29.860 --> 12:31.610
S-Sorry, I just can't!

12:31.610 --> 12:32.290
What?!

12:32.290 --> 12:35.750
We're Crimson Demons! 
We're way more fierce than that!

12:35.750 --> 12:39.030
It should be easy to finish 
off an immobilized monster!

12:39.030 --> 12:42.050
Are you really having so much 
trouble with that small fry?

12:44.410 --> 12:49.770
Go on! Claim the doe-eyed 
sacrifice before you!

12:49.770 --> 12:50.840
Why are you so strong?!

12:50.840 --> 12:54.040
Q-Quit it! No! No!

12:55.070 --> 12:57.480
We are the ruthless Crimson Demons.

12:57.480 --> 13:00.470
Felling a monster that can't 
flee should be child's play!

13:00.470 --> 13:03.460
I'm sorry! I'm really sorry, so please stop!

13:03.460 --> 13:04.790
It keeps going, "Kew!"

13:04.790 --> 13:07.010
Better to end it quickly, then!

13:07.010 --> 13:07.950
I'm sorry!

13:07.950 --> 13:11.090
Megumin! You're making Dodonko cry!

13:28.950 --> 13:31.700
What was that?! What <i>was that</i>?!

13:31.700 --> 13:33.510
So a gargoyle is free...

13:33.510 --> 13:35.870
Another sign of the Dark God's 
impending release?

13:35.870 --> 13:38.990
What is a dangerous monster 
like that doing here?!

13:38.990 --> 13:42.150
Most likely, one of the 
petrified ornaments got loose.

13:42.150 --> 13:44.160
What exactly is a petrified ornament?!

13:44.160 --> 13:47.200
The hot new hobby among some 
of the adults, apparently.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.590
Now that you mention it...

13:56.130 --> 13:58.820
Why can't those people ever 
do anything helpful?!

14:03.830 --> 14:05.690
Burning Flash!

14:14.890 --> 14:16.580
Wh-What was that?

14:19.080 --> 14:23.360
Hey! I thought I finally heard 
a familiar voice. It's Megumin!

14:23.360 --> 14:24.840
B-Bukkorori?!

14:24.840 --> 14:26.590
Wait, who is this?

14:26.590 --> 14:28.350
I think he's...

14:28.350 --> 14:31.980
Are you girls friends with Megumin?

14:32.350 --> 14:34.230
I am called Bukkorori!

14:34.230 --> 14:37.820
Arch wizard, and wielder of advanced magic!

14:37.820 --> 14:40.320
The son of the foremost cobbler 
among the Crimson Demons,

14:40.320 --> 14:42.820
and he who shall inherit the shoe shop!

14:43.720 --> 14:47.470
So, would you girls mind 
hauling me out of here?

14:47.470 --> 14:52.110
I'm more curious about what you're doing in 
the middle of the woods, and also, in a hole.

14:52.920 --> 14:54.490
It's all for Soketto.

14:54.740 --> 14:59.180
Soketto, as in the foremost 
Crimson Demon beauty?

14:59.180 --> 15:03.580
Right. And Bukkorori here is, 
er... Soketto's stalker.

15:03.580 --> 15:07.810
I'm not a stalker! 
I'm just honest about my love.

15:08.200 --> 15:11.850
Yes, it was for that very love 
that I dug this pitfall.

15:12.110 --> 15:15.440
Soketto comes to this forest 
every day, by herself, to train.

15:15.930 --> 15:20.090
She's beautiful, cute, and strong, too?! 
You're cheating, Soketto, my dear!

15:20.090 --> 15:23.760
Now, she prefers to use 
lightning attack magic,

15:23.760 --> 15:27.070
which tends to leave you blinded 
right after the flash, right?

15:27.300 --> 15:31.470
Which means it'd be perfectly natural 
for her to fall into a hole that I dug

15:31.470 --> 15:33.560
without even realizing it!

15:33.560 --> 15:36.460
She can't use Teleport yet, after all.

15:36.460 --> 15:38.270
I'm sure she'll be stuck, with no way out.

15:38.270 --> 15:41.120
Which is when I arrive to save her!

15:41.120 --> 15:44.750
It was a lot of work to get it 
to just the right depth, y'know.

15:45.610 --> 15:46.540
See?

15:47.910 --> 15:50.590
Just within arm's reach, right?

15:51.690 --> 15:53.310
Ew!

15:53.620 --> 15:59.110
Anyway, I forgot that I can't use 
Teleport yet either, and so here I am.

16:01.180 --> 16:05.290
Now, girls, please pull me to freedom!

16:06.410 --> 16:07.860
That's just plain creepy.

16:07.860 --> 16:08.830
Unbelievable...

16:08.830 --> 16:09.780
Gross.

16:09.780 --> 16:11.000
B-But why?!

16:11.000 --> 16:14.520
I just wanted a legitimate 
way to hold Soketto's hand!

16:15.470 --> 16:18.280
If only you could redo your 
life from the fetal stage.

16:18.280 --> 16:19.280
From a fetus?!

16:19.680 --> 16:21.960
This is a fine place for a landfill.

16:21.960 --> 16:23.990
Whoa, hang on! Don't leave me!

16:23.990 --> 16:25.770
Help me out of here, at least!

16:25.770 --> 16:27.810
Aw, come on! Please! Hey!

16:37.570 --> 16:41.330
O-Oh, no! The village! 
What's everyone doing?!

16:41.330 --> 16:42.460
No way!

16:45.330 --> 16:47.060
Light of Saber!

16:52.810 --> 16:55.930
Prized students of our academy...

16:55.930 --> 16:56.790
Teacher!

16:56.790 --> 16:57.840
You girls all right?

16:57.840 --> 16:59.050
W-We are!

16:59.050 --> 17:02.280
But the village... There's a horde 
of gargoyles attacking the village!

17:02.280 --> 17:03.250
If this keeps up...

17:04.300 --> 17:05.340
Right...

17:06.080 --> 17:11.250
Who could have predicted my ornamental 
gargoyles causing this disaster?

17:11.250 --> 17:13.890
Is this the curse of the crimson eyes?

17:13.890 --> 17:18.020
Or perhaps judgment 
delivered to man in his arrogance?

17:18.020 --> 17:20.980
My dear students, worry not.

17:20.980 --> 17:26.640
Before you stands the battle-hardened 
Lord of the Red Prison!

17:27.090 --> 17:30.510
And it is not only us who head 
into this dance of death!

17:31.890 --> 17:33.690
I am called Chekera!

17:33.690 --> 17:37.310
Arch wizard and owner of the foremost 
clothing store among the Crimson Demons!

17:37.310 --> 17:38.820
I am called Shikobei!

17:38.820 --> 17:41.730
Arch wizard and the foremost fisherman 
among the Crimson Demons!

17:41.730 --> 17:43.350
I am called Chakamiya!

17:43.350 --> 17:46.340
Arch wizard and owner of the foremost 
bakery among the Crimson Demons!

17:46.340 --> 17:47.920
I am called Torosuke!

17:47.920 --> 17:51.930
Arch wizard and owner of the foremost 
café among Crimson Demons!

17:52.280 --> 17:55.900
The time has come to pool 
our collective power!

17:55.900 --> 17:58.810
Light of Saber!

17:58.810 --> 18:02.950
King of the storm! The time has come 
to display your despotic grandeur!

18:02.950 --> 18:04.930
Inferno!

18:04.930 --> 18:09.520
Infernal flames that consume creation! 
Scorch the foes before me into oblivion!

18:09.520 --> 18:11.690
Energy Ignition!

18:17.440 --> 18:19.000
W-Wow!

18:19.000 --> 18:21.730
They're blowing those gargoyles 
away as if they were ants!

18:21.730 --> 18:26.100
All who stand in defiance of the 
crimson eyes are reduced to cinders!

18:27.630 --> 18:29.650
That's advanced magic...

18:29.650 --> 18:34.750
We'll be learning amazing magic like 
that before we graduate, won't we?

18:34.750 --> 18:37.190
<i>It's true that these spells 
are all impressive.</i>

18:37.620 --> 18:40.200
<i>Devastatingly so. And yet...</i>

18:40.520 --> 18:43.910
<i>This isn't it. It's not what I want!</i>

18:45.690 --> 18:47.510
<i>Heat that burns your skin,</i>

18:48.190 --> 18:50.020
<i>a shock wave that leaves you trembling,</i>

18:50.420 --> 18:52.510
<i>the scent of blasted earth...</i>

18:52.510 --> 18:55.820
<i>Glaring light that stabs the eyes, 
and the painful smoke!</i>

18:56.320 --> 18:58.400
<i>Compared to the magic she used...</i>

18:58.750 --> 19:02.410
<i>This is completely different, 
compared to explosion magic!</i>

19:02.950 --> 19:04.060
Tornado!

19:04.060 --> 19:05.130
Earth Shaker!

19:05.130 --> 19:06.960
Call of Thunderstorm!

19:11.120 --> 19:12.620
H-Huh?

19:14.000 --> 19:16.590
My family's pub... is on fire?

19:17.840 --> 19:20.650
Crimson Laser!

19:22.830 --> 19:27.340
Laser! Laser! Laser! Laser!

19:23.890 --> 19:25.470
Whoa, hold up!

19:25.470 --> 19:27.910
Uh, teachers? Stop!

19:27.910 --> 19:29.640
You've done enough!

19:29.640 --> 19:32.920
Dimension Hell Break!

19:36.790 --> 19:40.580
Burn, burn! The bonfire of 
celebration is at hand!

19:50.150 --> 19:52.640
Our beautiful village...

19:53.460 --> 19:57.130
After surviving for countless 
eons, the final paradise...

19:57.480 --> 20:02.010
our utopia, once called the 
treasure of Dragon's Peak...

20:02.010 --> 20:03.570
has been reduced to this!

20:04.260 --> 20:07.260
This... was our storefront decoration...

20:11.840 --> 20:13.460
A pox upon the Dark God!

20:13.810 --> 20:18.140
It's trampled our peaceful, modest lives!

20:18.910 --> 20:22.020
Uh, I'm pretty sure you all were 
the ones mostly responsible...

20:22.340 --> 20:25.360
At the hands of wicked creatures,

20:25.360 --> 20:27.260
the sky has been dyed red,

20:27.260 --> 20:30.430
the earth has been rent asunder, 
and the water has turned foul.

20:31.840 --> 20:35.730
But our Crimson Demon blood cannot 
be allowed to die out here!

20:35.730 --> 20:38.920
This is a trial we must overcome!

20:39.280 --> 20:40.930
Headmaster...

20:59.230 --> 21:01.300
It's pretty impressive that they were able

21:01.300 --> 21:04.070
to rebuild the village after 
a single day, huh, Megumin?

21:05.070 --> 21:07.870
But the headmaster and the others

21:07.870 --> 21:10.960
got chewed out by the parental association 
after what happened, Megumin!

21:11.830 --> 21:16.750
Of course they did! My mom was complaining 
about having to do overnight repairs.

21:16.750 --> 21:18.280
Is that really the problem?

21:18.280 --> 21:22.440
Lack of sleep is worse for your 
skin than gargoyles, huh, Megumin?

21:23.860 --> 21:26.000
Hold on one minute here.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.150
Why is this black furball 
being called Megumin?

21:29.150 --> 21:33.630
Well, she's your familiar, 
and a fragment of your soul, right?

21:33.630 --> 21:37.520
And since she doesn't have a name, 
it makes sense to call her Megumin.

21:37.520 --> 21:38.720
Right, Megumin?

21:38.720 --> 21:41.140
Please cut that out! Seriously, stop!

21:41.140 --> 21:42.650
What's with you?

21:42.650 --> 21:47.050
Did your alter ego end up taking your 
intellect and reason along with your charm?

21:47.050 --> 21:48.530
Isn't she awful, Megumin?

23:24.960 --> 23:39.970

23:25.310 --> 23:26.720
Big trouble, Megumin!

23:26.720 --> 23:30.220
That alum, Bukkorori, is being weird 
and asking for romantic advice!

23:30.220 --> 23:33.150
Wow, a completely worthless NEET putting 
his creepiness on full display!

23:33.150 --> 23:34.580
That's harsh! Isn't he 
like your big brother?

23:34.580 --> 23:36.480
I've never once considered 
that thing to be my brother.

23:36.480 --> 23:39.040
So mean! N-Next time, 
we'll be at your school with an...

23:39.040 --> 23:41.040
Explosion!
