1
00:00:10,292 --> 00:00:13,372
Darkness, that's unfair.

2
00:00:16,552 --> 00:00:19,678
All right. Very good.

3
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:21,729
-Just do as you please.
-Kazuma,

4
00:00:21,832 --> 00:00:25,032
make room for me, the exalted Aqua.

5
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:26,520
What?

6
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:28,890
I'm level 21,

7
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,570
the highest level in this team.

8
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:34,910
How dare a rookie
has no sense of propriety?

9
00:00:35,008 --> 00:00:38,559
If you get it, make room for me.
I want to sit in front of the fireplace.

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,568
What?

11
00:00:41,824 --> 00:00:45,829
I don't think your attributes
have risen since I first saw you.

12
00:00:46,019 --> 00:00:47,459
Kazuma, you fool.

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,960
My attributes were obviously
maxed out from the very beginning.

14
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:55,230
This is the difference between
ordinary adventurers and me.

15
00:00:55,686 --> 00:00:58,566
In this case, I can only
whip out my deadly teleport.

16
00:00:58,936 --> 00:01:00,856
Megumin, you're so cunning.

17
00:01:01,556 --> 00:01:02,556
These are the rules.

18
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:04,699
Destroyer, explosion!

19
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:07,179
What's wrong with you?

20
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:09,049
You're being very obedient.

21
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:14,336
That explains why
her intelligence doesn't improve

22
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:16,355
no matter how much she levels up.

23
00:01:17,419 --> 00:01:20,099
Kazuma, why are you crying?

24
00:01:20,335 --> 00:01:23,775
Why are you looking at me with sympathy?

25
00:01:24,179 --> 00:01:25,179
Good night.

26
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:27,005
Wait a minute, Kazuma.

27
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:29,269
We acquired a mansion.

28
00:01:29,874 --> 00:01:34,114
The biggest problem of getting through
winter has finally been solved.

29
00:01:34,622 --> 00:01:37,182
Although there are still
many problems to be solved...

30
00:01:37,339 --> 00:01:40,019
Darn it. What's the matter?

31
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:00,139
What are you two doing here?

32
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,760
Kazuma, you scared the hell out of me.

33
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:07,936
I have known these
two adventurers recently,

34
00:02:08,224 --> 00:02:09,569
Keith and Dust.

35
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:11,419
You're way too jumpy.

36
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:13,803
Is there something down this way?

37
00:02:17,766 --> 00:02:21,334
This is the secret of male adventurers.

38
00:02:21,984 --> 00:02:24,050
Have you heard of a shop
covertly run by succubi...

39
00:02:24,202 --> 00:02:27,202
that lets you have nice dreams?

40
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,719
Tell me all about it.

41
00:02:44,659 --> 00:02:55,419
(KONOSUBA:
God's Blessing on This Wonderful World!)

42
00:03:16,772 --> 00:03:20,312
(Episode 9: God's Blessing
On This Wonderful Shop!)

43
00:04:18,506 --> 00:04:22,106
I don't think I could have come
into a place like this on my own.

44
00:04:23,072 --> 00:04:24,087
Welcome!

45
00:04:25,196 --> 00:04:26,316
This way, please.

46
00:04:27,448 --> 00:04:28,448
All right.

47
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,110
Please come this way.

48
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,030
-All right.
-All right.

49
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,656
Please wait just a moment.

50
00:04:45,638 --> 00:04:46,656
You are...

51
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:50,859
Welcome to the entrance to hell.

52
00:04:50,963 --> 00:04:54,289
Do your best, you daredevil.

53
00:04:56,061 --> 00:04:57,581
I can hardly wait.

54
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:01,699
His occupation is a professional tailor.

55
00:05:02,407 --> 00:05:04,167
He's not an adventurer!

56
00:05:04,735 --> 00:05:05,735
Sir.

57
00:05:06,425 --> 00:05:07,470
Sir.

58
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,088
Yes.

59
00:05:09,407 --> 00:05:12,367
Is this your first time to our shop?

60
00:05:12,456 --> 00:05:13,603
Yes.

61
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:16,192
-Let me explain it to you.
-Thank you.

62
00:05:16,299 --> 00:05:17,664
We succubi has established

63
00:05:17,806 --> 00:05:21,664
a mutually beneficial relationship
with the male adventurers of the city.

64
00:05:21,753 --> 00:05:25,568
Many adventurers live in stables, right?

65
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:26,720
-Yes.
-Therefore,

66
00:05:26,816 --> 00:05:29,348
I believe that males
get pent-up in various ways.

67
00:05:29,443 --> 00:05:32,143
However, they're unable
to do anything about it

68
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:33,932
since there are other adventurers
sleeping all around them.

69
00:05:35,606 --> 00:05:37,926
I've nothing to feel guilty about.

70
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:41,091
Yes. There's nothing
to feel guilty about.

71
00:05:41,392 --> 00:05:45,512
If they were to try to make a move on
a female adventurer who slept nearby,

72
00:05:45,664 --> 00:05:49,636
the other adventurers would notice it
and beat them into submission.

73
00:05:50,275 --> 00:05:53,755
If there's someone who
tries to mess around with,

74
00:05:53,843 --> 00:05:56,706
his you-know-what could be
cut off with a hidden dagger.

75
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,524
Has that actually happened to anyone?

76
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:06,261
Also, succubi give male adventurers
dreams that bring them relief.

77
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:09,619
We do end up taking
a bit of your vitality.

78
00:06:09,716 --> 00:06:13,676
Of course it won't affect
your adventures and daily life.

79
00:06:15,945 --> 00:06:18,768
That's great.

80
00:06:19,314 --> 00:06:21,514
If everyone could be
in a constant state of afterglow,

81
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,620
there would be no war in this world.

82
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:28,659
Please write your desired dream
on this questionnaire sheet.

83
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:31,744
There are entries

84
00:06:31,844 --> 00:06:35,355
for the customer's condition, gender
and appearance in the dream.

85
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:37,420
What does it mean?

86
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:41,009
Some customers want to be prince or hero.

87
00:06:41,361 --> 00:06:45,041
There are also some
customers who want to be women.

88
00:06:45,491 --> 00:06:47,131
Is that so?

89
00:06:48,134 --> 00:06:50,414
There are also those who
wish to return to boyhood,

90
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:55,633
and get pushed down
by the strong female adventurer.

91
00:06:57,516 --> 00:07:00,836
Are the men in this city all right?

92
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:06,539
What about partner preferences?
How can you actually configure these?

93
00:07:06,798 --> 00:07:08,160
Their personality, speech patterns,

94
00:07:08,299 --> 00:07:10,304
appearance and even
how much they like you.

95
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,874
It can be anything or anyone,

96
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:14,819
no matter they exist
in the real life or not.

97
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,138
Really?

98
00:07:16,608 --> 00:07:17,664
Yes.

99
00:07:17,952 --> 00:07:20,764
It means from celebrities
to people around me,

100
00:07:20,864 --> 00:07:22,818
and even a fantasy girl
would be possible?

101
00:07:22,894 --> 00:07:26,254
Yes, even though I don't know
what fantasy girl means.

102
00:07:27,278 --> 00:07:30,678
That shouldn't be illegal, right?

103
00:07:31,196 --> 00:07:33,716
No problem, because this is a dream.

104
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,707
You're right.

105
00:07:36,796 --> 00:07:40,916
That means there's no restriction
on the partner's age, right?

106
00:07:41,066 --> 00:07:43,406
I don't intent to ask
for that sort of thing.

107
00:07:43,476 --> 00:07:44,992
I'm just asking.

108
00:07:45,152 --> 00:07:47,937
There's no restriction.
Please write your preferred settings.

109
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:51,179
Are you sure that it doesn't matter?

110
00:07:51,641 --> 00:07:54,041
Is it an act which
goes against regulations?

111
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,341
No problem, because this is just dream.

112
00:07:57,536 --> 00:07:59,341
You're right.

113
00:07:59,906 --> 00:08:02,386
Yes, there will be
no problem in the dream.

114
00:08:02,506 --> 00:08:03,726
That's wonderful.

115
00:08:03,808 --> 00:08:06,832
Succubi erotic dream
services are the greatest.

116
00:08:07,298 --> 00:08:09,348
Please be careful

117
00:08:09,472 --> 00:08:10,796
not to drink too much this evening.

118
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,440
If you sleep soundly,
we can't show you any dream.

119
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,280
Yes, I understand it.

120
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,828
Konosuba.

121
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:21,032
I'm back.

122
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,420
Be glad, Kazuma.

123
00:08:28,512 --> 00:08:30,579
Today's dinner is awesome.

124
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,140
It's crab! Crab!

125
00:08:32,256 --> 00:08:35,256
My family sent them to
congratulate us on moving in.

126
00:08:36,086 --> 00:08:38,406
It's a super high-grade coral crab,

127
00:08:38,496 --> 00:08:40,960
and it even came with
top-quality champagne.

128
00:08:41,076 --> 00:08:42,616
It said it's to thank their
daughter's teammates

129
00:08:42,752 --> 00:08:44,128
for always taking care of her.

130
00:08:44,226 --> 00:08:45,822
Is this a gift for everyone?

131
00:08:46,036 --> 00:08:49,276
I can't believe I'm lying
my eyes on coral crabs.

132
00:08:49,386 --> 00:08:53,026
I've never been more glad about
joining the team than I am today.

133
00:08:53,235 --> 00:08:55,090
Is it that luxurious?

134
00:08:55,264 --> 00:08:56,448
Of course!

135
00:08:56,544 --> 00:09:00,928
If you told me I could eat this crab
in exchange for not using my magic,

136
00:09:01,036 --> 00:09:02,956
I would restrain myself with pleasure,

137
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,568
and unleash my magic after I've eaten it.

138
00:09:05,888 --> 00:09:07,920
That's how luxurious it is.

139
00:09:08,206 --> 00:09:09,949
Is that so?

140
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,160
Why did you say at the end?

141
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,120
No!

142
00:09:38,907 --> 00:09:40,107
I can't stop myself.

143
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,864
Kazuma, give me the fire.

144
00:09:52,996 --> 00:09:56,436
I'll teach you a tasty way to drink this.

145
00:09:57,201 --> 00:09:58,407
Here you are. Tinder!

146
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:04,300
Just put a crab shell filled
with the crab innards here.

147
00:10:09,154 --> 00:10:10,481
It should be ready.

148
00:10:19,207 --> 00:10:20,607
I want to try it too.

149
00:10:23,643 --> 00:10:25,016
This is a trap.

150
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:27,439
The succubus lady told me

151
00:10:27,616 --> 00:10:30,406
if I drink too much and sleep soundly,
I won't be able to dream.

152
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:32,864
Are you not going to drink?

153
00:10:33,034 --> 00:10:34,554
I'll go first, then.

154
00:10:34,936 --> 00:10:36,016
Calm down.

155
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:38,119
I'm a man with self-restraint.

156
00:10:38,441 --> 00:10:42,001
A man who possesses a will of steel
and the strength to endure.

157
00:10:45,726 --> 00:10:46,944
It tastes so good.

158
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,129
It's really delicious.

159
00:10:48,224 --> 00:10:49,472
Don't tempt me.

160
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,916
Don't tempt me.

161
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,440
I'm sure I can't stop
myself once I take a sip.

162
00:10:53,664 --> 00:10:54,859
I want to drink it too.

163
00:10:54,962 --> 00:10:56,842
Just for today. I'll be just fine.

164
00:10:56,928 --> 00:10:57,960
No way.

165
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,240
I heard that someone will become
silly when starting drinking in childhood.

166
00:11:00,336 --> 00:11:03,616
Let's juice up! I feel so good now.

167
00:11:03,736 --> 00:11:06,616
Let me show you all my new
party trick for the first time.

168
00:11:06,755 --> 00:11:07,795
A trick of fingers.

169
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,640
The mobile fortress, Destroyer!

170
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:16,116
The form, the shape and the movements.
It's the Destroyer for sure.

171
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:18,378
I can't believe you could
mimic that movements.

172
00:11:18,619 --> 00:11:21,536
What is the Destroyer?

173
00:11:21,676 --> 00:11:23,906
Aqua, do it again.

174
00:11:24,004 --> 00:11:26,753
Art isn't something you
can just show it when asked.

175
00:11:26,866 --> 00:11:30,746
It's something that presents itself
naturally when the soul commands it.

176
00:11:31,683 --> 00:11:32,961
Kazuma, what's the matter?

177
00:11:33,354 --> 00:11:36,434
Didn't the food my family
sent suit your taste?

178
00:11:36,608 --> 00:11:39,006
No. The crab is very delicious.

179
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,472
It's just that I drank with
my friends just now,

180
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,320
and I don't think I can drink anymore.

181
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,240
Let's drink again tomorrow.

182
00:11:46,895 --> 00:11:47,936
I see.

183
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:52,269
Don't give me such a genuine smile.

184
00:11:52,426 --> 00:11:56,386
You normally blurt out nothing
but nasty stuff that creeps me out.

185
00:11:56,859 --> 00:11:59,059
At least you have to eat more.

186
00:11:59,457 --> 00:12:00,537
It's my thanks for everything.

187
00:12:01,194 --> 00:12:03,754
I feel a little guilty.

188
00:12:04,619 --> 00:12:09,243
Yes. I should just drink with them
and forget about the dream.

189
00:12:09,783 --> 00:12:11,823
Take a good look at my teammates.

190
00:12:11,985 --> 00:12:14,385
Think about which is more important.

191
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,800
There's nothing to hesitate at all.

192
00:12:22,634 --> 00:12:24,571
Although it's still quite early,

193
00:12:24,888 --> 00:12:26,528
I'm going to sleep first.

194
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:28,482
Goodnight, everybody.

195
00:12:29,153 --> 00:12:30,713
Konosuba.

196
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,560
Oh no, my heart is pounding now.

197
00:12:38,334 --> 00:12:40,122
What shall I do?

198
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:44,471
I'm nervous and I can't sleep.

199
00:12:55,573 --> 00:12:57,531
Although it's just a dream,

200
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,352
etiquette is still very important.

201
00:13:15,785 --> 00:13:17,905
The light is turned off?

202
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:24,589
Wait a minute.

203
00:13:24,739 --> 00:13:27,739
I felt drowsy earlier
and just closed my eyes.

204
00:13:27,979 --> 00:13:30,219
That would mean this is...

205
00:13:31,565 --> 00:13:32,623
a dream?

206
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,580
This moon is so beautiful tonight.

207
00:13:56,951 --> 00:14:00,170
I always imagined she has a sexy body,

208
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,701
but it's better than I imagined.

209
00:14:03,102 --> 00:14:06,208
Maybe the succubus adjusted her body
figure according to my preferences.

210
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,920
You are Kazuma?

211
00:14:10,564 --> 00:14:12,324
What's the matter, Darkness?

212
00:14:16,699 --> 00:14:21,139
Come over here.
You can start by washing my back.

213
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,138
What's with that reaction?

214
00:14:27,212 --> 00:14:30,212
It's different as usual. I like it.

215
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,560
Anyhow, why are you the one
to appear in my dream?

216
00:14:34,128 --> 00:14:37,408
Maybe I shouldn't have requested a
beautiful older woman with a hot body?

217
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,352
What are you talking about?

218
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:42,240
Kazuma, how...

219
00:14:42,362 --> 00:14:44,512
how could you ask me to
wash your back so calmly?

220
00:14:44,608 --> 00:14:47,991
you even said it's a dream.

221
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,214
Everything happened too fast.

222
00:14:49,312 --> 00:14:50,814
My brain can't quite keep up.

223
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:54,219
Playing hard-to-get wasn't
one of the setting I chose.

224
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,066
Anyway, I did write that...

225
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:59,030
I wanted a shy older woman
who's inexperienced.

226
00:14:59,179 --> 00:15:00,379
It's not bad now.

227
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,125
I have no idea that you
were set to be inexperienced.

228
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:07,731
Come and help me wash my back.

229
00:15:08,036 --> 00:15:10,876
In this situation,

230
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,181
is washing your back
considered common sense?

231
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:17,793
Hurry up, I can't stand with it anymore.

232
00:15:17,888 --> 00:15:21,529
Do you really understand
what's going on right now?

233
00:15:21,696 --> 00:15:23,758
If Aqua or Megumin found out about this,

234
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,680
why don't we all just
take a shower together?

235
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:29,586
What's wrong with you?

236
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:32,416
What's wrong with you today?

237
00:15:32,544 --> 00:15:34,516
You're so noisy from the beginning.

238
00:15:34,624 --> 00:15:35,744
What time do you think it is?

239
00:15:35,872 --> 00:15:37,459
Think about how much
you're bothering the neighbors.

240
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,808
Even if you don't understand common
sense, you can't be insensible.

241
00:15:39,948 --> 00:15:43,988
Although you're saying something
sensible in this situation,

242
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:47,552
am I the one who has no common sense?

243
00:15:47,659 --> 00:15:48,928
Am I the strange person?

244
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,560
You have been so strange all the time.

245
00:15:52,186 --> 00:15:55,466
Since it's a dream, I guess it's
no problem if you make noise.

246
00:15:55,907 --> 00:15:58,467
Forget it, please help me wash my back.

247
00:16:09,327 --> 00:16:10,927
Why is this happening?

248
00:16:11,168 --> 00:16:14,088
It's pathetic that my disposition

249
00:16:14,176 --> 00:16:17,193
prevents me from resisting
when you order me brazenly.

250
00:16:17,404 --> 00:16:19,524
This is a new experience for me.

251
00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:21,947
I'm the one who's
usually creeped out by you.

252
00:16:22,263 --> 00:16:25,343
So, it's nice seeing you being shy
and embarrassed for a change.

253
00:16:26,489 --> 00:16:30,769
You're talking and acting
like an old man today.

254
00:16:31,211 --> 00:16:33,411
That's enough, right?

255
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:36,289
Can I leave now?

256
00:16:36,376 --> 00:16:38,198
Don't be foolish.

257
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,968
I know I set you to be inexperienced,

258
00:16:40,086 --> 00:16:42,006
but don't you even know
what to do after this?

259
00:16:42,086 --> 00:16:43,588
Wash me without using a towel.

260
00:16:44,015 --> 00:16:45,535
This is not right!

261
00:16:45,619 --> 00:16:47,829
No matter how inexperienced I am,

262
00:16:47,968 --> 00:16:49,320
you've gone too far!

263
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:53,920
-Hurry up.
-It's absolutely strange.

264
00:16:54,016 --> 00:16:55,816
Hurry.

265
00:16:57,072 --> 00:16:59,659
Hurry up.

266
00:17:04,532 --> 00:17:05,812
Here's an intruder.

267
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,051
Come here, everyone.

268
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,184
There's an intruder in the house.

269
00:17:09,739 --> 00:17:10,819
It's Aqua's voice.

270
00:17:10,936 --> 00:17:13,824
I don't remember
having such a tortuous setting.

271
00:17:13,971 --> 00:17:16,001
Does that guy want to mess with my dream?

272
00:17:16,096 --> 00:17:17,280
I've to complain about it.

273
00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:19,339
Kazuma.

274
00:17:21,379 --> 00:17:22,578
Aqua!

275
00:17:22,979 --> 00:17:24,059
Look.

276
00:17:24,136 --> 00:17:27,936
An intruder got trapped in my barrier.

277
00:17:28,073 --> 00:17:29,713
We've got another suspicious guy here!

278
00:17:29,829 --> 00:17:31,149
Who's that suspicious guy?

279
00:17:34,443 --> 00:17:35,883
She's a succubus.

280
00:17:36,739 --> 00:17:40,459
This succubus got caught in the
barrier and now she's immobilized.

281
00:17:40,547 --> 00:17:42,907
She must be coming after you, Kazuma.

282
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:46,757
What's happening? This is strange.

283
00:17:46,979 --> 00:17:50,619
Darkness who's in the bathroom is...

284
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:53,789
I'll do an exorcism right away.

285
00:17:53,888 --> 00:17:55,756
Just be good and let us destroy you.

286
00:17:57,546 --> 00:17:59,226
It's your time to die.

287
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,160
I'm going to use a
powerful magic to destroy you.

288
00:18:09,136 --> 00:18:10,208
Run away.

289
00:18:10,899 --> 00:18:12,219
However,

290
00:18:12,553 --> 00:18:13,584
what are you doing?

291
00:18:13,696 --> 00:18:16,916
She's a devil who came to
attack you and steal your vitality.

292
00:18:17,024 --> 00:18:18,506
Are you insane, Kazuma?

293
00:18:19,979 --> 00:18:22,579
Sir, it's all my fault.

294
00:18:22,752 --> 00:18:23,833
I'm incompetent.

295
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,570
I can't break into your dream.

296
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,639
I can't allow you to humiliate yourself.

297
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,640
I'll accept my elimination.

298
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:32,919
Just pretend that
you don't know anything.

299
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:36,414
Sir.

300
00:18:36,596 --> 00:18:37,876
What do you want to do?

301
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,350
I'm a goddess.
I won't let go of this devil.

302
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:47,179
If you don't want us to beat you
into submission, move aside then.

303
00:18:50,489 --> 00:18:54,089
Kazuma has been charmed by that
succubus and he's under her control.

304
00:18:54,436 --> 00:18:57,596
He's been acting weird
since a little while ago.

305
00:18:57,739 --> 00:19:00,416
He's been talking about
setting up his dreams.

306
00:19:00,579 --> 00:19:01,979
He must be controlled by the succubus.

307
00:19:02,186 --> 00:19:05,280
The hateful succubus put me
through so much humiliation.

308
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,920
I must slaughter you!

309
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,780
Kazuma, although she's cute,
she is a devil after all.

310
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,084
She's a monster.

311
00:19:11,171 --> 00:19:12,876
Have you gone mad?

312
00:19:13,423 --> 00:19:14,432
Go.

313
00:19:15,312 --> 00:19:16,352
Anyhow,

314
00:19:16,544 --> 00:19:20,859
it seems I have to beat
Kazuma up right here and now.

315
00:19:21,138 --> 00:19:23,264
Once I've pulverized you,

316
00:19:23,584 --> 00:19:26,439
I'll send her to hell.

317
00:19:31,932 --> 00:19:32,960
Fine.

318
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:42,619
I've something that I must protect.

319
00:19:46,009 --> 00:19:48,405
Come on!

320
00:19:58,216 --> 00:20:00,456
The succubus ran away.

321
00:20:01,354 --> 00:20:02,674
I'd better toss some salt.

322
00:20:03,761 --> 00:20:04,904
Konosuba!

323
00:20:05,407 --> 00:20:07,107
THE NEXT DAY

324
00:20:15,016 --> 00:20:17,896
Don't be mad at me.
Please listen to my explanation.

325
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:21,600
Besides, I think
you were part of the problem,

326
00:20:21,725 --> 00:20:23,285
since you were affected
by the atmosphere too.

327
00:20:28,379 --> 00:20:32,739
Can't you remember
what happened last night?

328
00:20:33,579 --> 00:20:37,320
It seemed that you were
controlled by the succubus,

329
00:20:37,781 --> 00:20:39,261
and forgot everything.

330
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,320
What a pity. I can't remember anything.

331
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:45,098
I just know that I had a sweet dream.

332
00:20:45,407 --> 00:20:46,967
Is that so?

333
00:20:47,072 --> 00:20:48,096
That's good.

334
00:20:49,936 --> 00:20:51,347
Forget it.

335
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,220
It was sort of an accident.

336
00:20:53,328 --> 00:20:55,288
I'll try to forget about it too.

337
00:20:55,659 --> 00:20:59,239
I was controlled by
the succubus last night.

338
00:21:00,081 --> 00:21:01,441
That's the story I'm going with.

339
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:03,488
A reasonable explanation
fell into my lap...

340
00:21:03,648 --> 00:21:04,935
so, I may as well go with it.

341
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:08,832
Anyway, you were
overbearing at that time,

342
00:21:08,939 --> 00:21:10,179
and a little scary,

343
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:12,119
but it wasn't bad.

344
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:16,059
I just can't accept that
you ordered me around,

345
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,256
and also said that I'm ignorant.

346
00:21:17,466 --> 00:21:18,866
Anyway,

347
00:21:18,956 --> 00:21:21,636
you're not an ignorant lady.

348
00:21:21,834 --> 00:21:23,994
Brush up your common sense a little more.

349
00:21:24,899 --> 00:21:29,370
So, that incident wasn't
my fault in any way, right?

350
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:31,388
I lit the lantern,

351
00:21:31,686 --> 00:21:33,526
and put up the sign
saying that the bathroom was in use.

352
00:21:33,602 --> 00:21:36,082
I don't know who's
the one who pranked us.

353
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:40,919
You do remember what happened last night.

354
00:21:40,991 --> 00:21:44,673
Were those actions really caused
by a succubus controlling you?

355
00:21:45,019 --> 00:21:46,459
Kazuma!

356
00:21:49,219 --> 00:21:50,539
