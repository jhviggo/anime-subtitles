1
00:00:01,262 --> 00:00:03,982
<i>Destroyer alert! Destroyer alert!</i>

2
00:00:05,043 --> 00:00:07,363
All citizens, evacuate at once!

3
00:00:07,562 --> 00:00:10,976
<i>All adventurers, equip yourselves
and report to the adventurer's guild!</i>

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,650
Kazuma!

5
00:00:12,922 --> 00:00:15,442
We're running away!
We're running far away!

6
00:00:16,772 --> 00:00:18,612
The mobile fortress, Destroyer...

7
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:21,675
Fighting that thing is reckless.

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,280
I keep asking what's a Destroyer?

9
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,290
An ancient weapon that went on a rampage.

10
00:00:28,042 --> 00:00:31,512
They say wherever it passes through,
not even grass remains.

11
00:00:34,224 --> 00:00:36,173
Hey, everyone. We're going to the guild.

12
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:37,285
Why?

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,080
We're not going to let
this house that we've earned,

14
00:00:40,222 --> 00:00:43,622
after so much work, to
be destroyed that easily!

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,480
All of you are this city's
last bastion of hope.

16
00:01:00,492 --> 00:01:03,092
We humbly request your assistance.

17
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:07,464
At present, the mobile fortress,
Destroyer,

18
00:01:07,702 --> 00:01:11,902
is on our way,
invading from the northwest.

19
00:01:12,344 --> 00:01:14,624
One hour remains until its arrival.

20
00:01:24,344 --> 00:01:25,344
Well...

21
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:29,112
Destroyer was created by
an ancient magical kingdom, right?

22
00:01:29,512 --> 00:01:33,632
Did the people who created it
prepare any countermeasures?

23
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:37,652
Unfortunately, they were the first
to perish in the Destroyer's rampage.

24
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:39,344
This game is impossible.

25
00:01:39,456 --> 00:01:42,649
Such a strong foe isn't supposed to
come to a city of novice adventurers!

26
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:44,921
If only Mitsurugi arrived here,

27
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,210
I wonder where he went.

28
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,925
You should all run away immediately.

29
00:01:51,242 --> 00:01:52,282
No, they can't.

30
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,360
The townspeople will lose their homes.

31
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,400
You're as stubborn as ever, Darkness.

32
00:01:59,042 --> 00:02:00,064
Hey, you.

33
00:02:00,672 --> 00:02:02,232
Any bright ideas?

34
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,584
That's asking a lot...

35
00:02:06,892 --> 00:02:09,932
Aqua, couldn't you break its barrier?

36
00:02:12,384 --> 00:02:14,496
I won't know unless I try.

37
00:02:14,615 --> 00:02:17,455
You can break the Destroyer's barrier?

38
00:02:17,562 --> 00:02:19,982
No, I just thought maybe...

39
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,464
Even so, couldn't you at least try it?

40
00:02:22,567 --> 00:02:23,807
Sure...

41
00:02:24,184 --> 00:02:25,184
Aside from that,

42
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,132
we'll need some heavy-hitting magic.

43
00:02:28,704 --> 00:02:29,760
We have that.

44
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,504
We have her, don't we?

45
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:34,182
The crazy one.

46
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,535
That's right. The crazy one!

47
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,280
We do have the crazy girl!

48
00:02:42,592 --> 00:02:44,556
Stare...

49
00:02:44,677 --> 00:02:45,797
Hey, wait!

50
00:02:45,877 --> 00:02:49,917
If you're talking about me,
don't use that nickname!

51
00:02:50,183 --> 00:02:53,182
Otherwise, I'll prove just how crazy I am

52
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,480
right here and now!

53
00:02:57,224 --> 00:03:00,464
Your explosion magic is the
greatest firepower this city has.

54
00:03:00,997 --> 00:03:01,997
What do you say, Megumin?

55
00:03:03,575 --> 00:03:08,655
I don't think my explosion magic
can take it down in a single blow.

56
00:03:10,695 --> 00:03:13,495
I'm sorry I'm late!

57
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,100
I'm the proprietor
of Wiz's Magical Tool Shop.

58
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:20,490
I'm a qualified adventurer,
so I've come to help.

59
00:03:20,722 --> 00:03:21,922
It's the shopkeeper!

60
00:03:21,996 --> 00:03:23,676
The destitute shopkeeper is here!

61
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,760
We can win this! We can win this now!

62
00:03:28,184 --> 00:03:30,544
Why is she so famous?

63
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,447
Don't call her a destitute shopkeeper.
I feel bad for her.

64
00:03:34,538 --> 00:03:35,978
Don't you know?

65
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,450
She named herself as a master arch wizard
once upon a time.

66
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:43,329
Her true identity is
an undead corpse, though...

67
00:03:43,592 --> 00:03:45,072
All right, everyone!

68
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,330
The emergency quest will now begin!

69
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,534
EMERGENCY QUEST: PROTECT THE CITH
FROM THE MOBILE FORTRESS, DESTROYER

70
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,491
NO LEVEL REQUIREMENT.
COMPULSORY PARTICIPATION.

71
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,172
Hurry up! It's going to
be here any second!

72
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,270
Right!

73
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:09,248
Hey, Darkness.
I know how stubborn you are,

74
00:04:09,504 --> 00:04:13,690
but set aside your fetishes for now
and join me at the edge of the road.

75
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:18,250
Given my usual behavior, it can't be
helped that you would think that way,

76
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:23,370
do you really think I'm a woman of
such rigid adherence to my desires?

77
00:04:23,934 --> 00:04:25,294
Sure! Obviously.

78
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,400
What...

79
00:04:29,504 --> 00:04:32,690
I must protect the inhabitants
of this land.

80
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,920
I'm sure the residents of this city
won't pay me any mind,

81
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,112
at least that's how I feel.

82
00:04:39,104 --> 00:04:40,608
Do you have some reason for that?

83
00:04:44,988 --> 00:04:48,708
My real name is Dustiness Ford Lalatina.

84
00:04:48,984 --> 00:04:50,744
What was that?

85
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:55,121
I belong to the Dustiness family,
which governs this area.

86
00:04:55,248 --> 00:04:56,688
So you're a rich girl?

87
00:04:57,401 --> 00:04:58,721
Don't tell the others.

88
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,370
Oh, sure.

89
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,920
I am a knight.

90
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:08,960
Protecting my citizen's livelihood
is both my duty and my honor.

91
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,850
Don't you hate selfish, stubborn allies?

92
00:05:15,722 --> 00:05:17,972
A certain arch priest's selfish whims

93
00:05:18,076 --> 00:05:20,836
annoy me and make me want to slap her,

94
00:05:21,548 --> 00:05:24,868
but I don't mind when
someone like you is selfish.

95
00:05:26,908 --> 00:05:27,948
I see.

96
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:38,688
Lalatina.

97
00:05:38,788 --> 00:05:40,788
Don't call me by that name!

98
00:05:41,316 --> 00:05:42,476
Konosuba.

99
00:05:43,161 --> 00:05:46,561
All adventurers!
The Destroyer will be here soon!

100
00:05:46,816 --> 00:05:48,468
Please prepare for battle!

101
00:06:10,323 --> 00:06:11,923
It's huge!

102
00:06:20,315 --> 00:06:22,555
Are we going to be okay?
Can we handle this?

103
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,640
Hey, Wiz! You're up for this, right?

104
00:06:26,228 --> 00:06:28,348
Please leave it to me, Aqua.

105
00:06:28,476 --> 00:06:31,116
No matter what,
I'm still the highest-ranked undead.

106
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,160
You're really up for this, right?

107
00:06:33,284 --> 00:06:37,604
If I fail, let's return to the soil
together on good terms.

108
00:06:37,714 --> 00:06:40,274
That's not funny! That's not funny!

109
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,680
Kazuma, are you okay over there?

110
00:06:42,793 --> 00:06:46,210
I'm okay. I am strong, I am strong.

111
00:06:46,304 --> 00:06:47,348
It's not looking good.

112
00:06:47,456 --> 00:06:50,912
-I am the finest...
-Hey, calm down. Don't overthink it.

113
00:06:51,068 --> 00:06:54,948
I'll blow, blow it away
with my explosion magic!

114
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,765
Hey, it's too soon! Too soon!

115
00:06:58,122 --> 00:07:00,042
Here it comes!

116
00:07:06,606 --> 00:07:09,246
Sacred...

117
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:16,588
Break Spell!

118
00:07:46,935 --> 00:07:48,180
Now!

119
00:07:48,457 --> 00:07:50,777
Megumin, launch a concurrent strike!

120
00:07:52,188 --> 00:07:53,908
Hey, Megumin!

121
00:07:55,696 --> 00:07:59,349
Hey! Is your love for
explosion magic for real?

122
00:07:59,428 --> 00:08:01,348
If you're outdone by Wiz,
you'll be a disgrace!

123
00:08:01,432 --> 00:08:06,112
Is your explosion magic so useless,
and it can't even destroy that thing?

124
00:08:06,322 --> 00:08:07,602
What was that?

125
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,780
You just said something...

126
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,080
You must never say to me,
even worse than mocking my name!

127
00:08:14,336 --> 00:08:17,896
I'll show you what
real explosion magic is!

128
00:08:18,563 --> 00:08:21,563
Darkness blacker than black
and darker than dark,

129
00:08:22,216 --> 00:08:24,856
I beseech you to combine
with my deep crimson.

130
00:08:25,076 --> 00:08:26,596
The time of awakening is here.

131
00:08:27,011 --> 00:08:29,371
Justice, fallen upon
the infallible boundary,

132
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:32,710
appear now as an intangible distortion!

133
00:08:33,868 --> 00:08:36,279
Explosion!

134
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:09,356
You did it, Megumin.

135
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,800
You're really a corpse!
Her level far exceeds my own.

136
00:09:18,388 --> 00:09:19,648
How frustrating...

137
00:09:20,486 --> 00:09:23,403
There, there. Good job, good job.

138
00:09:23,588 --> 00:09:24,708
They did it?

139
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,033
When this is all over,
I'm getting married.

140
00:09:27,876 --> 00:09:30,756
Hey, don't say anything
that'll trigger a flag right now!

141
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:33,029
Come on, let's go back and celebrate!

142
00:09:33,127 --> 00:09:34,807
I wonder how much the reward will be!

143
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,960
You idiot! Why do you
love cliches so much?

144
00:09:41,426 --> 00:09:43,106
See? What did I tell you?

145
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,670
What?

146
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,988
Due to extreme damage, self-destruct
mechanism will now initiate.

147
00:09:49,077 --> 00:09:51,557
All crew, please evacuate immediately.

148
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,680
All crew, please evacuate immediately.

149
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,644
Are you serious?

150
00:09:59,156 --> 00:10:00,996
Initiating self-destruct mechanism.

151
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,920
Initiating self-destruct mechanism.

152
00:10:05,108 --> 00:10:10,628
Super Emergency Quest: Prevent the
Destroyer from Self-Destructing

153
00:10:11,828 --> 00:10:12,988
It's no use.

154
00:10:13,626 --> 00:10:15,426
It can't be done!

155
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,348
It's hopeless! Run for it!

156
00:10:17,499 --> 00:10:19,619
Darkness! We're evacuating!

157
00:10:20,216 --> 00:10:22,616
I cannot withdraw until the very end.

158
00:10:23,346 --> 00:10:27,066
A knight mustn't run away
before her citizens.

159
00:10:27,806 --> 00:10:28,832
Darkness...

160
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,320
Besides, when I think about
exposing myself

161
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,960
to a bomb massive enough
to obliterate a city, I wonder...

162
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,730
What is this rising excitement
like nothing I've felt before?

163
00:10:40,229 --> 00:10:42,709
Will I be able to withstand it?

164
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,760
No, even if I'm sturdy, it's unlikely
I'll get through this unharmed.

165
00:10:48,706 --> 00:10:50,546
I can't stand it any longer!

166
00:10:50,944 --> 00:10:52,000
-Kazuma!
-Yes?

167
00:10:52,091 --> 00:10:53,571
I'm charging in!

168
00:10:54,948 --> 00:10:56,428
I'll be back!

169
00:10:59,888 --> 00:11:02,426
Hey, Darkness is charging in!

170
00:11:02,508 --> 00:11:03,520
What?

171
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,868
I see! She intends to destroy it
before it explodes!

172
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,559
All to protect the city!

173
00:11:09,764 --> 00:11:11,308
I'm going for it!

174
00:11:12,306 --> 00:11:14,666
I owe this city so much!

175
00:11:15,082 --> 00:11:18,162
Even though I'm already past level 30,

176
00:11:19,232 --> 00:11:23,160
I now remember why
I'm still in this city of beginners.

177
00:11:23,628 --> 00:11:26,708
In fact, after all the inexpensive
hospitality I've received...

178
00:11:28,076 --> 00:11:31,236
If I can't repay that debt now,
I'm done for as a human being!

179
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:32,348
Yeah!

180
00:11:32,448 --> 00:11:35,108
Don't be scared! We'll follow her, too!

181
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,334
Yeah!

182
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:38,628
Go!

183
00:11:42,948 --> 00:11:46,108
Come on!
Whoever's in charge, show yourself!

184
00:11:48,548 --> 00:11:49,600
Mr Kazuma,

185
00:11:50,386 --> 00:11:53,626
if we can locate the control device,

186
00:11:53,788 --> 00:11:55,908
we may be able to stop it
from self-destructing.

187
00:11:56,516 --> 00:12:00,916
Darkness definitely barged in
without thinking of that.

188
00:12:02,428 --> 00:12:03,789
It's open!

189
00:12:08,076 --> 00:12:10,835
The way this is going,
we can leave things to them.

190
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,832
Let's go home. Go home and
try harder again tomorrow.

191
00:12:12,952 --> 00:12:16,872
-Come on, you useless goddess!
-No, no!

192
00:12:18,188 --> 00:12:19,548
Found it!

193
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:23,708
I want to go home!

194
00:12:26,526 --> 00:12:28,286
Take a look at that.

195
00:12:30,188 --> 00:12:32,508
Is that a member of the crew?

196
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:34,699
He's already passed on.

197
00:12:34,948 --> 00:12:36,268
Not only did he not turn undead,

198
00:12:36,348 --> 00:12:39,188
but he passed away peacefully,
with no lingering attachments.

199
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:41,219
No, he must have had attachments!

200
00:12:41,308 --> 00:12:45,628
He looks like he died.
A solitary, lonesome death...

201
00:12:47,468 --> 00:12:48,588
What's this?

202
00:12:52,536 --> 00:12:55,326
This country's bigshots
made an unreasonable request.

203
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,840
Telling me to create a
mobile fortress on a limited budget?

204
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,128
So absurd.

205
00:13:00,588 --> 00:13:02,548
Is that his diary?

206
00:13:04,148 --> 00:13:07,588
They also asked about a power source,
but what do I care?

207
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:12,028
I told them to bring me some
legendary corona stone or something.

208
00:13:14,386 --> 00:13:16,986
They actually brought it.
What should I do?

209
00:13:17,388 --> 00:13:19,748
Will I get the death penalty
if it doesn't work now?

210
00:13:19,923 --> 00:13:22,763
Please work. I'm begging you.

211
00:13:24,588 --> 00:13:27,748
All done. As of this moment,
it's going on a rampage.

212
00:13:28,696 --> 00:13:31,816
The country has perished.
It was wiped out.

213
00:13:31,948 --> 00:13:33,428
Oh, no!

214
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:36,226
Still, I feel kind of relieved.
I'm satisfied.

215
00:13:36,308 --> 00:13:39,908
All right, I've decided to
spend the rest of my life here.

216
00:13:40,224 --> 00:13:43,240
I can't get out of this thing, anyway.
I can't stop it, either.

217
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,115
The guy who created this
must be an idiot!

218
00:13:48,336 --> 00:13:51,536
Opps, I was the one
responsible for creating it.

219
00:13:55,988 --> 00:13:57,828
-The end.
-Don't screw with us!

220
00:13:57,972 --> 00:13:59,812
Konosuba.

221
00:14:00,748 --> 00:14:02,868
We let Dust and the others
get away first,

222
00:14:03,188 --> 00:14:05,028
but what do we do with this?

223
00:14:05,863 --> 00:14:08,463
The corona stone is out of control.

224
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,760
Can't you do something about this?

225
00:14:11,228 --> 00:14:12,468
Doesn't it happen all the time?

226
00:14:12,548 --> 00:14:14,893
A goddess seals away
an evil power or something?

227
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:16,828
What's with that self-serving, wild idea?

228
00:14:17,014 --> 00:14:19,694
Hey, Wiz, can't you
do something about this?

229
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:25,236
-I could use teleportation magic.
-Do that!

230
00:14:25,308 --> 00:14:27,388
But I don't have enough magic!

231
00:14:27,926 --> 00:14:29,526
Erm, Kazuma.

232
00:14:31,506 --> 00:14:32,746
I have a request.

233
00:14:33,868 --> 00:14:35,548
What is it?

234
00:14:39,348 --> 00:14:41,773
Would you let me suck it out?

235
00:14:41,988 --> 00:14:42,988
With pleasure.

236
00:14:43,992 --> 00:14:46,752
I won't say something
as tasteless as sucking it out?

237
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,560
I'm not the dense type
who would get worked up and

238
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,171
play dumb at a time like this.

239
00:14:52,388 --> 00:14:54,368
-Thank you!
-No, thank you.

240
00:14:54,464 --> 00:14:55,563
Now, then...

241
00:14:55,648 --> 00:14:56,672
Bring it.

242
00:14:58,616 --> 00:15:00,736
Mum, dad...

243
00:15:01,131 --> 00:15:02,851
I'm about to become an adult...

244
00:15:04,086 --> 00:15:06,686
I'm sorry! Drain Touch!

245
00:15:10,126 --> 00:15:13,166
Hey! Kazuma is drying up!

246
00:15:15,306 --> 00:15:17,306
What a fall...

247
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,468
I should be able to use
teleportation magic now!

248
00:15:21,016 --> 00:15:22,016
I see.

249
00:15:22,277 --> 00:15:23,679
But there's a problem.

250
00:15:23,776 --> 00:15:26,560
I have limited control
over its destination.

251
00:15:26,828 --> 00:15:28,228
Hey, this isn't good!

252
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:31,693
The stone's gone past red,
and is shining white now!

253
00:15:32,148 --> 00:15:35,205
I can send it away immediately
if I do a random teleport, but...

254
00:15:35,328 --> 00:15:36,388
Do that, then!

255
00:15:36,604 --> 00:15:38,326
But if it goes poorly,

256
00:15:38,428 --> 00:15:41,108
it could end up at somewhere
densely populated.

257
00:15:41,188 --> 00:15:42,988
It's a big world out there!

258
00:15:43,348 --> 00:15:45,468
It's okay. I'll take responsibility.

259
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,200
You may not believe me,
but I apparently have good luck!

260
00:15:53,228 --> 00:15:54,228
Got it.

261
00:15:55,386 --> 00:15:57,226
Let's do it, Kazuma.

262
00:15:58,926 --> 00:16:00,086
Teleport!

263
00:16:03,936 --> 00:16:06,776
Initiating self-destruction.

264
00:16:08,548 --> 00:16:10,388
Is this where you were, Darkness?

265
00:16:10,948 --> 00:16:12,000
Not yet.

266
00:16:13,152 --> 00:16:15,680
My strong sense of smell
can sniff out a worthy foe,

267
00:16:15,996 --> 00:16:18,636
and it's still detecting
the savory aroma of danger.

268
00:16:19,317 --> 00:16:20,677
It's not over yet.

269
00:16:20,804 --> 00:16:21,824
What?

270
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:24,708
What is that?

271
00:16:32,468 --> 00:16:35,548
Hey, I thought we removed
the corona stone!

272
00:16:38,228 --> 00:16:39,232
Could this be...

273
00:16:39,396 --> 00:16:42,356
its internal heat is escaping?

274
00:16:43,476 --> 00:16:46,476
At this rate, the city will
become a sea of flames!

275
00:16:46,581 --> 00:16:49,341
So there was no point
sending the corona stone away!

276
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,415
Use Explosion one more time!

277
00:16:52,396 --> 00:16:54,516
I ran out of magic.

278
00:16:54,644 --> 00:16:55,884
Out of magic?

279
00:16:57,566 --> 00:17:01,806
Now that I think about it,
this city's guild issued my loans,

280
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,920
so if it explodes right now...

281
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,640
Come here, you self-proclaimed somebody.

282
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,960
Look, I don't have time
to deal with you right now!

283
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,200
I'd rather just...

284
00:17:12,988 --> 00:17:15,988
You little! What are you doing
in this state of emergency?

285
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,800
Because this is a state of emergency!

286
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:20,004
I'm going to share
your magical power with Wiz...

287
00:17:20,128 --> 00:17:21,568
so she can use explosion magic!

288
00:17:21,824 --> 00:17:22,848
Wait!

289
00:17:22,944 --> 00:17:25,280
If you inject her with
huge amounts of holy power,

290
00:17:25,395 --> 00:17:26,995
she'll definitely disappear!

291
00:17:28,306 --> 00:17:29,986
Are you serious?

292
00:17:33,472 --> 00:17:35,188
The star takes the stage.

293
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,822
Megumin!

294
00:17:36,908 --> 00:17:40,211
I fell behind earlier, because it's true...

295
00:17:40,346 --> 00:17:42,626
I wasn't feeling very well!

296
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,400
I shall show you true explosion magic!

297
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,440
Konosuba!

298
00:17:51,748 --> 00:17:52,948
All right, here goes!

299
00:17:53,388 --> 00:17:55,148
I'm ready anytime.

300
00:17:55,626 --> 00:17:57,506
You only get one chance.

301
00:17:57,693 --> 00:17:59,653
I'm betting on your radiance.

302
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:01,388
Hey, do you understand?

303
00:18:01,484 --> 00:18:04,044
Don't absorb too much, okay?
Don't absorb too much.

304
00:18:04,346 --> 00:18:05,706
I get it, I get it.

305
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,160
That's the god of party tricks'
lead-in, right?

306
00:18:08,231 --> 00:18:11,511
No! I wasn't trying to
sound like some performer!

307
00:18:11,668 --> 00:18:13,748
Drain Touch is most effective

308
00:18:13,853 --> 00:18:17,480
when absorbing from somewhere
with thin skin, close to the heart.

309
00:18:18,788 --> 00:18:21,548
I can't believe I get to use
explosion magic twice in a day.

310
00:18:23,508 --> 00:18:25,548
What are you doing all of a sudden?

311
00:18:25,628 --> 00:18:27,629
I thought my heart was going to stop!

312
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,468
What is it? Is this sexual harassment?!

313
00:18:29,548 --> 00:18:31,788
You're harassing me
in this state of emergency?

314
00:18:31,908 --> 00:18:33,428
Stupid, that's not it!

315
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,800
I'm using Drain Touch
with effectiveness in mind!

316
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,400
Hey! Not you, too!

317
00:18:37,597 --> 00:18:40,437
You should be grateful that I wasn't
going to grab you from the front!

318
00:18:40,836 --> 00:18:42,276
Konosuba!

319
00:18:45,844 --> 00:18:47,164
We've reached a compromise.

320
00:18:48,548 --> 00:18:49,988
I feel it, I feel it!

321
00:18:50,646 --> 00:18:54,566
I should be able to fire the highest
grade of explosion magic with this.

322
00:18:54,682 --> 00:18:57,122
Hey, Megumin, are you finished?

323
00:18:57,244 --> 00:19:00,202
I think you've absorbed
more than enough already.

324
00:19:00,486 --> 00:19:03,006
A little more, just a little more.

325
00:19:03,468 --> 00:19:05,868
This might be bad. It's bad.

326
00:19:06,068 --> 00:19:07,788
Hey, what is this?

327
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:09,931
She's not going to detonate, is she?

328
00:19:13,746 --> 00:19:16,106
Oh, blackness shrouded in light.

329
00:19:16,508 --> 00:19:18,668
Frenzied blaze clad in night.

330
00:19:20,228 --> 00:19:21,908
All else aside,

331
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,195
I don't want to be outdone by anyone else

332
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,880
when it comes to explosion magic!

333
00:19:28,068 --> 00:19:29,120
Here I go!

334
00:19:31,346 --> 00:19:33,426
My ultimate destructive magic.

335
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,720
Explosion!

336
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,400
Our battle with the mobile fortress,
Destroyer, ended.

337
00:20:06,668 --> 00:20:08,268
The thrilling adventurers' world

338
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,960
that I wished for is still very far off.

339
00:20:17,748 --> 00:20:21,108
My reluctant party of horrible allies
in this good-for-nothing world.

340
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,188
I finally get to stay in a house
after a harsh life in the stables.

341
00:20:29,868 --> 00:20:32,268
My agonizing days of
impossible difficulty.

342
00:20:32,988 --> 00:20:34,063
However,

343
00:20:34,828 --> 00:20:38,228
those may have been trials
to make me grow.

344
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,948
That was one long tutorial.

345
00:20:44,966 --> 00:20:46,463
Kazuma! We've got trouble!

346
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:48,198
Knights are coming from
the imperial capital!

347
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,200
Oh, are they coming to deliver
my compensation in person?

348
00:20:51,946 --> 00:20:53,066
They must be.

349
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,860
With this, my adventure
will begin at last!

350
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:06,751
Adventurer Satou Kazuma.

351
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,680
You are currently suspected for
the crime of subversion of the state.

352
00:21:11,108 --> 00:21:12,788
You need to come with me.

353
00:21:13,116 --> 00:21:14,176
What?

354
00:21:14,508 --> 00:21:18,028
The corona stone that was
teleported at your instruction

355
00:21:18,228 --> 00:21:20,988
obliterated Overlord Aldarp's mansion.

356
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,020
What?

357
00:21:24,188 --> 00:21:26,068
That's definitely...

358
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,840
What? You're not being compensated?

359
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,120
My next adventure is calling me.

360
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,320
Hey!

361
00:21:33,346 --> 00:21:37,106
That's right.
Nothing goes the way I expected it.

362
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,480
That's the sort of good-for-nothing
world.

363
00:21:39,745 --> 00:21:43,061
Kazuma! You're a criminal, Kazuma!

364
00:21:43,133 --> 00:21:46,656
Killing the Demon King
is totally out of the question now!

365
00:21:46,784 --> 00:21:48,221
Oh, my.

366
00:21:48,828 --> 00:21:52,948
I pray that if I ever get another
chance to go to a parallel world,

367
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:55,710
I'm able to go to a wonderful world

368
00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:00,028
where I can actually
achieve something cool!
