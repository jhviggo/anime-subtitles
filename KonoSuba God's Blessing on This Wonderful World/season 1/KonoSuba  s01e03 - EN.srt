1
00:00:01,746 --> 00:00:03,426
My name is Darkness.

2
00:00:03,859 --> 00:00:06,059
I'm a crusader.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,100
Please allow me to...

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:15,394
Please allow me to join your team.

5
00:00:16,779 --> 00:00:17,779
About this...

6
00:00:18,856 --> 00:00:21,776
The slimy girls that I saw just now
are your teammates, right?

7
00:00:21,948 --> 00:00:23,628
What had happened?

8
00:00:23,712 --> 00:00:26,592
There was a giant frog attacking us.

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,960
What? It's beyond my imagination.

10
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,538
How do I say? This female knight looks...

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,000
No!

12
00:00:35,104 --> 00:00:36,800
The two girls who are young and ignorant

13
00:00:36,896 --> 00:00:38,353
were attacked.

14
00:00:38,432 --> 00:00:40,059
As a crusader, I can't stand by.

15
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,590
She has scary eyes.

16
00:00:41,779 --> 00:00:44,219
My danger detector has issued an alert.

17
00:00:44,646 --> 00:00:48,686
This girl has the same characteristics
as Aqua and Megumin.

18
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:50,859
In fact, I don't really
recommend our team.

19
00:00:51,043 --> 00:00:53,600
One of my teammate is a good-for-nothing.

20
00:00:53,752 --> 00:00:56,832
The another one can only
use her magic once a day.

21
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,435
I'm the weakest member.

22
00:00:58,659 --> 00:00:59,744
We are nothing.

23
00:00:59,866 --> 00:01:02,225
You'd better go and look for someone else.
It's painful!

24
00:01:02,336 --> 00:01:04,032
It's good news for me.

25
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:08,481
In fact, I have a lump in my throat.

26
00:01:09,499 --> 00:01:12,659
Although I'm confident in
my ability and endurance,

27
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:13,790
I'm quite stupid...

28
00:01:14,059 --> 00:01:17,659
I can't attack my target precisely.

29
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:21,299
My danger detector is very sensitive.

30
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:24,832
So, just let me rush to the front line,

31
00:01:25,005 --> 00:01:26,925
and use me as a shield.

32
00:01:27,018 --> 00:01:28,498
Her face is too close to mine.

33
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:33,190
I am still influenced by my
experience even in this place. No.

34
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,271
It's just too exciting for
a man who reaches puberty.

35
00:01:36,384 --> 00:01:39,080
Calm down. Don't be
confused by her appearance.

36
00:01:40,544 --> 00:01:43,904
No. How can I make a girl as a shield?

37
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,840
This is my wish.

38
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,896
You may be preyed on
by monsters every time.

39
00:01:48,992 --> 00:01:50,464
This is my wish.

40
00:01:50,623 --> 00:01:51,648
What?

41
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:54,419
I understand it now.

42
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,299
It seems that this girl is not only
incapable, but also useless in nature.

43
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:24,700
(KONOSUBA:
God's Blessing on This Wonderful World!)

44
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:49,179
(Episode 3: A Panty Treasure
in This Right Hand!)

45
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,593
I am so fatigued
that I have slept until noon.

46
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,792
Thank you.

47
00:03:49,619 --> 00:03:50,899
Kazuma, come and take a look.

48
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:53,659
What do you think of my new skill?

49
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,080
I am the goddess of water. Don't you
think this skill is just right for me?

50
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,550
Isn't it a banquet skill?

51
00:03:58,688 --> 00:03:59,899
What a useless goddess.

52
00:04:04,066 --> 00:04:07,266
You can learn a new skill
with your accumulated points.

53
00:04:07,473 --> 00:04:08,820
I can't waste it
in learning a strange skill.

54
00:04:08,896 --> 00:04:10,620
I shall choose it carefully.

55
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:18,019
First, you shall ask the others
about how to use the skills.

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,880
Then, optional items
will appear on the card.

57
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:24,000
You may use points to
redeem for the skill you want to learn.

58
00:04:24,124 --> 00:04:25,684
Then, you'll succeed in
mastering a new skill.

59
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,320
It means if Megumin is my teacher,

60
00:04:28,454 --> 00:04:30,974
I'll learn how to use Explosion Magic?

61
00:04:31,059 --> 00:04:32,259
Exactly.

62
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:34,144
You are right, Kazuma.

63
00:04:34,224 --> 00:04:37,426
If you want to learn Explosion Magic,
I will try my best to teach you.

64
00:04:37,549 --> 00:04:39,373
Anyway, apart from this skill,

65
00:04:39,456 --> 00:04:41,527
are there any other skills worth learning?

66
00:04:41,608 --> 00:04:43,200
No.

67
00:04:43,296 --> 00:04:46,736
Come on, just learn
Explosion Magic from me.

68
00:04:47,586 --> 00:04:48,986
Her face is too close to mine.

69
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,640
Calm down, Lolita.

70
00:04:53,176 --> 00:04:55,856
I only have 3 points.

71
00:04:55,936 --> 00:04:57,501
Lolita?

72
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:10,188
How dare you call me Lolita?

73
00:05:13,007 --> 00:05:15,104
Is there any simple skill
for me to learn?

74
00:05:15,336 --> 00:05:18,336
Simple skill that doesn't
require a lot of points.

75
00:05:18,497 --> 00:05:19,552
I got you.

76
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:23,831
Oh no!

77
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:27,631
You said that you drank too much
yesterday and left immediately.

78
00:05:27,816 --> 00:05:29,656
Thank you for your concern.

79
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,117
I want to euphemistically reject her,

80
00:05:32,307 --> 00:05:34,947
but it seems that she doesn't
understand what I mean.

81
00:05:35,457 --> 00:05:38,737
In this case, let's talk
about the matter of yesterday.

82
00:05:39,021 --> 00:05:40,480
Please let me join your team.

83
00:05:40,617 --> 00:05:41,817
I reject.

84
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,720
How can you turn down my request so fast?

85
00:05:46,864 --> 00:05:48,616
Why does she seem so happy?

86
00:05:48,736 --> 00:05:50,136
She's a dangerous character.

87
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,560
Darkness, you can't
take such a strong action.

88
00:05:55,736 --> 00:05:57,336
Who are you?

89
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,723
My name is Chris.
As you can see, I'm a thief.

90
00:06:01,096 --> 00:06:03,075
I'm her best friend.

91
00:06:03,176 --> 00:06:06,776
Great. She looks normal.

92
00:06:06,971 --> 00:06:10,091
Do you want to learn
a skill that might come in handy?

93
00:06:10,172 --> 00:06:12,332
Are you interested in the thief skills?

94
00:06:13,301 --> 00:06:15,936
You don't have to spend
a lot of points. It's worthwhile.

95
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:17,639
If you master it, it will
make your life easier.

96
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,416
How is it?

97
00:06:19,488 --> 00:06:21,408
If you want to learn it, you just have
to buy me a cup of carbonated drink.

98
00:06:21,536 --> 00:06:22,628
It's so cheap.

99
00:06:22,936 --> 00:06:24,176
All right.

100
00:06:24,776 --> 00:06:28,056
Excuse me, please give her
a cup of carbonated drink.

101
00:06:33,312 --> 00:06:38,000
The thief skills include
"to perceive the enemy" and "to lurk".

102
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,320
I especially recommend this skill.

103
00:06:40,777 --> 00:06:42,457
Pay attention to it.

104
00:06:42,617 --> 00:06:45,634
All right, Chris. You may start it now.

105
00:06:45,954 --> 00:06:46,994
Steal.

106
00:06:57,766 --> 00:06:58,886
That's my wallet!

107
00:06:59,117 --> 00:07:01,157
This is the theft skill, "Steal".

108
00:07:01,312 --> 00:07:02,336
If you manage to master this skill,

109
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:04,736
you're able to steal
other people's belongings.

110
00:07:04,928 --> 00:07:07,048
In short, this is what you can do.

111
00:07:10,707 --> 00:07:12,707
Do you want to compete with me?

112
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,327
I taught you the skill of steal just now.

113
00:07:15,427 --> 00:07:17,440
Do you want to try
taking this wallet back?

114
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,377
It sounds unreasonable.

115
00:07:20,609 --> 00:07:21,952
You're an adventurer, aren't you?

116
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,700
If you are, you shall
take this challenge.

117
00:07:26,496 --> 00:07:28,656
It seems the tuition fee is costly.

118
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,016
Anyhow,

119
00:07:30,237 --> 00:07:35,117
this is the conversation between
adventurers that I look forward to!

120
00:07:35,256 --> 00:07:36,352
After coming to this world,

121
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,880
I finally find that this
is a place for adventurers.

122
00:07:40,336 --> 00:07:42,190
-All right.
-That's a deal.

123
00:07:42,547 --> 00:07:46,067
Use the adventurer card to
try learning this skill first.

124
00:07:46,336 --> 00:07:49,256
You are able to find
the skill I taught you there.

125
00:07:50,073 --> 00:07:51,944
One point for perceiving the enemy.

126
00:07:52,307 --> 00:07:53,987
One point for lurking.

127
00:07:54,237 --> 00:07:56,077
One point for thief skills.

128
00:07:56,447 --> 00:07:57,847
Magic Bouquet.

129
00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:59,237
Magic Bouquet?

130
00:08:00,536 --> 00:08:05,096
This is the banquet skill which
was used by your teammate just now.

131
00:08:05,577 --> 00:08:07,552
A simple banquet skill requires 5 points?

132
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,800
That's so expensive!

133
00:08:08,896 --> 00:08:10,099
This is useless.

134
00:08:31,296 --> 00:08:34,456
From now on, you own thief skills.

135
00:08:34,616 --> 00:08:35,856
Come on.

136
00:08:35,927 --> 00:08:39,730
All right. You won't cry no matter
what I steal from you, right?

137
00:08:40,936 --> 00:08:42,696
Steal this magic knife from
me if you're competent.

138
00:08:42,816 --> 00:08:45,405
This is Alice's treasure and
it costs about 400 thousand,

139
00:08:46,363 --> 00:08:49,613
while these stones
will be the booby prize.

140
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,976
They are dirty!

141
00:08:53,077 --> 00:08:56,156
If so, the probability of stealing
the short knife is greatly reduced.

142
00:08:56,407 --> 00:08:59,567
Darn it. Anyway,
I have learned a lot from it.

143
00:08:59,856 --> 00:09:03,184
This is not Japan but a world
reflects the law of the jungle.

144
00:09:03,374 --> 00:09:05,774
An innocent person
shall learn a lesson from it.

145
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:12,256
Look at me. Steal!

146
00:09:16,748 --> 00:09:18,803
Great. It works.

147
00:09:24,048 --> 00:09:25,208
What is this?

148
00:09:28,616 --> 00:09:30,816
Anyhow, I did it, right?

149
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:34,527
I win a lottery!

150
00:09:34,736 --> 00:09:39,508
Gosh! Give me back my underwear!

151
00:09:45,896 --> 00:09:47,965
He's such a pervert.

152
00:09:48,456 --> 00:09:51,456
My judgment is so reliable.

153
00:09:55,216 --> 00:09:57,600
Kazuma, where are you going?

154
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,799
Why don't you enjoy
my gorgeous performance?

155
00:10:00,496 --> 00:10:02,304
What happened to her?

156
00:10:02,503 --> 00:10:03,663
Actually...

157
00:10:03,747 --> 00:10:07,691
Actually, when this girl was
teaching Kazuma skill of thief,

158
00:10:07,837 --> 00:10:09,097
he took off her underwear,

159
00:10:09,184 --> 00:10:10,696
and also took all her money.

160
00:10:10,784 --> 00:10:12,056
That's why she's sad now.

161
00:10:12,127 --> 00:10:14,167
What are you talking about?

162
00:10:14,304 --> 00:10:16,288
He even said that I can't
just return the wallet to him.

163
00:10:16,688 --> 00:10:18,336
I shall pay as much as you want.

164
00:10:18,441 --> 00:10:20,601
Please return my underwear to me.

165
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,384
He said that I shall determine
the value of my own underwear.

166
00:10:24,512 --> 00:10:26,080
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

167
00:10:26,216 --> 00:10:28,237
Although you didn't say
anything wrong, you can just hold on.

168
00:10:28,448 --> 00:10:32,832
Otherwise, this underwear
will become his family's heirloom,

169
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,160
and it will be handed down
from generation to generation.

170
00:10:35,296 --> 00:10:40,021
Stop it. I can feel the female
adventurers' cold eyes staring at me.

171
00:10:40,128 --> 00:10:41,482
Shut up, please!

172
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,440
Kazuma, did you
master the skill of thief?

173
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,267
Let me show you.

174
00:10:50,687 --> 00:10:52,607
Steal!

175
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:06,129
What is this?

176
00:11:07,528 --> 00:11:08,648
What happened to you?

177
00:11:08,776 --> 00:11:11,134
Is it because you've leveled up,

178
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:14,049
you become a pervert from an adventurer?

179
00:11:15,136 --> 00:11:17,216
It's cold underneath my skirt.

180
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:18,904
Can you return me my underwear?

181
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:20,945
Kazuma, how could you...

182
00:11:21,157 --> 00:11:22,961
Oh, it's weird.

183
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,832
Stealing shall be performed randomly.

184
00:11:24,937 --> 00:11:27,097
How dare you grab a young
girl's underwear in public?

185
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:31,868
I definitely can't let
a pervert like you go.

186
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:35,456
Please let me join your team.

187
00:11:35,592 --> 00:11:36,608
No.

188
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:43,404
This woman is definitely
a useless person.

189
00:11:43,616 --> 00:11:46,016
I can't allow any weirdo
to join my team anymore.

190
00:11:46,307 --> 00:11:49,024
Kazuma, is she the person
who came to interview yesterday

191
00:11:49,117 --> 00:11:52,757
when Megumin and I went to take a shower?

192
00:11:56,376 --> 00:11:59,416
What? Is she really a crusader?

193
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,240
We've no reason to reject her.

194
00:12:03,107 --> 00:12:07,708
-They two shouldn't meet with her.
-Look, she's a crusader.

195
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,176
All right. That's the
only thing I can do now.

196
00:12:11,536 --> 00:12:16,416
Darkness, there's
one thing I must tell you.

197
00:12:16,976 --> 00:12:17,978
Actually,

198
00:12:18,616 --> 00:12:20,416
don't judge Aqua and me
just by our appearances,

199
00:12:20,537 --> 00:12:22,857
we really wish to beat the Devil King up.

200
00:12:23,096 --> 00:12:24,139
That's right.

201
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:26,766
Is that true?

202
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:28,637
Of course. We're great, aren't we?

203
00:12:28,954 --> 00:12:32,902
In the future, our adventures
will become tougher,

204
00:12:33,347 --> 00:12:35,867
especially for you
who's a female crusader.

205
00:12:36,016 --> 00:12:38,216
If you're caught by the Devil King,
you'll be in trouble.

206
00:12:38,536 --> 00:12:41,810
You'll suffer from inhuman treatment.

207
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,957
Yeah, that's right.

208
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:49,576
A crusader's job includes being caught
by the Devil King since ancient times.

209
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:52,117
To accomplish this,
I must join your team.

210
00:12:52,297 --> 00:12:53,344
What?

211
00:12:53,487 --> 00:12:54,847
What's wrong?

212
00:12:55,056 --> 00:12:57,124
Did I say something strange?

213
00:12:57,426 --> 00:12:59,826
In short, this is not important.

214
00:13:00,907 --> 00:13:02,187
Megumin, listen!

215
00:13:02,776 --> 00:13:04,136
Our opponent is the Devil King.

216
00:13:04,327 --> 00:13:07,407
We are going to challenge the
most powerful creature in this world.

217
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:11,017
Don't force yourself to stay with us.

218
00:13:11,153 --> 00:13:12,633
My name is Megumin.

219
00:13:12,827 --> 00:13:15,187
I'm the best wizard of the Red Devils.

220
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:17,469
I'm able to manipulate Explosion Magic.

221
00:13:17,816 --> 00:13:20,096
How could the Devil King
call himself the most powerful devil?

222
00:13:20,187 --> 00:13:24,506
I'll use the most powerful
magic to kill this cocky guy.

223
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:26,736
She is hopeless.

224
00:13:26,867 --> 00:13:30,163
What shall I do? There are two
energetic problematic children here.

225
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:31,637
Kazuma,

226
00:13:32,407 --> 00:13:35,887
you scared the hell out of me.

227
00:13:36,056 --> 00:13:38,616
Is there a more relaxed way?

228
00:13:38,816 --> 00:13:40,629
You should get up steam.

229
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,992
You play the most
important role in this matter.

230
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:46,577
<i>Urgent mission.</i>

231
00:13:47,097 --> 00:13:48,337
What happened?

232
00:13:48,496 --> 00:13:51,856
<i>To all the adventurers, please
gather at the main entrance.</i>

233
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:53,056
To all the adventurers,

234
00:13:53,168 --> 00:13:56,888
<i>please gather at the main entrance.</i>

235
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:02,845
-It's coming.
-What? I didn't hear about it.

236
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:06,535
-Don't let the kids out.
-Oh, no.

237
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,390
Are all of you ready?

238
00:14:11,787 --> 00:14:13,387
Keep your chin up!

239
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,360
What happened? What is coming?

240
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:25,007
I will protect you all.

241
00:14:25,216 --> 00:14:26,736
Kazuma, stay with me.

242
00:14:27,027 --> 00:14:30,347
What is the urgent mission?
Are monsters attacking the city?

243
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,280
Didn't I tell you about them?
They are cabbages.

244
00:14:33,376 --> 00:14:34,397
What?

245
00:14:36,957 --> 00:14:38,752
They seem to be very lively this year.

246
00:14:38,896 --> 00:14:40,896
The storm is coming.

247
00:14:42,897 --> 00:14:45,417
Harvest!

248
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:48,227
Get me some mayonnaise.

249
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,720
What are these?

250
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,840
Cabbages.

251
00:14:59,957 --> 00:15:02,927
ALL THE CABBAGES WILL BE HARVESTED

252
00:15:03,212 --> 00:15:05,092
Attack!

253
00:15:05,976 --> 00:15:08,576
The cabbages will fly
by themselves in this world.

254
00:15:08,847 --> 00:15:10,118
They have mellow flavors.

255
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,743
They will bustle around
during harvest season.

256
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,513
You cannot have a chance
to eat them easily.

257
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,280
Before they can run
on the road and field,

258
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,120
they have to cross lands and oceans,

259
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,402
and finally reach an unknown world,

260
00:15:25,016 --> 00:15:29,136
so that they won't be
eaten and hibernate.

261
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:36,662
In this case,

262
00:15:37,597 --> 00:15:40,597
it's better for us to catch and turn them

263
00:15:41,111 --> 00:15:43,791
into delicious food and eat them.

264
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:49,240
The season of harvesting
cabbage is coming again.

265
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,320
The cabbages grow
exceptionally good this year.

266
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:54,207
Each cabbage can be
exchanged for 10 thousand Eris.

267
00:15:54,427 --> 00:15:57,867
Please catch more cabbages for exchange.

268
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,020
Good.

269
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:02,756
Can I go back to sleep first?

270
00:16:03,256 --> 00:16:04,256
Kazuma.

271
00:16:04,955 --> 00:16:06,240
It's a rare opportunity.

272
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:10,096
Let me show you
my strength as a crusader.

273
00:16:26,976 --> 00:16:28,736
You can't hit your target at all.

274
00:16:38,378 --> 00:16:39,418
It's dangerous.

275
00:16:52,376 --> 00:16:54,616
Leave it to me. Run.

276
00:16:55,576 --> 00:16:56,721
Darkness!

277
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:06,549
Use the armor.

278
00:17:07,936 --> 00:17:10,936
It's too late. Run quickly!

279
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,320
Don't talk foolishly.

280
00:17:14,176 --> 00:17:16,297
Darkness, you...

281
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:19,730
I can't see someone in mortal danger
without lifting a finger to save him.

282
00:17:20,656 --> 00:17:23,189
I can't do it.

283
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:25,896
She's a model of the crusader.

284
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,520
Run away, Darkness.

285
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,990
All eyes are on me.

286
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:41,736
All the men are
staring at my skin excitedly.

287
00:17:42,273 --> 00:17:43,993
It's too shameful.

288
00:17:44,136 --> 00:17:46,496
It's so disgusting.

289
00:17:46,856 --> 00:17:49,176
-I can't escape right now.
-She's attractive.

290
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:51,830
In order to protect the others,
she's sacrificing herself.

291
00:17:52,007 --> 00:17:54,264
As a knight, I should learn from her.

292
00:17:54,457 --> 00:17:56,552
No. Everyone is misunderstanding her.

293
00:17:56,672 --> 00:17:59,718
In front of my Explosion Magic,

294
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,628
no one can fulfill
the long-cherished wish.

295
00:18:03,033 --> 00:18:05,193
There is also a troublesome guy here.

296
00:18:08,227 --> 00:18:10,464
In front of so many enemies,

297
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:14,056
how can I stop myself
from showing Explosion Magic?

298
00:18:14,896 --> 00:18:17,114
-No, absolutely not.
-You can do it.

299
00:18:17,536 --> 00:18:19,616
Darkness was shrouded in radiance.

300
00:18:20,027 --> 00:18:21,947
It entangled in the night sky.

301
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,648
In the name of Red Devil,

302
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:25,919
please show your prime crushing power.

303
00:18:26,216 --> 00:18:30,296
Every root of power
that's hiding on this land,

304
00:18:30,807 --> 00:18:32,287
please gather in front of me.

305
00:18:33,397 --> 00:18:35,637
Explosion!

306
00:18:56,776 --> 00:19:00,176
PLENTIFUL HARVEST OF CABBAGES

307
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,200
We don't have to worry about the
stock of vegetables for a while.

308
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,223
I'm not willing to give in.

309
00:19:07,096 --> 00:19:10,849
Why can fried cabbage be so delicious?

310
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:14,459
I am not here to fight with the cabbages.

311
00:19:15,136 --> 00:19:17,496
You're definitely a brave crusader.

312
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,207
Even the bunch of cabbages

313
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,646
felt helpless when facing your
protection just like an iron wall.

314
00:19:22,683 --> 00:19:26,043
In fact, I'm just a tough woman.

315
00:19:26,397 --> 00:19:29,397
I'm willing to become an iron shield
just to protect the others.

316
00:19:29,896 --> 00:19:32,776
Aqua's Magic Bouquet
is also very powerful.

317
00:19:32,896 --> 00:19:35,256
It not only be used
to boost the adventurers' morale,

318
00:19:35,331 --> 00:19:37,056
but also keeps the harvested cabbages

319
00:19:37,196 --> 00:19:38,596
fresh with cold water.

320
00:19:38,696 --> 00:19:40,136
Magic Bouquet!

321
00:19:40,976 --> 00:19:42,496
Magic Bouquet!

322
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,570
Don't mention it. As a priest,

323
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,960
it's my responsibility.

324
00:19:48,127 --> 00:19:49,807
Is this important?

325
00:19:50,047 --> 00:19:53,296
The magic water of the priest is pure.

326
00:19:53,376 --> 00:19:55,682
Megumin's magic is also very powerful.

327
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:59,132
You blew away the entire swarm
of cabbages in a single blow.

328
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,468
Have you seen the power
of Red Devil's blood?

329
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:06,016
I've never taken a direct hit
by such firepower before.

330
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:07,732
Don't let her hit you directly.

331
00:20:15,467 --> 00:20:18,724
Kazuma, you did a good job too.

332
00:20:19,247 --> 00:20:22,687
Indeed. You erased your
presence with the skill of lurk,

333
00:20:22,776 --> 00:20:24,776
and attacked the enemy
from behind with the skill of steal.

334
00:20:24,937 --> 00:20:29,097
You looked just like a skilled assassin.

335
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:31,633
Kazuma, by my name,

336
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,350
I hereby confer upon you the
title of "The Great Cabbage Thief".

337
00:20:35,587 --> 00:20:36,832
Shut up.

338
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,552
Darn it. How did things end up like this?

339
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,704
Most importantly,

340
00:20:40,832 --> 00:20:44,685
you now understand
my abilities as a crusader.

341
00:20:45,127 --> 00:20:46,509
So, once more,

342
00:20:46,896 --> 00:20:48,016
my name is Darkness.

343
00:20:48,527 --> 00:20:50,607
I can use swords with either hand,

344
00:20:50,737 --> 00:20:52,697
but you don't expect me
to be a powerhouse in a battle.

345
00:20:53,147 --> 00:20:56,627
I'm far too clumsy and my attack
hardly ever hits the targets.

346
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,360
However, I'm very good
at becoming a shield.

347
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,440
Our team is turning out to have
a pretty impressive roster, right?

348
00:21:04,687 --> 00:21:06,401
There are me, an arch priest,

349
00:21:06,717 --> 00:21:08,277
Megumin, an arch wizard,

350
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,359
and Darkness, a crusader.

351
00:21:11,047 --> 00:21:14,687
There aren't many teams where three
out of four have upper-class jobs.

352
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:21,905
I wouldn't have any reason to
refuse her if she's a normal ally.

353
00:21:22,087 --> 00:21:23,247
She's gorgeous after all,

354
00:21:23,677 --> 00:21:24,837
but

355
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:26,917
Kazuma,

356
00:21:27,015 --> 00:21:30,735
please don't hesitate to use me
as a bait or shield in the future.

357
00:21:32,137 --> 00:21:34,699
She is totally a masochist.

358
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,816
Although it seems like a perfect
formation, it's not the case at all.

359
00:21:39,017 --> 00:21:41,777
I foresee nothing but
hardships in our future.

360
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,840
If I do anything to hold back the team,

361
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,276
please reprimand me sternly.

362
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,280
You may even abandon me
as a sacrificial pawn if you wish.

363
00:21:50,557 --> 00:21:53,077
Just imagining it makes
me tremble with excitement.

364
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,012
I'm looking forward to working with you.

365
00:23:30,848 --> 00:23:40,030
