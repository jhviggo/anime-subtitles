1
00:00:09,124 --> 00:00:10,244
Where am I?

2
00:00:13,265 --> 00:00:15,985
Oh, did I...

3
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:18,856
die again?

4
00:00:33,552 --> 00:00:44,675
(KONOSUBA:
God's Blessing on This Wonderful World!)

5
00:01:06,336 --> 00:01:09,248
(Episode 7: A Second Death
in This Freezing Season!)

6
00:01:53,045 --> 00:01:56,325
After the battle with Verdia,
a leader in the Devil King's army,

7
00:01:56,415 --> 00:01:57,975
the season turned to winter.

8
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,525
That day, I groaned wholeheartedly,
as if I were coughing up blood.

9
00:02:04,445 --> 00:02:05,925
I want money!

10
00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:10,219
Huh? Everybody wants money!

11
00:02:10,415 --> 00:02:12,655
You're just far too unresourceful!

12
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:16,605
You make a goddess like me
sleep in a stable every night!

13
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,360
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

14
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,577
If you understand that,
then give me more luxury!

15
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,724
Spoil me more!

16
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,440
Do you not get why I want more money?

17
00:02:29,536 --> 00:02:30,545
Huh?

18
00:02:30,644 --> 00:02:32,444
The debt!

19
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,616
Thanks to the debt you've racked up,

20
00:02:35,735 --> 00:02:38,080
most of the reward money we earn

21
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:41,431
are used to repay those debts!

22
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:42,592
Just this morning...

23
00:02:42,815 --> 00:02:46,176
This morning, when I woke up
in the straw of the stable,

24
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:48,064
my eyelashes were frozen solid!

25
00:02:48,322 --> 00:02:49,920
If we keep sleeping in that stable,

26
00:02:50,048 --> 00:02:51,884
I'm definitely going to freeze to death!

27
00:02:54,564 --> 00:02:56,244
I can't help it!

28
00:02:56,325 --> 00:02:59,744
This city may have perished
in that battle with Verdia

29
00:02:59,885 --> 00:03:02,485
if not for my astounding efforts!

30
00:03:02,688 --> 00:03:04,664
You should exalt me more!

31
00:03:04,804 --> 00:03:07,638
All of you should praise me,
praise me, and spoil me!

32
00:03:07,756 --> 00:03:09,745
You attention-seeking woman!

33
00:03:09,884 --> 00:03:12,907
If your feats are that astounding,

34
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:16,375
the rewards, accolades
and debt are all yours!

35
00:03:16,512 --> 00:03:18,912
Pay off your debts on your own.

36
00:03:19,595 --> 00:03:21,795
Wait! I'm sorry!

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,344
I apologize for getting carried away,
please don't abandon me!

38
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:27,571
What's the big fuss early in the morning?

39
00:03:27,795 --> 00:03:29,875
Do we have some nice work lined up?

40
00:03:30,253 --> 00:03:32,887
No, we haven't started
looking for work yet.

41
00:03:33,764 --> 00:03:35,654
Given the situation and all...

42
00:03:37,204 --> 00:03:38,884
What should we do today?

43
00:03:38,964 --> 00:03:41,244
Let's sleep at the inn. It's cold!

44
00:03:41,705 --> 00:03:44,345
The reward for fighting off
the Devil King's army leader

45
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:47,644
was distributed to every
adventurer who participated.

46
00:03:48,105 --> 00:03:51,328
There's no reason for anyone
to go hunting dangerous winter monsters

47
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:53,119
when they are rich.

48
00:03:53,555 --> 00:03:55,835
Personally, I gladly welcome it.

49
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,965
So do I.

50
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,276
The stronger the enemy, the better.

51
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,440
Konosuba!

52
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,440
Although the rewards are nice,
there aren't any decent quests.

53
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,480
-Kazuma, Kazuma!
-I'm Kazuma.

54
00:04:11,815 --> 00:04:12,975
How about this?

55
00:04:13,242 --> 00:04:16,562
Kill quest for a pack of White Wolves.
The reward is 1 million Eris!

56
00:04:17,161 --> 00:04:21,561
Just imagining a pack of wild beasts
making a mess of me.

57
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,280
Rejected.

58
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,176
-Kazuma, Kazuma!
-Yes, I'm Kazuma.

59
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,680
How about this?

60
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,735
Kill quest for a One-shot Bear!

61
00:04:31,815 --> 00:04:35,495
Now is the time for me
to tell it which of us

62
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:38,243
has the stronger one-shot attack
with my explosion magic!

63
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,640
I want nothing to do with a monster
with such awful name.

64
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:44,285
I bet we'll die instantly
even if it only touches our necks.

65
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,504
The mobile fortress Destroyer
is approaching,

66
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,360
so we are recruiting scouts to
help predict the route it will take.

67
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,720
What is this? What's a Destroyer?

68
00:04:56,178 --> 00:04:58,418
The Destroyer is the Destroyer.

69
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,160
It's a massive fortress
that moves at high speed.

70
00:05:01,372 --> 00:05:04,132
It lumbers around, trampling everything.

71
00:05:04,244 --> 00:05:06,604
It's oddly popular with children.

72
00:05:07,104 --> 00:05:08,800
I see. I don't get it.

73
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,800
Let's see. What's this?

74
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,099
A Snow Sprite kill quest?

75
00:05:15,912 --> 00:05:18,232
Hey, what are Snow Sprites?

76
00:05:18,947 --> 00:05:21,947
They don't sound all that strong,

77
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:24,279
but it says the reward is
100,000 Eris each.

78
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:27,375
There are lots of Snow Sprites
in the snowy plains.

79
00:05:27,502 --> 00:05:31,342
It's said that spring will come half
a day sooner for every one you kill.

80
00:05:31,724 --> 00:05:34,884
They're very weak monsters,
so they're easily defeated, but...

81
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,600
If we take on that quest, I'll get ready!

82
00:05:37,728 --> 00:05:38,784
Hey, wait.

83
00:05:39,484 --> 00:05:41,564
-Are you laughing?
-Snow Sprites, huh?

84
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,400
Why does this perverted crusader, who
always wants to fight strong monsters,

85
00:05:48,885 --> 00:05:50,965
look so happy?

86
00:05:52,345 --> 00:05:54,825
Money is still the top priority now!

87
00:06:00,363 --> 00:06:02,043
These are Snow Sprites?

88
00:06:02,575 --> 00:06:05,535
Hey, what's with your outfit?

89
00:06:06,007 --> 00:06:08,887
You look like a dumb kid
in the middle of winter.

90
00:06:09,192 --> 00:06:13,072
I can catch Snow Sprites with this
and bottle them up.

91
00:06:13,154 --> 00:06:16,606
I have the idea that if we
mix them in with our drinks,

92
00:06:16,946 --> 00:06:20,226
we can have ice-cold drinks
whenever we want!

93
00:06:20,644 --> 00:06:22,364
Well? That's smart, right?

94
00:06:22,555 --> 00:06:24,355
I can see where this is going.

95
00:06:25,204 --> 00:06:27,124
Darkness, what happened to your armor?

96
00:06:27,564 --> 00:06:29,524
Are you going to be
all right in that gear?

97
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:32,859
No problem.

98
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,520
I'm a little cold, but this is...

99
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,400
A pervert with steamy thoughts
will have a high body temperature.

100
00:06:46,118 --> 00:06:51,578
KILL QUEST: KILL THE SNOW SPRITES

101
00:06:53,485 --> 00:06:57,285
Number three, wait!

102
00:06:57,568 --> 00:06:59,240
Crap! It's darting all over!

103
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:02,927
There! I caught my fourth one!

104
00:07:03,004 --> 00:07:04,604
Kazuma, look over here!

105
00:07:05,788 --> 00:07:06,908
I caught a bunch!

106
00:07:08,764 --> 00:07:11,324
If my kill count comes out too low,

107
00:07:11,424 --> 00:07:14,591
I'll just kill all the Snow Sprites
that she caught.

108
00:07:15,765 --> 00:07:16,885
Now!

109
00:07:19,995 --> 00:07:21,152
-Kazuma!
-What?

110
00:07:21,244 --> 00:07:24,164
Can I blow away all those
within this area with explosion magic?

111
00:07:24,704 --> 00:07:26,600
Sure! Wipe them all out!

112
00:07:27,084 --> 00:07:28,096
Roger!

113
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:31,804
By my command of deep crimson,

114
00:07:31,965 --> 00:07:34,165
topple this white world!

115
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:38,135
Explosion!

116
00:08:04,524 --> 00:08:06,484
Hey, are you all right?

117
00:08:08,081 --> 00:08:10,241
I got eight of them.

118
00:08:10,604 --> 00:08:13,444
A total of nine Snow Sprites
were defeated.

119
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,980
I even went up a level.

120
00:08:16,109 --> 00:08:17,758
Oh, good job!

121
00:08:17,855 --> 00:08:21,375
If I'm not buried in the snow,
I'll look cooler.

122
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:23,890
What the heck?

123
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,480
Killing Snow Sprites
is totally delectable!

124
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:30,605
Why isn't anybody doing this?

125
00:08:31,524 --> 00:08:32,896
-There it is!
-What?

126
00:08:38,298 --> 00:08:39,818
What is that?

127
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:40,960
Exciting!

128
00:08:42,284 --> 00:08:44,524
She's playing dead?

129
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,664
Kazuma!

130
00:08:46,465 --> 00:08:51,345
Let me tell you why other adventurers
won't accept this quest.

131
00:08:53,604 --> 00:08:55,764
You lived in Japan.

132
00:08:55,964 --> 00:08:59,444
I'm sure you've heard the name
in the news or weather forecasts.

133
00:08:59,844 --> 00:09:02,004
He's the Snow Sprites' master,

134
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,440
and is also said to evoke
the image of winter.

135
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,804
Yes, the Winter Shogun has arrived!

136
00:09:10,715 --> 00:09:11,776
What?

137
00:09:14,094 --> 00:09:15,334
Winter Shogun!

138
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,072
One of the specially designated monsters

139
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,320
the country has put a huge bounty on.

140
00:09:22,545 --> 00:09:25,635
I'm sure this monster plans
to use his position as shogun

141
00:09:25,728 --> 00:09:27,564
to have his way with me.

142
00:09:28,244 --> 00:09:30,164
I'll resist him, but...

143
00:09:30,235 --> 00:09:32,995
he will be beyond my capabilities,
and I'll be shamed.

144
00:09:34,884 --> 00:09:35,944
Stupid!

145
00:09:36,084 --> 00:09:39,724
All things in this nonsense world,
the people, food, or monsters,

146
00:09:39,808 --> 00:09:42,635
are all absolutely stupid!

147
00:09:57,404 --> 00:09:58,644
My sword!

148
00:10:05,595 --> 00:10:09,381
Sprites can be transformed
based on the subconscious thoughts

149
00:10:09,536 --> 00:10:11,284
of the people they encounter.

150
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,514
But the ones strolling around
outside town in winter

151
00:10:14,604 --> 00:10:17,884
are mostly just cheaters
who came here from Japan.

152
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,200
So this one was brought to life
by some idiot who came here from Japan,

153
00:10:21,275 --> 00:10:24,990
and associated winter
with the Winter Shogun?

154
00:10:25,481 --> 00:10:27,841
Such pain in the neck!

155
00:10:29,824 --> 00:10:33,880
I'll step on that girl
who's been playing dead later.

156
00:10:34,665 --> 00:10:36,201
-Kazuma!
-What is it?

157
00:10:36,352 --> 00:10:37,941
The Winter Shogun is merciful.

158
00:10:38,065 --> 00:10:41,425
If we politely apologize,
he'll overlook this!

159
00:10:49,364 --> 00:10:52,294
Kneel down. Kneel down before him!
Come on!

160
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,570
Toss your weapons aside and kneel down!

161
00:10:54,764 --> 00:10:57,884
Apologize! Hurry up
and apologize, Kazuma!

162
00:10:59,124 --> 00:11:02,924
The former goddess who appears
to have abandoned all of her pride

163
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,540
knelt down magnificently.

164
00:11:08,109 --> 00:11:10,909
Hey, hurry up and bow your head!

165
00:11:11,028 --> 00:11:12,708
Even though no one is watching,

166
00:11:12,832 --> 00:11:15,560
a knight like me would
never bow down to a monster.

167
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:20,789
You trail behind those monsters
all the time!

168
00:11:20,884 --> 00:11:23,724
Why do you show off your pride
at times like these?

169
00:11:24,644 --> 00:11:25,964
Stop it!

170
00:11:26,746 --> 00:11:29,426
You're forcing me to bow down
even when I refused,

171
00:11:29,545 --> 00:11:31,225
and shove my face into the ground!

172
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,080
What a reward!

173
00:11:36,325 --> 00:11:37,805
The snow is so cold.

174
00:11:38,444 --> 00:11:39,448
Kazuma!

175
00:11:40,144 --> 00:11:41,344
Your weapon, your weapon!

176
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,680
Throw away the sword you're holding!

177
00:11:55,156 --> 00:11:56,316
That's right.

178
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,983
I was killed by the Winter Shogun.

179
00:12:00,705 --> 00:12:02,185
Mr. Sato Kazuma.

180
00:12:03,753 --> 00:12:05,713
Welcome to the afterlife.

181
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,240
I am Eris, the goddess
who'll lead you down a new path.

182
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,800
Your life in this world

183
00:12:15,844 --> 00:12:17,284
is now over.

184
00:12:20,764 --> 00:12:23,084
This feels familiar.

185
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,627
Is this also how it was when I met Aqua?

186
00:12:29,394 --> 00:12:31,994
Are you a goddess of this world?

187
00:12:32,364 --> 00:12:34,764
Yes, Mr. Sato Kazuma.

188
00:12:35,424 --> 00:12:39,084
You came all the way from
peaceful Japan to this world,

189
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,964
only for this to happen to you...

190
00:12:42,859 --> 00:12:44,259
What's with this goddess?

191
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:47,190
Is she mourning my death?

192
00:12:47,724 --> 00:12:49,724
She's not like that useless goddess!

193
00:12:50,244 --> 00:12:52,484
Brave hero from the parallel world.

194
00:12:52,732 --> 00:12:53,812
Yes?

195
00:12:54,165 --> 00:12:56,116
With my power,

196
00:12:56,203 --> 00:12:59,427
you will be reincarnated
back to Japan in a wealthy family,

197
00:12:59,724 --> 00:13:03,564
and lead a life of comfort.

198
00:13:03,812 --> 00:13:05,852
Wait, you can do that?

199
00:13:06,944 --> 00:13:08,499
If you wish for it.

200
00:13:08,884 --> 00:13:10,484
For real?

201
00:13:10,785 --> 00:13:11,955
If it's possible,

202
00:13:12,064 --> 00:13:14,814
I'd like above-average
charm, wisdom, and strength,

203
00:13:14,884 --> 00:13:18,284
as well as a beautiful girl
as my childhood friend!

204
00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:21,179
Well, that is more than I can...

205
00:13:21,266 --> 00:13:23,746
Wow, thank goodness!

206
00:13:23,909 --> 00:13:25,472
I thought it was all over,

207
00:13:25,734 --> 00:13:28,614
but now it feels like I pulled through
by the skin of my teeth.

208
00:13:28,973 --> 00:13:31,933
This is a reward for my hard work, right?

209
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,920
Because my life up to now
had been so awful!

210
00:13:35,484 --> 00:13:36,604
Yes.

211
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,200
I looked in on your life
from time to time.

212
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,040
I believe your days
were filled with adversity.

213
00:13:43,486 --> 00:13:45,406
You said it!

214
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,960
I thought I'd go on
a thrilling adventure like in a game.

215
00:13:50,189 --> 00:13:52,709
This looks like a misleading
promo video, isn't it?

216
00:13:54,004 --> 00:13:56,592
The useless goddess who came
with me as a reincarnation perk

217
00:13:56,725 --> 00:13:59,085
was just an arrogant one.

218
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:00,972
We recruited allies,

219
00:14:01,116 --> 00:14:03,264
but the only one who turned up
was a crazy explosion girl,

220
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:05,379
who fell flat every time
she used her magic,

221
00:14:05,797 --> 00:14:09,717
and a perverted crusader
whose attacks always missed.

222
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,324
I was an adventurer,

223
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,170
but I did construction, side jobs,
and was forced into cabbage hunting.

224
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:20,288
I was in great debt
after defeating a boss enemy.

225
00:14:21,312 --> 00:14:25,888
Sleeping in the stables only froze me
to death, let alone restore my energy.

226
00:14:27,168 --> 00:14:29,984
Do you know how it feels to have
your eyelashes frozen every morning?

227
00:14:31,895 --> 00:14:36,055
The previous world was poorly balanced.

228
00:14:46,128 --> 00:14:47,200
Wait...

229
00:14:51,684 --> 00:14:52,736
Why?

230
00:14:54,025 --> 00:14:55,945
After you is reborn,

231
00:14:56,724 --> 00:14:59,444
may you be blessed once more
with kind encounters.

232
00:15:06,619 --> 00:15:09,379
I see. It appears...

233
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,520
I was unexpectedly fond of
that terrible world

234
00:15:15,555 --> 00:15:17,315
that I thought I hated.

235
00:15:18,244 --> 00:15:19,324
I wanted to

236
00:15:20,225 --> 00:15:22,465
adventure with those girls
a little longer.

237
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:27,105
-Now, return to us, Kazuma!
-What?

238
00:15:27,564 --> 00:15:31,402
How could you get killed off so easily?
It's too soon for you to die!

239
00:15:31,815 --> 00:15:32,864
What?

240
00:15:33,504 --> 00:15:35,162
This is Aqua's voice?

241
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,680
Is it really you?

242
00:15:36,844 --> 00:15:38,844
Hey, Kazuma, can you hear me?

243
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:41,248
I cast recovery magic on your body,

244
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,476
so you can come back to this side now.

245
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,400
Oh, for real?

246
00:15:45,725 --> 00:15:47,552
Please wait a moment!

247
00:15:47,684 --> 00:15:50,844
You've already been reborn once,
so according to the laws of Heaven,

248
00:15:50,915 --> 00:15:53,195
you can't be revived again!

249
00:15:53,326 --> 00:15:55,846
Is that true? Aqua!

250
00:15:55,924 --> 00:15:57,632
She says that according to
the laws of Heaven,

251
00:15:57,824 --> 00:16:01,747
I can't be revived again since
I was reborn before!

252
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:06,343
Which goddess is spouting that nonsense?

253
00:16:06,444 --> 00:16:08,599
Hey, identify yourself!

254
00:16:08,815 --> 00:16:12,665
Why did a goddess in charge of
the desolated area say that to me,

255
00:16:12,755 --> 00:16:14,475
an elite in charge of Japan?

256
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,329
Hey, knock it off!

257
00:16:16,404 --> 00:16:20,367
The face of the goddess in charge of
the desolated area is twitching now!

258
00:16:21,004 --> 00:16:22,048
Erm...

259
00:16:22,465 --> 00:16:24,835
she's a goddess called Eris.

260
00:16:25,045 --> 00:16:26,125
Eris?

261
00:16:26,255 --> 00:16:29,344
The one who's grown cocky and
even become a unit of currency,

262
00:16:29,484 --> 00:16:32,672
just because she's worshiped
in the religion of this world?

263
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,040
-Hey, Kazuma!
-Yes?

264
00:16:35,165 --> 00:16:37,320
If Eris gives you any more trouble,

265
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,575
-I'll confiscate her breast pads...
-I understand!

266
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,804
An exception!
I'll deem this an exception!

267
00:16:41,881 --> 00:16:43,424
I'll open the gate right now!

268
00:16:43,604 --> 00:16:44,604
They're pads?

269
00:16:44,724 --> 00:16:48,524
-My god, Aqua is so unreasonable.
-They're pads?

270
00:16:48,605 --> 00:16:50,805
Konosuba. I don't mind if they're pads.

271
00:16:52,964 --> 00:16:55,044
You are now connected
to the living world.

272
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,960
This normally never happens, you know.

273
00:17:00,705 --> 00:17:02,261
You are called Kazuma right?

274
00:17:02,364 --> 00:17:04,684
Erm, yes!

275
00:17:09,244 --> 00:17:10,524
This is...

276
00:17:11,524 --> 00:17:12,844
our little secret, okay?

277
00:17:31,604 --> 00:17:34,564
Kazuma! Kazuma, please wake up!

278
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:35,970
Kazuma!

279
00:17:38,284 --> 00:17:40,365
Oh, you're finally awake?

280
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,683
Sheesh, that girl is so hardheaded.

281
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,371
Kazuma!

282
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:49,856
This is extremely embarrassing.

283
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,880
Oh, come on. Kazuma,

284
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:55,244
what are you blushing for? Say something!

285
00:17:57,063 --> 00:18:00,143
I brought you back to life, you know?

286
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,360
Don't you have anything to say? Come on.

287
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:09,130
I want to trade this useless goddess
for that cute goddess just now.

288
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,450
Say something.

289
00:18:11,542 --> 00:18:14,875
Like an apology for how you've treated
such a high-class goddess

290
00:18:14,946 --> 00:18:16,936
with such contempt all this time.

291
00:18:17,056 --> 00:18:19,080
Goddess change!

292
00:18:19,522 --> 00:18:21,522
Fine, you scoundrel!

293
00:18:22,112 --> 00:18:26,192
Why don't I send you to meet
Eris right away?

294
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,553
Calm down, Aqua!

295
00:18:30,627 --> 00:18:34,347
How do you feel?
Do you feel uncomfortable?

296
00:18:35,545 --> 00:18:37,256
I think I'm okay.

297
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,680
Great! You died in such
a terrible way, after all...

298
00:18:42,635 --> 00:18:44,715
How was I killed?

299
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,204
You were beheaded by the Winter Shogun.

300
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,430
It was quite a clean chop.

301
00:18:51,645 --> 00:18:53,605
Beheaded!

302
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,024
Winter in this world

303
00:19:01,396 --> 00:19:04,990
is a season where only those who make
it through the struggle for survival,

304
00:19:05,084 --> 00:19:07,634
despite the scarce food
and harsh environment,

305
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,610
are allowed to be alive and active.

306
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,805
There aren't any quests
beginners like us can complete easily.

307
00:19:16,505 --> 00:19:18,065
Okay, retreat!

308
00:19:18,364 --> 00:19:20,533
KILL QUEST: KILL THE SNOW SPRITES. RETIRED

309
00:19:20,699 --> 00:19:22,819
Konosuba!

310
00:19:30,923 --> 00:19:32,163
A Snow Sprite?

311
00:19:33,324 --> 00:19:36,404
I didn't only prostrate myself.

312
00:19:36,695 --> 00:19:40,095
I pretended to set them all free,
but I saved just one.

313
00:19:40,564 --> 00:19:44,204
I guess the Winter Shogun couldn't see
through my convincing performance!

314
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:46,124
Way to go, Aqua!

315
00:19:46,425 --> 00:19:48,945
All right, hand it over and I'll kill it.

316
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,560
What? No!

317
00:19:50,633 --> 00:19:53,153
I'm going to bring it home
and make it a refrigerator!

318
00:19:53,284 --> 00:19:56,084
The reward for killing it is
100,000 each!

319
00:19:56,156 --> 00:20:00,556
No! Not this one!
I've already given it a name!

320
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,351
I won't let you kill it! Don't! Don't!

321
00:20:03,444 --> 00:20:05,244
She's resisting more than I expected.

322
00:20:05,524 --> 00:20:07,284
Let her be, Kazuma.

323
00:20:08,284 --> 00:20:09,403
Oh, fine.

324
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,325
I'll raise it with care,

325
00:20:15,404 --> 00:20:18,284
and when summer comes,
I'll have it make lots of ice.

326
00:20:18,452 --> 00:20:20,372
Then we'll open a snow cone shop!

327
00:20:20,564 --> 00:20:23,564
We'll sleep together on hot,
restless nights.

328
00:20:24,164 --> 00:20:26,284
Hey, what does this little one eat?

329
00:20:26,615 --> 00:20:29,632
Do Snow Sprites eat anything?

330
00:20:29,888 --> 00:20:32,531
They look so fluffy and soft.

331
00:20:33,195 --> 00:20:36,715
Maybe if you put some sugar on it
and take a bite, it might be tasty.

332
00:20:36,804 --> 00:20:38,524
I won't let you eat it!

333
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,600
Actually, I've worked up an appetite.

334
00:20:42,404 --> 00:20:43,764
Let's order something!

335
00:20:44,436 --> 00:20:46,396
What should I choose?

336
00:20:47,684 --> 00:20:49,284
That goddess...

337
00:20:50,221 --> 00:20:53,261
She mourned for my death,

338
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,680
and smiled kindly when I was revived.

339
00:20:58,564 --> 00:20:59,804
This is...

340
00:21:01,024 --> 00:21:02,207
our little secret, okay?

341
00:21:02,656 --> 00:21:05,894
A righteous, beautiful girl
who's not an oddball.

342
00:21:06,124 --> 00:21:10,364
After I came to this world,
the main heroine has finally appeared.

343
00:21:10,485 --> 00:21:12,765
Kazuma, aren't you going to eat?

344
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:18,094
Hey, how much did you guys order?

345
00:21:18,185 --> 00:21:20,755
A great wizard like me

346
00:21:20,843 --> 00:21:24,003
will require great sacrifices
in order to function.

347
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:28,514
Any problem? I brought you
back to life today, Kazuma!

348
00:21:28,604 --> 00:21:31,004
There's nothing wrong with
a reward of this size, right?

349
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:33,248
I put a little of the reward
from the quest into it!

350
00:21:33,404 --> 00:21:35,844
That money was to get us
through the winter!

351
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,080
-What's the problem?
-What?

352
00:21:37,164 --> 00:21:39,842
We can always accept another quest.

353
00:21:40,075 --> 00:21:42,115
What kind of monster
should we fight next?

354
00:21:42,396 --> 00:21:45,236
Maybe the one that contains
