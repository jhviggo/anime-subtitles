1
00:00:19,245 --> 00:00:23,125
Why is this different from the life
in a parallel world I imagined?

2
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,520
Rookie adventurers have no steady income.

3
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,010
Sleeping in the stable is a common thing.

4
00:00:31,555 --> 00:00:33,435
The adventurers actually

5
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,200
are no different from poor wanderers.

6
00:00:37,097 --> 00:00:38,697
Even in wealthy Japan,

7
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,880
wanderers are not able to
sleep at the hotel every day.

8
00:00:43,065 --> 00:00:46,105
Minimum wage, labor law,

9
00:00:46,326 --> 00:00:47,966
what are those? Are they delicious?

10
00:00:52,935 --> 00:00:54,135
Good morning.

11
00:00:54,585 --> 00:00:57,705
Good morning? It is almost afternoon.

12
00:00:58,215 --> 00:01:00,014
Didn't you say you want to go for crusade?

13
00:01:01,926 --> 00:01:03,900
I feel relaxed once I think
that I don't have to

14
00:01:03,946 --> 00:01:05,786
go to the construction site
to move bricks.

15
00:01:06,976 --> 00:01:10,136
Is the sentence
"count on me" yesterday a joke?

16
00:01:10,796 --> 00:01:13,406
Besides, didn't you say
the world is invaded by the devil

17
00:01:13,446 --> 00:01:15,446
and threatened by growing crisis?

18
00:01:15,856 --> 00:01:17,496
It's quite peaceful.

19
00:01:17,846 --> 00:01:19,566
I didn't even see a hair of the devil.

20
00:01:20,056 --> 00:01:23,336
Here is the furthest town
from the City of Devil.

21
00:01:23,741 --> 00:01:26,501
Besides, there are only
rookie adventurers here.

22
00:01:26,546 --> 00:01:28,386
It is impossible for
the devil to come here.

23
00:01:29,226 --> 00:01:30,346
That's true.

24
00:01:30,987 --> 00:01:33,827
Then let's go for crusade.

25
00:01:34,401 --> 00:01:36,481
Wait for me to show my capabilities.

26
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:40,269
I think you said similar words yesterday.

27
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,880
However, that's true
as you are a goddess.

28
00:01:44,135 --> 00:01:45,335
I'll count on you then.

29
00:01:45,813 --> 00:01:49,133
Okay, let's get
basic equipment and set out.

30
00:01:51,753 --> 00:01:54,033
How long do you want to stay? You idiot!

31
00:01:54,232 --> 00:01:56,010
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:21,856
(KONOSUBA:
God's Blessing on This Wonderful World!)

33
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,080
(Episode 2: An Explosion for This Chuunibyo!)

34
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,080
CRUSADE MISSION -
CRUSADE 5 GIANT TOADS WITHIN 3 DAYS

35
00:03:41,491 --> 00:03:44,931
Help, Aqua, help me.

36
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:49,629
Oh dear! It's so funny!

37
00:03:49,722 --> 00:03:51,790
Kazuma, why is your face flushed?

38
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:54,096
Why do you look so tiring
and with watery eyes?

39
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,409
I will definitely bury her
after we get home later.

40
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,500
Giant toads, although they are just frogs,

41
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,880
they really can't be underestimated.

42
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,012
If the breeding season comes, in order
to save their strength to lay eggs,

43
00:04:06,122 --> 00:04:08,042
they even go to the village
where there are baits.

44
00:04:08,195 --> 00:04:11,387
I heard that they will even swallow
the goats raised by the villagers.

45
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:15,679
Besides, it seems that
when toads' breeding season comes,

46
00:04:15,848 --> 00:04:20,048
there will be children or villagers
missing in the village.

47
00:04:20,274 --> 00:04:22,914
By the way, although toad meat
is a bit hard,

48
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:26,633
it's still very popular
as food as it tastes good.

49
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:30,505
Kazuma, if you want me to save you,

50
00:04:30,531 --> 00:04:34,211
let's start with
using honorifics when talking to me.

51
00:04:34,401 --> 00:04:36,481
Master Aqua!

52
00:04:36,547 --> 00:04:38,227
I really can't help it.

53
00:04:38,304 --> 00:04:40,824
Then I will save you, jobless otaku.

54
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:43,791
To express gratitude, you have to
worship me in the future.

55
00:04:44,311 --> 00:04:45,151
What?

56
00:04:45,239 --> 00:04:47,999
Join Axis Sect
when you go back to the town.

57
00:04:48,065 --> 00:04:50,545
Pray to me three times a day.

58
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:51,619
When eating,

59
00:04:51,663 --> 00:04:55,023
as long as I say "give me",
you have to obey and give it to me.

60
00:04:55,049 --> 00:04:56,129
Moreover...

61
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,710
You are eaten!

62
00:05:11,175 --> 00:05:13,138
With Aqua in its mouth,

63
00:05:13,204 --> 00:05:14,924
the toad can't move for the moment.
That's great.

64
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,860
Thank you, Kazuma.

65
00:05:22,152 --> 00:05:25,152
Thank you.

66
00:05:27,007 --> 00:05:28,647
It stinks!

67
00:05:29,575 --> 00:05:31,468
Let's go back first for today.

68
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,560
This is not the creature we can deal with.

69
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,460
Let's go back
and get some equipment first.

70
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,880
However, I have been tarnished.

71
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,058
If my situation now is seen

72
00:05:44,102 --> 00:05:47,251
by the followers of Axis Sect,
they will definitely give up faith,

73
00:05:47,561 --> 00:05:50,201
not to mention I was defeated by a toad.

74
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,600
If this is known, the reputation
of goddess Aqua will be destroyed.

75
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,320
You usually stupidly work and
sweat with a group of uncles.

76
00:05:58,855 --> 00:06:02,375
The only pleasure after showering
in the evening is dinner and some wine.

77
00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:05,815
After that, you even drool
when sleeping in the stable.

78
00:06:06,055 --> 00:06:08,255
Now you said you have been tarnished.

79
00:06:11,553 --> 00:06:12,673
Wait, Aqua!

80
00:06:12,858 --> 00:06:15,113
I'll let you see the power of God!

81
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,495
How dare you block my way!

82
00:06:17,538 --> 00:06:19,698
You even dare to challenge me!

83
00:06:19,771 --> 00:06:22,251
Go to hell
for self-reflection and repentance!

84
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,950
Fist of God!

85
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,960
The so-called fist of God blends
with the goddess's anger and sorrow!

86
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:31,496
The enemy will die!

87
00:06:38,317 --> 00:06:39,549
Toad or something,

88
00:06:39,575 --> 00:06:41,775
it's pretty cute after looking carefully.

89
00:06:43,579 --> 00:06:45,179
Aqua!

90
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,927
TODAY'S RESULT - CRUSADED 2 GIANT TOADS

91
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:53,225
TOAD X 2 = 10000 ERIS

92
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,180
The girl is so cute.

93
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,175
It seems the power of
two people can't beat them.

94
00:07:04,243 --> 00:07:05,843
Let's recruit companions.

95
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,310
A toad only values 5000 Eris.

96
00:07:09,175 --> 00:07:12,335
It has no difference from moving bricks.

97
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:15,655
I didn't expect that it's quite delicious.

98
00:07:15,712 --> 00:07:18,272
Although it's a bit hard,
but it is very chewy.

99
00:07:18,692 --> 00:07:22,152
As for recruitment,
will anyone want to team up with

100
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,600
rookies who have
no decent equipment like us?

101
00:07:24,686 --> 00:07:26,446
I'm there.
Don't worry that no one will join us.

102
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,323
Swallow it!
Talk after you swallow the food.

103
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,760
I'm the most superior priest.

104
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:37,453
No matter what team it is,
they will definitely covet me.

105
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,970
Once I post a recruitment notice,

106
00:07:39,996 --> 00:07:43,516
people who will say
"please, let me join you" must be a lot.

107
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:46,649
Give me another piece of
fried toad if you understand it.

108
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,446
THE NEXT DAY

109
00:07:56,106 --> 00:07:57,460
There are too few people today.

110
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,760
Yes, it's too relaxed today.

111
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,640
Is today a day off?

112
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,720
No one comes.

113
00:08:03,394 --> 00:08:06,434
The recruitment notice
has been posted for half a day.

114
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,910
None of the future hero
candidates has come.

115
00:08:11,135 --> 00:08:14,695
Recruitment, this is
a lively and warm team.

116
00:08:14,905 --> 00:08:17,065
Adventurers who want to
start a journey with

117
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,210
the beautiful and elegant priest,
Master Aqua, please come to register.

118
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,800
I'm very happy every day in this team.

119
00:08:23,874 --> 00:08:25,646
I even won the lottery.

120
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,480
Luckily, I joined Master Aqua's team.

121
00:08:28,547 --> 00:08:30,947
Even my illness has been cured,
and I recently have become popular.

122
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,700
Entry requirement.

123
00:08:32,941 --> 00:08:35,301
Only for senior professional adventurers.

124
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,120
Let's lower the entry requirement.

125
00:08:40,495 --> 00:08:43,935
No matter what,
the entry requirement is too strict.

126
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,710
However...

127
00:08:46,913 --> 00:08:49,073
No one will come if it goes on like this.

128
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,290
Furthermore, although you are
in a senior occupation,

129
00:08:52,352 --> 00:08:53,872
I am in the weakest one.

130
00:08:54,247 --> 00:08:57,087
I'll be ashamed
if I'm surrounded by elites.

131
00:08:57,182 --> 00:09:00,142
I have seen the recruitment notice.

132
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,160
This destined encounter
is the result of the world's choice.

133
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,400
I'm looking forward to
meeting people like you.

134
00:09:14,215 --> 00:09:18,095
My name is Megumin. I am a mage.

135
00:09:18,175 --> 00:09:22,295
The strongest attack and
explosion magic spellcaster.

136
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,640
Well...

137
00:09:28,298 --> 00:09:29,978
My forbidden ability
which is discriminated by the world

138
00:09:30,054 --> 00:09:32,414
as its lethality is too strong,

139
00:09:32,468 --> 00:09:33,868
are you desperate for it?

140
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:36,219
Since it is so,

141
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,980
let's look long into an ultimate abyss.

142
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,040
When you look long into an abyss,

143
00:09:42,296 --> 00:09:44,957
the abyss looks back into you.

144
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,333
Are you here to talk about jokes?

145
00:09:48,527 --> 00:09:50,047
Of course not.

146
00:09:51,305 --> 00:09:54,305
Crimson colored eyes.
Are you from the Crimson Demon village?

147
00:09:54,975 --> 00:09:59,335
Yes, I am the best magician
in Crimson Demon village, Megumin.

148
00:09:59,775 --> 00:10:04,827
My unique magic's power can make mountains
fall and the earth split...

149
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,610
What's wrong with you?

150
00:10:11,972 --> 00:10:15,252
I haven't eaten for three days.

151
00:10:15,642 --> 00:10:18,442
Can you give me something to eat?

152
00:10:18,546 --> 00:10:20,466
Of course I can treat you to a meal,

153
00:10:20,782 --> 00:10:22,379
but what happened to your eye?

154
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,360
Let her treat you if you are injured.

155
00:10:25,803 --> 00:10:28,283
She is very powerful
although she has only recovering magic.

156
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,295
Only?

157
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,340
This is a magical item
to suppress my powerful magic.

158
00:10:35,038 --> 00:10:37,118
If it is taken off,

159
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:41,104
this world will suffer huge disasters.

160
00:10:41,895 --> 00:10:44,295
It is like a seal?

161
00:10:44,775 --> 00:10:46,255
I made up a story.

162
00:10:46,527 --> 00:10:48,447
I only wear it for fashion.

163
00:10:49,366 --> 00:10:52,006
I'm sorry. Please don't pull it!

164
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:54,366
Stop it!

165
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,529
Well...

166
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:57,461
She is like the people
in Crimson Demon village.

167
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,040
They were all born with
high intelligence and strong magic.

168
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:02,509
They are generally expert magicians

169
00:11:02,582 --> 00:11:05,862
-with some strange names.
-Yes, let go slowly, slowly.

170
00:11:06,806 --> 00:11:08,769
My eye hurts!

171
00:11:09,422 --> 00:11:11,782
I'm sorry. I thought you were fooling me

172
00:11:12,055 --> 00:11:14,855
as you said something strange
and even your name is so weird.

173
00:11:15,928 --> 00:11:17,892
It's so rude to judge my name.

174
00:11:18,022 --> 00:11:22,542
I think the names of people
on the street are the weird ones.

175
00:11:23,411 --> 00:11:24,971
By the way, what are
the names of your parents?

176
00:11:25,424 --> 00:11:28,624
My mother is Yuiyui,
and my father is Hyoizaburoo.

177
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:35,511
Most of the people in her village
are excellent magicians, right?

178
00:11:36,527 --> 00:11:40,567
Say it if you have any comments
on the names of my parents.

179
00:11:40,635 --> 00:11:42,635
Hyoizaburoo.

180
00:11:48,072 --> 00:11:50,500
There is no way
to fake the adventurer card.

181
00:11:50,703 --> 00:11:53,103
It seems that she is really a mage.

182
00:11:54,054 --> 00:11:57,014
She is a senior mage
who can use powerful attack magic.

183
00:11:57,086 --> 00:12:00,006
The magic value of
this girl is really high.

184
00:12:00,322 --> 00:12:05,042
Isn't it great
if she really can use explosion magic?

185
00:12:05,238 --> 00:12:07,431
That is the strongest attack magic.

186
00:12:09,499 --> 00:12:11,379
"This girl", "she", what are those?

187
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:13,520
Please call my name.

188
00:12:18,402 --> 00:12:21,002
Well, order something, Ms. Mage.

189
00:12:23,122 --> 00:12:26,189
CRUSADE MISSION -
CRUSADE 5 GIANT TOADS WITHIN 3 DAYS

190
00:12:26,215 --> 00:12:29,335
MISSION COMPLETION RATE 2/5

191
00:12:29,778 --> 00:12:32,018
As explosion magic is the strongest magic,

192
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:35,479
the preparation time is relatively longer.

193
00:12:36,515 --> 00:12:40,355
During the preparation period,
please hold the toad down.

194
00:12:40,491 --> 00:12:42,371
Okay, count on us.

195
00:12:42,989 --> 00:12:44,149
Kazuma, there is another one!

196
00:12:45,451 --> 00:12:46,971
Are they coming together?

197
00:12:49,258 --> 00:12:51,538
Make the distant one the target.

198
00:12:51,775 --> 00:12:53,015
I got it.

199
00:12:53,186 --> 00:12:54,247
As for the one near us,

200
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,240
let's go, Aqua.

201
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,910
Anyway, you were a goddess.

202
00:12:58,955 --> 00:13:01,475
Let me see your power for some time.

203
00:13:01,545 --> 00:13:02,705
Were?

204
00:13:02,731 --> 00:13:05,571
I'm a goddess here and now.

205
00:13:05,862 --> 00:13:06,742
Goddess?

206
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,470
She is a self-proclaimed goddess,
what a poor child.

207
00:13:10,553 --> 00:13:14,018
She will talk nonsense sometimes.
I hope you don't mind.

208
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,470
What a poor girl.

209
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:17,749
What?

210
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,160
Although combat family
does not work with these toads,

211
00:13:20,228 --> 00:13:21,308
but it will work this time.

212
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,500
Look, Kazuma.

213
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,600
I'll show you how great I'm.

214
00:13:27,036 --> 00:13:28,943
Sleep with trembling.

215
00:13:29,381 --> 00:13:31,301
Lullaby of God!

216
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:33,312
The so-called lullaby of God means

217
00:13:33,349 --> 00:13:35,829
a requiem full of love and
sadness of the goddess.

218
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,560
The enemy will die.

219
00:13:44,117 --> 00:13:45,517
She is indeed a goddess.

220
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,599
She sacrificed herself
to get us more time.

221
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,660
Darkness is blacker than black
and darker than dark.

222
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,320
I beseech you to
combine with my deep crimson.

223
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,360
The time of awakening comes.

224
00:13:58,455 --> 00:14:00,815
Justice falls upon
the infallible boundary.

225
00:14:00,945 --> 00:14:03,585
Appear now as an intangible distortion!

226
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,610
Dance!

227
00:14:06,728 --> 00:14:09,648
I desire for my torrent of
power as destructive force:

228
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,840
a destructive force no one can match!

229
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:15,737
Return all creation to cinders
and come from the abyss!

230
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,518
This is the mightiest means
of attack known to man,

231
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:25,260
the ultimate attack magic! Explosion!

232
00:14:48,251 --> 00:14:49,641
Amazing.

233
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,689
So, this is magic?

234
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:00,451
Was it awakened
by the sound of the explosion?

235
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,460
Megumin, let's hide first.

236
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:08,822
As my mystic explosion magic

237
00:15:08,961 --> 00:15:10,635
possesses tremendous might,

238
00:15:10,756 --> 00:15:12,836
it consumes tremendous magical power.

239
00:15:13,616 --> 00:15:17,936
In short, I used magical power
beyond my limits,

240
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:20,079
so now I can't move at all.

241
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,786
I never expected to have so many toads
popping out so close by.

242
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,504
This is bad. I'm going to be eaten.

243
00:15:28,758 --> 00:15:31,358
Sorry, could you help me...

244
00:15:35,695 --> 00:15:39,520
You guys, don't get eaten like this!

245
00:15:40,387 --> 00:15:42,069
TODAY'S RESULTS - CRUSADED 3 GIANT TOADS

246
00:15:42,095 --> 00:15:43,455
SUCCESSFULLY CRUSADED 5 IN TOTAL

247
00:15:43,468 --> 00:15:45,765
QUEST COMPLETED

248
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,930
Wow, it's huge!

249
00:15:53,331 --> 00:15:56,691
It's so stinky.

250
00:15:57,358 --> 00:16:01,318
The toad's mouth is a bit stinky,
but it feels quite warm.

251
00:16:02,664 --> 00:16:05,064
That is information I don't need to know.

252
00:16:05,935 --> 00:16:09,244
You're banned from using explosion magic
except in emergency situations.

253
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,120
Just use ordinary magic.

254
00:16:12,335 --> 00:16:13,535
I can't.

255
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,520
What?

256
00:16:15,132 --> 00:16:17,532
I can only use explosion magic.

257
00:16:17,928 --> 00:16:20,402
I can't use any other type of magic.

258
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:22,464
Really?

259
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:24,542
Yes.

260
00:16:27,075 --> 00:16:29,155
Hey, wait right there!

261
00:16:30,412 --> 00:16:32,732
If your level is high enough
to use explosion magic,

262
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,840
shouldn't you be able
to use other magic too?

263
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:38,999
I didn't learn all the arch priest spells

264
00:16:39,072 --> 00:16:41,912
until I learned the party trick skills.

265
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,640
What would you use party trick skills for?

266
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:48,651
I am an arch mage
who loves explosion magic above all else.

267
00:16:49,015 --> 00:16:51,735
I don't like any other magic
in the detonation family.

268
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,300
I only like explosion magic!

269
00:16:54,364 --> 00:16:58,204
I could, of course, easily go on
adventures if I learned other magic,

270
00:16:58,372 --> 00:16:59,732
but that just won't do!

271
00:16:59,842 --> 00:17:02,482
I only love explosion magic!

272
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:04,629
Even if only one use per day is my limit,

273
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:07,089
otherwise I collapse after using my magic,

274
00:17:07,186 --> 00:17:10,546
explosion magic is still
the only magic I'll ever love!

275
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:13,789
After all, I chose the path of a mage

276
00:17:13,861 --> 00:17:16,913
solely because I could use explosion magic!

277
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,624
Great! It's simply wonderful!

278
00:17:21,722 --> 00:17:26,282
Inefficient though it is,
I am touched by your romantic pursuit!

279
00:17:26,561 --> 00:17:30,081
Oh dear, it seems
this magician is hopeless.

280
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,720
The fact that Aqua
sympathizes with her proves it.

281
00:17:34,548 --> 00:17:36,148
Based on these two battles,

282
00:17:36,261 --> 00:17:40,381
I highly suspect this goddess
is completely useless too.

283
00:17:41,432 --> 00:17:44,352
Frankly, I don't need any more
problematic children to put up with.

284
00:17:45,907 --> 00:17:47,227
I see!

285
00:17:47,253 --> 00:17:49,853
I'm sure the path ahead of you
will be thorny, but just do your best!

286
00:17:49,913 --> 00:17:51,913
Once we reach the guild,
we'll split the reward evenly.

287
00:17:51,974 --> 00:17:53,694
Then let's meet up somewhere else
when we get a chance.

288
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,900
My only wish is to use
my explosion magic.

289
00:17:58,134 --> 00:18:01,134
I would be fine with
going unpaid if needed.

290
00:18:01,357 --> 00:18:04,747
Yes, an arch mage's
mighty power can be yours

291
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:06,909
for the low cost of food and sundries!

292
00:18:06,974 --> 00:18:10,974
What choice do you have but to
make a long-term contract with me?

293
00:18:11,014 --> 00:18:13,354
No, such mighty power

294
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,940
would be wasted on a puny party
of rookie adventurers like us.

295
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,080
No, it's fine,
even if you are puny or just rookies!

296
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:24,225
Although I am a senior, I'm only level 6.

297
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:27,210
Please don't tear my hand away.

298
00:18:27,264 --> 00:18:31,359
No, what kind of magician
can only use a spell once a day?

299
00:18:31,455 --> 00:18:33,716
This girl

300
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:36,139
has got a surprisingly
strong grip as a magician!

301
00:18:36,388 --> 00:18:37,908
Hey, let go!

302
00:18:37,934 --> 00:18:39,864
You've got dumped
by some other party, didn't you?

303
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,101
Let go!

304
00:18:41,127 --> 00:18:42,869
If we go into a dungeon,

305
00:18:42,895 --> 00:18:44,855
there won't be enough room
to use explosion magic!

306
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:46,557
You will get more useless!

307
00:18:46,615 --> 00:18:48,815
Hey, stop! You're getting it on my face!

308
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,390
No other parties will take me anymore!

309
00:18:52,505 --> 00:18:54,545
I'll carry your stuff or
whatever else you need!

310
00:18:54,578 --> 00:18:56,458
I'm begging you! Don't abandon me.

311
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,420
How awful, that man is
going to abandon a little girl.

312
00:19:00,353 --> 00:19:03,449
And he has got a girl
covered in snot beside him.

313
00:19:03,613 --> 00:19:06,933
Toying with such a little girl,
then discarding her? What a scumbag.

314
00:19:06,991 --> 00:19:10,031
Look! The two girls are all slimy!

315
00:19:10,424 --> 00:19:13,509
What sort of plays
did that pervert perform on them?

316
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,270
It's not like that!

317
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:25,152
I'm fine with whatever
erotic plays you like!

318
00:19:25,222 --> 00:19:28,982
I can even endure
that slimy play we used those toads for!

319
00:19:29,032 --> 00:19:31,769
All right, I got it!
Glad to have you on board!

320
00:19:37,098 --> 00:19:39,498
I have confirmed
you have completed your quest.

321
00:19:39,604 --> 00:19:40,964
Thank you for your hard work.

322
00:19:41,742 --> 00:19:44,142
I went up 4 levels all at once.

323
00:19:44,495 --> 00:19:47,735
I really do get stronger
just by defeating some monsters.

324
00:19:48,015 --> 00:19:51,375
The newer the adventurer,
the faster you will grow.

325
00:19:51,743 --> 00:19:54,356
Now, adding up the sale of the giant toads

326
00:19:54,436 --> 00:19:56,756
and your quest completion reward,

327
00:19:56,838 --> 00:19:58,758
your total comes to 110,000 Eris.

328
00:19:59,317 --> 00:20:00,997
Please verify the amount.

329
00:20:05,695 --> 00:20:08,947
110,000. Split between three people,

330
00:20:09,054 --> 00:20:11,414
that comes to around 36,000 Eris each.

331
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:19,372
We nearly lost our lives
for a reward of 36,000 each.

332
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:21,078
It's not worth it.

333
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,120
I checked other quests just in case, but...

334
00:20:24,805 --> 00:20:28,085
Please search for the lost pet white wolf.

335
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,750
Please teach my son swordsmanship.

336
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,451
Requirement: Rune knights
or sword masters only.

337
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:37,341
Looking for a practice partner
for magical experiments.

338
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,320
Requirement: Strong physical strength.

339
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,000
Welcome people
who can resist powerful magic!

340
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,044
It's no use.

341
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,080
I really want to go back to Japan.

342
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,850
The ally we recruited is a lost cause.

343
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,560
Living in this world
is not going to be easy.

344
00:20:56,774 --> 00:20:59,854
I happened to see your recruitment notice.

345
00:21:01,415 --> 00:21:04,255
Are you still recruiting people?

346
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,160
We are!

347
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,280
Though, I wouldn't really recommend it...

348
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:18,239
A female knight, an extraordinary beauty?

349
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,200
<i>She is such a gorgeous grown-up woman.
I got so nervous</i>
