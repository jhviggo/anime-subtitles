1
00:00:12,501 --> 00:00:14,421
Create Water!

2
00:00:28,694 --> 00:00:31,814
Well, that's what I'd expect
from elementary magic.

3
00:00:32,023 --> 00:00:35,136
Now that I've learned a skill,
maybe I'm a bit more of an adventurer.

4
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:36,352
Kazuma!

5
00:00:36,775 --> 00:00:40,448
Look! I repaired my armor with
the reward I got for the cabbages.

6
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:42,208
It's so shiny now!

7
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:43,491
What do you think of it?

8
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:47,371
It looks like the sort of armor
an aristocrat's son would wear.

9
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,500
I'd like some genuine praises sometimes.

10
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,910
Kazuma, you never show any mercy, right?

11
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,970
I didn't have time
to pay attention to you right now.

12
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,170
You shall do something about
that pervert before she surpasses you.

13
00:01:02,251 --> 00:01:05,411
The luster of this stainless steel
brimming with magical power.

14
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:09,815
What is that?

15
00:01:09,915 --> 00:01:11,680
Hey you, what's the meaning of this?

16
00:01:11,789 --> 00:01:13,984
How many cabbages do you think I caught?

17
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:15,171
Well.

18
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:16,352
What?

19
00:01:16,445 --> 00:01:20,432
Most of what you caught
are actually lettuces.

20
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,160
Why are there lettuces mixed in?

21
00:01:24,005 --> 00:01:26,880
It is true that lettuce
has a low exchange rate.

22
00:01:27,031 --> 00:01:29,111
I went through a lot of troubles,
so I shall do something!

23
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,982
Ugh, here she comes. This isn't good.

24
00:01:34,215 --> 00:01:36,735
Mister Kazuma!

25
00:01:37,651 --> 00:01:40,731
How much was your reward
from our last quest?

26
00:01:41,571 --> 00:01:42,811
About a million.

27
00:01:45,211 --> 00:01:46,226
Yes.

28
00:01:46,451 --> 00:01:48,891
Thanks to the quest that was
sprung on us out of the blue,

29
00:01:49,131 --> 00:01:51,331
I suddenly obtained a small fortune.

30
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:16,886
(KONOSUBA:
God's Blessing on This Wonderful World!)

31
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:41,563
(Episode 4: Explosion Magic
for This Formidable Enemy!)

32
00:03:23,015 --> 00:03:24,255
A million.

33
00:03:24,988 --> 00:03:26,893
Many of the cabbages I harvested

34
00:03:27,051 --> 00:03:29,971
were apparently packed with lots of XP.

35
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:32,571
I guess good luck
makes all the difference.

36
00:03:34,971 --> 00:03:36,731
Kazuma,

37
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:40,211
I've thought of this for
quite a while, but you're...

38
00:03:40,491 --> 00:03:42,931
fairly cool, you know?

39
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:46,224
If there are no praiseworthy remarks
about me, don't force it.

40
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,952
Kazuma!

41
00:03:50,082 --> 00:03:53,440
I thought my reward for this quest
would be very hefty,

42
00:03:53,575 --> 00:03:55,915
so I used up all the money I had!

43
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,144
In fact, I expected to rake in
a sum of money,

44
00:03:58,262 --> 00:04:00,942
so I would have a bar tab of
nearly 100,000 Eris!

45
00:04:01,036 --> 00:04:02,379
Why do I care?

46
00:04:02,452 --> 00:04:05,524
You're the one who suggested that
we must keep our rewards to ourselves!

47
00:04:05,595 --> 00:04:08,724
That was because I thought
I'd be the only one raking it in!

48
00:04:08,811 --> 00:04:09,931
You're real scum.

49
00:04:10,011 --> 00:04:11,891
Please lend me money!

50
00:04:12,032 --> 00:04:13,600
I just need enough money
to pay for my tab!

51
00:04:13,731 --> 00:04:15,251
Shut up, you useless goddess!

52
00:04:15,331 --> 00:04:19,251
I'm using this money to escape
life in the stables once and for all!

53
00:04:19,402 --> 00:04:21,682
Well, you are a boy,

54
00:04:21,764 --> 00:04:24,320
and I know you rustle
beside me at night sometimes,

55
00:04:24,451 --> 00:04:27,008
so I'm sure you'd like
a private room very soon.

56
00:04:27,211 --> 00:04:29,061
Okay! Alright, I got it!

57
00:04:29,157 --> 00:04:31,075
I'll lend you the money, so shut up!

58
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:32,571
Konosuba.

59
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:35,121
Kazuma, allies surely are great, huh?

60
00:04:35,211 --> 00:04:37,159
We're the greatest party ever!

61
00:04:39,165 --> 00:04:40,565
Oh, thanks for your business.

62
00:04:40,795 --> 00:04:42,395
This girl.

63
00:04:50,985 --> 00:04:54,193
Kazuma looks like a real adventurer now.

64
00:04:54,265 --> 00:04:57,385
Wearing that tracksuit
has ruined that fantasy feel, right?

65
00:04:57,554 --> 00:04:58,754
Fantasy feel?

66
00:04:59,754 --> 00:05:03,114
It's elementary,
but I did acquire a magic skill.

67
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,120
I was thinking of going for
a sword-mage style, with no shield.

68
00:05:07,196 --> 00:05:09,396
Only your words seem mature, huh?

69
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,931
Let's take on a kill quest then.

70
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:15,091
One with a cluster of small fry monsters!

71
00:05:15,605 --> 00:05:18,285
I want to test out
new staff's magic power!

72
00:05:18,432 --> 00:05:23,382
No, one with super strong monsters
that were hit with a heavy blow!

73
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:25,952
No, let's take on a profitable quest!

74
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:28,864
I have paid for my tab, so I don't
have to worry about meal charges!

75
00:05:28,984 --> 00:05:30,592
They're not on the same page!

76
00:05:30,771 --> 00:05:33,891
Okay, now is the Giant Toads'
mating season,

77
00:05:34,015 --> 00:05:36,055
and I hear they're infesting
areas near the city.

78
00:05:36,131 --> 00:05:37,491
No frogs!

79
00:05:38,113 --> 00:05:39,183
Why?

80
00:05:39,328 --> 00:05:43,291
Oh, these two have been
traumatized by frogs.

81
00:05:43,418 --> 00:05:46,913
They got swallowed head-first
and covered in slime.

82
00:05:47,905 --> 00:05:49,331
Covered in slime?

83
00:05:49,411 --> 00:05:51,651
You're excited now, aren't you?

84
00:05:52,055 --> 00:05:53,088
I am not.

85
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,320
Konosuba.

86
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:57,609
Wait? What's going on?

87
00:05:57,696 --> 00:05:59,246
There are hardly any quests.

88
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,826
Kazuma, this is it!
Let's take on this one!

89
00:06:01,908 --> 00:06:04,531
A kill quest for a giant beast
named Black Fang!

90
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:05,862
No! No way!

91
00:06:06,548 --> 00:06:07,788
What's this all about?

92
00:06:07,891 --> 00:06:10,563
There are only
highly difficult quests left!

93
00:06:11,185 --> 00:06:12,665
I am very sorry.

94
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:18,440
The truth is, one of the Devil King's
top leaders moved into town recently.

95
00:06:19,328 --> 00:06:23,224
All the weak monsters in the area
have gone into hiding because of that,

96
00:06:23,518 --> 00:06:25,838
so there's been a decline in quests.

97
00:06:26,112 --> 00:06:27,531
What?

98
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:30,131
Honestly!

99
00:06:30,211 --> 00:06:32,084
I don't care if he's a top leader or not.

100
00:06:32,224 --> 00:06:34,469
If he's the undead, just watch me!

101
00:06:34,562 --> 00:06:35,642
In other words,

102
00:06:35,744 --> 00:06:39,971
before capable adventurers
and knights are sent here,

103
00:06:40,122 --> 00:06:42,642
we won't be able to find any decent work?

104
00:06:43,331 --> 00:06:46,251
Look, this is incredible!
It's such fine work!

105
00:06:46,331 --> 00:06:48,291
I wonder if the sale price will go up.

106
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:52,251
A thrilling adventure
in a parallel world, huh?

107
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,800
Can't you conduct your
magic training on your own?

108
00:07:02,112 --> 00:07:05,602
If I did that, who would carry me home?

109
00:07:05,784 --> 00:07:08,024
After one shot, I can't move anymore.

110
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:09,752
Is she...

111
00:07:10,655 --> 00:07:14,735
going to make me tag along
for this every day?

112
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,489
Hey, right here. It's fine, isn't it?

113
00:07:17,611 --> 00:07:19,491
Just use your magic on whatever
and let's go back.

114
00:07:19,594 --> 00:07:20,844
I can't do that!

115
00:07:20,931 --> 00:07:25,091
If I don't do it far away from town,
I'll be scolded by the guards again.

116
00:07:25,207 --> 00:07:27,367
You just said again, didn't you?

117
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,240
Did they get mad because of the noise?

118
00:07:33,691 --> 00:07:35,411
Guess we have no choice, huh?

119
00:07:36,576 --> 00:07:37,691
Konosuba.

120
00:07:38,451 --> 00:07:41,331
Is that an abandoned castle?

121
00:07:41,531 --> 00:07:43,131
It's so eerie.

122
00:07:43,371 --> 00:07:44,611
I'll use that!

123
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:48,298
I'm sure nobody will complain
if I destroy it!

124
00:07:48,691 --> 00:07:49,851
Yeah...

125
00:07:50,395 --> 00:07:52,995
Crimson-black blaze,
king of myriad worlds,

126
00:07:53,091 --> 00:07:55,171
though I promote the laws of nature,

127
00:07:55,355 --> 00:07:57,155
I am the alias of destruction incarnate

128
00:07:58,131 --> 00:08:00,371
in accordance with the
principles of all creation.

129
00:08:00,691 --> 00:08:03,651
Let the hammer of eternity
descend upon me!

130
00:08:04,371 --> 00:08:07,131
Explosion!

131
00:08:18,215 --> 00:08:20,855
Burnt to ashes within the crimson.

132
00:08:23,811 --> 00:08:25,931
This is the best.

133
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,223
And that's how

134
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,240
my new daily routine with Megumin began.

135
00:08:33,397 --> 00:08:36,872
Cheap, super cheap! Fresh cabbages!

136
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:40,198
Aqua worked hard for her part-time job
every day after she became broke.

137
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:45,769
Darkness said she was going to do
weight training at home.

138
00:08:46,194 --> 00:08:48,243
Megumin, who had nothing to do,

139
00:08:48,335 --> 00:08:52,695
went to that castle every day
to unleash explosion magic on it.

140
00:08:55,091 --> 00:08:57,891
On cold, rainy evenings.

141
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,440
On calm, early afternoons,
right after lunch.

142
00:09:06,611 --> 00:09:10,593
During brisk, early morning walks.

143
00:09:15,162 --> 00:09:17,366
I'd give that one 60 points, I think.

144
00:09:17,826 --> 00:09:19,266
It was lacking in volume.

145
00:09:21,133 --> 00:09:22,653
No matter what the occasion is,

146
00:09:23,387 --> 00:09:26,667
Megumin unleashed magic on
that abandoned castle every day.

147
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:32,251
I kept close observation of her magic,

148
00:09:33,371 --> 00:09:35,851
and eventually came to
understand the quality

149
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:39,491
of each day's explosion magic.

150
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:49,611
Explosion!

151
00:09:58,091 --> 00:09:59,891
It feels really good today.

152
00:10:00,011 --> 00:10:04,091
The shock waves reverberate
through my flesh and bones,

153
00:10:04,257 --> 00:10:08,577
and yet the vibrations of the air
seem to strike my skin.

154
00:10:09,891 --> 00:10:11,291
Nice explosion!

155
00:10:11,691 --> 00:10:13,451
Nice explosion!

156
00:10:13,795 --> 00:10:16,915
You've also come to understand
the path of explosions, Kazuma.

157
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,272
How about it?

158
00:10:18,377 --> 00:10:21,715
Why not learn some
explosion magic for real?

159
00:10:23,171 --> 00:10:27,051
It could be fun to acquire it
in the future when I can afford it.

160
00:10:27,552 --> 00:10:29,329
You have a great attitude.

161
00:10:36,131 --> 00:10:37,651
The future, huh?

162
00:10:38,251 --> 00:10:39,611
I'm back!

163
00:10:40,148 --> 00:10:41,228
Look at this!

164
00:10:41,325 --> 00:10:43,965
We had some cooking leftover,
so they said I could bring it home.

165
00:10:44,093 --> 00:10:45,453
It's a huge score!

166
00:10:46,091 --> 00:10:48,896
Hey Aqua, I don't want to say this, but...

167
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,080
What?

168
00:10:50,176 --> 00:10:54,080
Frankly, I think that there's no way
for us to defeat the Devil King.

169
00:10:55,712 --> 00:10:56,736
Listen.

170
00:10:56,896 --> 00:11:01,000
I never have any amazing powers
like other protagonists do.

171
00:11:01,451 --> 00:11:04,769
Shouldn't some group endowed
with powerful abilities, equipment,

172
00:11:04,851 --> 00:11:08,411
and so forth be sent to fight
the Devil King's army instead?

173
00:11:08,771 --> 00:11:11,931
Stop saying that! I'll never
be able to go home that way!

174
00:11:12,036 --> 00:11:16,097
Save that line after you've done
something a goddess would do,

175
00:11:16,185 --> 00:11:19,104
like guiding the hero or buying time
by sealing the Devil King

176
00:11:19,243 --> 00:11:21,203
until the hero can stand on his own.

177
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,810
You're only useful for party tricks!

178
00:11:28,305 --> 00:11:32,745
So come up with some profitable
business that's simple to do.

179
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:37,696
And also hurry up and
teach me recovery magic.

180
00:11:37,835 --> 00:11:39,235
No!

181
00:11:39,455 --> 00:11:41,811
Anything but my recovery magic!

182
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:44,564
Don't take away my reason for being!

183
00:11:44,651 --> 00:11:47,291
You've got me for that!
Isn't that enough?

184
00:11:49,344 --> 00:11:52,347
Your verbal lashings are pretty nasty.

185
00:11:52,736 --> 00:11:56,334
Most women will cry
if you're too straightforward.

186
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,080
If you're feeling stressed out,

187
00:11:59,492 --> 00:12:03,532
I wouldn't mind if you
verbally abuse me instead.

188
00:12:05,511 --> 00:12:06,911
You're so cruel!

189
00:12:07,012 --> 00:12:08,732
Why you little...

190
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,760
Emergency! Emergency!

191
00:12:11,011 --> 00:12:14,331
All adventurers,
please arm yourselves at once,

192
00:12:14,514 --> 00:12:17,554
and gather at the city gates
to be prepared for battle!

193
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:23,785
Hey now, that's no laughing matter!

194
00:12:30,331 --> 00:12:31,812
What is that?

195
00:12:31,891 --> 00:12:33,082
Hey, what's going on?

196
00:12:33,171 --> 00:12:34,811
He looks quite strong!

197
00:12:35,751 --> 00:12:39,551
I'm the leader of the Devil King's army.

198
00:12:39,731 --> 00:12:42,291
I've recently moved into a nearby castle.

199
00:12:42,491 --> 00:12:44,011
That's Dullahan?

200
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:49,248
Day after day, after day, after day!

201
00:12:49,373 --> 00:12:53,812
Who's that psychotic person
who keeps firing explosion magic

202
00:12:53,891 --> 00:12:57,851
on my castle every single day?

203
00:13:01,411 --> 00:13:03,331
One of the Devil King's leaders

204
00:13:03,488 --> 00:13:06,304
was utterly enraged with us.

205
00:13:09,811 --> 00:13:12,651
Day after day, after day, after day!

206
00:13:12,838 --> 00:13:15,008
Who's the psychotic person who keeps

207
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:18,499
firing explosion magic on my castle?

208
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:23,651
Explosion magic?

209
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:26,369
Who's the one among us
that can use explosion magic?

210
00:13:26,491 --> 00:13:28,691
Speaking of explosion magic...

211
00:13:33,571 --> 00:13:35,691
Oh? Me?

212
00:13:35,841 --> 00:13:37,344
Why are you looking at me?

213
00:13:37,531 --> 00:13:39,651
I can't use explosion magic!

214
00:13:39,776 --> 00:13:42,199
I'm still a novice.

215
00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:44,469
I really didn't do it! Please believe me!

216
00:13:44,576 --> 00:13:46,131
I don't want to die yet!

217
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,483
I have little brothers to take care of!

218
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,224
Megumin?

219
00:14:05,691 --> 00:14:07,131
So it was you?

220
00:14:10,131 --> 00:14:13,732
You're that culprit
who's been firing explosion magic

221
00:14:13,856 --> 00:14:15,229
on my castle every day?

222
00:14:15,451 --> 00:14:18,962
If you want to pick a fight with
the leader of the Devil King's army,

223
00:14:19,072 --> 00:14:20,949
you can attack my castle fair and square!

224
00:14:21,091 --> 00:14:23,931
If you don't have nerves, then
stay in the city and tremble in fear!

225
00:14:24,047 --> 00:14:27,167
Tell me why there is
underhanded harassment.

226
00:14:27,251 --> 00:14:30,491
Just because we left this city alone
since there's nothing much here.

227
00:14:30,563 --> 00:14:34,368
Don't get too cocky and make my castle
go boom, boom, boom every single day!

228
00:14:34,531 --> 00:14:37,571
Are you crazy, you wench?

229
00:14:39,643 --> 00:14:41,363
My name is Megumin!

230
00:14:41,627 --> 00:14:45,427
An arch wizard who commands
explosion magic!

231
00:14:47,091 --> 00:14:48,811
What sort of a name is "Megumin"?

232
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:51,479
-Are you making a fool of me?
-No, no!

233
00:14:51,811 --> 00:14:56,011
I am a crimson demon,
the greatest wizard in this city.

234
00:14:56,491 --> 00:14:59,331
Firing explosion magic continuously
at you was a strategy to lure you,

235
00:14:59,406 --> 00:15:02,886
a leader in the Devil King's
army, out here.

236
00:15:03,531 --> 00:15:06,411
You fell for it,
and came to this city alone.

237
00:15:06,528 --> 00:15:07,675
It seems you're out of luck.

238
00:15:09,597 --> 00:15:11,917
When did this turn into a strategy?

239
00:15:12,373 --> 00:15:13,413
Not to mention,

240
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:16,346
she just proclaimed herself
the greatest wizard in this city.

241
00:15:16,608 --> 00:15:19,291
Hush! Do her a favor and keep quiet!

242
00:15:19,553 --> 00:15:21,888
She hasn't used any
explosion magic today,

243
00:15:22,034 --> 00:15:24,114
and she has lots of
adventurers behind her,

244
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:25,422
so she's acting tough.

245
00:15:25,632 --> 00:15:28,811
The best part is yet to come.
Stand here and keep watching!

246
00:15:31,023 --> 00:15:32,103
Very well.

247
00:15:32,211 --> 00:15:35,531
I did not come to this land
to meddle with you small fry.

248
00:15:36,365 --> 00:15:39,645
I'll likely be staying in that castle
for a while longer,

249
00:15:40,008 --> 00:15:43,008
so stop firing your
explosion magic on it again.

250
00:15:43,348 --> 00:15:44,348
Got it?

251
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,504
No way.

252
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,201
We crimson demons must unleash
it once a day, or we'll die.

253
00:15:49,344 --> 00:15:52,291
Hey, I've never heard anything
like that before!

254
00:15:52,731 --> 00:15:54,304
Don't make up lies!

255
00:15:54,973 --> 00:15:58,493
No matter what, you don't intend
to stop using explosion magic?

256
00:15:58,976 --> 00:16:00,064
Yes.

257
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,600
I may have given myself up to evil,
but I was once a knight.

258
00:16:05,251 --> 00:16:08,531
I'm not interested in mowing down
weaklings. However...

259
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,140
You can't act so composed for long.

260
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,840
If you would!

261
00:16:18,091 --> 00:16:19,200
Guess I have no choice.

262
00:16:19,328 --> 00:16:20,352
What?

263
00:16:20,448 --> 00:16:22,520
I don't care if you're one of
the Devil King's leaders!

264
00:16:22,645 --> 00:16:25,605
Coming here while I'm around
was bad luck!

265
00:16:25,705 --> 00:16:28,945
I can't accept any decent quests
because of you!

266
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,240
Now, are you ready?

267
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,840
What do we have here?

268
00:16:34,281 --> 00:16:35,841
An arch priest?

269
00:16:36,313 --> 00:16:39,273
I am one of the top leaders
in the Devil King's army.

270
00:16:39,611 --> 00:16:44,731
I won't be easily purified by some
low-level priests from this city.

271
00:16:45,124 --> 00:16:46,404
I know.

272
00:16:46,531 --> 00:16:50,171
Why don't I let that
crimson demon girl suffer a bit?

273
00:16:54,531 --> 00:16:56,743
I'll purify you with my prayer!

274
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:58,578
You're too late!

275
00:16:59,944 --> 00:17:02,624
I sentence you to death.

276
00:17:02,763 --> 00:17:06,043
You will die in one week.

277
00:17:10,091 --> 00:17:11,371
Darkness!

278
00:17:14,848 --> 00:17:17,376
Oh no, he got us! A death sentence?

279
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:20,771
-Darkness! Darkness!
-Are you all right?

280
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,640
It doesn't appear to be serious.

281
00:17:25,283 --> 00:17:29,083
This method may actually be
more effective against

282
00:17:29,504 --> 00:17:32,138
tightly-knit adventurers like you.

283
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,275
Listen up, crimson demon girl.

284
00:17:34,451 --> 00:17:37,211
That crusader will die in one week.

285
00:17:38,816 --> 00:17:44,091
Your precious ally will suffer
as she trembles in terror of death.

286
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:46,825
Yes, because of you!

287
00:17:48,223 --> 00:17:54,263
Watch as your ally suffers for the
next week and repent for your actions.

288
00:17:56,096 --> 00:17:59,143
You should have just done as I said.

289
00:18:03,033 --> 00:18:04,433
How terrible.

290
00:18:04,515 --> 00:18:07,648
You're basically saying you
cast a death curse on me,

291
00:18:07,811 --> 00:18:11,256
and we must obey your orders
if we want it removed?

292
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,800
Is that what you're after?

293
00:18:14,363 --> 00:18:15,392
What?

294
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,854
I don't even want to understand
what Darkness is talking about.

295
00:18:19,313 --> 00:18:22,913
I won't give in to a curse!

296
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,760
I won't give in, but...

297
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,744
-What should I do, Kazuma?
-Yes, I'm Kazuma.

298
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,580
Look at Dullahan's obscene eyes
hidden beneath his helmet!

299
00:18:31,813 --> 00:18:34,593
Those are the eyes of a demon who
plans to take me back to his castle,

300
00:18:34,684 --> 00:18:37,644
lets me shut up and submit to him
if I want the curse removed,

301
00:18:37,731 --> 00:18:42,491
and demands that I perform hardcore acts
of perversion for him!

302
00:18:44,671 --> 00:18:46,951
You may do as you please with my body,

303
00:18:47,331 --> 00:18:49,771
but not with my heart!

304
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,400
An imprisoned knight having demands
made by the Devil King's minion.

305
00:18:55,619 --> 00:18:58,379
Oh, what should I do?
What should I do, Kazuma?

306
00:18:58,496 --> 00:19:01,125
This is an unexpectedly
difficult situation!

307
00:19:01,521 --> 00:19:02,681
I don't want to go.

308
00:19:02,855 --> 00:19:04,975
I don't want to go, but I have no choice!

309
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:08,571
I'll resist as long as I can,
so don't stand in my way!

310
00:19:08,811 --> 00:19:10,731
Okay, I'll be back!

311
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:12,618
Crazy.

312
00:19:13,283 --> 00:19:16,448
Stop, don't go!
You're bothering that Dullahan guy!

313
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:17,651
Let go of me!

314
00:19:17,933 --> 00:19:19,023
Don't stop me!

315
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,811
-Pitiful...
-Cut it out!

316
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:22,524
Konosuba.

317
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:27,360
Well, anyway! Stop firing
explosion magic on my castle!

318
00:19:27,563 --> 00:19:29,203
And you, crimson demon girl!

319
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,600
If you wish to lift the curse,
come to my castle.

320
00:19:34,043 --> 00:19:38,203
If you're able to make it,
then I'll lift the curse.

321
00:19:38,913 --> 00:19:43,553
However, are you able to
make it that far?

322
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,080
Hey, where do you think you're going?

323
00:20:06,386 --> 00:20:07,986
I'm going to the castle,

324
00:20:08,091 --> 00:20:11,091
nail Dullahan with a direct hit
of my explosion magic,

325
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,400
and lift the curse on Darkness.

326
00:20:19,531 --> 00:20:21,731
You know I'm going with you.

327
00:20:22,091 --> 00:20:24,771
If you go alone, you'll use
your magic on some small fry,

328
00:20:24,876 --> 00:20:26,516
and then it'll be over.

329
00:20:26,795 --> 00:20:29,595
Besides, I'm that fool
who went with you everyday

330
00:20:29,691 --> 00:20:32,491
and didn't realize it belonged
to one of their leaders.

331
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,760
Shall we go together then?

332
00:20:37,134 --> 00:20:40,654
From what I heard, there's
a bunch of undead in the castle.

333
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,320
That means weapons won't work very well.

334
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:47,370
My magic should be more effective, so...

335
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,891
Please rely on me at times like these!

336
00:20:53,912 --> 00:20:54,912
Don't...

337
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:59,075
Give it up, you two.
Don't do all this for me.

338
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,480
Hey, Darkness!

339
00:21:00,796 --> 00:21:03,154
We'll definitely do something
about your curse!

340
00:21:03,265 --> 00:21:04,411
Don't worry.

341
00:21:04,512 --> 00:21:09,184
Sacred Break Spell!

342
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,330
Huh?

343
00:21:28,614 --> 00:21:32,574
To me, lifting Dullahan's curse
is child's play!

344
00:21:32,713 --> 00:21:36,136
Well, I can be a priest
once in a while, don't you think?

345
00:21:44,531 --> 00:21:47,051
Oh, it is nothing.
Actually, maybe it isn't!

346
00:21:47,259 --> 00:21:49,099
Megumin and I are so excited.

347
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,440
Give us back our motivation.

348
00:21:52,363 --> 00:21:53,376
