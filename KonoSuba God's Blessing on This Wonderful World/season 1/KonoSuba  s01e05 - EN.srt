1
00:00:11,063 --> 00:00:12,783
This money is meaningless.

2
00:00:14,042 --> 00:00:15,940
Feeling satisfied with just a few coins,

3
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:17,817
and taking care of a useless goddess.

4
00:00:18,165 --> 00:00:21,885
The is not the different
world life I wished for!

5
00:00:22,653 --> 00:00:26,173
Fighting ferocious dragons
with a cursed or holy sword,

6
00:00:26,358 --> 00:00:29,198
being lauded as a chosen hero,

7
00:00:29,933 --> 00:00:33,093
and love blossoming with a party member,

8
00:00:33,493 --> 00:00:35,733
isn't that how it's supposed to be?

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,840
Red rover!

10
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,943
I have had all I can
take of living in debt!

11
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:46,345
A quest!

12
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,990
Thanks to Dullahan, there are only
tough ones left, but let's accept one!

13
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,710
I want money!

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,080
I don't mind.

15
00:00:55,463 --> 00:00:57,536
Please!

16
00:00:57,713 --> 00:00:59,776
I'm sick of working part-time
in the shopping district!

17
00:00:59,923 --> 00:01:02,112
The manager yells at me if
any croquettes aren't sold!

18
00:01:02,243 --> 00:01:06,363
I will work hard! I'll give it
everything I've got this time!

19
00:01:06,493 --> 00:01:09,493
This is a pitiful
self-proclaimed goddess.

20
00:01:10,293 --> 00:01:12,653
I'm sure I'll also run out of
money eventually,

21
00:01:12,779 --> 00:01:15,219
so go find a decent-looking quest for us.

22
00:01:15,349 --> 00:01:16,549
Got it!

23
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,567
Will Aqua be all right?

24
00:01:21,965 --> 00:01:24,245
I feel that she will
take on some insane quest.

25
00:01:24,457 --> 00:01:26,937
I would be fine with
an unreasonable quest!

26
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:31,680
All right.

27
00:01:31,957 --> 00:01:33,197
That's not all right!

28
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,080
What are you trying to accept?

29
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,000
There is a place where a manticore and
a griffin are fighting over territory.

30
00:01:41,072 --> 00:01:43,232
Please kill both of them.

31
00:01:43,346 --> 00:01:45,306
The reward is 500,000 Eris.

32
00:01:45,473 --> 00:01:46,807
Are you crazy?

33
00:01:47,056 --> 00:01:48,657
I am right to come check on her.

34
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,472
I nearly let her accept
a ridiculously high-level quest!

35
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,287
Hey, check this one out!

36
00:01:55,513 --> 00:01:57,992
The quality of the lake water
in the town has declined,

37
00:01:58,072 --> 00:02:00,472
and brutal alligators
have started to live in it,

38
00:02:00,561 --> 00:02:02,271
so I would like to
have the water purified.

39
00:02:02,572 --> 00:02:04,032
The monsters will
move to a different habitat

40
00:02:04,176 --> 00:02:06,256
if the lake is purified,

41
00:02:06,368 --> 00:02:08,120
so there is no need to kill them.

42
00:02:08,457 --> 00:02:10,509
The reward is 300,000 Eris.

43
00:02:11,056 --> 00:02:13,296
This quest is perfect for me!

44
00:02:27,817 --> 00:02:38,497
(KONOSUBA:
God's Blessing on This Wonderful World!)

45
00:03:00,045 --> 00:03:03,125
(Episode 5: A Price for This Magic Sword!)

46
00:03:49,325 --> 00:03:50,336
How about it?

47
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:52,943
Are you actually capable
of purifying the water?

48
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:56,305
You fool, who do you think I am?

49
00:03:56,513 --> 00:04:01,393
Surely you can learn about my role
from my name and appearance.

50
00:04:01,772 --> 00:04:03,072
Goddess of party tricks, right?

51
00:04:03,212 --> 00:04:04,832
No, you shut-in NEET!

52
00:04:04,928 --> 00:04:05,952
Water!

53
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,305
Don't you see the beautiful
water-colored eyes and hair?

54
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:11,257
Go ahead and accept it then.

55
00:04:11,422 --> 00:04:14,622
If you accept it alone, you can
keep the whole reward for yourself.

56
00:04:17,312 --> 00:04:21,192
Well, monsters are likely to
attack while I'm purifying the water.

57
00:04:21,621 --> 00:04:24,061
So, I would like you to protect me.

58
00:04:24,728 --> 00:04:26,088
So it is.

59
00:04:26,962 --> 00:04:29,900
How long will it take? About 5 minutes?

60
00:04:32,142 --> 00:04:33,142
About half a day?

61
00:04:33,216 --> 00:04:34,422
That's too long!

62
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,646
Please, I'm begging you!

63
00:04:36,736 --> 00:04:38,400
Help me out, Mr. Kazuma!

64
00:04:38,501 --> 00:04:40,541
How will you purify it anyway?

65
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:44,861
Well, for a goddess of my class,

66
00:04:44,996 --> 00:04:48,476
I can purify the water
by simply touching it.

67
00:04:48,734 --> 00:04:49,734
I see.

68
00:04:51,104 --> 00:04:52,128
Hey, Aqua.

69
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,400
I think I know a way
for you to purify the lake safely.

70
00:04:57,322 --> 00:04:58,522
Konosuba.

71
00:05:05,712 --> 00:05:07,552
Hey, are we really doing this?

72
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:12,541
My strategy is so reliable.
Why are you unsatisfied with it?

73
00:05:13,261 --> 00:05:19,261
I look like a rare and captured
monster that is on its way to be sold.

74
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:24,992
EXPLORATION QUEST:
PURIFY THE RIVERHEAD LAKE

75
00:05:32,549 --> 00:05:34,880
By no means do we come here

76
00:05:34,976 --> 00:05:36,933
to abandon this worthless goddess
in the lake.

77
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,600
She will be able to touch and purify
the water from inside the safe cage.

78
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,566
Aqua! Tell us if anything happens!

79
00:05:44,652 --> 00:05:46,692
We will reel you and cage in!

80
00:05:47,074 --> 00:05:52,114
I look like a teabag of black tea
being made into soup stock.

81
00:05:53,122 --> 00:05:56,692
AFTER TWO HOURS

82
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:02,519
312 iron bars, 313 iron bars.

83
00:06:02,591 --> 00:06:04,311
No monsters are showing up.

84
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:06,319
It seems that way.

85
00:06:06,888 --> 00:06:09,608
You are being awfully reserved today.

86
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,056
Normally, you would say
something silly

87
00:06:13,186 --> 00:06:15,386
and try to blow the
monsters and lake away.

88
00:06:16,288 --> 00:06:17,318
That's true.

89
00:06:17,408 --> 00:06:20,109
What sort of impression
do you both have of me?

90
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:23,622
My ultimate explosion
magic isn't to be used

91
00:06:23,712 --> 00:06:26,027
on the likes of mere alligators.

92
00:06:26,401 --> 00:06:28,881
You always fire it off all
over the place for no reason.

93
00:06:30,094 --> 00:06:35,134
Hey, Aqua! How is
purifying the lake going?

94
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,640
It's going well!

95
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,480
You will catch a cold
if you're in the water for too long!

96
00:06:40,574 --> 00:06:42,654
If you need to go to the bathroom,
let us know!

97
00:06:43,347 --> 00:06:46,067
Arch priests don't go to the bathroom!

98
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,309
It sounds like she is doing fine.

99
00:06:48,581 --> 00:06:51,581
By the way, crimson demons
don't go to the bathroom either.

100
00:06:51,836 --> 00:06:53,796
You used to be idols or something?

101
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,648
Me too.

102
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,560
I'm a crusader, so I don't...

103
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:04,799
Darkness, don't try so hard to deny it.

104
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:08,119
Megumin and Aqua insist
they don't go to the bathroom,

105
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,200
so next time we'll accept a
quest that will take longer

106
00:07:10,302 --> 00:07:13,007
than a day and we'll see
whether they go to the bathroom or not.

107
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,640
Please don't do that!

108
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,085
Crimson demons really
don't go to the bathroom, okay?

109
00:07:17,326 --> 00:07:19,486
But I will apologize,
so please don't do that.

110
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,906
He proved to be the man I appreciate.

111
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:25,613
The alligators aren't still coming.

112
00:07:25,968 --> 00:07:28,850
It would be great
if things end up peacefully.

113
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:31,680
Hey, that line has been
bound to trigger a flag!

114
00:07:31,778 --> 00:07:33,578
Kazuma!

115
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:37,196
Something is coming! Hey,
a lot of them are coming!

116
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,240
Kazuma!

117
00:07:45,802 --> 00:07:48,122
AFTER FOUR HOURS

118
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,520
Since the alligators show up,

119
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:53,709
Aqua is not only using her
godly purification ability,

120
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:56,773
but also purification magic
as if her life depends on it.

121
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,740
Purification!

122
00:07:58,816 --> 00:08:00,544
Purification!

123
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,696
Purifica...

124
00:08:04,312 --> 00:08:06,152
Purification!

125
00:08:06,304 --> 00:08:07,936
Purification!

126
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,488
Purification!

127
00:08:10,752 --> 00:08:13,592
The cage! The cage
is making a strange sound!

128
00:08:13,662 --> 00:08:16,622
Aqua, let us know if you want to give up!

129
00:08:16,842 --> 00:08:19,842
We will pull the cage in
by the chain and run away!

130
00:08:19,924 --> 00:08:23,544
No way! I won't get my
reward if I give up now!

131
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:27,606
It just went crack!

132
00:08:27,734 --> 00:08:30,774
The cage just made a sound
no cage should ever make!

133
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,864
Purification!

134
00:08:32,973 --> 00:08:37,013
It looks kind of fun inside that cage.

135
00:08:37,293 --> 00:08:38,304
You shall not go.

136
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:40,489
Purification!

137
00:08:40,565 --> 00:08:42,925
Purification!

138
00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:44,479
Purification!

139
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,272
AFTER SEVEN HOURS

140
00:08:54,948 --> 00:08:56,998
It seems that
the purification is complete.

141
00:08:57,384 --> 00:08:59,784
All of the alligators
appear to have left too.

142
00:09:00,222 --> 00:09:01,502
Aqua, are you okay?

143
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:03,872
Aqua?

144
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,600
Hey, Aqua.

145
00:09:05,948 --> 00:09:07,148
Miss Aqua.

146
00:09:08,888 --> 00:09:10,448
Hey, I'm talking to you!

147
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,620
What's wrong?

148
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,600
If that is enough to make you
cry, you should have given up.

149
00:09:19,281 --> 00:09:21,041
Okay, let's go back.

150
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:22,976
Hey, Aqua.

151
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,360
As we talked it over, we don't
need any reward for this.

152
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:28,738
That's right, Aqua.

153
00:09:28,864 --> 00:09:31,223
All 300,000 Eris is yours.

154
00:09:31,328 --> 00:09:32,384
Yes, that's right.

155
00:09:32,512 --> 00:09:35,073
Aqua did all the
work this time after all!

156
00:09:37,393 --> 00:09:39,033
Come on, get out of the cage.

157
00:09:39,357 --> 00:09:41,002
The alligators are gone.

158
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,042
Just take me back like this.

159
00:09:43,613 --> 00:09:44,640
What did you say?

160
00:09:45,601 --> 00:09:48,201
The world outside this cage is scary.

161
00:09:48,705 --> 00:09:50,945
Take me back to the village like this.

162
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,600
It looks like this quest
traumatized Aqua again.

163
00:09:59,263 --> 00:10:00,896
TODAY'S RESULTS PURIFY THE RIVERHEAD LAKE

164
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:02,461
LAKE PURIFICATION SUCCESSFUL

165
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,781
QUEST COMPLETE

166
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,480
Is that the Legendary Ancient Dragon?

167
00:10:19,764 --> 00:10:21,364
Can we beat that thing?

168
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,574
Maybe we should run away.

169
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,470
My name is Mitsurugi Kyouya.

170
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:30,383
I was the sort of ordinary high
schooler you could find anywhere,

171
00:10:30,495 --> 00:10:32,535
but in the abyss of death,
I met a lovely goddess,

172
00:10:32,721 --> 00:10:36,041
and was reincarnated into
this world as a chosen hero.

173
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,320
If we let this dragon run rampant,

174
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:41,951
many people could be
injured or lose their lives.

175
00:10:42,627 --> 00:10:46,627
We are the only ones who can defeat it!

176
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,163
Kyouya!

177
00:10:48,929 --> 00:10:50,609
The sacred treasure is said to be created

178
00:10:50,703 --> 00:10:52,703
by the gods, and only Kyouya can wield it.

179
00:10:52,846 --> 00:10:54,174
The Cursed Sword, Gram!

180
00:11:06,622 --> 00:11:08,574
That's my Kyouya!

181
00:11:08,704 --> 00:11:11,296
Only he can defeat the
Ancient Dragon in a single blow!

182
00:11:11,424 --> 00:11:13,883
When did he become yours?

183
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,901
Hey, stop that.

184
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,040
Kyouya is mine!

185
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,554
What are you talking about?
Kyouya is mine, okay?

186
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,840
I will save this world without fail.

187
00:11:24,702 --> 00:11:26,312
I made a promise to her.

188
00:11:28,384 --> 00:11:29,440
Now,

189
00:11:29,568 --> 00:11:31,859
depart on your journey with
the Cursed Sword, Gram,

190
00:11:32,196 --> 00:11:33,516
the chosen hero.

191
00:11:35,092 --> 00:11:36,096
Lady Goddess.

192
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,240
I will slay the Devil King
and save the world for you.

193
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:43,210
Okay, I expect great things of you.

194
00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:51,686
<i>A used up goddess is
being transported along...</i>

195
00:11:52,229 --> 00:11:53,509
I have heard this voice before!

196
00:11:54,502 --> 00:11:56,462
Kyouya, where are you going?

197
00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:10,290
<i>I'm sure they are taking
me away to be sold...</i>

198
00:12:11,532 --> 00:12:13,852
Lady Goddess!

199
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,772
<i>I'm sure they are taking
me away to be sold...</i>

200
00:12:19,856 --> 00:12:22,356
Hey, Aqua, we are in the village now,

201
00:12:22,464 --> 00:12:23,936
so stop singing that song.

202
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,760
Just transporting a woman on
her knees in a beat-up cage

203
00:12:28,012 --> 00:12:30,332
is already drawing everyone's attention.

204
00:12:30,821 --> 00:12:32,421
In fact, you should get out of there!

205
00:12:33,263 --> 00:12:34,272
No.

206
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:36,901
This cage is my sanctuary.

207
00:12:37,354 --> 00:12:38,954
The outside world is too scary,

208
00:12:39,072 --> 00:12:40,279
so I won't come out for a while.

209
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,480
She is completely
hold herself up in there.

210
00:12:43,976 --> 00:12:45,136
Yes.

211
00:12:45,661 --> 00:12:47,340
She is just like I used to be.

212
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:49,097
Oh, nothing.

213
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:50,592
Lady Goddess!

214
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:51,969
You are Lady Goddess, aren't you?

215
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:56,870
Seriously?

216
00:12:57,413 --> 00:13:00,493
What are you doing
in such a place, Lady Goddess?

217
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,360
Don't touch my ally so freely.

218
00:13:04,723 --> 00:13:06,683
Who are you?

219
00:13:07,778 --> 00:13:09,440
You know him, don't you?

220
00:13:09,533 --> 00:13:12,213
He was calling you a goddess.
Just do something!

221
00:13:12,887 --> 00:13:13,912
Goddess?

222
00:13:14,016 --> 00:13:15,032
Yes!

223
00:13:20,075 --> 00:13:22,144
That's right! I am a goddess!

224
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:26,261
She didn't seriously forget
she is a goddess, did she?

225
00:13:33,797 --> 00:13:36,769
What is it you want to see me about?

226
00:13:38,244 --> 00:13:39,296
Who are you?

227
00:13:39,594 --> 00:13:42,334
It's me, Mitsurugi Kyouya!

228
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,896
The Mitsurugi Kyouya who
received this Cursed Sword,

229
00:13:45,056 --> 00:13:47,736
Gram, from you and was
reincarnated into this world!

230
00:13:53,402 --> 00:13:55,162
Oh, of course! That guy!

231
00:13:55,343 --> 00:13:57,743
Sorry, I totally forgot it!

232
00:13:57,825 --> 00:13:59,345
I've sent along a lot of people,

233
00:13:59,424 --> 00:14:01,590
so it's inevitable that
I would forget someone!

234
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:07,659
It has been a while, Master Aqua.

235
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:11,365
I have been working hard
every day as your chosen hero.

236
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:16,981
By the way, Master Aqua, why
have you been locked up in a cage?

237
00:14:17,602 --> 00:14:20,362
Because she didn't want
to come out of the cage.

238
00:14:20,971 --> 00:14:22,990
Konosuba.

239
00:14:24,817 --> 00:14:27,337
You dragged the goddess to this world?

240
00:14:27,507 --> 00:14:30,080
Then you locked her in a cage
and dunked her into a lake?

241
00:14:30,205 --> 00:14:32,381
What the heck were you thinking?

242
00:14:32,582 --> 00:14:33,662
Wait!

243
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,560
I have lots of fun every day,

244
00:14:36,672 --> 00:14:39,577
and I'm not upset about
being dragged here anymore.

245
00:14:39,656 --> 00:14:43,416
Master Aqua, I don't know
how this man won you over,

246
00:14:43,888 --> 00:14:46,855
but you are a goddess!
And yet, this little...

247
00:14:47,061 --> 00:14:49,194
This jerk just says whatever he wants.

248
00:14:49,466 --> 00:14:51,906
He doesn't even know Aqua all that well!

249
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:55,117
What? Fighting over a woman?

250
00:14:55,218 --> 00:14:58,698
By the way, where are you
staying right now, Master Aqua?

251
00:15:00,262 --> 00:15:01,345
Horse stable.

252
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:02,880
What?

253
00:15:05,219 --> 00:15:06,779
Hey, take your hands off him!

254
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:08,765
Is there no limit to your rudeness?

255
00:15:09,181 --> 00:15:11,021
He is kind of making me
want to blow him up.

256
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,960
Don't do that, I will die too.

257
00:15:13,437 --> 00:15:17,357
You both are crusader and arch mage?

258
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,840
I see. You are blessed with
wonderful party members.

259
00:15:21,681 --> 00:15:24,069
You have such excellent people here,

260
00:15:24,219 --> 00:15:26,432
but you make Master Aqua
sleep in a horse stable.

261
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,207
Don't you feel ashamed?

262
00:15:31,302 --> 00:15:34,650
I'm sure this guy has lived a
life free of worry with that

263
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,076
Cursed Sword, Gram, so that he got
as a perk when reincarnating.

264
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:41,599
I worked my way up from square one,

265
00:15:41,696 --> 00:15:44,120
so why must I get
lectured by a guy like him?

266
00:15:44,621 --> 00:15:46,941
Besides, these girls are excellent?

267
00:15:47,581 --> 00:15:48,701
I have...

268
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,240
never once...

269
00:15:50,642 --> 00:15:51,937
seen the slightest...

270
00:15:52,341 --> 00:15:53,661
glimpse of...

271
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:55,153
that!

272
00:15:55,661 --> 00:15:59,621
All of you should travel with me,
a sword master, from now on.

273
00:15:59,962 --> 00:16:02,233
I will even buy you full sets
of high-grade equipment.

274
00:16:04,384 --> 00:16:06,128
Hey, this is bad.

275
00:16:06,207 --> 00:16:08,687
This guy seriously freaks me out.

276
00:16:08,762 --> 00:16:11,082
He is the narcissistic
type and that scares me.

277
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,920
What should I do? My instincts
won't let me accept that man.

278
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,460
I enjoy getting hit more than attacking,

279
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,760
but something about him
makes me want to hit him.

280
00:16:20,168 --> 00:16:21,328
Can I blow him up?

281
00:16:21,452 --> 00:16:22,492
Can I blow him up?

282
00:16:22,912 --> 00:16:25,888
It sounds like my allies unanimously

283
00:16:26,011 --> 00:16:28,211
don't want to join your party.

284
00:16:28,782 --> 00:16:29,792
Bye then.

285
00:16:33,061 --> 00:16:34,112
Wait!

286
00:16:36,434 --> 00:16:37,754
Please move aside.

287
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:42,101
Sorry, but I can't leave
Master Aqua in this environment.

288
00:16:42,438 --> 00:16:45,038
What now? He is the type
that won't listen to anyone.

289
00:16:45,354 --> 00:16:47,434
I can see where this is going.

290
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,610
Let's have a match.

291
00:16:50,045 --> 00:16:51,285
I knew it.

292
00:16:51,381 --> 00:16:53,966
If I win, hand Master Aqua over to me.

293
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:55,248
If you win,

294
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,312
I will listen to any request you have.

295
00:16:57,452 --> 00:16:58,972
All right, I'm in. Here I go!

296
00:16:59,535 --> 00:17:00,735
Hey, wait!

297
00:17:01,301 --> 00:17:03,541
Steal!

298
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,227
That will teach you
to say whatever you please.

299
00:17:16,951 --> 00:17:19,249
Coward!

300
00:17:19,553 --> 00:17:22,033
Coward!

301
00:17:23,363 --> 00:17:25,433
Are you both this guy's allies?

302
00:17:25,696 --> 00:17:28,475
So what? You disgusting man! Coward!

303
00:17:28,737 --> 00:17:31,933
This cheater with a cursed
sword who challenged

304
00:17:32,032 --> 00:17:35,039
a rookie adventurer with weak gear
in a match is the real coward!

305
00:17:35,341 --> 00:17:36,931
Give Gram back!

306
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,821
Only Kyouya can use that cursed sword!

307
00:17:40,914 --> 00:17:41,920
Really?

308
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,864
The Cursed Sword, Gram, is only for
use by this narcissistic guy.

309
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,221
Well, I have it now,
so I guess I'll keep it.

310
00:17:51,584 --> 00:17:53,617
Wait a second!

311
00:17:53,723 --> 00:17:56,163
We don't accept the way you won!

312
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,719
I am an advocate of true gender equality.

313
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,960
I am a guy who has no problem doling
out a drop kick to a female opponent.

314
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:09,273
Don't think I will go easy on you.

315
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,960
I'll unleash my steal skill
right here in public.

316
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:20,979
So, what will it be?

317
00:18:25,781 --> 00:18:28,781
Come on!

318
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,463
No!

319
00:18:37,368 --> 00:18:38,368
No.

320
00:18:38,843 --> 00:18:40,073
Konosuba.

321
00:18:40,562 --> 00:18:41,952
THE NEXT DAY

322
00:18:42,634 --> 00:18:44,514
Why?

323
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:46,962
That was Aqua's voice.

324
00:18:47,425 --> 00:18:48,985
I wonder what happened.

325
00:18:49,264 --> 00:18:52,664
She is never satisfied
until she causes a commotion.

326
00:18:56,116 --> 00:18:57,596
She said my reward this time

327
00:18:58,395 --> 00:19:01,315
after deducting the cost of
the broken cage is 100,000 Eris.

328
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,333
The cage repair fee is 200,000 Eris.

329
00:19:05,452 --> 00:19:07,652
I am not even the one who broke it.

330
00:19:08,461 --> 00:19:09,621
Next time when I see that man,

331
00:19:09,696 --> 00:19:12,901
I'm going to nail him
with Fist of God for sure!

332
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,960
I have been looking
for you, Satou Kazuma!

333
00:19:18,661 --> 00:19:22,141
I heard about you from a thief girl.

334
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:23,981
She said you are a demon
who strips off panties!

335
00:19:24,348 --> 00:19:27,296
Other than that,
there also seems to be rumors

336
00:19:27,456 --> 00:19:29,176
that you're into getting girls
covered in snot.

337
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,040
They call you "Kazuma the Brute".

338
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,856
Hey, wait! Tell me
who is spreading that around!

339
00:19:34,018 --> 00:19:37,858
Master Aqua, I swear that
I will defeat the Devil King.

340
00:19:38,088 --> 00:19:40,128
So, please, join me...

341
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,880
Fist of God!

342
00:19:47,922 --> 00:19:49,302
Hey, you!

343
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,552
Pay the repair fee for
the cage you broke!

344
00:19:51,672 --> 00:19:53,633
It's 300,000! 300,000!

345
00:19:55,001 --> 00:19:56,001
Sure.

346
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,600
Didn't she say 200,000 earlier?

347
00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:04,199
Excuse me! One drink and
a stack of fried frogs please!

348
00:20:06,556 --> 00:20:10,236
I realize this request is too much,

349
00:20:11,272 --> 00:20:12,288
but please...

350
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,188
return the cursed sword to me.

351
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:17,021
In exchange, I'll buy you
the finest sword in the shop.

352
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,580
First, there is the matter
of the cursed sword.

353
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,454
It is no longer being in his possession.

354
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,200
Satou Kazuma, where is the cursed sword?

355
00:20:33,526 --> 00:20:35,846
Where is my cursed sword?

356
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,728
I sold it.

357
00:20:38,161 --> 00:20:41,601
Darn it!

358
00:20:41,835 --> 00:20:44,115
Kyouya!

359
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:47,544
This money is meaningless.

360
00:20:48,721 --> 00:20:50,881
What's wrong with that guy?

361
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:56,533
By the way, he kept calling Aqua
a goddess. What is that about?

362
00:20:58,944 --> 00:21:00,000
The time is right.

363
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,720
It might be fine
to tell Megumin and Darkness.

364
00:21:04,372 --> 00:21:06,132
I have kept this to myself until now,

365
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,472
but I will tell you.

366
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:10,341
I am Aqua,

367
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:13,875
the goddess who rules water,
and is worshipped by the Akuxisi teach.

368
00:21:14,086 --> 00:21:17,526
Yes, I am the goddess Aqua!

369
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:19,520
Did you dream that?

370
00:21:19,674 --> 00:21:20,704
No!

371
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:22,083
<i>Emergency!</i>

372
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,536
<i>All adventurers, please
arm yourselves at once</i>

373
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,677
<i>and gather at the
front gate of the village!</i>

374
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,760
Adventurer Satou Kazuma
and his party in particular,

375
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:32,386
<i>as soon as possible, please!</i>

376
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,813
Him again?

377
00:21:47,082 --> 00:21:48,522
All of you.

378
00:21:50,581 --> 00:21:52,512
Why haven't you come to the castle?

379
00:21:52,665 --> 00:21:56,105
You wretches!

380
00:21:58,386 --> 00:21:59,392
What?

381
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:39,840

This Worthless Fight!)
