1
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:06,649
So cold.

2
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:10,305
I pawned my coat too. It's so cold.

3
00:00:12,261 --> 00:00:13,344
The fire!

4
00:00:18,322 --> 00:00:19,968
Hey, what are you doing?

5
00:00:20,098 --> 00:00:21,458
Stop screwing around!

6
00:00:21,532 --> 00:00:25,053
What are you doing
to my only memento of Japan?

7
00:00:25,184 --> 00:00:28,068
I don't have any choice!
There is nothing else to burn!

8
00:00:28,158 --> 00:00:29,792
Hand over that raiment then!

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,880
It looks like it would burn
better than a tracksuit!

10
00:00:32,388 --> 00:00:34,528
Let go of it, you shut-in NEET!

11
00:00:34,648 --> 00:00:35,818
Warm me up!

12
00:00:35,904 --> 00:00:38,069
Warm me up more!

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,360
Wait, stop!

14
00:00:55,068 --> 00:00:56,468
I can't go on like this.

15
00:00:57,118 --> 00:00:58,718
We have to do something.

16
00:01:14,058 --> 00:01:25,258
(KONOSUBA:
God's Blessing on This Wonderful World!)

17
00:01:46,928 --> 00:01:50,058
(Episode 8: A Loving Hand for Our Party
When We Can't Make It Through Winter!)

18
00:02:33,308 --> 00:02:35,788
Our team is poorly balanced.

19
00:02:36,134 --> 00:02:39,854
I'd like a skill that I could
use more like a main weapon.

20
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,240
All right, we're here. Listen, Aqua.

21
00:02:45,341 --> 00:02:48,421
I'll say this when I have the chance.
Don't throw any fits, got it?

22
00:02:48,557 --> 00:02:50,357
Hey, what are you talking about?

23
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,680
What do you take me for?

24
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:55,218
I am not hoodlum or outlaw.

25
00:02:55,328 --> 00:02:57,024
I am a goddess, a bona fide deity!

26
00:02:57,168 --> 00:02:59,488
Hey! Are you listening to me?

27
00:02:59,584 --> 00:03:01,184
Wait! You should listen
gratefully when a goddess speaks!

28
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,368
Welco...

29
00:03:06,412 --> 00:03:08,222
It's you, the undead!

30
00:03:08,352 --> 00:03:10,678
You opened up a shop here?

31
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:15,861
I'm sleeping in a stable
and you're running a shop?

32
00:03:15,937 --> 00:03:17,897
You're pretty full of yourself for a lich!

33
00:03:18,016 --> 00:03:20,600
I'll burn this shop to the ground
in the name of God...

34
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,856
Ow!

35
00:03:22,978 --> 00:03:24,138
Mr. Kazuma!

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,600
Hello, Wiz, it has been a while.

37
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:28,673
Konosuba.

38
00:03:31,557 --> 00:03:33,917
Don't you even serve tea at this shop?

39
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,360
Oh, I'm sorry! I'll bring some
for you right away!

40
00:03:41,997 --> 00:03:43,605
I see she hasn't changed.

41
00:03:47,277 --> 00:03:48,837
Her name is Wiz.

42
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:52,347
She may look like an ordinary
human, but she is actually a lich.

43
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,392
She is a ruler of the undead,
also known as the "No-Life King".

44
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,840
Although Wiz is a
lich, she is a kind girl.

45
00:03:59,097 --> 00:04:00,857
Every night, she sends spirits wandering

46
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,600
the graveyard to Heaven.

47
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,759
Though various circumstances,

48
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,373
we took up that job

49
00:04:07,657 --> 00:04:10,457
and ended up letting her go, but...

50
00:04:12,347 --> 00:04:13,987
Here you go.

51
00:04:18,148 --> 00:04:19,933
It's delicious.

52
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,860
You can set up a shop
even though you're an undead,

53
00:04:23,008 --> 00:04:25,763
and you can prepare warm tea
even though you're an undead.

54
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,120
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,495
The likes of me should
not live in such luxury!

56
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,887
Stop acting like a
spiteful sister-in-law.

57
00:04:34,757 --> 00:04:37,357
Wiz, I have some spare points saved up.

58
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,203
Could you teach me a skill?

59
00:04:40,407 --> 00:04:42,877
Hey! What are you thinking, Kazuma?

60
00:04:42,976 --> 00:04:46,857
I can't put up with attendant's learning
of a lich's skills!

61
00:04:46,976 --> 00:04:48,468
Who is an attendant?

62
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,000
Listen, liches love

63
00:04:51,179 --> 00:04:53,499
gloomy and dismal places.

64
00:04:53,632 --> 00:04:56,576
The whole lot of them are
basically related to slugs!

65
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,950
That is terrible!

66
00:04:58,082 --> 00:05:01,562
But people normally
can't learn lich skills, right?

67
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:03,639
I was thinking it could be

68
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:06,188
a great asset in battle
if I could learn skills like that.

69
00:05:06,441 --> 00:05:07,456
Um...

70
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:10,279
Did she say an attendant earlier?

71
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,872
That's right.

72
00:05:12,002 --> 00:05:13,282
I am Aqua.

73
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:16,999
Yes, the goddess Aqua,
worshipped by the Akuxisi teach.

74
00:05:17,249 --> 00:05:19,169
Renounce yourself, Lich!

75
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:23,712
Hey, Wiz. There is no need
to get so scared.

76
00:05:23,872 --> 00:05:25,152
No, it's...

77
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:28,528
There are lots of crazy
people in the Akuxisi teach,

78
00:05:28,607 --> 00:05:32,128
and it's common knowledge that it's
best not to get involved with them,

79
00:05:32,222 --> 00:05:35,622
so when I heard that she's the
goddess of the Akuxisi teach...

80
00:05:38,414 --> 00:05:41,174
What did you say?

81
00:05:41,354 --> 00:05:42,634
Curse you! This is what you get!

82
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,320
This conversation is not going anywhere.

83
00:05:45,018 --> 00:05:46,058
Konosuba.

84
00:05:52,064 --> 00:05:55,624
By the way, I heard that
you defeated Mr. Verdia.

85
00:05:56,402 --> 00:05:59,802
His skill with the sword
was supposed to be

86
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,180
quite impressive, even
among the other leaders,

87
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:04,077
so that's quite amazing.

88
00:06:04,623 --> 00:06:07,943
You sound as if you knew Verdia.

89
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:12,576
That's because I'm one of the eight
leaders of the Devil King's army.

90
00:06:12,728 --> 00:06:13,824
Got you!

91
00:06:15,282 --> 00:06:18,082
Wait! Please wait, Master Aqua!

92
00:06:18,152 --> 00:06:21,032
I beg you! Please listen
to what I have to say!

93
00:06:23,134 --> 00:06:24,384
I did it, Kazuma!

94
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,324
With this, all my debts will be forgiven!

95
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,080
In fact, I should get change back!

96
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:31,402
Hey, Aqua, at least hear her out.

97
00:06:32,672 --> 00:06:35,840
Listen, as an adventurer,
I obviously can't put up with the fact

98
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,240
that you're a leader
of the Devil King's army.

99
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:39,643
You have got it all wrong!

100
00:06:39,744 --> 00:06:43,069
I was asked to maintain the barrier
that protects the Devil King's castle!

101
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:46,272
I have never harmed humans,

102
00:06:46,368 --> 00:06:50,587
and you won't receive any
bounty for defeating me either!

103
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,328
I don't really get it,

104
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,330
but I'll eliminate you just in case.

105
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,665
Please wait, Master Aqua!

106
00:06:59,942 --> 00:07:01,822
Konosuba.

107
00:07:02,153 --> 00:07:05,433
So you're saying we can open the path

108
00:07:05,504 --> 00:07:08,543
to the Devil King's castle by defeating
all of his leaders, right?

109
00:07:09,952 --> 00:07:11,104
Yes, that's correct!

110
00:07:11,242 --> 00:07:13,122
That's what the Devil King asked of me!

111
00:07:13,201 --> 00:07:15,321
He said he wouldn't stop me from quietly

112
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,353
managing my shop in a human settlement,

113
00:07:17,423 --> 00:07:20,823
but only asked that I shall maintain
the barrier as one of his leaders.

114
00:07:21,082 --> 00:07:22,742
So, as long as you are around,

115
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,562
humans cannot invade
the Devil King's castle?

116
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,913
Kazuma, let's eliminate her.

117
00:07:29,122 --> 00:07:30,862
Wait! Please wait!

118
00:07:30,944 --> 00:07:33,834
Please at least let me
live a little while longer!

119
00:07:34,242 --> 00:07:37,482
I still have something I need to do.

120
00:07:39,002 --> 00:07:41,362
I could easily break a simple barrier.

121
00:07:42,485 --> 00:07:44,325
But she's a lich, so let's eliminate her.

122
00:07:44,408 --> 00:07:45,856
Please wait!

123
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:46,976
Hang on.

124
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,216
Even if we break the barrier right now,

125
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,096
we can't defeat the
Devil King at our current levels.

126
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,602
We will just end up being beheaded.

127
00:07:54,785 --> 00:07:56,345
Okay, fine.

128
00:07:57,024 --> 00:07:58,208
Thank you very much!

129
00:07:58,368 --> 00:07:59,424
But are you okay with this?

130
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,350
You don't resent us for
defeating Verdia or anything?

131
00:08:02,934 --> 00:08:08,184
It's not as though I was particularly
close to Mr. Verdia or anything.

132
00:08:11,063 --> 00:08:12,583
Whenever I walked around...

133
00:08:19,462 --> 00:08:21,662
My hand slipped!

134
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:26,448
He was the one who would often
roll his own head down by my feet,

135
00:08:26,602 --> 00:08:29,381
and try to look up my skirt.

136
00:08:29,581 --> 00:08:32,301
Strike! In so many ways, a total strike!

137
00:08:33,654 --> 00:08:39,136
Besides, I believe
my heart is human, even now.

138
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:41,906
Here I go!

139
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:45,409
Okay, I'll teach you
one of my skills then.

140
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:50,355
It's the least I can do to repay you
for letting me go before.

141
00:08:50,773 --> 00:08:51,808
What's wrong?

142
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:56,890
All of my skills can only
be used on an opponent.

143
00:08:57,117 --> 00:08:59,397
Aqua, sorry, but would you do it?

144
00:09:01,473 --> 00:09:05,046
What skill is an undead
planning to use on me?

145
00:09:05,335 --> 00:09:06,695
Well...

146
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:09,120
How about Drain Touch?

147
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:11,496
It's a skill that absorbs
an opponent's health and magic,

148
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,765
and can distribute that
power to others then.

149
00:09:14,871 --> 00:09:17,011
I see. Depending on how it's used,

150
00:09:17,088 --> 00:09:20,594
it might be to compensate for
our party's lack of firepower.

151
00:09:20,786 --> 00:09:21,920
Of course,

152
00:09:22,048 --> 00:09:24,434
I will only absorb a very small amount.

153
00:09:27,911 --> 00:09:30,551
Fine. Absorb as much as you can.

154
00:09:30,682 --> 00:09:32,282
Go ahead.

155
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,440
It's getting hard to tell
who the lich is and who the goddess is.

156
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,722
Okay, please excuse me.

157
00:09:46,236 --> 00:09:47,840
Come on, what's the matter?

158
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,483
Aren't you going to
absorb my magic and health?

159
00:09:52,768 --> 00:09:53,773
Ow!

160
00:09:53,888 --> 00:09:55,918
Hey, Kazuma, don't interfere!

161
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:58,304
This is a battle between
a lich and a goddess!

162
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,467
I won't let her absorb
my strength that easily!

163
00:10:00,547 --> 00:10:03,475
Look, we're not getting
anywhere, so let her absorb it!

164
00:10:03,797 --> 00:10:05,437
Konosuba.

165
00:10:25,212 --> 00:10:26,463
Acquisition complete!

166
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:28,619
Um, Master Aqua?

167
00:10:29,143 --> 00:10:32,343
It's all right. You can
let go of my hand now.

168
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,340
Actually, when you touch me,
it makes my hand tingle,

169
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,494
so I appreciate it
if you would let go of it.

170
00:10:40,282 --> 00:10:41,802
Master Aqua?

171
00:10:42,627 --> 00:10:45,184
My hand is starting to burn.

172
00:10:45,268 --> 00:10:48,948
Master Aqua, I'm going to
disappear! I'm disappearing!

173
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,308
Ow!

174
00:10:50,432 --> 00:10:52,588
What are you
taking advantage of the moment to do?

175
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,380
You're so mean.

176
00:10:55,562 --> 00:10:59,406
Is it just my imagination
or does Wiz look kind of see-through?

177
00:10:59,781 --> 00:11:01,101
Excuse me!

178
00:11:02,005 --> 00:11:03,925
Is Miss Wiz here?

179
00:11:04,962 --> 00:11:06,122
Konosuba.

180
00:11:12,457 --> 00:11:13,497
This is the place?

181
00:11:13,624 --> 00:11:16,464
Not bad! Yes, not bad at all!

182
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,404
This should be a fitting
place for me to live!

183
00:11:19,602 --> 00:11:23,224
I heard that this originally was
an aristocrat's villa.

184
00:11:23,322 --> 00:11:26,842
But the landlord is certainly generous,

185
00:11:26,981 --> 00:11:28,621
allowing us to live here as a
reward if we can exorcise it.

186
00:11:28,914 --> 00:11:32,634
Wiz is apparently known as a
famous magician in our city,

187
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:36,653
so people often bring
cases like these to her.

188
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:40,082
With this, we can make it
through the winter without worry!

189
00:11:40,186 --> 00:11:43,146
Like they say, "make the
best of a bad situation".

190
00:11:43,252 --> 00:11:44,292
I really admire myself.

191
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:45,760
But according to the landlord,

192
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:49,650
spirits reappeared instantly no matter
how many times they were exorcised.

193
00:11:49,723 --> 00:11:50,752
Leave it to me!

194
00:11:50,869 --> 00:11:53,536
I am a goddess and an arch priest!

195
00:11:53,694 --> 00:11:56,381
You could call me an anti-undead expert!

196
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:03,521
I see it!

197
00:12:03,882 --> 00:12:07,622
There was a child born in this mansion
to an aristocrat who made a move on

198
00:12:07,712 --> 00:12:11,128
his maid, partly in fun, and that
illegitimate child was confined here.

199
00:12:11,506 --> 00:12:13,952
The aristocrat had a weak
constitution, when he died from illness,

200
00:12:14,054 --> 00:12:17,152
the mother of the child
went missing as well.

201
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:19,264
The girl remained in the
mansion and succumbed to the same illness

202
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:22,208
as her father, passing away
at a young age.

203
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:26,209
I really want to ask how you
knew the setting in such detail.

204
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,458
That will take care of
the cleaning for now.

205
00:12:34,538 --> 00:12:37,578
We've decided the room arrangements
and we've carried in our luggage,

206
00:12:37,682 --> 00:12:39,362
so all we need is to wait for night time.

207
00:12:39,474 --> 00:12:41,408
No surprise that it's dusty.

208
00:12:41,542 --> 00:12:43,382
The girl's name was
Anna Filante Estheroid.

209
00:12:43,536 --> 00:12:45,376
Her favorite things were stuffed dolls,

210
00:12:45,696 --> 00:12:48,065
and tales of adventurers' journeys.

211
00:12:48,604 --> 00:12:51,296
But don't worry. This
spirit is not a bad girl.

212
00:12:51,616 --> 00:12:55,442
She may be a child, but she appears to
like things that are a bit grown-up.

213
00:12:55,814 --> 00:12:57,376
She enjoys sweet, hard drinks.

214
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,992
Okay, everyone is free to do
as they please from now on.

215
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:03,414
Call out as soon as
an evil spirit shows up.

216
00:13:04,456 --> 00:13:05,568
Dismissed!

217
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,468
This is great! Having my own
room is a wonderful thing!

218
00:13:14,692 --> 00:13:17,612
I'm sure the evil spirits
will be gone by morning.

219
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:18,889
I know Aqua well.

220
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:21,858
She isn't the type to let evil spirits

221
00:13:21,984 --> 00:13:23,962
do whatever they like in her own house.

222
00:13:24,112 --> 00:13:26,832
She is an arch priest
and goddess after all.

223
00:13:29,824 --> 00:13:30,848
What?

224
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:34,695
What's wrong? Hey, Aqua,
what happened? Are you all right?

225
00:13:37,162 --> 00:13:38,700
Kazuma!

226
00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:44,219
This is super expensive
alcohol that I've been saving.

227
00:13:44,294 --> 00:13:48,494
I was looking forward to taking
leisurely sips of it after my bath.

228
00:13:48,815 --> 00:13:51,375
But when I came back to my room,

229
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,504
as you can see, it was empty!

230
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,522
I see. Goodnight then. See you tomorrow.

231
00:13:55,695 --> 00:13:57,455
This is the work of evil spirits!

232
00:13:57,533 --> 00:13:59,763
I'm going to go look around the mansion,

233
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:02,233
and strike down any
spirits that catch my eye!

234
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:08,630
Show yourselves!

235
00:14:09,805 --> 00:14:11,665
Turn Undead!

236
00:14:11,747 --> 00:14:13,617
Turn Undead!

237
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,840
Turn Undead! Nature's Beauty!

238
00:14:15,962 --> 00:14:17,582
Turn Undead!

239
00:14:17,654 --> 00:14:19,134
Turn Undead!

240
00:14:29,305 --> 00:14:30,745
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

241
00:14:36,121 --> 00:14:37,152
Scary!

242
00:14:37,979 --> 00:14:39,899
Was there a doll like that in this room?

243
00:14:40,722 --> 00:14:42,402
It can't be!

244
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:46,229
A cliched development
like this can't be happening!

245
00:15:05,944 --> 00:15:08,279
Aqua! Master Aqua!

246
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:11,689
Scary! This is super scary! What is this?

247
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:15,411
Aqua, save m...

248
00:15:22,432 --> 00:15:23,802
Don't scare me like that, Megumin!

249
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,403
I nearly wet myself.

250
00:15:25,804 --> 00:15:27,564
I'm the one who should be saying that!

251
00:15:27,762 --> 00:15:30,642
Why did you come barging into this room?

252
00:15:30,882 --> 00:15:33,282
I thought Aqua was coming back.

253
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:35,899
I could ask you the same.
Why are you in Aqua's room?

254
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,634
Well, there were dolls
moving around all over the place.

255
00:15:40,842 --> 00:15:45,117
So, I was going to have Aqua protect me,

256
00:15:46,304 --> 00:15:50,338
and thought we could go
to the bathroom together.

257
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:51,739
You too?

258
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:56,033
Aqua is probably still out exorcising
spirits in the mansion, isn't she?

259
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:57,362
Is she?

260
00:15:57,442 --> 00:15:59,648
I'm sure Darkness is with her then.

261
00:16:01,276 --> 00:16:03,916
Yes, despite how she is,
she is a crusader.

262
00:16:06,951 --> 00:16:08,166
Hey, Megumin,

263
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,360
look over there and cover
your ears for a minute.

264
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:13,273
I'm going to borrow your veranda for a...

265
00:16:13,812 --> 00:16:16,412
Hey, what are you doing? Let go of me.

266
00:16:16,745 --> 00:16:18,464
If you don't, my pants and the carpet

267
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,027
in this room are going
to be in big trouble.

268
00:16:20,603 --> 00:16:24,763
I won't let you do it. How can
you relieve yourself alone?

269
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:27,707
Aren't we allies?

270
00:16:27,884 --> 00:16:32,244
Wherever we go, bathroom
or otherwise, we go together!

271
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,340
Let go of me! Don't emphasize our bond
as allies only at times like these!

272
00:16:36,437 --> 00:16:39,557
Didn't you say crimson demons
don't use the bathroom?

273
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,375
If you want, there is an
empty bottle lying over there!

274
00:16:42,819 --> 00:16:45,139
You just blurted out
something outrageous!

275
00:16:45,344 --> 00:16:47,782
What are you suggesting me
to do with that empty bottle?

276
00:16:47,936 --> 00:16:51,436
I won't let you do it! I can
at least shake you from behind

277
00:16:51,534 --> 00:16:54,334
while you go to the bathroom.

278
00:17:06,623 --> 00:17:08,503
Konosuba.

279
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:15,449
Kazuma, are you there?

280
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,672
I'm here.

281
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:19,424
Are you really there?

282
00:17:19,584 --> 00:17:20,608
I'm here!

283
00:17:20,747 --> 00:17:23,657
You are really there for me, right?

284
00:17:23,744 --> 00:17:25,763
I am here! I'm right here.

285
00:17:25,856 --> 00:17:28,119
and I won't leave you,
so hurry up and go!

286
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,840
This is a little embarrassing.

287
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,478
Could you sing a song or
something in a loud voice?

288
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:39,242
Why do I have to sing in the middle
of the night in front of a bathroom?

289
00:17:44,852 --> 00:17:45,852
Hey, Megumin, hurry up!

290
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:47,972
Please don't rush me like that!

291
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,240
I know you're in a tough spot too!

292
00:17:50,385 --> 00:17:52,505
It's true that both our
bladders are in a tough spot,

293
00:17:52,608 --> 00:17:54,831
but we've got a bigger
problem closing in!

294
00:17:55,072 --> 00:17:58,269
I can't go if you rush me like that!

295
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,064
It's no good!

296
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,753
I can't wait any longer!

297
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,840
Hurry up!

298
00:18:10,501 --> 00:18:12,701
How can anyone have
so little common sense?

299
00:18:12,835 --> 00:18:15,475
You at least got half way
through, so you're fine!

300
00:18:15,576 --> 00:18:16,936
What are you talking about?

301
00:18:17,015 --> 00:18:19,015
Crimson demons don't use the bathroom.

302
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,004
You are saying that now?
I'm already at my limit here!

303
00:18:23,348 --> 00:18:25,828
I thought that might
happen, so I brought this.

304
00:18:26,028 --> 00:18:27,268
Please use it.

305
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,879
No, thanks!

306
00:18:37,426 --> 00:18:41,346
I can't hold it anymore.
At this point, I'd sooner use the vase.

307
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:45,229
Darkness blacker than
black and darker than dark.

308
00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:47,889
I beseech you to combine
with my deep crimson.

309
00:18:47,991 --> 00:18:49,631
What are you chanting?
You want to blow away

310
00:18:49,703 --> 00:18:51,053
this mansion along with them?

311
00:18:56,237 --> 00:18:58,197
We will just have to go for it!

312
00:18:58,364 --> 00:19:00,684
Megumin, run once I open the door!

313
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,136
I will use the Drain Touch
skill I just learned,

314
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:05,379
and absorb the magic of
as many dolls as I can!

315
00:19:06,852 --> 00:19:10,417
Bring it on, you evil spirits!

316
00:19:10,501 --> 00:19:14,421
I will get our goddess on you all later!

317
00:19:20,374 --> 00:19:22,118
Aqua, are you okay?

318
00:19:22,571 --> 00:19:23,931
Konosuba.

319
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:29,579
Since you exorcised the evil spirits,
you get a special reward.

320
00:19:29,862 --> 00:19:32,742
This was posted as a crusade quest,

321
00:19:32,941 --> 00:19:35,416
but even the guild was
bothered by how new spirits

322
00:19:35,488 --> 00:19:37,642
settled in, no matter
how many spirits were exorcised.

323
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:39,099
So I hear.

324
00:19:39,257 --> 00:19:41,737
Why did so many
evil spirits gather there?

325
00:19:41,924 --> 00:19:43,364
About that,

326
00:19:43,529 --> 00:19:46,862
there is a community
graveyard near that mansion, right?

327
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:48,835
A community graveyard?

328
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:51,544
The place where we first met Wiz?

329
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,020
Someone apparently erected
a massive barrier

330
00:19:54,173 --> 00:19:56,573
as a prank or something.

331
00:19:56,769 --> 00:19:58,844
So the spirits had nowhere to go

332
00:19:58,976 --> 00:20:01,000
and settled in the vacant mansion instead.

333
00:20:02,832 --> 00:20:04,125
Excuse us for a moment.

334
00:20:07,904 --> 00:20:10,240
Hey, you know what is
going on, don't you? Say it.

335
00:20:11,207 --> 00:20:13,792
Yes. You remember how
we undertook exorcising

336
00:20:13,903 --> 00:20:15,943
of the graveyard in Wiz's stead before?

337
00:20:16,176 --> 00:20:19,456
But constantly going all the way
to the graveyard was a huge pain.

338
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,640
So, I figured if I took away
their graveyard, the spirits' home,

339
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:28,581
they would eventually
disperse and leave. So, I did.

340
00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:31,809
Talk about stirring up
trouble and taking the credit!

341
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:33,869
This is obviously wrong.

342
00:20:34,631 --> 00:20:38,711
We will not accept the special
reward from the guild, got it?

343
00:20:39,008 --> 00:20:40,064
Yes.

344
00:20:40,427 --> 00:20:41,427
Konosuba.

345
00:20:44,889 --> 00:20:47,249
I thought for sure it was
all Aqua's wild delusions.

346
00:20:47,355 --> 00:20:49,675
Who would have thought it was all true?

347
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,351
Hello, Mr. Kazuma.

348
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,000
Are you cleaning the gravestone?

349
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,960
Isn't it great that you've been
allowed to live here?

350
00:20:58,358 --> 00:21:01,478
It's a life-saver that the landlord
here is such a nice person.

351
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,481
We caused you a lot of trouble too, Wiz.

352
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:07,889
No. I personally think
this was for the best.

353
00:21:08,344 --> 00:21:11,104
I'm sure she won't be lonely anymore.

354
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:14,240
I'm sure.

355
00:21:14,824 --> 00:21:17,744
I'm begging you, please
don't cause any more mischief.

356
00:21:17,929 --> 00:21:21,129
Well, I need to attend to the shop,
so I'll be heading back for the day.

357
00:21:21,337 --> 00:21:22,737
Say hello to the others for me.

358
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,051
Yes, thank you for coming.

359
00:21:30,364 --> 00:21:34,164
Kazuma! Lunch is ready, so hurry back!

360
00:21:34,343 --> 00:21:38,143
If you don't, your
long-awaited lunch will get cold!

361
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,560
With this, I finally obtained

362
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,600
the down-to-earth lifestyle
I most desired.

363
00:21:44,264 --> 00:21:46,592
Got it, I'm on my way!

364
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,160
Aqua, we're out of
wood for the fireplace.

365
00:21:50,231 --> 00:21:53,871
Oh, then toss Kazuma's tracksuit
over there onto the fire!

366
00:21:53,978 --> 00:21:55,358
Don't do that!

367
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,049
I told you not to burn
my precious memories!

368
00:23:30,016 --> 00:23:39,744
