1
00:00:05,367 --> 00:00:06,432
There we go.

2
00:00:07,648 --> 00:00:09,696
Normally, I shut myself at home,

3
00:00:10,447 --> 00:00:12,576
but today, I remarkably
made up my mind to go out.

4
00:00:17,344 --> 00:00:19,600
This is because I want to
buy the first-run limited edition

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,208
of a popular online game
that goes on sale today.

6
00:00:31,274 --> 00:00:34,272
Even though it was a five-hour trip,
I'm glad I finally got it.

7
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,920
Exclusive to specific stores?
They are really playing dirty.

8
00:00:40,965 --> 00:00:44,365
This sunlight is my worst enemy
after three straight all-nighters.

9
00:00:44,808 --> 00:00:46,720
Time to go home and play.

10
00:00:52,777 --> 00:00:54,177
A girl from my high school?

11
00:00:59,008 --> 00:01:00,064
Look out!

12
00:01:00,463 --> 00:01:01,583
That truck is...

13
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,712
Why would I choose now, of all times,

14
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,880
to do something so out of my character?

15
00:01:25,088 --> 00:01:26,208
Satou Kazuma.

16
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,928
Welcome to the afterlife world.

17
00:01:32,064 --> 00:01:35,744
I'm sorry, but you passed away
moments ago.

18
00:01:39,744 --> 00:01:41,664
Your life was a short one,

19
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,504
but you are, in fact, dead.

20
00:01:49,029 --> 00:01:50,176
Just one question...

21
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,640
What about the girl
I pushed out of harm's way?

22
00:01:56,096 --> 00:01:57,360
She's alive.

23
00:01:59,816 --> 00:02:01,184
Thank goodness.

24
00:02:01,773 --> 00:02:04,064
That means my death wasn't in vain.

25
00:02:06,536 --> 00:02:09,136
Well, she wouldn't have got hurt,

26
00:02:09,216 --> 00:02:11,392
if you hadn't pushed her out of the way.

27
00:02:13,056 --> 00:02:16,384
That tractor was going to stop
before it hit her.

28
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:18,589
What? Wait a second.

29
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:19,680
What is it?

30
00:02:19,779 --> 00:02:20,939
A tractor?

31
00:02:21,859 --> 00:02:23,899
Yes, it was a tractor.

32
00:02:24,188 --> 00:02:25,828
Then what happened?

33
00:02:26,336 --> 00:02:28,880
Did I die by getting
plowed over by a tractor?

34
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:31,104
No, you died of shock.

35
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:33,120
You mistakenly thought
a truck ran over you.

36
00:02:33,259 --> 00:02:34,659
I died of shock?

37
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:40,800
I've been doing this job for a long time,

38
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:44,442
but you're the first human to
ever die in such a bizarre way.

39
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:46,272
What's her deal?

40
00:02:46,345 --> 00:02:48,608
What's the deal with this girl
I've never met before?

41
00:02:48,773 --> 00:02:51,413
You were so terrified
that you even wet yourself.

42
00:02:51,499 --> 00:02:53,664
You passed out and were taken
to a nearby hospital.

43
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,576
The doctors and nurses laughed at you
when you had a heart attack...

44
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,640
Stop! I don't want to hear it!

45
00:02:58,752 --> 00:03:00,384
I don't want to hear it!
I don't want to hear it!

46
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,815
Your family rushed to the hospital,

47
00:03:02,912 --> 00:03:05,260
and even now they're laughing
at the cause of your death.

48
00:03:05,376 --> 00:03:06,944
Stop! Stop!

49
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:08,160
Well then...

50
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:12,184
I've vented enough stress for now.

51
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:13,819
You little...

52
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,360
My name is Aqua.

53
00:03:16,143 --> 00:03:19,835
I'm a goddess who guides humans
who die young to the afterlife.

54
00:03:20,043 --> 00:03:22,603
You have two choices:

55
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,530
you can start from zero with a new life,

56
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,480
or you can go to Heaven
and carry on like an old man.

57
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,624
To tell you the truth,

58
00:03:32,203 --> 00:03:35,483
Heaven isn't a dream place
you all imagine it to be.

59
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,720
There's no TV, manga or any game.

60
00:03:38,842 --> 00:03:40,522
You don't even have a physical body,

61
00:03:40,866 --> 00:03:44,306
so you can't do anything sexual, either.

62
00:03:44,538 --> 00:03:47,818
There's nothing to do there
but to bask in the sun for all eternity.

63
00:03:48,035 --> 00:03:49,195
What?

64
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,240
You wouldn't want to go to
a boring place like Heaven, would you?

65
00:03:53,563 --> 00:03:55,163
Right...

66
00:03:55,553 --> 00:03:58,993
Actually, starting over from zero
isn't very fun, either.

67
00:03:59,084 --> 00:04:01,284
On that note,
I've got a great offer for you.

68
00:04:01,551 --> 00:04:03,831
You like games, don't you?

69
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:06,729
This world,

70
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:08,480
which has long enjoyed peace,

71
00:04:08,604 --> 00:04:11,284
is being threatened
by the Devil King's army!

72
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:15,509
The livelihood of its citizens
is being trampled by monsters.

73
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:20,419
Everyone's in fear of the Devil King's
army's merciless slaughter!

74
00:04:21,018 --> 00:04:22,418
Slaughter!

75
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,433
Since it's that sort of world,
everyone refuses to be reborn,

76
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,219
so the population is declining.

77
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:31,388
I see.

78
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:33,888
So we decided,
"Why not send people who died

79
00:04:34,026 --> 00:04:38,546
in other worlds there with
their bodies and memories intact?"

80
00:04:38,963 --> 00:04:41,803
There's no point sending me there
if I'm going to be killed, right?

81
00:04:41,877 --> 00:04:43,277
That's why I'm doing you a big favor.

82
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:47,685
I'm granting you the right to
bring anything you choose with you.

83
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,218
It could be a powerful weapon
or a tremendous talent.

84
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,848
You'll be able to redo your life
with all of your original memories.

85
00:04:55,168 --> 00:04:57,847
To top it off, you can bring one thing
of your choosing!

86
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,520
And the people of the parallel world

87
00:04:59,676 --> 00:05:01,876
will earn someone
battle-ready to help them.

88
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,235
Not a bad deal, right?

89
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,920
Can I ask you something?

90
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,320
Will I be able to speak their language?

91
00:05:13,058 --> 00:05:14,938
That won't be an issue.

92
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:19,179
Gods like us will provide you with help.

93
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:22,939
We'll overload your brain
so you can learn it instantly.

94
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:26,531
As a side effect, you might go
"poof" if you're unlucky, though.

95
00:05:26,841 --> 00:05:30,161
What's left to do now is to
choose an ability or piece of equipment.

96
00:05:33,059 --> 00:05:35,619
You just mentioned
something really serious.

97
00:05:36,508 --> 00:05:37,824
What do you mean, "poof"?

98
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,840
-I never said that.
-Yes, you did.

99
00:05:40,663 --> 00:05:42,383
Now, choose!

100
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:47,651
I'll grant you one power
that is second to none!

101
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,499
<i>This is my intuition talking as a gamer,</i>

102
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,480
<i>but all of the abilities and equipment
here are totally awesome!</i>

103
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:59,802
<i>If I'm going to a world where magic exists,
I have to try magic out!</i>

104
00:06:00,683 --> 00:06:02,683
Hey, hurry up.

105
00:06:02,753 --> 00:06:04,913
No matter what you pick,
it's all the same.

106
00:06:05,061 --> 00:06:07,541
No one's expecting much
from an otaku anyway.

107
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:09,706
I'm not an otaku!

108
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:12,499
I died outside my house,
so I'm not a shut-in!

109
00:06:14,823 --> 00:06:17,383
None of that matters. Just hurry up.

110
00:06:17,508 --> 00:06:20,678
I still have lots of deceased humans
to guide, you know.

111
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:22,059
You...

112
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:26,579
So egotistic just because
she's a little cute...

113
00:06:31,343 --> 00:06:32,983
Hurry up and decide, right?

114
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:35,333
I'll do just that, then.

115
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,440
Pick one thing to bring into
this parallel world, right?

116
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,640
That's right.

117
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:43,939
Okay, I pick you.

118
00:06:50,723 --> 00:06:53,603
All right, stand still and
don't leave the magic circle.

119
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:56,179
Wait, what did you just say?

120
00:07:02,739 --> 00:07:04,459
We have heard your request.

121
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,080
I shall take over your job
from now on, Aqua.

122
00:07:10,403 --> 00:07:14,803
Kazuma's wish complies with
regulations and has been accepted.

123
00:07:14,956 --> 00:07:16,539
Hey, what is all this?

124
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,421
What? You've got to be kidding me.

125
00:07:18,496 --> 00:07:19,628
No, no, no!

126
00:07:19,712 --> 00:07:20,897
Wait a minute.

127
00:07:20,972 --> 00:07:22,212
This is not right!

128
00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:25,372
Taking a goddess with you
is against the rules!

129
00:07:25,452 --> 00:07:27,808
It's illegal! It is illegal!

130
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,876
Wait! Wait!

131
00:07:30,996 --> 00:07:33,196
Please have a safe trip, Aqua.

132
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:35,669
Should you successfully
defeat the Devil King,

133
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:37,344
I will send someone to pick you up.

134
00:07:37,443 --> 00:07:40,323
I may have the ability to heal
since I'm a goddess,

135
00:07:40,428 --> 00:07:42,468
but I have no fighting skills at all!

136
00:07:42,592 --> 00:07:45,472
There's no way
I can defeat the Devil King!

137
00:07:45,619 --> 00:07:48,059
Hey, wait!

138
00:07:49,413 --> 00:07:54,013
How does it feel to get dragged away
with the guy you ill-treated?

139
00:07:56,363 --> 00:07:59,603
You've been designated as
the one thing I'll be bringing along,

140
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,720
so if you're a goddess,
use your godly power

141
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,120
or whatever to make my life
as easy as possible!

142
00:08:04,238 --> 00:08:05,718
No!

143
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,880
I don't want to go to a parallel world
with a man like this!

144
00:08:13,153 --> 00:08:17,433
Brave hero, I pray that
of many prospective heroes,

145
00:08:17,517 --> 00:08:20,397
you will be the one
to defeat the Devil King.

146
00:08:20,755 --> 00:08:23,115
If you do so, we shall grant

147
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,836
any wish you desire
as a gift from the gods.

148
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,280
Really?

149
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:29,507
That's my line!

150
00:08:29,736 --> 00:08:31,816
Now, go forth on your journey!

151
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:37,433
No!

152
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:01,379
AXEL - THE TOWN OF BEGINNING ADVENTURES

153
00:09:03,736 --> 00:09:04,768
It's a parallel world.

154
00:09:05,099 --> 00:09:07,219
Hey, this really is a parallel world!

155
00:09:08,022 --> 00:09:12,182
Wait, I'm really going to be using magic

156
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,720
and going on adventures
in this world from now on?

157
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:22,342
Goodbye, shut-in life! Hello, new world!

158
00:09:22,452 --> 00:09:24,896
I can really start anew in this world!

159
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,360
Hey, shut up.

160
00:09:27,606 --> 00:09:31,286
What if everyone thinks
my partner is a crazy woman?

161
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,080
Before I forget, isn't there something
you're supposed to give me?

162
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,560
Look at what I'm wearing.
I'm in a tracksuit.

163
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,080
Here I am in a fantasy world,
but all I have is a single tracksuit.

164
00:09:41,356 --> 00:09:43,596
Isn't there a starter pack I should...?

165
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:56,053
What the heck? Stop! Stop it!

166
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,320
I get it, okay? I'm sorry!

167
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,855
If you hate it that much,
then you can go home.

168
00:10:00,943 --> 00:10:02,983
I'll work out the rest on my own.

169
00:10:03,072 --> 00:10:04,864
What are you talking about?!

170
00:10:04,968 --> 00:10:06,720
I'm in trouble because I can't go back!

171
00:10:06,849 --> 00:10:08,649
What do I do? Huh? What am I going to do?

172
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,840
What am I supposed to do now?

173
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,240
Hey, calm down, goddess.

174
00:10:14,523 --> 00:10:16,163
Now we should find the guilds first.

175
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:21,626
Going places to gather information
is what you do in RPGs.

176
00:10:23,183 --> 00:10:25,503
You're supposed to be
some game otaku shut-in.

177
00:10:25,586 --> 00:10:27,186
Why are you so reliable?

178
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:28,828
All right! Let's go, goddess.

179
00:10:28,948 --> 00:10:30,028
Hey, wait.

180
00:10:31,219 --> 00:10:33,659
You can call me "goddess" if you like,

181
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,731
but you can also call me Aqua,
so we don't cause a commotion.

182
00:10:36,859 --> 00:10:37,888
I get it.

183
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,512
If you're a goddess, do you know
where we can find an adventurer's guild?

184
00:10:42,593 --> 00:10:43,953
I'm a goddess.

185
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:47,483
There's no way I'd know about
every little lowly place like that.

186
00:10:49,241 --> 00:10:51,124
Useless girl.

187
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,224
Thanks for buying.

188
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:54,659
Thank you. Up we go.

189
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:57,499
ADVENTURER'S GUILD

190
00:10:57,643 --> 00:10:59,563
Looks like this is the place.

191
00:11:04,143 --> 00:11:05,263
Scary!

192
00:11:07,443 --> 00:11:11,008
Welcome! If you're dining in,
please take any open seat.

193
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:13,859
If you need job guidance,
head over to that counter inside.

194
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:15,328
Thank you.

195
00:11:21,619 --> 00:11:22,624
Hey!

196
00:11:23,619 --> 00:11:25,179
I haven't seen you here before.

197
00:11:26,464 --> 00:11:29,143
What's with that weird clothes?

198
00:11:29,285 --> 00:11:34,045
Oh, we've come a long way here,
and we just got into town.

199
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:39,499
I want to become an adventurer
to fight the Devil King's army too.

200
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,510
Is that right, you reckless kid?

201
00:11:43,946 --> 00:11:46,306
Welcome to the gate to hell!

202
00:11:46,432 --> 00:11:48,731
If you're looking for
the guild admission desk, it's over there.

203
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,408
Hey.

204
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:57,973
How can you make up a story
like that on the spot?

205
00:11:58,337 --> 00:11:59,377
Listen, Aqua.

206
00:12:00,579 --> 00:12:04,139
We must register with a guild by today
and find a place to stay at night.

207
00:12:04,463 --> 00:12:07,520
Got it. I don't know
anything about games,

208
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:09,899
but I guess that's how it works
in worlds like this, right?

209
00:12:10,228 --> 00:12:12,800
Exactly. All right, let's go.

210
00:12:12,978 --> 00:12:14,018
Oh, wait.

211
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:17,053
You seem like a capable guy.

212
00:12:17,984 --> 00:12:21,440
Why were you a shut-in otaku
with no friends or even a girlfriend?

213
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,840
Why did you seclude yourself every day?

214
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,840
Stop telling me that, girl.

215
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,650
Okay? Stop it immediately.

216
00:12:31,593 --> 00:12:33,913
Hello. What can I do for you today?

217
00:12:34,355 --> 00:12:36,795
Um, we'd like to become adventurers.

218
00:12:36,971 --> 00:12:38,131
I see.

219
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,360
In that case, you'll need to
pay the registration fee.

220
00:12:41,564 --> 00:12:42,564
Sure, sure.

221
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,433
What? Registration fee?

222
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,179
Do you have any money?

223
00:12:48,463 --> 00:12:50,663
You dragged me here without any warning.

224
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,140
Of course I don't.

225
00:12:52,634 --> 00:12:54,594
This girl is so useless.

226
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:03,899
Are you ready to order?

227
00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:07,299
Um, I'm still thinking about it.

228
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,880
Please take your time.

229
00:13:09,974 --> 00:13:11,054
Hey, what should we do?

230
00:13:11,764 --> 00:13:12,924
We've already hit a roadblock.

231
00:13:13,474 --> 00:13:15,914
Normally, we'll get a minimal
amount of equipment

232
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,920
and enough money
to cover basic living expenses, at least.

233
00:13:19,051 --> 00:13:20,251
This is totally inhospitable.

234
00:13:20,798 --> 00:13:23,198
Your reliability disappeared like that.

235
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,080
Well, I guess it was inevitable.
You really are a shut-in.

236
00:13:26,171 --> 00:13:27,171
Don't call me that.

237
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,440
Fine. I guess it's my turn now.

238
00:13:30,762 --> 00:13:32,922
Let me show you what a goddess can do!

239
00:13:36,892 --> 00:13:39,612
You there, priest!
State your denomination!

240
00:13:40,144 --> 00:13:41,424
I'm Aqua.

241
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,000
An object of worship for the Religious
Order of Axis: the goddess Aqua!

242
00:13:46,638 --> 00:13:49,158
If you're one of my followers,

243
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:52,859
it'd be a huge help
if you could lend me some money!

244
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:56,019
I'm in the Eris Sect, though.

245
00:14:00,003 --> 00:14:03,043
Oh, you are? I'm sorry.

246
00:14:03,567 --> 00:14:06,927
Oh, young lady,
are you with the Axis Sect?

247
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:09,152
The relationship of the goddesses Aqua

248
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:11,508
and Eris is like
that of superior and subordinate.

249
00:14:11,596 --> 00:14:13,116
This must be fate.

250
00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:16,119
I overheard earlier
you couldn't cover the fee, right?

251
00:14:17,403 --> 00:14:18,432
Here you go.

252
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,960
Please consider it
as Eris's divine blessing.

253
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,470
Still, no matter how devout
a believer you are,

254
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,560
you mustn't call yourself a goddess.

255
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:28,069
Uh, yes. I'm sorry.

256
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,622
Thank you very much.

257
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:36,370
He didn't even believe that I'm a goddess.

258
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,240
By the way, Eris is a goddess
ranked beneath me.

259
00:14:41,822 --> 00:14:45,582
A believer of my subordinate
took pity on me

260
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,240
and even lent me money.

261
00:14:56,473 --> 00:14:59,753
We've brought the registration fee.

262
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:05,859
It seems she doesn't want to
make eye contact with us.

263
00:15:06,534 --> 00:15:08,734
Well then, let me explain.

264
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:12,267
Each adventurer
has his or her own occupation.

265
00:15:12,585 --> 00:15:14,741
This is your registration card.

266
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,480
It keeps track of how many
monsters you've vanquished.

267
00:15:18,699 --> 00:15:20,019
As your level increases,

268
00:15:20,192 --> 00:15:22,997
you'll earn points
that you can use to learn skills,

269
00:15:23,112 --> 00:15:25,466
so please work hard to raise your level.

270
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,640
One at a time,
place your hands over this crystal.

271
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,680
Like this?

272
00:15:46,353 --> 00:15:49,088
With this, you will each learn
your current status,

273
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:53,249
so please choose your desired occupation
based on your status.

274
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,800
Here it comes!

275
00:15:54,884 --> 00:15:57,644
Now my tremendous abilities
will be made apparent,

276
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:00,708
and there'll be
an uproar throughout the guild!

277
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:06,297
Yes, thank you very much.

278
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:08,949
Satou Kazuma, is it?

279
00:16:09,156 --> 00:16:10,322
Let me see.

280
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:12,000
Average across the board,

281
00:16:12,148 --> 00:16:14,548
with the exception of
decently high intelligence.

282
00:16:14,659 --> 00:16:17,379
Oh, and your luck is extraordinarily high.

283
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,640
Of course, luck isn't
essential for an adventurer.

284
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,480
With this much luck,

285
00:16:23,586 --> 00:16:26,546
I'd recommend you to become
a merchant or something similar.

286
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,064
Hey,

287
00:16:28,245 --> 00:16:30,485
she's disapproving my adventurer's
lifestyle right off the bat.

288
00:16:30,675 --> 00:16:31,675
What's going on?

289
00:16:34,044 --> 00:16:36,684
Make my primary
occupation adventurer, please.

290
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,880
Well, you can always change occupation
when you level up!

291
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:43,019
You're right!

292
00:16:43,843 --> 00:16:45,443
The weakest occupation, huh?

293
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:51,008
Aside from your intelligence
being below average

294
00:16:51,156 --> 00:16:53,116
and your luck being the lowest,

295
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:56,750
all of your statuses are
drastically above average!

296
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,840
What? Does that mean I'm really amazing?

297
00:17:00,706 --> 00:17:02,986
Amazing is an understatement!

298
00:17:03,281 --> 00:17:06,521
The mage class which requires
intelligence, is out of the question.

299
00:17:06,912 --> 00:17:08,992
Other than that, you can be
anything you want!

300
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,340
A crusader, sword master, arch priest...

301
00:17:12,452 --> 00:17:14,612
nearly any advanced class
right from the start!

302
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:18,219
I see. It's a shame there's
no occupation like goddess,

303
00:17:18,641 --> 00:17:21,790
but in my case, maybe I'll be
an arch priest who heals her allies.

304
00:17:21,891 --> 00:17:23,731
An arch priest!

305
00:17:23,891 --> 00:17:26,976
An almighty class that commands
all recovery and support magic,

306
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:30,931
and even boasts enough strength
to stand at the front line!

307
00:17:36,783 --> 00:17:40,183
Without further ado, welcome to
the Adventurer's Guild, Aqua.

308
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:44,138
All of our staff will be
looking forward to your future exploits.

309
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:49,313
Starting off as an arch priest
is incredible!

310
00:17:49,553 --> 00:17:54,073
Someone might actually be able to beat
the Devil King, you reckless girl!

311
00:17:54,459 --> 00:17:57,296
So there's no event like this for me?

312
00:17:57,651 --> 00:18:01,011
It's the adventurer's life for us
starting today, Kazuma!

313
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:03,499
I thought you absolutely hated all this.

314
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,120
Did I?

315
00:18:12,465 --> 00:18:16,745
Well, everything thus far
has been character creation.

316
00:18:17,027 --> 00:18:20,787
Now our adventure is
finally about to begin!

317
00:20:07,819 --> 00:20:09,139
Wait, this isn't right!

318
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:10,888
What isn't?

319
00:20:11,139 --> 00:20:13,059
No, wait a second!

320
00:20:13,408 --> 00:20:16,820
What's wrong? Did you forget
to use the bathroom before bed?

321
00:20:16,899 --> 00:20:18,560
It's dark. Want me to go with you?

322
00:20:18,714 --> 00:20:21,154
No! That's not it!

323
00:20:21,691 --> 00:20:22,931
Keep it down!

324
00:20:23,027 --> 00:20:24,587
We're sorry!

325
00:20:29,293 --> 00:20:31,712
We didn't come here to be laborers.

326
00:20:31,892 --> 00:20:34,132
Oh, that's right!

327
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,680
I need you to defeat the Devil King,
or I'll never be able to go home!

328
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:47,871
Her intelligence is lower than a human's.

329
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,622
All of the monsters near town
have been exterminated.

330
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,880
With no monsters,
no one will send us requests.

331
00:20:57,363 --> 00:21:00,363
I didn't want to learn
such a harsh reality.

332
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,730
Thanks for your business!

333
00:21:15,939 --> 00:21:16,960
What is it?

334
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:21,699
It's nothing.

335
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:23,328
Hey,

336
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:25,819
I was just thinking

337
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,080
let's run away from here
and do a kill quest.

338
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,224
We're only at level one,
so we don't have full set of equipment.

339
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,440
No worries.

340
00:21:33,536 --> 00:21:36,120
As long as I'm with you,
it'll be over in a flash!

341
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:38,619
You can count on me!

342
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:40,899
I feel very uneasy about this.

343
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,440
Who do you think I am?

344
00:21:44,329 --> 00:21:45,489
That's right.

345
00:21:45,786 --> 00:21:48,266
You're a goddess, after all.

346
00:21:48,587 --> 00:21:50,467
Yes! Just leave it to me.

347
00:21:52,219 --> 00:21:55,739
And so our adventure began,

348
00:21:55,956 --> 00:21:58,356
