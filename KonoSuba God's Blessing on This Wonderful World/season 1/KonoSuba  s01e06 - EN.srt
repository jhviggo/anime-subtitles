1
00:00:05,694 --> 00:00:07,488
Why haven't you come to the castle?

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,200
You wretches!

3
00:00:11,508 --> 00:00:12,508
What?

4
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:15,232
We didn't fire the
Explosion Magic at you.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,262
Are you sure you didn't fire that at me?

6
00:00:17,335 --> 00:00:19,770
That's a barefaced lie!

7
00:00:21,763 --> 00:00:24,603
The crazy red devil

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,640
is still coming to my
castle every single day.

9
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:32,131
What did you do?

10
00:00:32,211 --> 00:00:33,590
It's painful.

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,160
That's not the case.
Please listen to my explanation.

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,840
I unleashed my magic on empty plains,

13
00:00:41,945 --> 00:00:44,985
but since I learned the allure
of using magic attacks on a castle,

14
00:00:45,089 --> 00:00:49,849
I need to find some big and hard targets.
If not, I can't endure it.

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,272
Don't say that while fidgeting.

16
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,320
Besides, you can't move
after unleashing your magic, right?

17
00:00:55,431 --> 00:00:57,631
It means you must've had an accomplice.

18
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:03,360
It's you, right?

19
00:01:03,456 --> 00:01:04,896
It's so painful.

20
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,535
We can't get any task
because of this headless knight.

21
00:01:07,616 --> 00:01:09,655
I always want to vent my anger.

22
00:01:11,695 --> 00:01:13,615
Hey fools, listen to me.

23
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:15,297
My name is Verdia.

24
00:01:15,855 --> 00:01:19,375
There's another reason
that makes me really angry.

25
00:01:19,768 --> 00:01:24,048
Did you not have guts
to seek revenge for your ally's death?

26
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:27,563
I was an upstanding knight
when I was alive.

27
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,674
In my opinion,

28
00:01:30,415 --> 00:01:33,335
the crusader who was cursed
to protect her companions

29
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:35,587
is the model crusader.

30
00:01:35,712 --> 00:01:37,080
Do you want to make
her death meaningless?

31
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,720
Actually,

32
00:01:45,495 --> 00:01:47,274
what's about the model crusader?

33
00:01:49,094 --> 00:01:53,094
How is it going?

34
00:02:06,575 --> 00:02:17,024
(KONOSUBA:
God's Blessing on This Wonderful World!)

35
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:42,120
(Episode 6: A Conclusion to
This Worthless Fight!)

36
00:03:24,175 --> 00:03:26,171
You're still alive?

37
00:03:27,236 --> 00:03:31,616
What? Was this headless knight
waiting for us all the time?

38
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,480
He didn't know that I dispelled
his curse easily after he left.

39
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:36,927
It's so funny.

40
00:03:37,003 --> 00:03:38,843
It's very funny, right?

41
00:03:39,335 --> 00:03:41,099
You know if you make me angry,

42
00:03:41,335 --> 00:03:44,576
I can kill everyone in your village.

43
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:47,104
You're a cocky undead.

44
00:03:47,424 --> 00:03:49,695
Do you think a beginner
adventurer's magic will work on me?

45
00:03:49,824 --> 00:03:51,115
Turn Undead!

46
00:03:51,914 --> 00:03:53,914
What?

47
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,120
Kazuma, it's weird. It doesn't work.

48
00:04:04,456 --> 00:04:06,432
No, it looked pretty effective.

49
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,962
You made him scream, right?

50
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,418
Are you really a beginner?

51
00:04:14,055 --> 00:04:17,175
Isn't this
a gathering place for beginners?

52
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:19,945
Forget it.

53
00:04:20,182 --> 00:04:23,210
I don't have to fight
with you all by myself.

54
00:04:25,552 --> 00:04:26,912
Undead Knights!

55
00:04:27,138 --> 00:04:29,778
Send them to the hell!

56
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,880
This guy must be frightened
because Aqua's magic is powerful.

57
00:04:36,012 --> 00:04:37,172
No.

58
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,897
What should the
boss fight first in a battle?

59
00:04:40,145 --> 00:04:43,985
-Let the small potatoes start first.
-Sacred Turn Undead!

60
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:51,235
My eyes.

61
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,768
Kazuma, what should I do?

62
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,744
My purification magic
doesn't work on him.

63
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,536
He screamed, right?

64
00:04:57,632 --> 00:04:59,008
I think it must be very effective.

65
00:05:02,256 --> 00:05:04,072
That's enough.

66
00:05:04,268 --> 00:05:08,032
Kill everyone in this village!

67
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,652
Go and call the priest.

68
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:14,692
Who's going to the church?
Please bring as much as holy water here.

69
00:05:15,976 --> 00:05:19,696
Come on, let me hear
your screams of despair.

70
00:05:26,095 --> 00:05:28,352
Why are they only chasing me?

71
00:05:28,448 --> 00:05:29,840
I'm a goddess.

72
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,920
I've been a good girl every day.

73
00:05:32,011 --> 00:05:33,171
It's not fair.

74
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,872
I've been a really good girl every day.

75
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:36,960
Why are they running over there?

76
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:42,387
Maybe they are instinctively
seeking salvation from a goddess.

77
00:05:43,602 --> 00:05:47,122
Megumin, can you attack this swarm
of undead with Explosion Magic?

78
00:05:47,852 --> 00:05:49,692
It's hard
when they're scattered like this.

79
00:05:51,587 --> 00:05:53,824
Kazuma.

80
00:05:59,723 --> 00:06:01,723
Fool, don't come over.

81
00:06:01,824 --> 00:06:04,280
If you go the other way,
I will treat you to dinner tonight.

82
00:06:04,352 --> 00:06:07,067
I'll treat you if you do something.

83
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:11,099
I can't get rid of them no matter
how many times I use Turn Undead.

84
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,656
Darn it, there are so many of them.

85
00:06:13,815 --> 00:06:14,975
Wait a minute.

86
00:06:15,872 --> 00:06:18,395
Megumin, please be ready
to use your magic.

87
00:06:18,955 --> 00:06:20,395
All right.

88
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,160
Aqua, come with me.

89
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:24,467
Why?

90
00:06:26,737 --> 00:06:29,577
Megumin, do it now.

91
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,560
What an ideal situation.

92
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,960
Thank you very much, Kazuma.

93
00:06:38,369 --> 00:06:39,929
My name is Megumin.

94
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,240
I'm the best wizard of the Red Devils.

95
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,628
I'm able to manipulate Explosion Magic.

96
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,160
Let me show all of you my power.

97
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,460
Explosion!

98
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:10,109
It seems that everyone who witnesses
the power of Explosion Magic

99
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:13,189
becomes speechless at the end.

100
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:18,831
This feeling is so amazing.

101
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,813
Do you need me to carry you?

102
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,096
Please.

103
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,720
That's great!
The crazy red devil did a good job.

104
00:07:30,823 --> 00:07:32,583
Although she seems crazy,

105
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,600
she pulls us through when it counts.

106
00:07:34,691 --> 00:07:36,851
You've impressed me, little girl.

107
00:07:36,962 --> 00:07:37,984
What?

108
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,320
I'm sorry. Please help me
remember those people's faces.

109
00:07:42,721 --> 00:07:44,161
I'll blow them all away next time.

110
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,480
That's interesting.

111
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,084
That's really interesting.

112
00:07:55,217 --> 00:07:58,638
I didn't expect you'd actually
annihilate my subordinates.

113
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,200
All right. I'll keep my promise.

114
00:08:01,578 --> 00:08:02,592
Kazuma,

115
00:08:04,162 --> 00:08:07,642
let me take you on personally.

116
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,440
Megumin is out of magic power.

117
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,649
Aqua's magic can't cause a fatal blow.

118
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,144
What should I do?

119
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,960
Don't be afraid.
The village's trump will be here soon.

120
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,604
It doesn't matter if you are
the leader of the Devil King.

121
00:08:22,212 --> 00:08:23,839
The trump card of this village?

122
00:08:24,196 --> 00:08:28,436
We can create a blind spot
if we all attack at once.

123
00:08:29,413 --> 00:08:30,573
Attack!

124
00:08:31,368 --> 00:08:33,648
It seems that you all can't wait to die.

125
00:08:38,445 --> 00:08:40,845
Stop, don't go over there!

126
00:09:02,272 --> 00:09:03,490
Who's the next?

127
00:09:05,084 --> 00:09:09,484
When Mitsurugi gets here,
he'll slay you in a single blow.

128
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,240
Mitsurugi?

129
00:09:11,796 --> 00:09:13,568
I stole and sold

130
00:09:16,352 --> 00:09:19,796
Mitsurugi's sword before.

131
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,400
Do you think you can hold out...

132
00:09:28,992 --> 00:09:31,585
This is bad.

133
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,400
...until the boy is here.

134
00:09:41,354 --> 00:09:42,486
How dare you...

135
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,040
How dare you attack them?

136
00:09:45,256 --> 00:09:47,736
Darkness, your sword is no match for him.

137
00:09:47,893 --> 00:09:50,413
As a knight who has
to protect the others,

138
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,906
I don't have any excuse to give in.

139
00:09:56,043 --> 00:10:01,443
You intend to use your strong
arms to lewdly torture me

140
00:10:01,696 --> 00:10:03,714
in front of everyone, right?

141
00:10:04,528 --> 00:10:06,366
Try it if you really can do so.

142
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:08,640
Show me what you've got!

143
00:10:08,756 --> 00:10:10,236
Don't have strange delusions!

144
00:10:10,322 --> 00:10:11,842
I will be misunderstood by everyone.

145
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,880
You're on, Verdia!

146
00:10:16,641 --> 00:10:20,041
It's inevitable that a holy knight
would be my opponent.

147
00:10:36,647 --> 00:10:37,847
Oh no!

148
00:10:37,949 --> 00:10:41,029
You even missed stationary targets?
How embarrassing.

149
00:10:41,115 --> 00:10:43,155
She's my ally.

150
00:10:43,865 --> 00:10:45,665
What a disappointment.

151
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:47,591
That's enough.

152
00:10:50,267 --> 00:10:52,931
Darkness!

153
00:11:01,763 --> 00:11:04,323
-Darkness, stand down.
-A crusader

154
00:11:04,653 --> 00:11:07,693
can't stand down when
protecting someone behind them.

155
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,114
I can't comply with your wish.

156
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,880
Not to mention...

157
00:11:12,657 --> 00:11:15,254
Not to mention, this headless knight

158
00:11:15,584 --> 00:11:16,800
is definitely my match.

159
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:17,952
What?

160
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,320
He's been shaving away at my armor

161
00:11:21,442 --> 00:11:23,202
a little at a time for a while now.

162
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,237
Instead of stripping me nude,

163
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:27,759
he's left parts of my armor intact,

164
00:11:28,037 --> 00:11:34,037
leaving me in a more provocative state
than nakedness to shame me in public.

165
00:11:34,596 --> 00:11:35,756
Come on.

166
00:11:35,908 --> 00:11:38,708
Is this the way that
Devil King's used to shame people?

167
00:11:38,853 --> 00:11:41,773
Just attack me. Come on.

168
00:11:42,449 --> 00:11:43,969
Please consider the time and place.

169
00:11:44,064 --> 00:11:46,103
You freaking hardcore pervert.

170
00:11:46,176 --> 00:11:49,656
Pervert. Darn it.

171
00:11:49,992 --> 00:11:53,232
Kazuma, you should consider
the time and place yourself.

172
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:58,046
It's difficult for me to face
the devil's attack in public.

173
00:12:00,154 --> 00:12:03,296
How can you attack me
together with the headless knight?

174
00:12:03,463 --> 00:12:05,503
What are you going to do with me?

175
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,800
I'm not doing anything.

176
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,560
I'm not doing anything.

177
00:12:08,683 --> 00:12:11,309
Oh, well. You bought me some time.

178
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:14,339
Create Water!

179
00:12:20,723 --> 00:12:24,185
I don't dislike being treated
in this way unexpectedly,

180
00:12:25,146 --> 00:12:26,761
but please consider the time and place.

181
00:12:26,848 --> 00:12:29,088
No. This is not a trick.

182
00:12:29,197 --> 00:12:31,757
I did it on purpose. Freeze!

183
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,520
I messed up.

184
00:12:35,076 --> 00:12:37,236
As long as I could
make you fail to dodge.

185
00:12:37,622 --> 00:12:39,302
This is my real intention.

186
00:12:39,584 --> 00:12:41,655
Steal!

187
00:12:46,323 --> 00:12:48,163
That wasn't a bad trick.

188
00:12:49,924 --> 00:12:51,456
This showed our difference in level.

189
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:55,025
All right. I'll put an end to this farce.

190
00:12:58,445 --> 00:12:59,456
Kazuma.

191
00:13:02,116 --> 00:13:03,516
Darkness!

192
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,636
Remember! Our opponent
is a headless knight.

193
00:13:10,975 --> 00:13:14,215
What was his weakness in RPG?

194
00:13:14,474 --> 00:13:16,114
Observe him carefully.

195
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,546
Why was he able to
dodge my water so adeptly?

196
00:13:20,126 --> 00:13:21,446
The weakness of the headless knight is...

197
00:13:21,805 --> 00:13:23,647
The weakness of the undead monster is...

198
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,113
As a former knight, I give my thanks
to the Devil King,

199
00:13:33,247 --> 00:13:36,167
and the false god for this chance
to have a bout with you.

200
00:13:36,576 --> 00:13:40,220
Farewell, brave yet foolish crusader.

201
00:13:41,523 --> 00:13:44,123
Create Water!

202
00:13:45,448 --> 00:13:47,488
What are you trying to do, scoundrel?

203
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,000
It's water!

204
00:13:50,295 --> 00:13:52,092
Create Water!

205
00:13:52,204 --> 00:13:54,604
Stop those attacks!

206
00:13:54,723 --> 00:13:56,283
Create Water!

207
00:13:56,448 --> 00:13:58,059
Create Water!

208
00:14:00,248 --> 00:14:01,608
You guys!

209
00:14:01,865 --> 00:14:03,136
Hit him!

210
00:14:03,283 --> 00:14:05,323
Darn it! I'm going to run out of magic.

211
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,629
What happened?

212
00:14:07,963 --> 00:14:09,963
Kazuma, what are you doing?

213
00:14:10,272 --> 00:14:11,283
Are you an idiot?

214
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,746
What the hell!

215
00:14:13,231 --> 00:14:15,071
The weakness
of the headless knight is water.

216
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,060
Even a lame goddess like you
must be able to use a water spell.

217
00:14:18,723 --> 00:14:21,696
Rude guy, you will deserve
for what you've done sooner or later.

218
00:14:21,866 --> 00:14:23,946
I can even cause flood by using my magic.

219
00:14:24,043 --> 00:14:25,123
Are you sure?

220
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:30,716
Apologize for calling
a water goddess as a "lame goddess".

221
00:14:30,963 --> 00:14:32,803
I'll apologize later as you wish.

222
00:14:32,928 --> 00:14:34,800
Hurry up and do it, useless goddess.

223
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:37,679
You just called me a useless goddess.

224
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,280
Just wait and watch.

225
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,740
I'll show you
the real power of a goddess.

226
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,960
All my followers in this world,

227
00:14:46,363 --> 00:14:48,743
the goddess water Aqua commands you.

228
00:14:51,008 --> 00:14:52,064
This is...

229
00:14:52,376 --> 00:14:55,136
Answer my request, my prayer...

230
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,677
and show the world your power.

231
00:14:57,924 --> 00:14:58,924
Oh, no.

232
00:15:01,203 --> 00:15:03,803
Let go of me, crazy knight.

233
00:15:03,938 --> 00:15:05,698
How abusive.

234
00:15:06,307 --> 00:15:09,187
Sacred Create Water!

235
00:15:13,424 --> 00:15:15,304
It's water.

236
00:15:17,435 --> 00:15:19,875
All right, that's enough.

237
00:15:39,203 --> 00:15:40,992
What are you thinking?

238
00:15:41,266 --> 00:15:42,336
Are you an idiot?

239
00:15:42,485 --> 00:15:44,445
Are you out of your mind?

240
00:15:45,338 --> 00:15:46,809
Now is your chance, Kazuma.

241
00:15:48,036 --> 00:15:50,476
This time I'll steal your weapon for sure.

242
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,499
I may be weakened now,

243
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,688
but a beginner adventurer with steal skill

244
00:15:54,843 --> 00:15:57,283
can't steal my weapon.

245
00:15:58,819 --> 00:16:01,019
I'll end this once and for all.

246
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:06,153
Steal!

247
00:16:12,236 --> 00:16:13,676
That...

248
00:16:13,763 --> 00:16:14,803
Well...

249
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,310
Hey guys,

250
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,557
-let's play football.
-Football?

251
00:16:25,728 --> 00:16:27,616
Football is...

252
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:32,370
a game that you handle the ball
with only feet but not hands.

253
00:16:32,512 --> 00:16:33,672
Only feet?

254
00:16:33,861 --> 00:16:36,800
Wait, stop it.

255
00:16:36,966 --> 00:16:39,726
It hurts. Stop it.

256
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,120
We should be safe now as he's so weak.

257
00:16:43,967 --> 00:16:45,647
Just kill him quick.

258
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,206
Yes, Aqua.

259
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,760
Leave it to me.

260
00:16:49,962 --> 00:16:50,976
Just do it.

261
00:16:57,564 --> 00:16:59,884
Sacred Turn Undead.

262
00:17:03,468 --> 00:17:04,668
Wait a minute.

263
00:17:28,804 --> 00:17:31,301
Darkness, what are you doing?

264
00:17:32,108 --> 00:17:33,721
I'm praying.

265
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:41,910
Sedol, the huge liar who said
he was brawny in his armour.

266
00:17:42,459 --> 00:17:45,390
Besides, Heinz asked me to fan
him with my huge sword.

267
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:48,252
He even teased me, saying,
"You can hit me with it if you want,"

268
00:17:48,403 --> 00:17:50,024
"but only if you can."

269
00:17:50,464 --> 00:17:54,127
Galil, who let me join
his team for only a single day,

270
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:59,210
and screamed at me, saying, "Why do
you charge into swarms of monster?"

271
00:18:00,382 --> 00:18:03,502
They were all killed
by the headless knight.

272
00:18:04,643 --> 00:18:09,363
If I could see them again,
I'd love to have a drink with them.

273
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:18,559
It actually bothers you that
your sword always misses target?

274
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,308
I'm sorry.

275
00:18:21,849 --> 00:18:23,369
I'll treat you next time.

276
00:18:23,643 --> 00:18:26,443
What? You all are still alive?

277
00:18:29,056 --> 00:18:30,456
For someone as great as me,

278
00:18:30,562 --> 00:18:33,632
reviving newly-fallen
adventurers is just a piece of cake.

279
00:18:33,758 --> 00:18:34,848
Dither lection!

280
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,704
Now you can drink with them together.

281
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,120
Darkness has a lot
to deal with, doesn't she?

282
00:18:41,216 --> 00:18:42,403
Shh! She'll hear you.

283
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,370
I want to die.

284
00:18:45,004 --> 00:18:46,324
Don't hold back.

285
00:18:46,572 --> 00:18:49,692
We'll keep criticizing her
like this for at least three days.

286
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:55,883
This isn't the kind
of shameful abuse I wanted.

287
00:18:58,327 --> 00:19:01,047
URGENT MISSION. KILL THE HEADLESS KNIGHT.
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

288
00:19:01,454 --> 00:19:04,054
Konosuba!

289
00:19:06,034 --> 00:19:07,114
THE NEXT DAY

290
00:19:07,964 --> 00:19:10,170
Things somehow works out this time,

291
00:19:10,763 --> 00:19:14,243
but I think I'll live a life of
leisure, without danger from now on.

292
00:19:15,243 --> 00:19:17,083
Kazuma, I've been waiting for you.

293
00:19:17,248 --> 00:19:18,302
Listen to me.

294
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:20,364
Darkness said that I'm
too young to have a drink.

295
00:19:20,443 --> 00:19:21,883
She's very stingy.

296
00:19:22,186 --> 00:19:24,386
Wait a minute. It's not
because of this reason.

297
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,580
You're late.

298
00:19:28,427 --> 00:19:30,667
Obviously, she's drunk.

299
00:19:30,894 --> 00:19:33,888
Kazuma, I've been waiting for you.

300
00:19:34,043 --> 00:19:38,452
Actually, I have a special reward
for you and your team.

301
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:40,059
Really?

302
00:19:42,087 --> 00:19:44,407
Why only us?

303
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,255
You and your team
defeated the Devil King's army.

304
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:51,373
I believed in the radiance
within you from the very start.

305
00:19:52,051 --> 00:19:53,809
The radiance within me?

306
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,240
A light that shines on the gate of hell.

307
00:19:57,889 --> 00:19:59,809
There may have an old legend like that.

308
00:20:00,106 --> 00:20:02,096
That's right. If you weren't there,

309
00:20:02,174 --> 00:20:04,409
how could the
headless knight being defeated?

310
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:07,643
Kazuma, Kazuma!

311
00:20:08,043 --> 00:20:10,843
Kazuma, Kazuma!

312
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,320
-Kazuma, Kazuma!
-I'm not really used to this,

313
00:20:13,696 --> 00:20:14,936
but this feeling is so good.

314
00:20:16,846 --> 00:20:20,219
In recognition of
Sato Kazuma's achievement,

315
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,656
I award you 300 million eris.

316
00:20:23,454 --> 00:20:25,564
300 million?

317
00:20:25,696 --> 00:20:27,146
Treat me, Kazuma.

318
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:29,345
Kazuma, treat me.

319
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:30,705
Group meeting.

320
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,200
I have something to tell all of you.

321
00:20:33,614 --> 00:20:36,557
We won thanks to my abilities,
so we should go 90/10.

322
00:20:36,714 --> 00:20:38,354
Now that we acquired great wealth,

323
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:41,604
I want to live a
leisurely and peaceful life.

324
00:20:41,803 --> 00:20:43,136
-Wait a minute.
-I won't wait.

325
00:20:43,229 --> 00:20:45,591
It's a big problem for me if I can't
fight strong enemies anymore.

326
00:20:45,664 --> 00:20:47,365
-It's not a problem.
-It bothers me too.

327
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,016
I want to follow Kazuma
to defeat the Devil King,

328
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:52,224
and earn the title of
the strongest magician.

329
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:54,656
-You won't earn it.
-Don't you want to become a Neet?

330
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,600
No. Because I'm not a Neet!

331
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,048
I won't be able to go home.

332
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,800
I've already made up my mind.

333
00:20:59,872 --> 00:21:00,960
It's a useless, useless goddess.

334
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:02,812
-Useless goddess
-Mr. Kazuma.

335
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,001
Is it a check? It's a check, right?

336
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:12,547
In fact, the flood of water
that Aqua summoned

337
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:15,864
caused huge damage to the outer walls.

338
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:19,168
Defeating a leader of Devil King's army
is a big accomplishment.

339
00:21:19,328 --> 00:21:21,683
So, you all don't have to pay the
full amount of compensation.

340
00:21:21,771 --> 00:21:24,651
I just ask you to pay
a portion of the cost.

341
00:21:24,754 --> 00:21:25,824
Wait a minute.

342
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,692
The reward is 300 million,

343
00:21:28,003 --> 00:21:31,363
but the amount of
compensation is 340 million.

344
00:21:31,603 --> 00:21:36,403
Our bloody journey of magic
has just begun.

345
00:21:36,836 --> 00:21:39,956
Let's take on a profitable mission
to defeat strong enemy tomorrow.

346
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:43,006
We can split the debt into equal parts.

347
00:21:44,028 --> 00:21:46,137
Am I really going to spend my entire life

348
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:48,603
in this irrational world
with these hopeless allies?

349
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:51,757
I close my eyes quietly

350
00:21:52,191 --> 00:21:54,471
and make up my mind
to defeat the Devil King,

351
00:21:55,622 --> 00:21:59,262
so that I can break away
from this hopeless world.

352
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:39,870

in This Freezing Season!)
