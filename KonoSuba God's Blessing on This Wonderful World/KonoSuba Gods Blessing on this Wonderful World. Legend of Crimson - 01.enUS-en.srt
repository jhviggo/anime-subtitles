00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,700
Capture Quest

2
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,700
Collect Migrating Tuna

3
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,160
Quest Failed

4
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,160
Did you hear? Starting next year,
there won't be any more tuna.

5
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,920
Some crazy mage screwed
up the entire landscape.

6
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,370
I always look forward to tuna season...

7
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,200
Zero points.

8
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,330
What?! Come on, today's Explosion magic
was worth at least worth 120 points!

9
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,350
It was worth nothing,
and that's being generous!

10
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,100
—sion!

11
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,360
You let loose an Explosion
because you thought

12
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,100
a monster was going to take our tuna?!

13
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,250
What's the point if you blow up the fish, too?!

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,900
—sion!

15
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,850
Would it kill you to learn some
other advanced magic already?!

16
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,270
Kazuma, that's going too far.

17
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,770
You reek of fish.

18
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,780
As soon as we got on the water,
they were gnawing on you!

19
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,650
Hey, are we in debt again now?

20
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:42,850
What are we gonna do?!

21
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,910
I don't wanna work part-time anymore!

22
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,330
The arch priest who makes everything a pain.

23
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,340
The arch wizard who makes
everything go to waste.

24
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,340
And the crusader who makes
everything smell like wild game.

25
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,300
It seems my adventure with these useless
comrades is headed for its climax!

26
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,600
Isn't stealing underwear
the only thing he's good at?

27
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,780
He's the kind of scumbag who'd dropkick
a woman without a second thought!

28
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,370
Scumzuma! Scumzuma! Scumzuma!

29
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,180
If this was an anime or a video game,

30
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,860
I'd probably have some
romantic interests by now...

31
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,620
Hey, it's Yunyun.
What's got you so looking so intense?

32
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,650
K-Kazuma-san...

33
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,440
Uh, yeah?

34
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,370
I... I...

35
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,880
I want to have your baby!

36
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,820
And thus begins my popular phase!

37
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,140
God's Blessing on this Wonderful World!
Legend of Crimson

38
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,140
The Movie

39
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:49,810
Ow!

40
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,020
Why'd you scratch me?!

41
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,300
Could you say that again for me?

42
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,280
I-I said I want to have a baby with you!

43
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,030
I've always wanted to start with a daughter...

44
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,490
N-No! The first child has to be a boy!

45
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,010
I thought she was on the meek side,

46
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,420
but she actually knows how to speak her mind!

47
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,540
What is wrong with you, Yunyun?!

48
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,300
Stop! Chomusuke!

49
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,300
Do you realize what kind of man he is?!

50
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,860
You need to snap out of it!

51
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,280
What in the world's gotten into you?

52
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,760
If Kazuma and I don't have a baby,
the world will... And the Devil King...

53
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,260
The Devil King?

54
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,080
I see. The fate of the world, huh?

55
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,390
It's all right, dear. You can leave
the world and the Devil King to me.

56
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,040
Once we have this baby,

57
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,710
the Devil King will be dealt with
and the world saved, right?

58
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,900
How could I possibly refuse someone in need?

59
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,450
B-But you always try to get out
of monster extermination quests!

60
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,530
Seriously!

61
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,290
Shut it!

62
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:51,870
Keep your noses out of our
relationship, got it?!

63
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,670
I'm finally in my popular phase! So buzz off!

64
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,890
He's mad at us?

65
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,590
But if an acquaintance of mine is
getting involved with a shady guy,

66
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,090
it's only natural that I'd speak up!

67
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,690
C-Calm down, everyone!

68
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,440
I'm sorry! This is my fault!
Please, just calm down!

69
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,210
Wonderful! Magnificent!

70
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,620
For the first time ever,
I'm glad I came to this world!

71
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,920
And what is with you two?
Do you secretly like me or something?

72
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,040
Are you jealous because of my
romantic developments with Yunyun?

73
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,610
Then you should've just
said so, you tsundere duo!

74
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,450
How dare you?!

75
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,530
Megumin, the Crimson Demon Village...

76
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,780
Why would anyone be jealous about that?!

77
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,780
The Crimson Demon Village
is going to be wiped out!

78
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,770
You must think—

79
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,910
KONOSUBA!

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,240
Your tea.

81
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,580
Th-Thank you...

82
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,000
Now, what exactly is going on?

83
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,150
I got this letter from my father...

84
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,820
"By the time you receive this letter,

85
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,210
I will surely have passed on."

86
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,750
It says the Crimson Demon Village is
under attack by the Devil King's forces.

87
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,730
"A fortune-teller saw a future where
the village would be devastated...

88
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:04,580
But they also saw a light of hope.

89
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,380
That light was the only survivor of
the Crimson Demons, Yunyun."

90
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,420
How is she the only survivor?

91
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,970
Forget that, just keep reading!

92
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,710
But what happened to me?!

93
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,470
"As the only survivor,

94
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:22,340
she would meet a certain man
in the town of beginners.

95
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,940
This man, though unremarkable
and with no special power,

96
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,400
will become her spouse."

97
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,760
Why'd you look at me after reading that?

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,500
And was that seriously all it
took to convince you it was me?!

99
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,470
"Then, as time passes,

100
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:40,440
the son born to her and this
man would go on a journey.

101
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,870
But the boy did not know...

102
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,950
that he would be the one to avenge
his clan and slay the Devil King..."

103
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,120
O-Our little boy's gonna beat the Devil King?!

104
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,390
Wait a second, Kazuma!

105
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,210
Hey, that doesn't work for me!

106
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,120
That seriously isn't gonna cut it!

107
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,300
I can't wait that long!

108
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,680
I want the Devil King defeated
as soon as possible!

109
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,560
Do you really expect me to
wait until your kid grows up?!

110
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,210
Can't we wrap this up in three years or so?

111
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,010
Because if not, then I want you
to forget about this prophecy!

112
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,780
You seriously want a toddler
to take on the Devil King?

113
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:16,720
Our village has very skilled
fortune-tellers. So...

114
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:20,170
I understand. In that case,
you can count on me.

115
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,770
It's to save the world. It must be done.

116
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,570
I-I can't believe you!

117
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:27,600
You're usually so wishy-washy!
Why the sudden streak of manliness?!

118
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,400
Shut up! Stop talking, boobs!

119
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,190
"Heroic Tales of the
Crimson Demons, Chapter 1."

120
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,890
Boobs?!

121
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,530
It's just having a kid!
Or is that a crime now?!

122
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,530
"Written by Arue."

123
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,970
Arue, you dummy!

124
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,790
Wait, what does that mean?! Explain!

125
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,440
What happens to my kid?! What do I do?!

126
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,800
Do I strip here? Or in my room?!

127
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,050
Arue is a classmate of ours from the
village who wants to be an author.

128
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,600
So it was just a story, then...

129
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,180
But what about that first letter?

130
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,930
I believe this one is genuine.

131
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,340
The Crimson Demons have
been a thorn in the side

132
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,490
of the Devil King's army for a long time.

133
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,170
Wait, hold up! What do I do about
my masculine obligation now?!

134
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,020
Hey, Yunyun?

135
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,600
Aren't we supposed to start a
bittersweet relationship now?

136
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,830
You are not!

137
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,340
Megumin, why are you so calm about this?

138
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,890
Aren't you worried about
your family and classmates?

139
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,330
Th-That's right!

140
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,390
What should we do, Megumin?!

141
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,830
The Crimson Demons are feared
by the Devil King for a reason.

142
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,100
I have a hard time believing our
village will go down without a fight.

143
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:32,240
Besides, as long as the chief's
daughter, Yunyun, is safe,

144
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,140
we won't die out, even if
the village is destroyed.

145
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,540
So we need only think of it in these terms:

146
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,510
"Our friends from the village will
always live on... in our hearts."

147
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,120
Megumin, you monster!

148
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,530
KONOSU—bahck!

149
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,780
I am so, so sorry!

150
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,830
H-Hey, it's no big deal.

151
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,410
But what are you gonna do?

152
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,390
Well, I think I'll head back to the village.

153
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:03,040
I have... f-friends... there.

154
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,290
She sure hesitated to use
the word "friends" there.

155
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,130
Everyone, if you'll excuse me.

156
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,820
Teleporting?

157
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,070
You need me to send you near
the Crimson Demon Village, then?

158
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,060
Yeah, the tsundere here feels homesick.

159
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,340
Wh-Who are you calling a tsundere?!

160
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,280
Well, look who it is!

161
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,920
The man with the easiest-to-level class,

162
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,190
who somehow still manages
to be under-leveled!

163
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,160
The girl who's been useless as of late,
except at calling in familial favors!

164
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,970
The small-time priest who's
overflowing with obnoxious light,

165
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,800
and the girl from the joke race who
can only use joke magic! Welcome, all!

166
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,750
I was actually hoping to run into you.

167
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,300
I've drawn up our little contract.

168
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,500
You're really gonna go
through with this, right?

169
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,730
But of course!

170
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:06,250
I'll buy the rights to Satou Kazuma's intellectual
property library for 300 million eris.

171
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,560
O-Okay!

172
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,980
That said, my debt-ridden fellow,
the deal hasn't been completed yet.

173
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,170
Here you are.

174
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:11,980
Drink up.

175
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:17,090
I haven't settled on a craftsman to
build the products you've dreamed up.

176
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,660
Hey, man!

177
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:23,000
Hands off the merchandise,
you walking blight!

178
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,560
Excuse me?! I thought the
customer was always right!

179
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,020
And I'm a goddess, so I'm extra right!

180
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,880
So show me the respect a goddess deserves!

181
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,660
How dare you try and lecture me

182
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,350
after damaging my merchandise,
you poverty-stricken goddess?!

183
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,010
Wiz, transport them out of here immediately!

184
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,510
So irritating!

185
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:42,770
Okay, I'll send you to the vicinity
of the Crimson Demon Village now.

186
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,650
I wish you a wonderful
journey and experience.

187
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,910
Teleport!

188
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,200
We're off!

189
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,030
What is it?

190
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,750
Isn't the Crimson Demon Village near...

191
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:13,050
Emergency quest!!

192
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:13,050
Survive! Defend yourselves!!

193
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:20,550
Where the hell did you teleport us, Wiz?!

194
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,370
Hold it right there!

195
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,810
Hey there, handsome!
Wanna have some fun with me?

196
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,320
Why is there a mob of lady orcs?!

197
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,080
Kazuma, there aren't any
male orcs left in the world!

198
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,320
They were wiped out ages ago!

199
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,370
And on the rare occasion that one is born,

200
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,920
they're usually overworked by the females
and die before they can fully mature!

201
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,790
The surviving female orcs are known
for capturing males of other races,

202
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,850
dragging them back to their communities,
and doing all kinds of crazy stuff to them!

203
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,760
They're natural-born predators of men!

204
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,660
Come spend a few days in our village
and you'll have a harem, baby!

205
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,100
We'll give you a taste of heaven on earth!

206
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,680
No, thank you!

207
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,770
I just turned down a lady's
invitation for the first time!

208
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,890
Wait! Orcs are supposed to be the
natural predators of lady knights!

209
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:16,300
Male orcs! Renowned for their libido,
attacking women the second they see them!

210
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,500
They're all dead.

211
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,240
Darkness!

212
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,280
I'm gonna have your babies!

213
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,970
No, me!

214
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:31,050
I think I'd like a son first!
And then 60 boys, and 40 girls!

215
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,700
We'll move into a white house by the sea

216
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,920
and spend every day all over each other!

217
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:39,170
Let me go! I just wanna go home!

218
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,180
Kazuma!

219
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,190
Okay, this won't take long!
Just close your eyes!

220
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:51,690
Save me, Megumin! Do the thing!
The thing you always do!

221
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,940
I can't use it at this range!

222
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,570
Darkness, stop being depressed!

223
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,820
Can we talk?! Let's talk!

224
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,090
Pillow talk?! I'd love to!

225
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:05,320
Go ahead and tell me all the dirtiest
fantasies you've kept bottled up!

226
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,330
P-Please stop!

227
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:13,490
Wait, your name! I don't even
know your name or age yet!

228
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,060
This might be my first time!

229
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,170
Can we maybe start with introductions?!

230
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,340
I'm Satou Kazuma!

231
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:24,090
I'm Swatti the orc, and
I'm a sweet 16-year-old!

232
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,960
Now, how about you introduce me
to what you've got down here?

233
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,070
Let me meet your big little boy!

234
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,270
But he's so shy!

235
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,730
We made our introductions, so could
we call it a wrap for today?!

236
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:41,240
Aqua! Aqua, save me!

237
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,240
Bottomless Swamp!

238
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,490
Orcs who live near the Crimson Demon Village!

239
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,580
I'm willing to overlook this
because we're neighbors!

240
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,500
Now, begone!

241
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,420
Yunyun! It's Yunyun!

242
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,180
Kazuma!

243
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,630
Kazuma-san!

244
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,670
Yunyun! Oh, Yunyun!

245
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,020
Thank you so much!

246
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,490
It's all right, don't worry.

247
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:19,020
Um... Y-You're covering my robe in snot!

248
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:25,030
Quest Failed

249
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:25,030
Kazuma was psychologically scarred

250
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,030
Orc (♀)

251
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,580
There, there.
That was scary, wasn't it, Kazuma?

252
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,270
You're okay now, though. It's all right.

253
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,590
What exactly happened
while I was passed out?

254
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,260
We only just started this journey.

255
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,130
I am so grateful, Yunyun.

256
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:46,340
To be specific, from now on, if anyone
asks me, "Who do you look up to?"

257
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:49,270
I'm going to answer "Yunyun!" right away.

258
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,050
P-Please don't do that!

259
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,590
It almost sounds sarcastic!

260
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:56,230
What are you all doing here, anyway?

261
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:59,600
Megumin, were you worried
about the village after all?

262
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,150
I just remembered some
business I had back home.

263
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,800
You just won't admit it!

264
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,330
You really are worried about everyone!

265
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,410
Aren't you?

266
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,910
Kazuma, would you like to hear an
embarrassing secret about Yunyun?

267
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:18,960
We Crimson Demons are born with
a tattoo somewhere on our bodies.

268
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,880
And in the case of Yunyun,
if you can believe it...

269
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,560
Hey, cut it out!

270
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,090
How do you even know where my tattoo is?!

271
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:30,190
You can't use your joke Explosion
magic around here, anyway!

272
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,890
So I can easily restrain you if I have to!

273
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,500
Aqua, I need support magic.

274
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,590
I think this girl needs to
be taught a painful lesson.

275
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,560
Y-You coward!
You never play fair, Megumin!

276
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,150
Never once, ever!

277
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:46,400
Hey, over here! I hear human voices!

278
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,490
Do you suppose they're with
the Devil King's army?

279
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,910
This is because of your short
temper and shouting, Yunyun!

280
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,620
But Megumin, you've got
a shorter fuse than me!

281
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,270
Say that again!

282
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:05,830
Enough, you two!
If you're too loud, they'll find us.

283
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:08,170
Kazuma, say something!

284
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:11,680
Hey, who gives a damn?!
Tell me where Yunyun's tattoo is!

285
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,930
Found them! They're over here!
They were hiding in the bushes!

286
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:18,340
What in the world is wrong with you?!

287
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,690
There's even some Crimson Demon brats!

288
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,880
Well, if it isn't a bunch of discount,
wannabe demons!

289
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,060
Oh, my!

290
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,690
What might a bunch of ogre-looking wash-outs

291
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,980
who couldn't even cut it as
lesser demons want with us?

292
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,380
Look, I'll let you walk away
this one time, so scram.

293
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,590
Go on, get!

294
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,710
Hey, priest lady, what gives?

295
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:57,160
The Crimson Demons put us through hell,
and you've got two of them!

296
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,940
You really think we're
gonna just let them walk?!

297
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,680
I seem to recall you saying
my magic is a joke.

298
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,360
Perhaps I should remind you
of just how serious it can be.

299
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:12,860
W-Wait a second... You're not gonna...

300
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,370
Explosion!

301
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,630
Did you see that?!
My ultimate spell, Explosion magic!

302
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:29,140
Well, would you still call that a joke spell?!

303
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:32,630
How about it, Kazuma?!
What score would you give that Explosion?!

304
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,780
You get negative 90 points!

305
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:38,260
What now?! Because we're in no
condition to carry you away now!

306
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,310
H-H-Holy crap, that was scary...

307
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,190
But now my reinforcements are here.

308
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,710
Say your prayers, people!

309
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,660
Time to cry and beg for mercy,
not that it's gonna help!

310
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,100
Not even a scrap of flesh will remain!

311
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,790
The dark flame born from my
ebon heart will scorch you!

312
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:10,550
Slumber for eternity in the
frozen embrace of my ice!

313
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:14,050
I... kill... you.

314
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,800
Now... it is born!

315
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,070
Aw, crap!

316
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,600
Light of Saber!

317
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,030
Light of Saber!

318
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,400
...Saber!

319
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,310
...ber!

320
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:36,030
Wait, what happened to the dark
flames and frozen embraces?

321
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,820
No doubt about it, though.

322
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,180
Those red eyes...

323
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,580
We heard an explosion in the distance...

324
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,830
and here we find Megumin and Yunyun.

325
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,800
We were told that the village
might be in danger.

326
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:56,220
I'm curious, Megumin. Are these
people your adventuring party?

327
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,910
I am called Bukkororii!

328
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,300
The son of the foremost cobbler
among the Crimson Demons!

329
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,690
Arch wizard, and wielder of advanced magic!

330
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:13,120
Hey there. I'm called Satou Kazuma.

331
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,650
From my home in Axel,
I have mastered countless skills

332
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:18,200
and used them to battle
the Devil King's generals.

333
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,950
No outsider has been able to
properly return a greeting before!

334
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,810
Megumin, your friends seem really nice.

335
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,670
The village is still some distance away.
Let us take you there.

336
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,210
Teleport!

337
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,340
Welcome to the
Crimson Demon Village, outsiders.

338
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,590
And it's good to have you
back, Megumin, Yunyun.

339
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,870
D-Dad? Could you repeat that?

340
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,620
That was just me sending you an update!

341
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,500
Uh, sir, what exactly do you mean?

342
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,880
But it said, "By the time you receive
this letter, I will surely have passed on."

343
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,230
That's the traditional Crimson Demon greeting!

344
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,590
But you said you wouldn't be able
to destroy the Devil King's fortress!

345
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,530
Yeah.

346
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:25,160
The village can't decide whether to destroy
it or leave it as a tourist attraction.

347
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:29,310
Yunyun, can I punch your dad in the face?

348
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,680
Go ahead.

349
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,690
Yunyun?!

350
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,690
If the Devil King's army is nearby,
then is a general...

351
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,630
Sure, there's one with them.
Strong with magic, I believe.

352
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,190
Should be showing up anytime now.

353
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,640
Devil King Army alert.

354
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,840
Anyone available, please assemble
at the entrance to the village.

355
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,870
The enemy force numbers around 1,000.

356
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,370
A thousand?!

357
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,880
Devil King Forces Approaching!

358
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,180
Sylvia-sama! Retreat!

359
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,630
You have to survive,
even if the rest of us don't!

360
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:04,740
Damn it! Damn it!
If we could just get close enough—

361
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,670
I said we never should've
attacked the Crimson Demons!

362
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,890
Nobody ever listens to me!

363
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,570
Suck on this boulder!

364
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,150
Holy crap...

365
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,530
This is... so impressive, it's freaky, honestly.

366
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,210
What do you think?

367
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:29,040
We've been wondering if the light
show might attract tourists!

368
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,790
KONOSUBA...

369
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,660
So, those are real Crimson Demons, huh?

370
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,200
When you put it that way, it makes
it sound like you know a fake one.

371
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,240
Why don't you explain exactly
what you mean by that?

372
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,680
Hey, Megumin, is that your stable?

373
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,290
That's not a stable. It's the house.

374
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,320
Is this your little sister, Megumin?

375
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,280
She's pretty cute!

376
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,120
It's like having a mini Megumin!

377
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,830
Hey, want some candy?

378
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:19,590
I'm back, Komekko.

379
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:28,100
Dad! Megumin's back, and she's snared a man!

380
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,600
Hey, little missy!
Could we perhaps discuss this?!

381
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,100
KONOSUBA!

382
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,260
What do I do?

383
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,110
The one who's supposed to smooth
a situation like this over is...

384
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:52,580
Damn you!

385
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,300
Look at this!

386
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,670
See how the mug moves around
once I've flipped it over?

387
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:02,200
Oh, wow! How'd you do it?!
How are you doing that?

388
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,990
It's a magnet!
It must be some kind of magnet!

389
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,760
No, there are no magnets or magic involved!

390
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:06,850
So...

391
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,760
What exactly is the nature of your
relationship with our daughter?

392
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,770
Like I've been saying, we're just frie—

393
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,640
Honey!

394
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,300
Stop! No more flipping
the table and breaking it!

395
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:26,780
We don't have that kind of money! Stop!

396
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:38,830
Forgive me. I lost my composure.

397
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:43,460
It's just that you kept insisting so
shamelessly that you're only friends...

398
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,050
This isn't much, but here...

399
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,060
Dear, I believe Kazuma-san
meant to give this to me.

400
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,160
Oh, really? After all that bluster just now,

401
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:01,830
you're being polite enough
to call him Kazuma-san?

402
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:04,230
You really shouldn't. It's embarrassing.

403
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,860
This is going to be our dinner tonight.

404
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,380
I'm not going to let you
snack on it with your booze.

405
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,950
Ma'am, those are just dumplings...

406
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:14,080
They don't make much of
a snack, let alone a meal.

407
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,940
Hey, is this the kind of food
that actually fills you up,

408
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,580
instead of the watery rice
porridge we usually eat?!

409
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,260
It really isn't much, but here...

410
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,700
We're so glad to have you, Kazuma-san!

411
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,220
Dear, bring out some of the good tea!

412
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,850
We only have one type of tea, honey.

413
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,600
KONOSUBA!

414
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,550
I don't care what you feed us!
You can't have Komekko!

415
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:43,580
I don't want her!
That's not what I'm trying to do!

416
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,470
Komekko, you can have the rest.

417
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,610
I can?! Yay!

418
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:51,490
You seem nice enough, so I won't object...

419
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,430
But I really think you should pay off
your debts before taking in our daughter.

420
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,730
I just told you that we're only friends!

421
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,920
But in her letters...

422
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,750
Can I ask you what she wrote, exactly?

423
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,130
Well, for starters...

424
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,440
You left her covered in a sticky
fluid and made sport of her.

425
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,900
When she depleted her magic power,

426
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,660
you carried her on your back while
pressing her chest against you.

427
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,400
You bathed together.

428
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,380
As she napped innocently on the sofa,

429
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:26,000
you stared up her skirt while sitting
across from her and holding your knees.

430
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,480
You feed Chomusuke and say,

431
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,440
"This is what I want. Bring me more of this!
Then I'll feed you even more!"

432
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,260
while showing her some underwear...

433
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:38,040
I am so sorry!

434
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,540
But in spite of it all, she says
you're an important friend...

435
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,050
And that even if you're a debt-ridden,

436
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:48,760
perverted foul-mouth
without a lick of sense,

437
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,550
you'd die without her, so she'll stay with you.

438
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:57,230
Considering she said all that, I'm sure
there's more to you than it seems.

439
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,470
There are parts of that I'd argue against,

440
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:04,060
but being called an important
friend does make me kind of happy.

441
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,680
Since you're in the same party as her,

442
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,820
we'd love to help you out...

443
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,570
No, it's all right! I'm on the verge
of making a fair bit of money.

444
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:15,490
Oh? Exactly how much are we talking?

445
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,620
I think it was 300 million eris.

446
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,580
300 million?!

447
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:22,120
Huh? Should I have not said that?

448
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,370
I've got a great idea, Kazuma-san!
You should spend the night here!

449
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:27,780
As my daughter's comrade
and friend, it's only natural!

450
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,700
I mean, as an adventurer, you don't
have a home of your own, right?!

451
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,510
N-No, I actually have a mansion in Axel...

452
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,010
Mansion?!

453
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,550
The second I brought up the
mansion and the 300 million,

454
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,270
the reception got a lot warmer...

455
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,370
But this place seems pretty safe,

456
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:54,170
so once Megumin's rested up,
we should get out of here

457
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:55,880
before we get caught up in any trouble.

458
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,360
How can you suggest such a thing?!

459
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,170
Don't you care what happens
to your daughter?!

460
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,430
It's perfectly fine.
She's old enough to get married,

461
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:16,620
and Kazuma-san is an adult
with good judgment.

462
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,890
Even if something were to happen...

463
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:19,700
What are you—

464
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,970
Sleep.

465
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,520
She actually did it!

466
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,010
Is this...

467
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:31,110
Oh, Kazuma-san. All done with the bath?

468
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,340
Everyone's already asleep,

469
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,610
so would you help me move
them into their rooms?

470
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:43,780
Well, enjoy yourselves!

471
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,910
This is no time to be enchanted!

472
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:57,510
I think those orcs might
have traumatized me...

473
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:02,260
I'm gonna need some emotional care from
those nice succubi when I get back to Axel.

474
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,120
Lock.

475
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,760
I know I slipped up by talking
about the money that was coming in,

476
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,790
but this lady is pretty intense...

477
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,530
Hang on a sec.

478
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:21,140
Aqua got hammered and fell asleep,

479
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,670
and Hyoizaburo-san and Darkness
were both put to sleep by her mom!

480
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,540
The door's been locked
from outside with magic!

481
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,580
No one can get in here, and I can't get out!

482
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,080
What a setup!

483
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,870
There's only one futon. It's spring,
but nights are still cold.

484
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:36,030
If I sleep without any cover,
I might get sick.

485
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,710
And what if it develops into pneumonia?

486
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:44,610
Given these factors, there should be no
problem with me sleeping next to Megumin.

487
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:48,050
But if I made a move on her while
she was sleeping so peacefully,

488
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:50,930
that'd rob me of any pretense
that I could use to deny

489
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:53,610
when Darkness or Aqua call
me a creep or a scumbag!

490
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,860
I'm a gentlemen! That's not like me!

491
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:59,290
However, her parents have
signed off on this situation.

492
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:01,860
I bet if Megumin sued me, I could win!

493
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,010
Wait, could I?

494
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:07,710
Damn it! I should have
studied up more on law!

495
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,850
If I had known this would happen, I would've!

496
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,710
Wait, that's not it!

497
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:15,340
What am I, stupid?!

498
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,920
This isn't about getting sued!
My entire perspective is off-base!

499
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,630
No good. I think the situation
has me all mixed up.

500
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,670
Calm down! Settle yourself, Satou Kazuma!

501
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,260
Let's calm down and think this through.

502
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,600
Spring or not, it's cold at night.
Too cold to think straight.

503
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,970
First, let's crawl into
the futon and calm down!

504
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:41,030
Wait, no! What a devious trap I've fallen for!

505
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:44,220
Without realizing it, I've ended
up sleeping next to Megumin!

506
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,350
Let's say I panic and jump out of the futon.

507
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:49,790
Wouldn't that be the exact
moment that she'd wake up?!

508
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:53,260
Exactly! The kind of situation where
I get punished no matter what I do!

509
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:56,680
If that happens, even if I say, "I didn't do
anything!" or "It was your parents' idea!"

510
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,800
I could have the best excuses in
the world, and no one would care!

511
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,420
Oh, bitter injustice!

512
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:03,310
It's a false accusation, that's what it is.

513
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:06,570
And if that's going to be how things
turn out, no matter what I do...

514
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:15,440
I may as well turn it around and remove
the "false" part of the equation.

515
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:21,240
You can't put me in the same futon as a
beautiful girl and expect nothing to happen.

516
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,450
More than anything, this situation
was cooked up by Megumin's mother.

517
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,380
It's fine! I can win!

518
00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:31,540
In this kind of situation, I bet I could
even beat Sena in a court of law!

519
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,840
Good morning.

520
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,800
Oh... good morning.

521
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,770
Uh, how long was I asleep?

522
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,120
About eight hours?

523
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,750
I see...

524
00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:00,240
And... why am I sleeping
in the same futon as you?

525
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,870
C'mon, don't make me spell it out.

526
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:02,860
Spell what out?!

527
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:07,370
Hey, don't flip the cover up. It's cold.

528
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:11,580
I just woke up in my old room next
to you, Kazuma! What happened?!

529
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:15,510
Come on, you really think
I'd try to pull something?

530
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,920
I haven't up until now, have I?

531
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,310
That's a good point. Sorry.

532
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:24,100
I think I was a bit confused,
since I just woke up...

533
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:29,430
You're not the kind of person who would
take advantage of a situation like this.

534
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,200
Of course not!

535
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,850
I'll have you know your mom locked
the door and trapped me in here!

536
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,600
She did?! Honestly...

537
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,370
That being the case, saddle up!

538
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,390
It's cold, so into the futon with you!

539
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,340
It's fine! I won't do! A thing!

540
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,370
You won't?

541
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:49,940
You really won't do... anything?

542
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,870
Even though we're all alone...

543
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,400
Say what?

544
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,990
I-Is she saying I should try something?
Is this really my popular phase?!

545
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:02,140
Fool! I'm obviously gonna try
something if we're all alone!

546
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,630
I've even got your parents' approval!

547
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,200
You idiot! I suspected as much!

548
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,640
I'm going to spend the
night at Yunyun's house!

549
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,140
Damn you! You tricked me!

550
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,890
Death to perverts!

551
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:17,390
Die, die, die, die, die!

552
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:22,770
Megumin, Megumin!

553
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,860
Could you show us the sights around here?

554
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,210
That's a good idea.

555
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:30,490
Why don't we have a nice, leisurely day,
and then stay one more night?

556
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,700
Yay!

557
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,840
I'm going to have Megumin show me around.

558
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,330
What are you going to do, Kreeperma-san?

559
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,740
Good question. Maybe I'll join...

560
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,580
Wait. What did you just call me?

561
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,250
Did I say something strange?

562
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,730
No... Maybe I imagined it?

563
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,590
Well, whatever. What about you, Darkness?

564
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:52,440
There's a place I'd like to visit.

565
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,100
You and the others should enjoy
your sightseeing, Kazutrash.

566
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,850
Okay, sounds— Wait, what did you just say?

567
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,340
So I'll be showing Aqua
and Kursedma around, then?

568
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:04,110
There are lots of things to see in town—

569
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,110
Hang on a second!

570
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:08,610
Is something wrong, Kazuma-san-who-tried-to-
mess-with-Megumin-while-she-was-sleeping?

571
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,620
I'm sorry.

572
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:51,820
This is the mysterious facility where the
Crimson Demons' natural enemy is sealed away.

573
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,660
What do you mean, mysterious facility?

574
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,870
Just what I said. It's a mysterious facility.

575
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:59,790
No one knows what else is inside,
who built it, or for what reason.

576
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,940
Hey, Megumin.

577
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,540
Are there any other places with
cool things hidden inside?

578
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:08,700
Well, there was a tomb where
an evil god was sealed away,

579
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,970
and a piece of land where a
nameless goddess was sealed away,

580
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:14,750
but eventually, they ended up being released.

581
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:17,260
Are you guys bad at keeping
things sealed or what?!

582
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,270
Well, if it isn't Megumin!
You're back in town?

583
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,900
Are these folks from out of town?

584
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:33,030
Does he have... problems with outsiders?

585
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:41,400
I am called Cheekera! Arch wizard
and wielder of advanced magic!

586
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,290
And owner of the foremost clothing
store among the Crimson Demons!

587
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:51,100
Welcome, folks! It's been a while
since I've had outsiders in the shop.

588
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:53,720
Having the foremost store
is pretty impressive!

589
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,390
Well, this is also the only
clothing store in the village.

590
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:59,050
Are you mocking us?!

591
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:02,950
I was actually hoping to
replace my current robe.

592
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:05,560
Do you have another just like this?

593
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:08,810
All of them?

594
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:12,480
Wow, our little Megumin's gone all bourgeois!

595
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:17,300
I'm honestly surprised the village
hasn't heard of my exploits yet!

596
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,380
And since the robes are
what I wear into action,

597
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,590
it can't hurt to have a few
more in my wardrobe.

598
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:25,850
That being said, future millionaire
Kazuma, lend me some money.

599
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,600
You...

600
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,850
I mean, fine, but...

601
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,500
Thank you very much!

602
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,480
Hey...

603
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,510
What is it?

604
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,710
Isn't this...

605
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:46,260
I mean, what the hell?
You're hanging clothes from that?

606
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:49,610
Oh, sir, do you recognize it?

607
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:54,270
This is the clothes-drying pole that's been
passed down through my family for ages.

608
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:56,900
It never rusts, so it's super handy.

609
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:01,030
That's pretty clearly a rifle.

610
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,370
That's what I thought.

611
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:04,870
What is up with this village?

612
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,380
Kazuma! Aqua!

613
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,970
Now that you know the charms
of the Crimson Demon Village,

614
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:17,760
allow me to show you even finer splendor!

615
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:23,150
Welcome...

616
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:26,230
to our magic academy, the Red Prison!

617
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,640
W-Welcome...

618
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,480
What're you doing here, Yunyun?

619
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,750
When I stayed over at her house last night,
the friendless wonder seemed lonely,

620
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,140
so I invited her to come along.

621
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,530
I-I-I never said I was lonely!

622
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:41,130
You even dug out your old uniform.
Why try and hide it?

623
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:46,140
So this is your uniform? It's cute!

624
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,190
Isn't it, though?!

625
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,010
It's only natural that I get changed

626
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:52,750
to show you around our
distinguished magical academy!

627
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,710
I bet you just wanted to wear it
because you felt nostalgic.

628
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:59,640
Kazuma always gets prickly when
the subject of school comes up.

629
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,720
He's probably still bitter
about not fitting in.

630
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,590
Hey, cut it out! That's a
confidentiality violation!

631
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:10,350
I am called Arue...

632
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:15,190
The most voluptuous among the
Crimson Demons, and a future author!

633
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:17,670
I am called Funifura!

634
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,450
The foremost among Crimson Demons
who love their brothers,

635
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:22,490
known for her brother complex!

636
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,390
I am called Dodonko!

637
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,770
Foremost among the Crimson Demons at...

638
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,910
At... what was it again?

639
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,980
You've got a brother complex, huh?

640
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:36,000
I-I just don't have a cool nickname yet!

641
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:40,630
Arue... Dodonko, Funikura.

642
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,010
It's Funifura! You did that on purpose!
You totally did, didn't you?!

643
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:47,010
We heard you were back in town.

644
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,300
Who're they?

645
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,770
Classmates from when we
attended the magic academy.

646
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:54,160
Welcome home. I'm glad to
see you made it back safely.

647
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,310
People might believe the things you write,

648
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:58,270
so please don't send "letters"
like that anymore.

649
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:01,360
And you people are the members
of Yunyun's party?

650
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,240
I'm surprised you actually exist!

651
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,190
Yunyun's party, I mean.

652
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,230
L-Let me introduce you!

653
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:11,150
Th-This guy is a rookie adventurer,

654
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:13,380
and the girl is an arch priest!

655
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:17,000
There's also a very durable lady
who's not with us at the moment!

656
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,210
And Megumin was sad on her own,

657
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:21,630
so we recently invited her to join us!

658
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,340
That sounds like a lovely party.

659
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:29,360
Yunyun's not actually a member of
the party, but she helps us out a lot,

660
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,520
despite not being a member!

661
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,240
Uh...

662
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,690
Yes, in spite of her not being a member.

663
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,190
We figured.

664
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:39,930
I've given Yunyun the nickname
"frog slayer" in my heart.

665
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,190
What are you talking about?

666
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,820
Light of Saber!

667
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,930
Come on, remember how she
took out those Giant Toads

668
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:49,300
with that sparkly sword-like spell?

669
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:51,970
Isn't that...

670
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,900
That's an actual advanced spell.

671
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,710
Yunyun, I thought you could
only do intermediate magic!

672
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:04,150
She picked it up at an awkward time,

673
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:07,340
so she wasn't able to learn
advanced magic before graduation.

674
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:11,460
C-Come on, it's not like I needed to know it.

675
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:22,740
What's wrong, Kazuma? Are you still torn
up about not having friends in school?

676
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,870
That's not it!

677
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,610
I was just wondering about Yunyun.

678
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,740
You mean what they said earlier?

679
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:33,940
I thought Crimson Demons were a bunch of
OP weirdos who all used advanced magic.

680
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:38,640
Well...

681
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:44,390
When I was a student, in order
to learn Explosion magic,

682
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:47,010
I was storing up my skill points.

683
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,920
I endured it day after day,

684
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,610
to make sure I could someday
learn Explosion magic.

685
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,440
But one day...

686
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:59,190
Give me my food back!

687
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,940
Komekko!

688
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:09,950
To save Komekko when she
was attacked by monsters,

689
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:14,120
Yunyun used her own points in
order to learn intermediate magic,

690
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,800
while I was hesitating...

691
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:25,140
You mean she covered for you
so you could learn Explosion magic?

692
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,510
Not that I asked her to, but yes.

693
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:35,090
Well, she's a more established
mage than you are now,

694
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:36,340
so it worked out all right!

695
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,390
True enough.

696
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,440
How dare you?!

697
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,150
The Devil King's forces have appeared!!

698
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:45,150
Emergency Quest

699
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:48,900
What is it with this woman?!
What is she trying to do?!

700
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:53,030
Lady Sylvia! There's no telling
what she's after! Please, stand back!

701
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,250
She's a real freak! Her attacks are
worthless, but she's sturdy as they come!

702
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:01,200
As long as there is light in my eyes,
you will not pass!

703
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:03,600
Darkness! Good job hanging in there!

704
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,250
We brought help from the village!

705
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:08,260
K-Kazuma? You're already here?

706
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:11,810
I was sad that only female orcs are left,
so I came here to see what I could find,

707
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:14,060
and even the Devil King's general is a woman!

708
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,020
What is wrong with this journey?!

709
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,960
Could you shut up for a second?!

710
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,140
You're ruining that impressive performance!

711
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:24,790
I see. Buying time until
your allies arrived, then?

712
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:29,900
From the way you endured those attacks,
you must be a fairly high-level crusader.

713
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,910
Was not being able to land
any attacks part of your act?

714
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:37,940
I-I suppose there's no point
in maintaining the facade...

715
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,000
Glance...

716
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,010
Look, you're Sylvia, right?

717
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:45,040
That crusader is an accomplished warrior
who fought the Devil King's general, Vanir!

718
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,160
Vanir?!

719
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,920
I heard he never returned
from the town of Axel...

720
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,000
Was that because of you people?

721
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,870
Yeah! Megumin here finished him off.

722
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,200
Vanir-sama is dead?!

723
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,060
That's awesome!

724
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,570
And that's not all!

725
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:03,630
The Dullahan, Verdia,
and Hans the Deadly Poison...

726
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,480
And even the mobile fortress, Destroyer.

727
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:09,570
The four of us took them all down.

728
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,720
Verdia and Hans, too?!

729
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,590
But when I think about how
we lost contact with Hans

730
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:18,330
after he infiltrated Arcanretia,
it seems plausible.

731
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:22,330
I take it you're the leader?
Why don't you tell me your name?

732
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,210
M-My name?

733
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,710
It's Mitsurugi.

734
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:32,680
Mitsurugi Kyouya. Remember it.

735
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,720
Someone just chickened out.

736
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:39,470
He must've been feeling cocky with all
these Crimson Demons backing him up.

737
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:43,290
So you're Mitsurugi of the Cursed Sword...

738
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:45,980
I didn't expect to encounter
such a powerful party.

739
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,390
Taking you down right here with
the Crimson Demons' help

740
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:52,490
wouldn't be much of an accomplishment.

741
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:55,070
I appreciate that, Mitsurugi.

742
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:58,460
Let's meet again. When we do,
we'll see who comes out on top.

743
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,740
Retreat!

744
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,850
Don't let them escape! Lightning Strike!

745
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:05,470
Light of Saber!

746
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:07,750
Time to test my magic on you all!

747
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:15,430
I should buy Mitsurugi some
bubbly next time I see him.

748
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,210
Good morning.

749
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:41,580
Did you get a good night's rest?

750
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,580
Good... morn...ing.

751
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:48,460
Did you finally cross the line?!

752
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:50,860
You beast! Kazuma, you beast!

753
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:51,710
Dummy.

754
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:54,470
I was just holding your
hand because it's cold.

755
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:56,610
R-Really?

756
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,860
I suppose I got the wrong idea.

757
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,220
I'm sorry.

758
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:05,570
H-Hey, it's fine.

759
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:09,980
But it's about time you
did seriously thank me.

760
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:13,420
I'm always cleaning up
after you guys, after all.

761
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:16,240
Thanking you?

762
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,240
You've got a point.

763
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:26,170
Back then, you accepted an aimless wizard

764
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:29,960
who could only cast
Explosion magic. Thank you.

765
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:32,600
You always carry me home on your back

766
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,460
when I can't move after
casting it. Thank you.

767
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,570
I always cause so much trouble,

768
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,080
but you keep me in the party. Thank you.

769
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,900
I was just thanking you.

770
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:50,170
Why are you embarrassed when
you're the one who demanded it?

771
00:43:50,170 --> 00:43:51,480
O-Oh...

772
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:56,240
Well, in spite of it all,
you guys do help out a lot.

773
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,640
To put it in your terms...

774
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:01,590
I am called Satou Kazuma!

775
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:06,750
Axel's weakest adventurer,
and foremost at getting into trouble!

776
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,710
He who will obtain the wealth to spend
his days having fun with the rest of you!

777
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:17,090
And I'm looking forward to it.

778
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,220
So am I. Here's to a bright future.

779
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:27,460
I-It really is cold today.

780
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:31,650
As if we're trapped... in... ice...

781
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:36,030
Kazuma, care to explain what this is?

782
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:38,980
I think maybe there was a freak blizzard

783
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:41,410
that froze the window
shut before blowing away.

784
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:44,120
Let me out! Let me out, please!

785
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,250
Open! Open! Open up, now!

786
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,120
Mom! Kazuma froze the window shut!

787
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,060
Look, I'm sorry, and I'm
not gonna do anything!

788
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:53,380
It's cold, so let's go to bed.

789
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,420
I want my gratitude back!

790
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:58,450
Look, I'm sorry. My bad.

791
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,640
I'm really regretting all
those nice things I said.

792
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:12,570
And after she was the one who held my hand.

793
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,050
Feels like we're an old couple in a cold stretch.

794
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:16,560
Freeze...

795
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:19,850
Did you just use ice magic again?!

796
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,920
Do you want me to cling to you that badly?!

797
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:28,490
H-Hey! If you start clinging
to me like that...

798
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:32,200
I can see why Darkness says that

799
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,870
every time you've had a chance
to do something with her,

800
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:37,090
you laugh it off and never do anything.

801
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:39,000
You really are a wimp.

802
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:40,550
Huh?

803
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:42,760
Is this... Does Megumin...

804
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:45,260
Is she open to the idea?!

805
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:48,510
This really is my popular phase!

806
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:51,740
The Devil King Army is attacking!
The Devil King Army is attacking!

807
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:53,770
They've already breached the village!

808
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:56,020
Yeah, that's what I figured.

809
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,770
How dare you interrupt just
when it was getting good?!

810
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:06,960
What the hell, man?!

811
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,630
You ever think about the trouble
you cause other people, dumbass?!

812
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:11,000
You want an ass whooping?!

813
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:13,140
I'm sorry!

814
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,380
Wait, no!

815
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,300
I didn't think I'd run into you out here.

816
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:20,250
Oh, dear!

817
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:23,050
Did I interrupt something?

818
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:24,380
No!

819
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,380
Hell yeah, you did!

820
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:27,420
Do you know how late it is?
Could you quiet down?

821
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,920
Aqua! One of the Devil King's
generals is out here!

822
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,620
Get Megumin's parents!

823
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:32,390
Okay!

824
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:35,140
You better not expect any
mercy just because you're hot!

825
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:36,960
In the name of true gender equality,

826
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,730
I will dropkick any rotten
woman who deserves it!

827
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:46,310
Are you actually the famous Mitsurugi?

828
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:48,870
You mean to tell me this little
thing is the Cursed Sword Gram?

829
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:50,410
It's Chunchunmaru.

830
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:54,810
I said that sword's name is Chunchunmaru.

831
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:59,880
Please don't compare it to some cursed
sword nobody's heard of, like Gram!

832
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:06,810
You're not Mitsurugi, are you?

833
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:08,790
My name is Satou Kazuma!

834
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:13,370
I thought if you people knew my name,
you'd put a bounty on my head or something!

835
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:15,390
I think I like you!

836
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:16,550
Kazuma!

837
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:20,130
You! The people of this house have left
to gather the other Crimson Demons!

838
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:21,150
Surrender now!

839
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:27,450
Settle down, now.

840
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:29,030
Thank you very—

841
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:30,630
Wait, no, that's wrong! This is a trap.

842
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:32,990
I shouldn't be happy just because
sh'es exposing skin, busty,

843
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:35,950
and a statuesque beauty in spite of
her huge frame thank you very much!

844
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,620
I'll get you out of there, Kazuma!

845
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:40,000
You'll blow Kazuma away, too,
if you use Explosion magic!

846
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:43,100
I'm taking him as a hostage.

847
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:45,780
Wait! If you need a hostage, take me!

848
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:48,260
You're a naughty one, aren't you?

849
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:51,700
What has been up with me lately?

850
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:54,570
It starts with Yunyun saying
she wants to have my baby,

851
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:56,420
then the orcs, Megumin, and now Sylvia...

852
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:58,270
Even if the orcs weren't really a positive.

853
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:00,850
But this is the kind of luck where
I'd expect some kind of backlash.

854
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:02,730
Have I actually entered a popular phase?

855
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:07,450
Or has my high luck stat, my only
saving grace, kicked into overdrive?

856
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:11,470
Now, sweetie, stop breathing so heavily...

857
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:13,030
You're heating me up.

858
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:15,200
Sacred Exorcism!

859
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:19,840
A sneak attack...

860
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,570
But I've got bad news.

861
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:25,710
I'm not a pure demon,
so it's not going to kill me.

862
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:28,420
I am called Sylvia!

863
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:30,870
I am the chief of the Enhanced
Monster Development Bureau,

864
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:34,430
she who has synthesized
and modified her own body!

865
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,730
Yes, Sylvia, the Growth Chimera!

866
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:40,340
And I'm taking this boy with me!

867
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:42,480
Let's become one again.

868
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:43,980
Kazuma!

869
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:55,580
Did... Did he just let himself be taken?

870
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,070
Of course not.

871
00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:00,880
This is strange. It's such a perfect fit,
and I feel so safe.

872
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,960
Like I've finally found the sanctuary
I've been searching for.

873
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:06,590
Hold on, Kazuma! I'll get you out of there!

874
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,240
I'd rather you didn't.

875
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:11,470
I said I'd rather you didn't.

876
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:15,710
You guys have been kind of taking
me for granted lately, haven't you?

877
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:19,140
See, Sylvia-san here...
She actually appreciates me.

878
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:23,330
It's enough to make me...
defect to the Devil King's army.

879
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:24,850
So apologize!

880
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:27,480
It's about time I got an apology,
since I always try so hard for you all!

881
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:30,720
E-Enough with the jokes, Kazuma...

882
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,420
There's a time and place for these things.

883
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:36,700
T-True enough, you have
accomplished some great feats.

884
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:39,040
When we get back to Axel, I'll talk to
my father about giving you a medal...

885
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,810
I want sincerity!

886
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:43,750
Stop trying to buy me off with stuff!
I want genuine contrition!

887
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:45,750
Just look at what's happening here.

888
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:49,510
Miss Sylvia of the Devil King's army is
giving me the billowy pillowy treatment!

889
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:54,010
Darkness! What is your greatest strength?
Tell me! Go on, spit it out!

890
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:56,510
M-My defensive strength?

891
00:49:56,510 --> 00:49:58,010
Obviously not!

892
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:00,390
Your only strength is your
needlessy seductive body

893
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:02,000
that brings men to their knees!

894
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,080
How can you be so oblivious?!

895
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,150
I-I don't seduce anybody!

896
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:08,220
You clearly do!

897
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:09,900
Your body is luscious,
and for no good reason!

898
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:13,440
What you don't realize is that my high
luck stat is at its apex tonight!

899
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,660
I've never been a bigger hit with the chicks!

900
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:17,130
Now apologize!

901
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:20,550
Give me a proper apology so I
don't waltz off with Sylvia-san,

902
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:22,580
thanks to my awesome popular phase!

903
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:24,790
You are just delightful.

904
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:27,700
But don't be too harsh on the ladies, okay?

905
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:31,670
I need to teach you how to
understand women a bit better.

906
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:36,210
As if a demonic beast could
understand how human women feel...

907
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:40,680
Well, of course I can understand
how they feel. Men and women.

908
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:44,150
Just what I'd expect from a demonic beauty.

909
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:48,440
She's got bewitching charisma that
lets her understand men and women!

910
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:52,440
After all, I'm partially a man myself.

911
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:57,450
Say that again?

912
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:01,750
Oh, you didn't hear me?
I'm a chimera, after all.

913
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:05,540
Even these boobs you're so fond of
were something I added to my body.

914
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:09,290
K-Kazuma... s-stay calm...

915
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:13,050
I-It's fine! Don't panic! Don't panic.

916
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:16,230
You really are a fine man, though.

917
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:19,800
Just holding you like this has my breasts
and lower body feeling all tingly!

918
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:22,180
Sylvia-san! Sylvia-san!

919
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:24,790
Why do I feel something
pressing into my butt?

920
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:29,310
Because something is!

921
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:33,150
Something is! Something is! Something is!

922
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:38,820
No!

923
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:38,820
Quest Failed

924
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,820
Orc (♀)

925
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:38,820
Kazuma was psychologically scarred

926
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,820
Sylvia (♂)

927
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:45,640
Cut it out! Get your dick
off of me! You wanna die?!

928
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:46,580
Settle down!

929
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,540
You don't have to worry.
I'm not going to try anything.

930
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:54,170
I managed to shake the others off
my tail, so you're free to go.

931
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,450
Where are we?

932
00:51:57,450 --> 00:52:00,180
This is the Crimson Demon Village's
underground storage facility.

933
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:04,840
My objective is to find the ancient
magic weapon that's hidden here.

934
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:06,830
A magic weapon?

935
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:10,760
The Mage Killer.

936
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:14,420
It can neutralize any magic...

937
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:17,200
A perfect counter to the Crimson Demons.

938
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:19,570
Something like that is down here?

939
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:22,260
I've finally gotten this close.

940
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,450
The barrier breaker isn't working?

941
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,960
What exactly is this?
It's not sealed with magic?

942
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:31,210
Are those... controller inputs?

943
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,340
You can read that ancient text?!

944
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:37,840
Nah, I think they just used a famous
cheat code as the password for the—

945
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:41,800
You're even better than I'd hoped.

946
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,350
I'm still an adventurer, y'know!

947
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:45,850
Don't expect me to give in that easily!

948
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:50,210
There's more to getting someone to talk
than threats and violence, you know.

949
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:53,600
You'll find my technique
is on par with a succubus.

950
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,380
I wonder how much ecstasy you'll be able to—

951
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,860
Up, up, down, down, left, right,
left, right! There you go!

952
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:06,990
Do the things you do not bother you?

953
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:10,750
Not that it matters. Now the weapon is mine.

954
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:13,000
Crap.

955
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:15,890
I got so anxious, I put the password in.

956
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:17,760
Still...

957
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:21,760
It's so dark. I can't see a thing.

958
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:27,010
I think she might be taking me too lightly
just because I don't have a weapon.

959
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:29,730
Hey, do you have anything
I can use for light?

960
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,270
Hey! What do you think you're—

961
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:37,020
Up, up, down, down, left, right,
left, right, and away you go!

962
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,750
Hey, you, stop that! Hold it right there!

963
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:41,530
Wait, damn it!

964
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:43,030
KONOSUBA...

965
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:44,970
Kazuma! Are you all right?

966
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:46,240
Where's Sylvia?

967
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:51,060
I managed to trap Sylvia in here
with a bit of skillful deceit.

968
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,240
Hey, damn it!

969
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:51,000
Open this door right now!
You hear me?!

970
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:55,000
If we leave her in there for a month
or so, she's bound to quiet down.

971
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:54,750
(Heavy breathing)

972
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:55,330
Ah! <3

973
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,450
A Devil King general...
killed by starvation?

974
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:56,130
It hurts!

975
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:57,380
Ow, ow, ow!

976
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,250
Oh!

977
00:53:58,450 --> 00:53:59,770
Well done, outsider!

978
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,250
My breasts!

979
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:02,510
I think my boobies
are stuck in the door!

980
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:02,630
You managed to capture Sylvia,
after she evaded us every time!

981
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:03,630
Ah!

982
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,010
I can't move!

983
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:07,390
Come on, Satou Kazuma.

984
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,160
Isn't there some kind of scary
weapon sealed in this place?

985
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,770
Won't you please open the door?

986
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:12,640
Even we couldn't figure out
how to use it. It'll be fine.

987
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:11,310
Hahh! Hahh!

988
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:12,270
Aw, come on!

989
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,140
Say something, damn it!

990
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:15,360
If Sylvia is able to activate the weapon,

991
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,400
At least respond, you piece of crap!

992
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,910
I'll run a lap around the village
while doing a handstand!

993
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:18,770
Because if you're not gonna poke at me,

994
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:19,780
Whoa, don't set flags!

995
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:20,650
I'm gonna poke you hard, damn it!

996
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:21,900
Come on, what are you worried about, Kazuma?

997
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:21,900
You hear me?!

998
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,520
You defeated one of
the Devil King's generals!

999
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,150
I am going

1000
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,530
to poke you!

1001
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:27,000
You basically did it by yourself this time,

1002
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,370
but since we're a party,
we split the reward, right?

1003
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:33,410
What should I buy when we get back to Axel?

1004
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,130
Why do you do this every damn time?!
We need to get out of here, fast!

1005
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:55,140
Did you think I was just going
to take the weapon with me?

1006
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:57,280
This is my power.

1007
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:01,750
I can assimilate anything into
my body, weapons or otherwise!

1008
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:04,340
My name is Sylvia!

1009
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:08,160
Sylvia the Growth Chimera,
who has obtained ultimate power!

1010
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:15,440
K-K-Kazuma, this is bad!

1011
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,920
That's the Mage Killer!

1012
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,370
Let's run! We need to get out of here, fast!

1013
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:22,670
Abandon the village! It's doomed!

1014
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:29,890
We've had our ups and downs,
but I have this power because of you.

1015
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:32,390
So I'll spare you.

1016
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:38,400
You can stand there and watch as
I wipe this village off the map!

1017
00:55:56,630 --> 00:55:57,620
Hey, look!

1018
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:59,920
Isn't that the legendary Mage Killer?!

1019
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:03,420
Time for some well-deserved payback!

1020
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,180
It's Sylvia-sama!

1021
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:16,750
Sylvia-sama managed to get
a hold of the Mage Killer!

1022
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:19,690
Sylvia! Sylvia!

1023
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:26,690
I never thought the seal would be broken...

1024
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:28,450
Village Chief!

1025
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,650
Oh, our visitors.

1026
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:32,980
It's a shame this happened
while you were here.

1027
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:34,200
I-It's okay...

1028
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:38,210
I'm so sorry. It was me
who let that thing out!

1029
00:56:38,370 --> 00:56:40,830
The village... is burning.

1030
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:45,210
I-Is there seriously nothing we can do?

1031
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:47,540
The Mage Killer does have...

1032
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:51,220
a secret countermeasure.

1033
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:55,560
There are ruins with an inscription that
no one has been able to decipher...

1034
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:56,860
There are?!

1035
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:58,480
O-Okay, let's head there right now!

1036
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,230
What did she hit?!

1037
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:06,620
That was near your house!

1038
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:07,750
Komekko's there!

1039
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:10,950
Megumin, take Kazuma and
the others to those ruins!

1040
00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:14,820
Don't worry. I'll protect your family.

1041
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:17,200
That's a knight's duty, right?

1042
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,580
Please, save Komekko.

1043
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:22,960
Okay, this is do-or-die. Let's go!

1044
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:25,790
"Do-or-die," eh?

1045
00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:29,060
For outsiders, you definitely
understand our culture!

1046
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:32,430
Not bad. If anything,
things like this are our style!

1047
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:38,030
All right, why don't we show her what
we can do to defend the village?

1048
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:39,430
Yeah!

1049
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:43,940
I think this disaster might be the kind
of thing they look forward to...

1050
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:48,990
Hey, sorry to interrupt during the big
speeches, but I don't like any of this.

1051
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:52,610
My job is providing support
from a safe position.

1052
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:54,590
Stop whining and move!

1053
00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:56,180
You're in this party, too!

1054
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:57,950
No!

1055
00:57:57,950 --> 00:57:59,450
KONOSUBA!

1056
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:02,710
Here we are, Vanir-san.

1057
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:06,930
I'm sure the craftsman I know can help you!

1058
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:10,710
That confidence only makes me anxious,
considering it's coming from you.

1059
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:12,860
It'll be fine!

1060
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:14,220
He's very skill—

1061
00:58:20,450 --> 00:58:21,630
This is screwed up.

1062
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:22,980
Kazuma, this way!

1063
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:26,480
Hey...

1064
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:28,540
This is Japanese!

1065
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:30,730
Japa... what?

1066
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:33,680
Uh, don't worry about it.

1067
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:37,120
"I now leave this record
of what has transpired.

1068
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:41,310
One day, the king trampled
into my paradise

1069
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:44,120
demanding a weapon that
could defeat the Devil King."

1070
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:47,480
But nothing can be gained from war...

1071
00:58:49,970 --> 00:58:53,570
I tried to brush it off with that,
but a lady researcher slapped me.

1072
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:57,560
I kinda think I already contributed
enough to this country

1073
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:00,030
using the cheat ability I got
when I came to this world!

1074
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:02,760
I'm all out of ideas!

1075
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:07,680
I managed to come up with a weapon
to deal with the Devil King.

1076
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:10,320
I say that, but they're just
humans that I modified...

1077
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:13,820
Master, please give us our new names.

1078
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:15,830
Master who?

1079
00:59:15,830 --> 00:59:17,570
Boy, they're really acting the part.

1080
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:22,290
Between asking for red eyes and wanting
identifying numbers on each of their bodies...

1081
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:25,080
Is everyone in this country a nutcase?

1082
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,870
I randomly came up with
the name "Crimson Demons,"

1083
00:59:27,870 --> 00:59:30,090
and they absolutely loved it for some reason!

1084
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:32,650
Kazuma, what are you doing?!

1085
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:34,510
Take your hands off my ears!

1086
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:39,380
The Crimson Demons found out about the
Mage Killer that I made a prototype of,

1087
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:42,010
and they called it "our natural enemy!"

1088
00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:44,220
Fight sorcerer technology
with sorcerer technology.

1089
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:47,520
We desire a deterrent to
prevent it from running amok.

1090
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:53,030
I honestly don't hate their whole
"pretentious but nerdy" aesthetic.

1091
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:01,920
For something I threw together, this
deterrent turned out pretty awesome!

1092
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,390
It's only about as big
as a clothes-drying pole,

1093
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:06,740
but it's got enough firepower
to wreck the planet!

1094
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:12,330
I can't think of a better name,
so I'll just call it the Railgun (TBD), for now.

1095
01:00:12,330 --> 01:00:13,370
Baby!

1096
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:15,840
What the hell do you mean, Railgun (TBD)?!

1097
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,230
I feel like... I should apologize.

1098
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:21,100
Quit sending dumbasses into this world!

1099
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:22,940
Between the Destroyer and the Mage Killer,

1100
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:25,040
do you realize how many times
this guy has screwed up?!

1101
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,120
What did it say?!

1102
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:26,980
Well, do you?!

1103
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:30,600
They took a dangerous weapon
and used it for laundry!

1104
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:34,400
Is there something wrong
with the Crimson Demons?!

1105
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,410
Burn! Burn!

1106
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,870
Let this village of lunatics
be reduced to ash!

1107
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,370
Sylvia-sama! You look incredible!

1108
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:48,980
So cool!

1109
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:50,290
Stylish!

1110
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:51,630
You boys...

1111
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:55,240
I'm sorry you had it so rough until now.

1112
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:58,130
I only made it this far because of you all.

1113
01:00:58,270 --> 01:01:00,750
Thank you! You're the best
army I could've asked for!

1114
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:06,140
We'll follow you wherever
you lead us, Sylvia-sama!

1115
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,140
Sylvia! Sylvia!

1116
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:07,580
This ends now!

1117
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:13,290
I am called Hiropon!

1118
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:16,150
The chief of this village,
and he who leads the Crimson Demons!

1119
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:19,840
I am called Pucchin! The foremost
educator among the Crimson Demons,

1120
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,660
and he who will one day be headmaster!

1121
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:25,010
I am called Shikobei! The foremost
fisherman among the Crimson Demons,

1122
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:27,160
and he who will one day catch a kraken!

1123
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:30,140
I am called Chakamiya!
Owner of the foremost bakery

1124
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:32,790
among the Crimson Demons,
and master of yeast!

1125
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:33,570
I am called—

1126
01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:34,240
I am called—

1127
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:35,250
I am called—

1128
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:38,760
Burning Flash!

1129
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:43,010
Sylvia-sama!

1130
01:02:05,590 --> 01:02:07,100
It seems...

1131
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:08,790
...this won't be that easy.

1132
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:11,540
Hey! You didn't even get rid of the goblins!

1133
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,880
This magic weapon is magnificent.

1134
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:19,090
The Crimson Demons will be destroyed
by the very power they've safeguarded!

1135
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,550
Now, despair...

1136
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:27,220
Ancient Dispel!

1137
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:37,270
That scared me!

1138
01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:38,700
What the heck did she do?

1139
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:40,820
Don't stop now! Keep lighting her up!

1140
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:45,270
Diabolic flames, run wild! Inferno!

1141
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:48,370
Our magic...

1142
01:02:48,370 --> 01:02:49,580
It's not casting!

1143
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:52,140
W-We can't teleport, either!

1144
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:54,110
This is bad! Run for it!

1145
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:57,080
We can't take on the Mage Killer after all!

1146
01:02:57,270 --> 01:03:00,990
If the Crimson Demons are just a
bunch of oafs without their magic...

1147
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:02,580
We've got them now!

1148
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:10,100
Get your scrawny butts back here!

1149
01:03:10,270 --> 01:03:10,830
Hurry!

1150
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:12,100
Hey, slow down!

1151
01:03:15,590 --> 01:03:16,580
Funifura!

1152
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:24,540
Whatever's the matter, ladies?

1153
01:03:25,290 --> 01:03:29,580
How unlucky for you. If you were
cute boys, I might've spared you...

1154
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:32,900
But your people have made a
mockery of us for too long.

1155
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,330
Oh, no!

1156
01:03:35,330 --> 01:03:37,810
Light of Saber!

1157
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:56,730
You've done enough,
Devil King Army General Sylvia!

1158
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,730
That's the chief's daughter!

1159
01:04:01,730 --> 01:04:02,800
Yunyun?!

1160
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:03,980
Idiot! What are you doing?!

1161
01:04:04,430 --> 01:04:07,740
I'm can't abandon my friends.

1162
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:09,220
Yunyun...

1163
01:04:13,330 --> 01:04:14,910
I am called Yunyun!

1164
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:18,480
Arch wizard, and wielder of advanced magic!

1165
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,090
The foremost mage among the Crimson Demons,

1166
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:23,890
and future leader of this village!

1167
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:30,530
My daughter!

1168
01:04:30,530 --> 01:04:33,660
She used to act so embarrassed
about giving her introduction...

1169
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:37,060
That's my student!
I'm the one who taught her!

1170
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:38,260
Yunyun!

1171
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:39,820
You can do it!

1172
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:41,810
Yunyun! Yunyun!

1173
01:04:41,810 --> 01:04:42,560
Yunyun!

1174
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:43,900
I challenge you to a duel, Sylvia!

1175
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:47,820
If you want to destroy the village,
you'll have to beat me first!

1176
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:49,730
How adorable.

1177
01:04:49,730 --> 01:04:54,580
But I actually hate cute
young things like you!

1178
01:04:58,030 --> 01:05:01,510
My crimson eyes will overlook no evil!

1179
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:03,380
Yunyun!

1180
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:06,960
That is my crimson fate!

1181
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:11,140
The scope is set!

1182
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:13,950
Yay! Yay!

1183
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:14,890
Sacred Exorcism! Sacred Exorcism!
Sacred Exorcism!

1184
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:13,230
We made it in time!

1185
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:14,890
Time to put an end to this!

1186
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:19,120
Huh, and I thought it was just
a pole for hanging clothes.

1187
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:21,400
So that's my son-in-law...

1188
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:24,900
Sylvia... It's been fun,

1189
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:26,900
but this is goodbye!

1190
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:28,400
Snipe.

1191
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:34,090
What the hell?! It's broken!

1192
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:35,390
Here, let me see.

1193
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:37,120
With things like this, if you just smack it...

1194
01:05:37,910 --> 01:05:38,940
Stop it!

1195
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:42,160
Hey, I charged that thing with
plenty of magic power! What gives?

1196
01:05:40,710 --> 01:05:42,160
I need to hit it!

1197
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:45,230
Shut up! We need to help Yunyun
before she's really in trouble!

1198
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:43,930
We need to hit it!

1199
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:48,960
And now, the star arrives!

1200
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,970
F-Forgive me! Just forget I said anything!

1201
01:05:51,970 --> 01:05:53,470
Not happening!

1202
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:55,660
I am called Megumin!

1203
01:05:56,010 --> 01:05:58,650
I am supreme and almighty in my dominion!

1204
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:01,980
She who calls down the power
of the very heavens themselves!

1205
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:05,980
Stop using that joke magic!
You're old enough to know better!

1206
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:08,150
Sorry! I'm so sorry!

1207
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,240
It comes! It comes! The hordes of flame...

1208
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:17,280
Now display your force, by my command!

1209
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:20,500
Explosion!

1210
01:06:34,970 --> 01:06:36,620
Well, as a goddess,

1211
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:39,650
I have an obligation to protect
Komekko's young life,

1212
01:06:39,650 --> 01:06:40,810
so I'm going to run off.

1213
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:43,520
Hey, it's glowing now.

1214
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:47,890
It wasn't broken after all!

1215
01:06:47,890 --> 01:06:49,900
It just didn't have enough magic power!

1216
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:52,490
Seems like you've got some
kind of scheme in mind.

1217
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:54,480
Sylvia!

1218
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,160
Remember my name!

1219
01:06:56,650 --> 01:06:59,790
And when you're on the other side,
tell your buddies I said hi!

1220
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:01,820
I am Sa—

1221
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:03,160
Boom!

1222
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:12,430
Wha...

1223
01:07:12,430 --> 01:07:16,630
A-Am I... done?

1224
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,370
I am called Komekko!

1225
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:27,130
The foremost lovable little sister
among the Crimson Demons!

1226
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:29,920
And she who is stronger
than a Devil King general!

1227
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:36,120
KONOSUBA.

1228
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:45,480
What happened to me?

1229
01:07:48,990 --> 01:07:51,950
Hey! Hey!

1230
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,300
Hey!

1231
01:07:54,530 --> 01:07:57,240
Come on! Come join us!

1232
01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:00,800
I'm all clean now.

1233
01:08:00,950 --> 01:08:02,530
Verdia and Hans?!

1234
01:08:02,530 --> 01:08:04,310
No! Is this place—

1235
01:08:07,230 --> 01:08:11,820
Come on. Come with us, and we can
all hang out like we used to.

1236
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:16,070
Soap, detergent, soap,
detergent, soap, detergent...

1237
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:18,460
No! I don't want this!

1238
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:20,710
I don't wanna go to the other side!

1239
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,830
Come... with us...

1240
01:08:37,050 --> 01:08:39,050
That was a brutal battle.

1241
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:42,980
I swear to never hurt another person again.

1242
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:47,250
Seriously, stop saying stuff that sets flags!

1243
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:53,360
Life...

1244
01:08:55,570 --> 01:09:00,230
Join us... Come with us!

1245
01:09:00,530 --> 01:09:04,240
I'm all clean now...

1246
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,830
Life!

1247
01:09:07,430 --> 01:09:08,930
What is that?!

1248
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:10,930
Isn't that the slime we fought before?!

1249
01:09:10,930 --> 01:09:12,450
And over there...

1250
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:14,410
The Dullahan!

1251
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:22,400
I won't let it end like this!

1252
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:28,470
My life has only just begun!
I'm going to continue living!

1253
01:09:30,210 --> 01:09:32,040
Crap, crap, crap, crap!

1254
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:34,830
Slow down! Kazuma-san, wait for me!

1255
01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:37,330
Faster! You need to run faster!

1256
01:09:37,330 --> 01:09:39,530
Megumin, stop squirming!

1257
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:04,050
She revived?!

1258
01:10:04,050 --> 01:10:06,720
What the hell is that?!

1259
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:11,690
My soul nearly passed on...

1260
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:14,480
I'm going to crush all of you!

1261
01:10:23,350 --> 01:10:26,490
Cursed Crystal Prison!

1262
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:40,010
K-Kazuma-san, what in the world is going on?

1263
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,420
Wiz?! What are you doing here?

1264
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:45,430
My boy, who is so gifted in
living a cowardly life...

1265
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:48,620
In order to produce your
designs as merchandise,

1266
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:51,390
we came to visit a craftsman in
this village, but it seems...

1267
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:56,610
You've unleashed a magical weapon
out of fear for your own life?

1268
01:10:56,610 --> 01:10:57,270
Wha?!

1269
01:10:57,510 --> 01:11:00,370
You can't hide the truth from
a demon that reads minds.

1270
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:04,740
That said, if the village is destroyed,
our arrangement can't be completed...

1271
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:07,700
My, my, what a mess.

1272
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:13,250
Hey! I thought you were going to use
your stolen ideas to make us all rich?!

1273
01:11:21,230 --> 01:11:24,070
Wiz?! And Vanir?!

1274
01:11:24,070 --> 01:11:26,640
Hello again, Sylvia-san.

1275
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,970
Can I convince you to take
a diplomatic approach here?

1276
01:11:28,970 --> 01:11:30,430
Hell no!

1277
01:11:31,650 --> 01:11:36,440
The Devil King's forces learning of my
survival would be more trouble than I'd like...

1278
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:38,690
You damned traitors!

1279
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:47,930
I don't understand what just happened,
other than you screwed up again, Kazuma!

1280
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:50,100
Well, I'm not going back
to sleeping in stables!

1281
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:54,460
After the taste of luxury I've had,
I can't go back to living where I work!

1282
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:13,470
Sylvia-san! I can't believe you'd turn
yourself into... that! Seriously!

1283
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:16,950
I'm so sure, Wiz!
Someone like you could never understand

1284
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:19,410
what it's like for those
of us on the front lines!

1285
01:12:19,410 --> 01:12:22,690
The way you ditz through life,
nothing ever goes wrong!

1286
01:12:22,690 --> 01:12:23,780
It pisses me off!

1287
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:28,700
Kazuma, don't you have some kind of plan?!

1288
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:31,280
Also, I demand you return my Explosion.

1289
01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:33,770
Is now really the time?!

1290
01:12:33,770 --> 01:12:36,790
She's fighting Wiz and Vanir
and still has the edge!

1291
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:37,710
Damn it!

1292
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:47,620
My magic...

1293
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,970
It seems physical damage
isn't doing much, either.

1294
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:54,130
How is she so strong?! It's totally unfair!

1295
01:12:54,130 --> 01:12:58,160
Damn it! Maybe there's a weakness? Like what?!

1296
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:00,980
Like... like... like...

1297
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:03,880
Like? Like...

1298
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:07,240
Like? Like... My popular phase?

1299
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:11,370
Kazuma?

1300
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:21,330
Damn it, fine!

1301
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:40,840
Traitors deserve death.

1302
01:13:59,170 --> 01:14:01,070
You okay, Wiz?!

1303
01:14:01,070 --> 01:14:01,920
Kazuma-san!

1304
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:06,270
The real battle starts now!

1305
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:15,410
The pervert knight with the terrible attacks!

1306
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:16,980
What's become of her?

1307
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:21,160
You! Vanir, the Mind-Reading Demon!

1308
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:24,690
We meet again, Verdia the Hero Slayer.

1309
01:14:24,890 --> 01:14:27,150
What's going on?
What are they planning to do?

1310
01:14:27,150 --> 01:14:28,620
Hey, look!

1311
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,190
Megumin?!

1312
01:14:33,190 --> 01:14:34,200
Yunyun?!

1313
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:36,810
Those two can't even use Teleport!

1314
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:38,000
Could it be...

1315
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:41,070
They intend to die.

1316
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:44,670
What?!

1317
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:50,880
My daughter... You can't die, Megumin!

1318
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:54,330
Megumin! Yunyun!

1319
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,640
Everyone!

1320
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:57,390
I need your help!

1321
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,890
Blessing. Blessing. Blessing.

1322
01:15:00,890 --> 01:15:04,150
Blessing. Blessing. Blessing.

1323
01:15:04,150 --> 01:15:06,420
I've known you for a while now, Kazuma-san,

1324
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:08,440
and you never run out of crazy ideas.

1325
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:09,780
It'll be fine.

1326
01:15:11,170 --> 01:15:13,280
I've got a goddess on my side, right?

1327
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:17,900
Give me all you've got, partner!

1328
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:22,790
Leave it to me!

1329
01:15:35,550 --> 01:15:37,070
Is this...

1330
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:39,110
She's a dark one...

1331
01:15:39,670 --> 01:15:43,710
But... twists like this are kind of my thing.

1332
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:48,480
Right! You understand our culture
pretty well, for an outsider!

1333
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:49,940
Thank you!

1334
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:54,770
Now, everyone, while Kazuma
and the others are buying time,

1335
01:15:54,770 --> 01:15:56,200
give me your magic power!

1336
01:16:04,430 --> 01:16:06,790
I'm sick of wasting my time with this village

1337
01:16:06,790 --> 01:16:09,110
full of maniacs with nothing to show for it!

1338
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:14,210
I've fought this entire time with my pride
as a general in the Devil King's army!

1339
01:16:14,210 --> 01:16:18,090
And my men, who admire me,
have fought loyally in my name!

1340
01:16:18,970 --> 01:16:20,100
But...

1341
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:29,370
When I was on the verge of death,
I realized something!

1342
01:16:29,370 --> 01:16:31,380
That I was wrong!

1343
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:34,780
Satisfaction and happiness
aren't the same thing!

1344
01:16:35,270 --> 01:16:39,400
No matter how hard I try, the only
people who notice are goblins!

1345
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:41,870
Sylvia-sama! I love you!

1346
01:16:44,690 --> 01:16:47,060
I have relationships, but no love!

1347
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:50,210
I've never wanted romance
as badly as I do now!

1348
01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:54,420
My life won't shine until
I finally have love in it!

1349
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:55,920
You idiot!

1350
01:17:04,810 --> 01:17:05,930
That's not true.

1351
01:17:08,070 --> 01:17:12,370
Sylvia, from the moment I met you...

1352
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:17,300
You were already shining!

1353
01:17:24,530 --> 01:17:28,760
N-No one's ever scolded
me like that before...

1354
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:30,780
Sylvia.

1355
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:38,840
I can't believe you...

1356
01:17:46,170 --> 01:17:47,620
I love you.

1357
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:49,630
I love you.

1358
01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:51,630
I love you...

1359
01:17:52,190 --> 01:17:53,630
...so much!

1360
01:18:03,830 --> 01:18:07,160
I love you!

1361
01:18:07,870 --> 01:18:09,910
The rest is up to you guys!

1362
01:18:14,650 --> 01:18:17,170
S-So much magic power!

1363
01:18:17,590 --> 01:18:19,050
Megumin-san, Yunyun-san,

1364
01:18:19,730 --> 01:18:22,430
it's all yours!

1365
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:30,810
The magic power...

1366
01:18:30,810 --> 01:18:32,940
of everyone in the village!

1367
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:38,940
This is crazy! I've never heard
of a gamble with worse odds!

1368
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:42,500
Kazuma becoming Sylvia's weakness...
because she'll like him?

1369
01:18:42,820 --> 01:18:45,790
If only I knew advanced magic...

1370
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:47,190
Megumin.

1371
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:51,960
Kazuma-san has faith in your Explosion magic.

1372
01:18:52,330 --> 01:18:55,080
He wouldn't come up with a
plan like this if he didn't.

1373
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:02,510
Megumin, have you lost
faith in Explosion magic?

1374
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:11,480
Power... surging!

1375
01:19:16,430 --> 01:19:17,920
I am called Yunyun!

1376
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:21,370
The foremost and greatest mage
among the Crimson Demons!

1377
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:23,740
I am called Megumin!

1378
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:26,990
The foremost and greatest mage
among the Crimson Demons!

1379
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,320
Because Yunyun allowed me to pursue
Explosion magic on that day,

1380
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,000
I became who I am now!

1381
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:38,750
And because I had Megumin as my
rival, I became who I am now!

1382
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,930
Light of Saber!

1383
01:19:46,870 --> 01:19:50,020
Let the storm blow! Let the flames roar!

1384
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:55,910
Explosion magic is the stuff of dreams!

1385
01:19:56,290 --> 01:19:59,910
It is the ultimate magic that
turns the impossible possible!

1386
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:03,030
Explosion!

1387
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:10,500
Love!

1388
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:15,500
A barrier?!

1389
01:20:15,730 --> 01:20:17,250
Dreams!

1390
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:20,750
Hope!

1391
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:27,590
Don't give up, Megumin!

1392
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:29,470
You can do it, Yunyun!

1393
01:20:29,470 --> 01:20:31,760
My students!

1394
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:40,770
That magic can't take my life!

1395
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:44,580
I'm moving forward! Into the future!

1396
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:45,650
Sylvia.

1397
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:48,690
Let's go...

1398
01:20:50,110 --> 01:20:51,410
Together!

1399
01:20:53,110 --> 01:20:55,040
I love you...

1400
01:20:55,590 --> 01:20:57,510
I love you!

1401
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:05,380
Kazuma was able to bring down
the barrier in her heart!

1402
01:21:16,990 --> 01:21:22,560
Satou Kazuma... y-you... toyed with me,

1403
01:21:24,490 --> 01:21:27,280
but I still love you!

1404
01:21:27,450 --> 01:21:32,780
This... is... my popular phase!

1405
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:51,050
And so, my popular phase came to an end.

1406
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:57,860
If Aqua hadn't used Blessing to
buff my luck dozens of times over,

1407
01:21:57,860 --> 01:22:01,210
I would've probably been blasted
beyond even smithereens.

1408
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:05,020
Even with my higher than average luck stat,

1409
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:07,140
this was an incredibly risky move.

1410
01:22:11,450 --> 01:22:13,320
Welcome back, Kazuma-san.

1411
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:17,210
I see. Sounds like you've been through hell.

1412
01:22:17,210 --> 01:22:20,410
But ain't that what adventuring's all about?

1413
01:22:20,410 --> 01:22:22,330
A toast to your adventure!

1414
01:22:22,550 --> 01:22:25,090
Let's all cheer for Kazuma!

1415
01:22:25,090 --> 01:22:28,720
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

1416
01:22:30,130 --> 01:22:32,700
Warriors deserve cheers every now and then.

1417
01:22:33,590 --> 01:22:38,170
There's no telling when my next
popular phase will kick in.

1418
01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:41,650
There we go!

1419
01:22:43,510 --> 01:22:45,810
It's perfect weather for a picnic today.

1420
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:50,330
Man, yet another brutal adventure...

1421
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:51,990
I'm sorry.

1422
01:22:55,080 --> 01:23:00,580
If I knew advanced magic,
you wouldn't have died...

1423
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:01,940
You've got that right.

1424
01:23:02,750 --> 01:23:05,750
The whole process is pretty unpleasant,
until you're fully revived.

1425
01:23:06,410 --> 01:23:09,260
Plus, the moment you die... hurts super bad.

1426
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:15,400
What's wrong?

1427
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:21,160
Can I ask you to do something terrible?

1428
01:23:22,310 --> 01:23:26,020
I want to be a mage who doesn't
get in the way from now on.

1429
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:33,900
You want me to press the button
so you can learn advanced magic?

1430
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:38,080
What happened to your talk about dreams?

1431
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:41,660
It's time to wake up. I'll be sealing
my Explosion magic away.

1432
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:45,030
The foremost mage among the Crimson Demons,

1433
01:23:45,030 --> 01:23:47,690
and the wielder of advanced magic!

1434
01:23:48,070 --> 01:23:50,040
From now on, that'll be my calling card.

1435
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:56,360
Since I have higher magic potential
than Yunyun, with advanced magic,

1436
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:59,010
I know I'll be number one
among the Crimson Demons!

1437
01:23:59,010 --> 01:24:03,180
I'm not going to let her take that title.

1438
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:13,020
This is so dumb.

1439
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:19,000
Here.

1440
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:20,450
Thanks...

1441
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,120
Well, let's get going.

1442
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:30,370
Hey, Megumin. Light one up for me.

1443
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:34,970
You haven't done your daily
Explosion today, right?

1444
01:24:36,430 --> 01:24:38,580
I can't believe you...

1445
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:41,210
To ask me to use it as soon
as I decided to stop...

1446
01:24:41,210 --> 01:24:42,970
What are you thinking?

1447
01:24:50,290 --> 01:24:51,870
Very well!

1448
01:24:51,870 --> 01:24:54,250
This will be my final Explosion magic.

1449
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:57,370
I'll make it one to remember!

1450
01:25:10,330 --> 01:25:11,470
Goodbye...

1451
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:15,440
Explosion!

1452
01:25:37,550 --> 01:25:38,450
What the...

1453
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:51,920
I am called Megumin!

1454
01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:56,420
Arch wizard and wielder of Explosion magic!

1455
01:25:56,420 --> 01:25:59,180
Axel's foremost mage,

1456
01:25:59,180 --> 01:26:02,520
and she who will one day
master Explosion magic!

1457
01:26:04,210 --> 01:26:06,880
Do I need a talented mage?

1458
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:12,200
I've got one who can toy with and defeat the
Devil King's generals with a single Explosion.

1459
01:26:12,690 --> 01:26:15,690
If you know one who can do better
than that, I'd like to meet them.

1460
01:26:15,850 --> 01:26:17,000
Up you go.

1461
01:26:17,650 --> 01:26:20,450
Kazuma! Megumin! The tea's ready!

1462
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:23,160
I'm gonna eat your lunches!

1463
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:25,450
Isn't it just leftovers they gave us?

1464
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:28,580
Well, I packed them for the picnic,
so now they're lunch!

1465
01:26:28,950 --> 01:26:30,200
Yeah, yeah...

1466
01:26:41,010 --> 01:26:42,440
That one gets 120 points!
