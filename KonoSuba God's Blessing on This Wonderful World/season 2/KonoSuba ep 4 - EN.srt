1
00:00:02,857 --> 00:00:06,057
Do you have the flu?
You need to take care of your health.

2
00:00:06,153 --> 00:00:08,673
You too, Kazuma, your voice sounds nasal.

3
00:00:08,744 --> 00:00:11,224
I'll be done with the sewing
of your sweater soon.

4
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:15,046
You are the one who
burnt it in the fireplace.

5
00:00:17,648 --> 00:00:20,088
Are you hungry already?

6
00:00:20,247 --> 00:00:23,927
Come to think of it,
I haven't had my breakfast.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,280
It's because you got carried away
and spent all the money on booze.

8
00:00:31,274 --> 00:00:34,776
It's because everybody
is drinking so merrily.

9
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,999
This looks like high-quality
bubbly booze...

10
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:41,420
that I had hidden under my bed.

11
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,921
The pawnshop is still open, right?

12
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,562
Come here, Chomusuke.

13
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:48,711
Give that back. It's the last bottle.

14
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,350
My last hope.

15
00:00:50,464 --> 00:00:52,044
I'm going to exchange it for money now.

16
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,400
Or I shall finish it now to
warm my cold body.

17
00:00:56,529 --> 00:01:00,569
No, I can't sleep without
hugging it to me.

18
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:03,609
Coming from you who burnt
the sweater of others.

19
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,195
Then I shall sell off
your priest garment.

20
00:01:06,272 --> 00:01:07,472
What are you talking about?

21
00:01:07,542 --> 00:01:10,422
This garment represents
my identity as a goddess.

22
00:01:10,498 --> 00:01:12,018
How can you sell it?

23
00:01:12,128 --> 00:01:14,405
Are you dumb? What foolishness
are you spewing about?

24
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,984
Steal.

25
00:01:19,316 --> 00:01:22,752
Master Kazuma, I'm the one
who got carried away.

26
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,900
-Don't sell it.
-You are so noisy.

27
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,096
Our debt is still as much as before
and Darkness has yet to return.

28
00:01:28,203 --> 00:01:30,523
Can you be more aware of our crisis?

29
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,080
Something bad had happened, Kazuma.

30
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,060
Who are you?

31
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:53,340
(KONOSUBA:
God's Blessing on This Wonderful World! 2)

32
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,140
(Episode 4:
A Betrothed for This Noble Daughter!)

33
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,540
Who are you?

34
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:17,216
Are you enjoying yourself?

35
00:03:17,344 --> 00:03:20,315
-Kazuma, continues this play later.
-So terrifying.

36
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,099
Are you Darkness? You have made us worry.

37
00:03:24,224 --> 00:03:25,947
Darkness.

38
00:03:26,027 --> 00:03:28,107
Kazuma, he...

39
00:03:28,278 --> 00:03:33,398
forcefully took off my most
important garment to sell it.

40
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,752
How can you say it like that?

41
00:03:34,945 --> 00:03:36,745
Darkness, welcome back.

42
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,860
Megumin, I'm back.

43
00:03:39,204 --> 00:03:40,324
This cat...

44
00:03:40,444 --> 00:03:42,204
I won't ask.

45
00:03:42,284 --> 00:03:44,844
Go and take a bath first...

46
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:47,881
to settle down and relax your body.

47
00:03:48,839 --> 00:03:50,679
What are you talking about?

48
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:53,803
Actually, I'm more curious
about Aqua's peculiar play.

49
00:03:55,966 --> 00:03:57,406
The ultimate...

50
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:58,853
top-notch woman.

51
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:01,989
You must have been through a lot.

52
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,209
What have you misunderstood?

53
00:04:04,348 --> 00:04:07,228
Are you thinking that the Governor
is toying with me?

54
00:04:07,883 --> 00:04:09,763
All is well as long as you are back.

55
00:04:09,885 --> 00:04:13,205
Quickly take a hot bath
and cry to your heart's content.

56
00:04:13,316 --> 00:04:14,356
That's not it.

57
00:04:14,476 --> 00:04:17,796
The Governor doesn't have
enough guts to ask that from me.

58
00:04:18,116 --> 00:04:19,836
Take a look at this.

59
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,040
What is it?

60
00:04:21,376 --> 00:04:23,636
Who is this handsome man?

61
00:04:23,762 --> 00:04:26,082
-I'm pissed.
-What are you doing?

62
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:28,328
Uncontrollable hands.

63
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:33,729
That handsome man is
the son of the Governor.

64
00:04:34,222 --> 00:04:37,152
In exchange for Kazuma's pardon,

65
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,290
he asked for my hand to marry his son.

66
00:04:39,743 --> 00:04:41,823
I didn't come back before that...

67
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:45,533
because I was doing my best
to prevent the marriage.

68
00:04:45,891 --> 00:04:50,971
Him aside, my father
speaks highly of him.

69
00:04:51,739 --> 00:04:53,939
My father approves of
this proposal the most.

70
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,200
Please, let us together
convince my father otherwise.

71
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,736
It's done.

72
00:05:01,075 --> 00:05:02,795
How is it? Isn't it perfect?

73
00:05:02,961 --> 00:05:06,561
You are quite talented
in this kind of thing.

74
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,288
<i>But, if we don't take this matter
into our own hands,</i>

75
00:05:09,364 --> 00:05:12,324
<i>our team's vital crusader will be
married off as somebody's wife.</i>

76
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,600
<i>More importantly...</i>

77
00:05:14,573 --> 00:05:16,013
Thank you, Aqua.

78
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,760
<i>-Marry off as somebody's wife?</i>
-I almost can't get out of it.

79
00:05:18,831 --> 00:05:22,112
<i>It means that she almost
can't break off the marriage.</i>

80
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,218
<i>Our team's crusader with poor aims
will have to quit to get married.</i>

81
00:05:24,568 --> 00:05:27,808
<i>It's not that I want to chase her away
because she is completely useless.</i>

82
00:05:27,882 --> 00:05:29,920
Such a miracle. You can
worship me a little bit more.

83
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,240
-Kazuma.
-Worship me a little bit more.

84
00:05:33,162 --> 00:05:37,682
This is a great chance.

85
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,560
I am Kazuma.

86
00:05:41,721 --> 00:05:43,841
You want me to accept this proposal? Why?

87
00:05:43,914 --> 00:05:47,171
Are you okay with it if Darkness
can no longer be an adventurer?

88
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:49,154
Even if you reject the proposal,

89
00:05:49,273 --> 00:05:52,753
that Governor will do his best to
deliberately make things difficult.

90
00:05:52,864 --> 00:05:53,933
That's right.

91
00:05:54,036 --> 00:05:56,916
That's why we have to accept it first
and wreak havoc later.

92
00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:00,209
But this will affect the reputation
of Darkness's family.

93
00:06:00,384 --> 00:06:02,344
You are right. Let's do this.

94
00:06:02,414 --> 00:06:04,694
If this goes well,
I won't need to pain myself...

95
00:06:04,784 --> 00:06:07,544
dealing with my father every time
the subject of marriage comes up.

96
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:10,031
<i>I pity your father.</i>

97
00:06:10,506 --> 00:06:11,786
Satou Kazuma.

98
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,490
Is Satou Kazuma here?

99
00:06:15,956 --> 00:06:18,036
What is wrong with today?

100
00:06:18,426 --> 00:06:20,946
The borders of the city are filled
with unidentified monsters.

101
00:06:21,121 --> 00:06:22,841
Do you have any idea about it?

102
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,520
Please follow me immediately.

103
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,198
I must reject.

104
00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:31,429
Now, our important companion
is in a critical situation.

105
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,200
We can't turn a blind eye
to her situation.

106
00:06:35,102 --> 00:06:36,182
Megumin.

107
00:06:36,341 --> 00:06:37,901
Calm down.

108
00:06:38,196 --> 00:06:41,596
<i>Wait, I can deal with Aqua.</i>

109
00:06:41,672 --> 00:06:44,192
<i>But at odd times,
Megumin can be smart too.</i>

110
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,838
<i>Truthfully, it's better
if she's not here.</i>

111
00:06:47,054 --> 00:06:48,064
Megumin.

112
00:06:49,007 --> 00:06:50,302
You can go.

113
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,280
Go and take care of those monsters.

114
00:06:53,488 --> 00:06:55,448
This is high time for you to
use your Explosion Magic.

115
00:06:55,712 --> 00:06:56,768
It'll be alright.

116
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,546
Aqua and I will take care
of Darkness's situation.

117
00:06:59,672 --> 00:07:00,952
But...

118
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,880
Only you can do this.

119
00:07:06,103 --> 00:07:07,903
Only me.

120
00:07:08,264 --> 00:07:11,387
I shall leave it to you,
the strongest magician!

121
00:07:11,783 --> 00:07:14,343
I'll let you experience my true power!

122
00:07:17,224 --> 00:07:18,640
Konosuba!

123
00:07:21,762 --> 00:07:24,162
Is it true, Lalatina?

124
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:26,225
Yes, Father.

125
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,400
This time, Lalatina would like
to accept the proposal.

126
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:32,472
These two are?

127
00:07:32,696 --> 00:07:34,856
They are my adventure companion.

128
00:07:35,064 --> 00:07:36,384
I would like them to accompany me

129
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,480
as the temporary butler and maid
for my marriage.

130
00:07:43,944 --> 00:07:45,582
Is it the right size?

131
00:07:45,904 --> 00:07:47,704
It feels all right to me.

132
00:07:53,074 --> 00:07:54,874
It's quite fitting.

133
00:07:55,002 --> 00:07:57,602
You look like first-class errand girl.

134
00:07:57,674 --> 00:07:58,794
So are you.

135
00:07:58,866 --> 00:08:01,866
Straighten your back and assume the
impression of a butler in training.

136
00:08:01,985 --> 00:08:04,705
How very interesting.

137
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,577
I'll make you pay for it...

138
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:08,973
if we are not in the
residence of an aristocrat,

139
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:10,867
am I right, Lady Lalatina?

140
00:08:10,946 --> 00:08:13,746
Don't call me Lady Lalatina.

141
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:17,571
<i>Your father has requested for me...</i>

142
00:08:17,874 --> 00:08:21,394
<i>to help you along and to make sure
you don't make a fool out of yourself.</i>

143
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,960
<i>And, if the marriage is successful,</i>

144
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:28,318
<i>I will be rewarded.</i>

145
00:08:28,687 --> 00:08:31,327
<i>Thus, I'm driven even though
I'm not willing to do it.</i>

146
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:34,549
You know the plan.
I'll leave it to you then.

147
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:42,413
I'm pleased that you are willing
to accept this marriage.

148
00:08:42,811 --> 00:08:45,171
Be happy, Lalatina.

149
00:08:45,717 --> 00:08:47,437
What are you talking about, Father?

150
00:08:47,572 --> 00:08:51,092
I just said that I would
consider this proposal.

151
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,288
What?

152
00:08:53,504 --> 00:08:55,104
After my consideration,

153
00:08:55,184 --> 00:08:58,544
I've decided that it is still
too early for me to get married.

154
00:08:58,635 --> 00:09:00,384
It's too late now.

155
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:04,102
Although I have accepted the proposal,
I haven't accepted the marriage.

156
00:09:04,427 --> 00:09:05,627
Destroy it.

157
00:09:05,762 --> 00:09:09,002
Destroy this marriage!

158
00:09:10,194 --> 00:09:11,394
Lalatina.

159
00:09:11,794 --> 00:09:14,554
Please don't use such boorish words.

160
00:09:15,184 --> 00:09:17,120
They might not like it.

161
00:09:17,274 --> 00:09:18,594
Are you going to betray me?

162
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,880
I am the temporary butler
of the Darkness family now.

163
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,440
My only wish for you
is to find happiness.

164
00:09:25,657 --> 00:09:27,137
Kazuma.

165
00:09:27,261 --> 00:09:28,901
Kazuma, you...

166
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,408
Walter.

167
00:09:39,488 --> 00:09:43,208
You are here. Are you the one who
is going to be my marriage partner?

168
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,550
I am Dustiness Ford Lalatina.

169
00:09:45,622 --> 00:09:47,022
You may call me Lady Dustiness.

170
00:09:47,102 --> 00:09:49,862
Mistress, please be
mindful of where you step.

171
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:52,608
Aren't you supposed to help me?

172
00:09:52,851 --> 00:09:56,571
Did you forget all about not ruining
your family's reputation?

173
00:09:56,658 --> 00:09:59,298
If someone talks bad about me
and scares my partner,

174
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,791
I can continue my adventurous
undertaking without hesitancy.

175
00:10:01,886 --> 00:10:04,126
I'm prepared to sever my family's
relationship if it comes to that.

176
00:10:04,252 --> 00:10:08,372
But I still grit my teeth and get on
with this impossible task.

177
00:10:08,449 --> 00:10:10,449
Then, I got caught by the gaze of...

178
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:12,154
the Devil King and was
pressed flat to the floor.

179
00:10:12,238 --> 00:10:15,558
<i>-It's a crusader, not Devil King.</i>
-That is the life that I want.

180
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:18,308
Finally, you speak of the truth.

181
00:10:18,468 --> 00:10:22,348
Besides that, he is not my type.

182
00:10:22,694 --> 00:10:24,854
First of all, he has a good personality.

183
00:10:24,926 --> 00:10:26,446
He is an even-tempered man.

184
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:27,584
Very diligent.

185
00:10:27,681 --> 00:10:30,721
He is the youngest person ever to be
awarded the knight's medal.

186
00:10:30,893 --> 00:10:33,653
-He sounded fine to me.
-Fine?

187
00:10:33,729 --> 00:10:35,169
An aristocrat should act
like an aristocrat.

188
00:10:35,296 --> 00:10:37,439
He should maintain
a vulgar smile at all times.

189
00:10:38,248 --> 00:10:41,288
And what about his pure, clear
and penetrating gaze?

190
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:42,727
He should look at me...

191
00:10:42,928 --> 00:10:44,608
with a more indecent gaze,

192
00:10:44,717 --> 00:10:47,237
like the one given by Kazuma.

193
00:10:47,328 --> 00:10:49,536
I didn't look at you like that.

194
00:10:49,675 --> 00:10:52,555
Won't he ever get mad?
Who is he trying to fool?

195
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,120
When a maid has done something wrong,
as an aristocrat,

196
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,100
he should do this and that to her
in the name of punishment.

197
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:59,651
My type of man...

198
00:10:59,772 --> 00:11:02,292
is totally opposite from the man who
likes me even though I ignore him.

199
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,160
The man I like can look ordinary,
slim, weak, or even fat.

200
00:11:06,255 --> 00:11:07,855
Although I like him with all my heart,

201
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:09,427
he will succumb to his lust...

202
00:11:09,521 --> 00:11:11,801
when he is seduced.
I prefer that kind of weak-willed man.

203
00:11:11,975 --> 00:11:15,135
He should be wild, dissipated
and lecherous at all times.

204
00:11:15,248 --> 00:11:17,168
The one who wishes
to be gluttonous, lazy...

205
00:11:17,288 --> 00:11:19,208
and looks down on life is the best.

206
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:21,288
It'll be better if he
has an external debt.

207
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:23,680
He should lose himself in a drink
every day and refuse to work.

208
00:11:23,796 --> 00:11:26,356
And he will complain and blame
society for his degradation.

209
00:11:26,434 --> 00:11:29,274
Then he will throw me
the empty bottle and tell me this.

210
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:32,714
Darkness, use your lewd body...

211
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:34,288
to earn some coins for me.

212
00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:40,119
<i>Darn it. This woman is too far gone.</i>

213
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,080
Please let me introduce myself.

214
00:11:44,668 --> 00:11:47,068
I am Alexei Barnes Walter.

215
00:11:47,297 --> 00:11:50,417
I am Dustiness Ford Lalatina.

216
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,520
Let's not go into details about
our family background.

217
00:11:53,678 --> 00:11:57,760
I'm sure the son of the nouveau riche
governor will understand it as well.

218
00:11:57,852 --> 00:11:58,933
What happened?

219
00:11:59,134 --> 00:12:00,494
It's nothing.

220
00:12:00,576 --> 00:12:03,560
I'm just having a bad mood whenever
I see your face, Sir Walter.

221
00:12:06,236 --> 00:12:08,756
Our Mistress is excited...

222
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,295
because she can finally meet you.

223
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,750
Come to think of it,
your face is very red.

224
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,680
I'm sorry for that.

225
00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:20,198
Mistress, if you utter more
of those unnecessary things,

226
00:12:20,293 --> 00:12:21,853
it will be more and more chilling.

227
00:12:22,126 --> 00:12:23,886
This is a reward.

228
00:12:24,057 --> 00:12:27,057
Our Mistress is really unyielding.

229
00:12:29,103 --> 00:12:31,264
I'll only be in your way
with my presence.

230
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,800
Let's take a stroll in the garden.
How about that?

231
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,100
<i>What kind of trick is that? Awesome.
I'll ask her to teach me later.</i>

232
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:49,402
May I ask what your hobby is?

233
00:12:49,696 --> 00:12:51,936
I like to hunt goblins once in a while.

234
00:12:53,413 --> 00:12:55,853
You two are quite close.

235
00:12:56,059 --> 00:12:57,699
Did I overdo it?

236
00:12:59,214 --> 00:13:03,334
Yes, my butler and I are inseparable.

237
00:13:03,624 --> 00:13:06,464
We eat together and bathe together.

238
00:13:06,546 --> 00:13:09,322
Of course, during the night, we...

239
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:14,194
<i>This shrewd woman has no sense of shame?</i>

240
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:18,721
I'm not going to continue this anymore.

241
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,920
Am I right, Walter?

242
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,320
Follow me to the
training ground right now.

243
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,480
We shall see about your
natural endowments.

244
00:13:28,556 --> 00:13:30,916
Darkness.

245
00:13:31,091 --> 00:13:33,091
Look, as an aristocrat,

246
00:13:33,164 --> 00:13:36,606
you should learn from Kazuma and
have this kind of vulgar gaze daily.

247
00:13:37,305 --> 00:13:40,025
Miss Lalatina, I am a knight.

248
00:13:40,511 --> 00:13:42,351
I won't raise my sword against a lady.

249
00:13:42,745 --> 00:13:44,745
You are so annoying.

250
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,235
Kazuma over there...

251
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,290
is an advocate of gender equality.

252
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:52,113
He said he would even high-kick a woman.

253
00:13:52,343 --> 00:13:53,823
Actually,

254
00:13:54,075 --> 00:13:55,435
I came here...

255
00:13:55,607 --> 00:13:58,567
to reject this marriage proposal.

256
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:02,030
But I changed my mind after I saw you.

257
00:14:02,406 --> 00:14:05,526
You are bold and uninhibited
but, at the same time, cute.

258
00:14:05,977 --> 00:14:08,537
You are frank and straightforward.

259
00:14:08,739 --> 00:14:11,859
And you did not treat
your butler with arrogance.

260
00:14:13,038 --> 00:14:15,238
I'm intrigued by you.

261
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:17,308
It's enough.

262
00:14:17,411 --> 00:14:19,731
Why won't you stop?

263
00:14:22,604 --> 00:14:23,724
What is it?

264
00:14:25,202 --> 00:14:28,082
Don't hold back, make your move.

265
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:30,455
Show me your true strength.

266
00:14:31,552 --> 00:14:34,814
<i>Just now, Darkness's wooden
sword can't even touch him.</i>

267
00:14:34,891 --> 00:14:37,605
<i>No matter how I see it,
Walter is in the upper hand.</i>

268
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,477
I lost.

269
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,388
Although I'm more skillful,

270
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,560
but my heart is not as tough as yours.

271
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,040
I cannot fight with you anymore.

272
00:14:50,157 --> 00:14:52,797
You are very strong.

273
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:57,091
<i>It feels like he has lost to
Darkness's strong will.</i>

274
00:14:57,379 --> 00:15:00,899
<i>But knowing Darkness's true colors,
I'm not touched at all.</i>

275
00:15:01,137 --> 00:15:02,592
You are so annoying.

276
00:15:02,726 --> 00:15:03,808
Come, Kazuma.

277
00:15:03,942 --> 00:15:07,182
Let's show Walter your ruthless
and heterodox ways.

278
00:15:07,381 --> 00:15:09,461
<i>What is she blabbering about?</i>

279
00:15:10,218 --> 00:15:11,538
I would like to see it too.

280
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,080
How would you,
the confidante of Lalatina...

281
00:15:14,168 --> 00:15:15,888
fight with her.

282
00:15:16,008 --> 00:15:18,408
<i>Busybody Walter.</i>

283
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:21,645
Since the marriage is a failure...

284
00:15:21,923 --> 00:15:26,003
and you wouldn't slander or spread
deceitful rumors about her.

285
00:15:26,085 --> 00:15:27,885
Good, come on, Kazuma.

286
00:15:27,975 --> 00:15:30,415
Actually, I've been wanting
to fight with you for a long time.

287
00:15:30,548 --> 00:15:33,628
-Create Water.
-Bring it on.

288
00:15:36,621 --> 00:15:38,381
What is it?

289
00:15:38,516 --> 00:15:41,716
You can't use magic in
a wooden sword sparring.

290
00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:43,554
Is that so?

291
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,320
So terrifying. No one can beat Kazuma...

292
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,506
in the field of sexual harassment.

293
00:15:52,621 --> 00:15:54,701
-It wasn't my intention.
-Did you see, Walter?

294
00:15:54,783 --> 00:15:57,303
Look at this man's shameful manner.

295
00:15:57,415 --> 00:16:00,415
Enough, you are the one who
asked me to bring it on.

296
00:16:00,503 --> 00:16:02,143
I shall do my best then.

297
00:16:02,367 --> 00:16:04,247
Freeze.

298
00:16:05,383 --> 00:16:06,663
Demon.

299
00:16:06,802 --> 00:16:08,802
Not only have you sprayed her with
water in this bitterly cold winter,

300
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,520
you even used freeze magic on her.

301
00:16:11,315 --> 00:16:15,275
His nicknames are Devilman Kazuma
and Kazuma Scum, after all.

302
00:16:17,635 --> 00:16:19,475
You are really ruthless.

303
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:21,090
This...

304
00:16:21,642 --> 00:16:24,362
is great!

305
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:30,025
Great, Darkness.
When it comes to wrestling,

306
00:16:30,144 --> 00:16:31,441
Kazuma is an unworthy opponent.

307
00:16:31,552 --> 00:16:34,984
<i>I'll sell off her priest's garment later.</i>

308
00:16:35,104 --> 00:16:38,624
Do you think you can win me by force?
Don't underestimate me.

309
00:16:39,012 --> 00:16:41,572
I am a crusader and
you are an adventurer.

310
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:43,329
There's a large gap between
our physical strength.

311
00:16:44,749 --> 00:16:47,589
It's impossible that I will
meet force with force.

312
00:16:47,713 --> 00:16:49,673
We are long-time friends.
You should know.

313
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,400
It's so painful.

314
00:16:54,664 --> 00:16:56,464
Drain Touch?

315
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,400
But, before you suck away my strength,

316
00:16:59,575 --> 00:17:01,895
I will snap off your wrists.

317
00:17:03,348 --> 00:17:04,428
You can try.

318
00:17:04,548 --> 00:17:05,868
It's so painful.

319
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:09,828
<i>This is bad, this weirdo's
strength is limitless.</i>

320
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:13,668
Let's make a bet.

321
00:17:13,938 --> 00:17:17,978
The term is the loser has to
fulfill the winner's request.

322
00:17:18,048 --> 00:17:19,057
Alright.

323
00:17:19,165 --> 00:17:22,045
If I win, I'll ask you to
kneel down before me.

324
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,513
I have hope.

325
00:17:23,654 --> 00:17:25,734
Is that so? Then we have a deal.

326
00:17:25,926 --> 00:17:29,006
<i>If I win, I won't listen,
even if you plead with me in tears.</i>

327
00:17:29,136 --> 00:17:30,496
What are you doing?

328
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,880
Something so abashed that
it will bring you to tears.

329
00:17:34,913 --> 00:17:38,273
I can imagine the way you cry
and beg for mercy.

330
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:41,697
You will scream for my mercy
and ask for my forgiveness.

331
00:17:41,792 --> 00:17:43,282
You are too impatient.

332
00:17:43,408 --> 00:17:44,568
Such a greedy fellow.

333
00:17:44,693 --> 00:17:48,653
I'll command you to do things
that even you can't imagine.

334
00:17:49,895 --> 00:17:51,975
Stop it.

335
00:17:52,278 --> 00:17:55,808
I want to resist, but my strength is
sucked away by Drain Touch.

336
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:58,861
<i>She's the one who has
diminished her power.</i>

337
00:18:02,107 --> 00:18:04,667
-I'll lose if this continues.
-He's good.

338
00:18:04,739 --> 00:18:07,979
I'll deplete you of your strength
until you lose consciousness.

339
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,680
Look forward to the sufferings that
you have to endure when you wake up.

340
00:18:14,683 --> 00:18:16,603
No matter how you humiliate me,

341
00:18:16,693 --> 00:18:19,053
my heart won't be subdued.

342
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:20,379
Torment?

343
00:18:21,137 --> 00:18:22,537
Torment.

344
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,730
Torment.

345
00:18:26,442 --> 00:18:28,221
Torment.

346
00:18:28,694 --> 00:18:32,174
Quick, go take a hot bath...

347
00:18:33,092 --> 00:18:34,612
and cry to your heart's content.

348
00:18:35,189 --> 00:18:36,869
Kazuma.

349
00:18:36,989 --> 00:18:40,509
What are you going to do with the
water that I've used to bathe myself?

350
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,400
Tor...

351
00:18:43,715 --> 00:18:47,715
Torment!

352
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:52,841
I won!

353
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,680
Kazuma Scum really suits you.

354
00:18:54,936 --> 00:18:56,176
You are too rude.

355
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,640
I've brought you some drinks.
Please enjoy it.

356
00:19:14,422 --> 00:19:17,056
-It's done by both of them.
-Alright, begin the punishment.

357
00:19:17,171 --> 00:19:19,291
No, it's a misunderstanding.

358
00:19:19,729 --> 00:19:20,769
Konosuba.

359
00:19:21,985 --> 00:19:24,945
My daughter finds socializing difficult.

360
00:19:25,224 --> 00:19:27,824
She was alone even after
she became a crusader.

361
00:19:28,214 --> 00:19:30,614
She went to Eris's church every day.

362
00:19:30,748 --> 00:19:33,788
And she prayed that she could find
some adventurer companions.

363
00:19:34,021 --> 00:19:35,968
One day, she came back happily.

364
00:19:36,115 --> 00:19:40,075
She said she finally had found a friend,
she's a female bandit.

365
00:19:40,409 --> 00:19:42,689
My wife passed away in her early age.

366
00:19:42,877 --> 00:19:44,797
As a man, although I did pamper her,

367
00:19:44,931 --> 00:19:47,091
I still gave her plenty of freedom.

368
00:19:47,931 --> 00:19:50,491
She shouldn't be like this.

369
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,560
No, that's her natural instinct.

370
00:19:53,078 --> 00:19:56,278
Miss Lalatina is an outstanding woman.

371
00:19:56,407 --> 00:19:57,767
If it wasn't because of Kazuma,

372
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,480
I would take her as my wife.

373
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,480
I'm sorry, but I don't understand.

374
00:20:03,819 --> 00:20:06,939
Miss Lalatina will be happier with you.

375
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:08,512
Come over here.

376
00:20:08,611 --> 00:20:10,611
I don't care if you are
the son of the Governor.

377
00:20:10,705 --> 00:20:11,825
Stop, Kazuma.

378
00:20:11,906 --> 00:20:14,626
Don't drag me down.

379
00:20:17,762 --> 00:20:21,322
Kazuma, from now on,
I shall leave my daughter to you.

380
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:26,047
Help me look after her.
Don't let her act foolishly.

381
00:20:27,328 --> 00:20:28,384
I beg of you.

382
00:20:28,511 --> 00:20:30,391
Alright.

383
00:20:36,598 --> 00:20:37,998
Are you awake?

384
00:20:40,452 --> 00:20:42,652
Is this the after-effect?

385
00:20:43,496 --> 00:20:45,824
We did lewd things after
I lost consciousness?

386
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,384
No, I didn't do anything to you.

387
00:20:48,576 --> 00:20:49,853
While you were sleeping,

388
00:20:49,952 --> 00:20:52,320
this baffling atmosphere set upon us.

389
00:20:57,392 --> 00:20:59,592
Father, Sir Walter.

390
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,020
Please discard this idea of marriage.

391
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:05,609
Although I've hidden the truth from you,

392
00:21:05,785 --> 00:21:07,776
actually, I am carrying Kazuma's baby.

393
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,800
What are you talking about?
I am still a virgin.

394
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,280
Is that so? You are with Kazuma's child?

395
00:21:16,951 --> 00:21:19,631
I'll tell father that I'm the one who
rejected this marriage proposal.

396
00:21:19,797 --> 00:21:21,957
This way, it'll be more
convenient for you.

397
00:21:27,382 --> 00:21:29,302
<i>He is such a good man.</i>

398
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,040
<i>Truthfully, please do me a favor
and take away Darkness.</i>

399
00:21:34,365 --> 00:21:36,925
Grandchild. My first grandchild.

400
00:21:37,267 --> 00:21:41,947
Am I going to have a cute grandchild?

401
00:21:43,685 --> 00:21:46,624
I've never thought that you two
have this kind of relationship.

402
00:21:46,752 --> 00:21:48,089
I need to be quick.

403
00:21:48,171 --> 00:21:50,571
I need to tell everybody in this town.

404
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,080
-Kazuma and Darkness.
-How could you believe that?

405
00:21:56,278 --> 00:21:57,424
Satou Kazuma.

406
00:21:57,597 --> 00:22:00,237
Is Satou Kazuma here?

407
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:33,518
