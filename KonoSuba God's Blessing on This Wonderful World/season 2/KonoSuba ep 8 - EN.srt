1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:02,710
Chicken Race.

2
00:00:03,302 --> 00:00:06,382
It is a game of speed whereby they
charge at an obstacle at full speed...

3
00:00:06,487 --> 00:00:09,087
and pull back at the last second...

4
00:00:09,182 --> 00:00:10,622
to prove their bravery.

5
00:00:12,175 --> 00:00:16,855
And now, she is chosen as the obstacle
in this extremely dangerous game.

6
00:00:17,568 --> 00:00:20,088
They are coming!

7
00:00:20,198 --> 00:00:21,216
Kazuma,

8
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,744
it's really too late this time.

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,920
They are going to knock me down!

10
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:38,701
Kazuma, is this some
kind of teasing play?

11
00:00:38,835 --> 00:00:41,435
The sensation of almost
being hit is quite addictive!

12
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,890
What is this? Male ostriches in heat
are continuously leaping over me.

13
00:00:47,117 --> 00:00:48,512
Enough, we have audiences!

14
00:00:48,608 --> 00:00:50,483
Shut up!

15
00:00:58,854 --> 00:01:04,254
(KONOSUBA:
God's Blessing on This Wonderful World! 2)

16
00:02:21,712 --> 00:02:22,792
Blessing.

17
00:02:22,925 --> 00:02:25,124
(Episode 8:
Sightseeing in This Pitiful City!)

18
00:02:25,754 --> 00:02:27,114
No need to trouble yourself.

19
00:02:30,506 --> 00:02:32,466
Looks like Darkness will be fine.

20
00:02:32,544 --> 00:02:34,504
It's all because of my Blessing.

21
00:02:34,584 --> 00:02:37,664
Yes. After we are done with this,
I'll exchange the seat with you.

22
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:38,784
Great.

23
00:02:39,196 --> 00:02:40,556
Lightning.

24
00:02:40,713 --> 00:02:42,147
Blade of wind.

25
00:02:42,724 --> 00:02:44,444
Fireball.

26
00:02:57,215 --> 00:02:58,615
Are they coming again?

27
00:02:58,717 --> 00:02:59,757
That's great!

28
00:03:02,563 --> 00:03:04,843
Mister, are there any cliffs around here?

29
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:08,608
No, we only have caves for
shelter when it's raining.

30
00:03:09,029 --> 00:03:11,669
Cave? That will do. Bring me there.

31
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,650
Megumin and Aqua,
let's hop into the carriage.

32
00:03:14,072 --> 00:03:15,432
Let's go, Darkness.

33
00:03:16,552 --> 00:03:18,912
You are too heavy to be carried around.

34
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,000
Don't say that I'm too heavy.

35
00:03:21,287 --> 00:03:24,007
Correct yourself. It should be
my Armour that is too heavy.

36
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:28,019
Just tie me at the back of the
carriage and drag me along.

37
00:03:28,106 --> 00:03:29,946
This is an emergency.
We don't have any other ways.

38
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,480
No need to be modest with me.
We had run out of options.

39
00:03:33,476 --> 00:03:36,676
Please be faster, Mister.
They are closing in!

40
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:39,238
Darkness, tell me if you
can't take it anymore.

41
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,470
I'll untie you immediately.

42
00:03:41,978 --> 00:03:44,738
Being bound and dragged
behind a carriage...

43
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:48,071
and all the while chased
by male ostriches.

44
00:04:00,211 --> 00:04:02,571
-Kazuma, this feels good!
-Don't call out my name!

45
00:04:02,649 --> 00:04:05,729
This is a new discovery,
being treated inhumanely like this!

46
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:10,036
Although I knew that Kazuma was evil,
even this is too much.

47
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,200
No, it's not like that. It's not me.
Darkness is the one who suggested it.

48
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:15,501
Mister.

49
00:04:15,693 --> 00:04:17,813
At this rate, they are going
to catch up with us.

50
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:21,088
This is bad. Mister, where is that cave?

51
00:04:21,193 --> 00:04:24,033
-There's still some distance.
-We can't make it!

52
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,896
Bottomless swamp.

53
00:04:32,626 --> 00:04:33,866
Thank you, Wiz.

54
00:04:37,717 --> 00:04:40,877
For an aristocrat to be
in such a sorry state.

55
00:04:41,405 --> 00:04:42,449
No, this can't do.

56
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,900
Don't look at me, Kazuma.

57
00:04:43,988 --> 00:04:48,268
-Don't look at my disheveled state.
-I told you not to call out my name!

58
00:04:48,777 --> 00:04:51,857
Heal...

59
00:04:51,978 --> 00:04:53,538
Hang in there, Darkness.

60
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,240
Kazuma, I can see the cave already.

61
00:04:56,369 --> 00:04:58,880
I am ready to release my magic.

62
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,490
Alright, Mister, stop the carriage
beside the opening of the cave.

63
00:05:02,587 --> 00:05:03,682
-Roger that.
-Aqua.

64
00:05:03,795 --> 00:05:05,955
Back me up with magic
to increase my power.

65
00:05:06,066 --> 00:05:07,072
Roger that.

66
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,288
Powered.

67
00:05:12,135 --> 00:05:15,775
Snipe...

68
00:05:26,803 --> 00:05:27,883
I see it now.

69
00:05:28,272 --> 00:05:30,032
I was just wondering,

70
00:05:30,123 --> 00:05:32,483
where is the natural instinct of
the Charging Ostriches?

71
00:05:32,554 --> 00:05:33,674
Now I can see it clearly.

72
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:36,811
Mister, hang in there!

73
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,984
Alright.

74
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:04,548
This play is not bad at all.
This is expected from Kazuma!

75
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,883
-He drags me on for so long...
-Don't call me.

76
00:06:05,984 --> 00:06:07,250
and tosses me towards the
monsters to be fed on.

77
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,800
-Megumin.
-Explosion!

78
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:30,432
Please enjoy the food.

79
00:06:30,584 --> 00:06:32,224
This is nicely roasted.
Please have a taste.

80
00:06:32,372 --> 00:06:34,212
It was so beautiful.

81
00:06:34,368 --> 00:06:35,968
I've never thought I could meet...

82
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:38,687
a powerful magician who could
wield Explosion Magic.

83
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:43,478
And an archpriest that can
easily heal so many injuries.

84
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,040
A courageous crusader who
stood firm and willing...

85
00:06:46,144 --> 00:06:49,534
to sacrifice herself as a decoy to
bait a herd of charging ostriches

86
00:06:49,632 --> 00:06:52,957
You who wielded a high-class
Swamp Magic to buy some time.

87
00:06:53,027 --> 00:06:56,987
And, of course, you, who lured the
enemies into the caves using your wit.

88
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,050
And you rounded them up
with your resourcefulness.

89
00:06:59,742 --> 00:07:00,982
It was too impressive.

90
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:02,942
It's enough.

91
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:04,669
It's not like that at all.

92
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:06,269
It's our fault.

93
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,200
This is just a small token of our
appreciation. Please accept it.

94
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,244
No, really, there's no need for it.

95
00:07:12,352 --> 00:07:14,144
What are you talking about?

96
00:07:14,272 --> 00:07:17,272
You are the ones who defeated
the Charging Ostriches.

97
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,600
It's our duty as adventurers
to contribute to the battle.

98
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:22,341
You are a great man.

99
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,280
I've never thought that
true adventurers...

100
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,829
like you still exist
in this selfish world.

101
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,280
I couldn't possibly accept this
reward that I didn't deserve.

102
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,880
Konosuba.

103
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,520
Thank you for your support.

104
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,590
It's not easy to repair this.

105
00:08:02,109 --> 00:08:05,309
But from the looks of it,
you are fixing it with ease.

106
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:09,538
I'm thrilled to be able to see
my amour being repaired...

107
00:08:09,617 --> 00:08:10,857
right in front of my eyes.

108
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,728
I'm glad that the smithing skills
that I've learned for...

109
00:08:13,858 --> 00:08:15,298
product development can be put to use.

110
00:08:16,424 --> 00:08:18,624
Again, encore!

111
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,520
We will pay for it. Please.

112
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:25,439
She can probably make
a better living through this.

113
00:08:43,405 --> 00:08:44,416
Wake up, Megumin.

114
00:08:44,693 --> 00:08:45,693
Something is wrong.

115
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,882
Megumin, Wiz, wake up!

116
00:08:51,174 --> 00:08:53,934
If you don't, I'll do something
shameful to you.

117
00:08:54,249 --> 00:08:56,169
Can I? I can, right?

118
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,220
You can't, of course.
What are you trying to do?

119
00:09:00,016 --> 00:09:02,216
Don't scare me like that.

120
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,560
I almost did something bad to you.

121
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,080
Seriously, what are you trying to do?

122
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,660
Let's not talk about this first.

123
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,280
Somebody is coming. Everybody, wake up.

124
00:09:17,328 --> 00:09:18,608
Farsight.

125
00:09:23,367 --> 00:09:24,727
There are a lot of them.

126
00:09:24,915 --> 00:09:26,115
But they are moving very slowly.

127
00:09:36,484 --> 00:09:39,004
Handle the things over here.
I'll get Aqua.

128
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,800
<i>It's our chance to make it up to them.</i>

129
00:09:41,876 --> 00:09:45,516
<i>We had brought them ostrich trouble
during the day because of Darkness.</i>

130
00:09:47,223 --> 00:09:50,863
What is happening? Why am I surrounded
by the undead when I wake up?

131
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:53,221
Sir Kazuma!

132
00:09:55,186 --> 00:09:56,759
<i>Don't tell me that...</i>

133
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,690
You dare to creep up on us
in the middle of the night, undead?

134
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,400
To the lost souls, rest in peace.

135
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,120
Turn undead.

136
00:10:17,479 --> 00:10:20,719
Hang on, Wiz. Somebody, please help...

137
00:10:20,801 --> 00:10:22,881
Amazing. She took care of
the zombies in a split second.

138
00:10:24,973 --> 00:10:26,093
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

139
00:10:26,973 --> 00:10:29,773
It's their bad luck for running into me.

140
00:10:29,881 --> 00:10:32,561
Look, I am going to purify
each and every one of you.

141
00:10:33,456 --> 00:10:34,536
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

142
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:36,919
Such a beautiful archpriest.

143
00:10:36,992 --> 00:10:38,543
She looks like a Goddess.

144
00:10:39,057 --> 00:10:42,337
She is the companion of that crusader.

145
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:44,736
<i>I'm terribly sorry.</i>

146
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,610
<i>I'm sorry for the continuous troubles
caused by my companions.</i>

147
00:10:47,727 --> 00:10:50,687
Although a zombie attack is rare,

148
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:53,824
I'm glad the archpriest is with us.

149
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:56,039
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

150
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,984
<i>If it wasn't for our Goddess,</i>

151
00:10:58,086 --> 00:11:00,926
<i>those zombies wouldn't even
come here in the first place.</i>

152
00:11:02,233 --> 00:11:05,353
How was it, Kazuma? My Goddess grandeur?

153
00:11:05,451 --> 00:11:08,091
I've proven myself
quite a bit on this trip.

154
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:10,421
It's high time for you to
offer me some tributes.

155
00:11:10,496 --> 00:11:12,763
You wouldn't be punished for it.

156
00:11:12,894 --> 00:11:15,334
You have saved us again.

157
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:18,259
This time, you must accept the reward.

158
00:11:18,385 --> 00:11:21,442
I'm sorry, but I won't
accept it no matter what.

159
00:11:23,112 --> 00:11:25,512
Please wrap this up for me.

160
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,624
Alright.

161
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,031
Open the door.

162
00:11:30,127 --> 00:11:32,647
I'm going to settle our
score today, Megumin.

163
00:11:32,832 --> 00:11:35,592
This is just a little gift from me.
Let's enjoy it together.

164
00:11:38,007 --> 00:11:39,327
Anybody home?

165
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,200
Quick, look at that.

166
00:12:07,616 --> 00:12:10,200
We have reached the city
of water and hot springs,

167
00:12:10,428 --> 00:12:11,708
Arcanretia.

168
00:12:26,816 --> 00:12:28,959
Awesome! Elves and dwarfs.

169
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,900
This is like a fantasy.

170
00:12:32,035 --> 00:12:34,595
The scenery is totally
different from Axel's.

171
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,760
And the air is fresh too.

172
00:12:39,441 --> 00:12:42,201
Steamed buns. Anybody wants
to buy a steamed bun?

173
00:12:42,286 --> 00:12:44,846
Those are their local specialties,
Arcan steamed buns.

174
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:46,932
I heard that they are delicious
and they are quite popular.

175
00:12:47,229 --> 00:12:48,989
Megumin, you sure did your research.

176
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:53,344
Arcanretia is quite renowned among
adventurers as a healing spot.

177
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,340
The hot springs here bring
extraordinary results.

178
00:12:58,066 --> 00:13:02,026
My father had brought me
to various cities in the past.

179
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:04,519
But this city is more
beautiful than any of them.

180
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,920
These healing hot springs
should be quite good.

181
00:13:08,108 --> 00:13:09,148
If I'd known earlier,

182
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,120
we would have traveled to
various cities all this while.

183
00:13:13,845 --> 00:13:16,365
My fellow customers,
have a wonderful holiday.

184
00:13:16,527 --> 00:13:18,527
Thank you, Mister.

185
00:13:20,526 --> 00:13:23,846
Jarippa, Jarippa is gone now.

186
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,120
She gave out a strange name again.

187
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,290
Where should we go, everybody?

188
00:13:30,402 --> 00:13:32,442
You can go ahead and ask me
anything about this city.

189
00:13:32,626 --> 00:13:36,866
The base camp of the Axis cult under
my protection is located right here.

190
00:13:38,115 --> 00:13:41,395
<i>The Axis Cult that is full of weirdos?</i>

191
00:13:41,561 --> 00:13:43,801
<i>Their base camp is here?</i>

192
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,821
<i>No wonder she wants
to come here so badly.</i>

193
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:51,629
Welcome to Arcanretia.

194
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,120
Are you here for a tour? To convert?

195
00:13:53,216 --> 00:13:54,667
For adventures? Or to be baptized?

196
00:13:54,741 --> 00:13:58,461
If you are looking for a job,
please visit the Axis Church.

197
00:13:58,592 --> 00:13:59,990
We have a vacancy right now.

198
00:14:00,068 --> 00:14:03,232
You can earn money by doing missionary
work for Axis Cult in other cities.

199
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,579
If you accept this job,
you will be privileged...

200
00:14:05,696 --> 00:14:07,840
to call yourself a follower
of the Axis Cult.

201
00:14:07,968 --> 00:14:10,125
Please! Join us! Quick!

202
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,646
Such beautiful blue-colored hair.

203
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:16,759
Is that your natural hair color?
I'm so jealous of you.

204
00:14:16,864 --> 00:14:19,971
Your priest garment that looks exactly
like Goddess Aqua's suits you too.

205
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,983
Let's head to our inn first.

206
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,986
You are right.

207
00:14:25,357 --> 00:14:28,157
We already have a priest
from the Axis Cult with us.

208
00:14:28,276 --> 00:14:29,596
We shall take our leave then.

209
00:14:30,322 --> 00:14:31,922
Goodbye, comrades.

210
00:14:32,017 --> 00:14:34,737
Have a nice day ahead of you.

211
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,920
Konosuba.

212
00:14:54,984 --> 00:14:56,064
Come here.

213
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,159
Over here.

214
00:15:01,638 --> 00:15:02,758
Where am I?

215
00:15:03,101 --> 00:15:06,341
Don't worry, we have reached Arcanretia.

216
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:09,707
It felt like Sir Beldia is
waving happily to me...

217
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,840
across a crystal clear river.

218
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,420
Thank you, Mr. Kazuma.

219
00:15:17,586 --> 00:15:19,755
You should thank Darkness instead.

220
00:15:20,025 --> 00:15:22,225
As long as you can come back safely.

221
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,560
I hope that Aqua hasn't brought us...

222
00:15:24,672 --> 00:15:26,992
any trouble again.

223
00:15:27,407 --> 00:15:31,087
I'm going to have some fun in the
headquarters of Axis Cult here.

224
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,952
Let them serve this archpriest properly.

225
00:15:35,972 --> 00:15:37,128
I'm worried.

226
00:15:37,452 --> 00:15:39,172
It should be no problem.

227
00:15:39,296 --> 00:15:41,320
Megumin has tagged along too.

228
00:15:41,555 --> 00:15:43,595
Is that so?

229
00:15:44,092 --> 00:15:46,012
I'm fine now.

230
00:15:46,134 --> 00:15:48,614
Why don't you go out and
walk around the city?

231
00:15:48,797 --> 00:15:50,397
Let's go, Kazuma.

232
00:15:50,752 --> 00:15:52,572
I would like to go sightseeing.

233
00:15:55,271 --> 00:15:57,831
Look, Kazuma, a fountain.

234
00:15:59,028 --> 00:16:00,068
You are right.

235
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,840
Such a beautiful statue of their Goddess.

236
00:16:03,203 --> 00:16:04,283
<i>This is fraud.</i>

237
00:16:10,191 --> 00:16:11,363
My apples.

238
00:16:11,622 --> 00:16:12,742
Are you alright?

239
00:16:16,165 --> 00:16:17,860
Thank you.

240
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,800
Thank you for your generous help.

241
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:21,579
Actually...

242
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:26,030
can you give me a chance
to thank you properly?

243
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,680
What? Is this some kind of hint?

244
00:16:33,406 --> 00:16:36,896
There's a café run by upfront.
It's managed by the Axis Cult.

245
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:38,688
Let's have a talk over there.

246
00:16:38,783 --> 00:16:39,823
No need for that.

247
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:42,144
Please wait for a while.

248
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,160
Actually, I'm a good fortune teller.

249
00:16:44,234 --> 00:16:46,784
To express my gratitude,
please let me read your fortune.

250
00:16:46,921 --> 00:16:50,560
It's alright. I don't need it.

251
00:16:50,703 --> 00:16:52,480
Let go of me.

252
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,903
It's painful.

253
00:16:54,016 --> 00:16:58,281
I've read your fortune. There will be
misfortunes waiting for you.

254
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,781
But you can avoid that
by joining the Axis Cult.

255
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,574
Join us!

256
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:07,011
That misfortune is standing
in front of me now.

257
00:17:07,104 --> 00:17:08,512
Let go of me.

258
00:17:08,647 --> 00:17:10,560
Darkness, help me.

259
00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:11,869
I'm sorry.

260
00:17:12,141 --> 00:17:14,301
I'm a follower of Eris.

261
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:17,628
If you wish to convert him,
you need to go through me first.

262
00:17:27,757 --> 00:17:29,877
About that...

263
00:17:30,037 --> 00:17:33,197
The relationship between the Axis Cult
and the Eris Cult is strained.

264
00:17:33,274 --> 00:17:34,994
It's better if you keep
away your insignia.

265
00:17:35,065 --> 00:17:36,585
Don't let it bother you.

266
00:17:38,829 --> 00:17:40,989
Are you excited?

267
00:17:41,475 --> 00:17:42,475
No.

268
00:17:42,653 --> 00:17:44,373
But...

269
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,000
This is really the base camp
for the Axis Cult.

270
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:52,743
There are not many people here.

271
00:17:52,826 --> 00:17:54,026
We should be fine.

272
00:17:54,842 --> 00:17:56,082
Help.

273
00:17:56,254 --> 00:17:58,374
Those two over there. Help me.

274
00:17:58,732 --> 00:18:01,332
This vicious man, who is
probably an Eris Cult believer...

275
00:18:01,427 --> 00:18:04,227
tried to force himself
on me in a dark alley.

276
00:18:05,072 --> 00:18:06,672
The man over there,

277
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,480
you are not from the Axis Cult, right?

278
00:18:09,594 --> 00:18:11,744
I would have run away

279
00:18:11,874 --> 00:18:13,154
if you were a strong
and handsome Axis cult believer.

280
00:18:13,312 --> 00:18:15,392
Since you are not, I shall do it my way.

281
00:18:15,513 --> 00:18:17,408
If you stand in my way,
I, who is protected by Eris,

282
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,900
the Goddess of Darkness,
will have you subdued in no time.

283
00:18:21,575 --> 00:18:25,975
What's this? In my hand are the
sign-in forms for Axis Cult.

284
00:18:26,144 --> 00:18:28,513
If someone is willing to
sign their names on them,

285
00:18:28,584 --> 00:18:31,174
this evil Eris believer
will definitely run away.

286
00:18:33,808 --> 00:18:35,608
Both of you, please,
don't ignore my peril.

287
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:38,227
It's alright. You just need
to write your name on it.

288
00:18:38,336 --> 00:18:40,209
Our powerful Goddess,
Aqua will bestow you

289
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,741
with strength and good looks.

290
00:18:41,899 --> 00:18:43,584
That Eris believer will also run away...

291
00:18:43,718 --> 00:18:46,159
when faced with her immense power.

292
00:18:46,237 --> 00:18:49,797
Yes. After you join the cult,
you will be multi-talented.

293
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,098
And you will be loved by the undead.

294
00:18:52,202 --> 00:18:54,016
There will be various kinds
of blessings as well.

295
00:18:54,113 --> 00:18:57,033
Don't say that Eris is a Goddess
of Darkness in front of me.

296
00:19:02,818 --> 00:19:05,418
Are all the believers of
the Axis Cult like this?

297
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,760
<i>Don't tell me that all the believers
of Eris Cult are like her?</i>

298
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:12,879
-You are excited, right?
-I'm not.

299
00:19:12,963 --> 00:19:14,643
Congratulations!

300
00:19:14,748 --> 00:19:18,268
You are the number one million
person that stepped on this road.

301
00:19:18,373 --> 00:19:21,293
As a commemoration, I would like
to present you with this souvenir.

302
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:23,627
But the souvenir is actually
sponsored by Axis Cult.

303
00:19:23,713 --> 00:19:25,713
This is just paperwork.

304
00:19:25,824 --> 00:19:30,274
In order to redeem your souvenir,
can you sign here, please?

305
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,804
Oh my gosh!

306
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:34,239
Long time no see.

307
00:19:34,327 --> 00:19:36,447
It's me. How are you?

308
00:19:36,528 --> 00:19:40,728
I went to the same school as you,
I'm your classmate.

309
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:41,824
Do you remember me?

310
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:43,689
After I joined the Axis Cult,

311
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,264
I changed a lot.

312
00:19:45,344 --> 00:19:47,000
I don't think you can recognize me now.

313
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,544
Wait.

314
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,264
Are you two newlyweds? How sweet.

315
00:19:51,374 --> 00:19:53,824
Please accept this detergent.

316
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,040
No need to pay for it. It's my
blessing for you, newlyweds.

317
00:19:58,145 --> 00:20:00,032
This detergent is really powerful.

318
00:20:00,164 --> 00:20:02,336
Because it's blessed
by our Goddess, Aqua.

319
00:20:02,459 --> 00:20:04,619
It can remove any tough stains.

320
00:20:04,722 --> 00:20:07,233
And it's not harmful to the body.

321
00:20:07,585 --> 00:20:09,905
It's true. You can even drink it.

322
00:20:14,551 --> 00:20:16,826
What is wrong with this city?

323
00:20:17,231 --> 00:20:19,551
This is a test for me in this pagan land.

324
00:20:20,822 --> 00:20:22,102
It's so satisfying.

325
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,581
You are really unaffected.

326
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,020
Sorry for the wait.

327
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,840
For the customer of Eris Cult,

328
00:20:31,361 --> 00:20:33,841
our shop has specially
prepared this for you.

329
00:20:34,664 --> 00:20:36,464
Please enjoy.

330
00:20:39,356 --> 00:20:40,553
Kazuma.

331
00:20:40,689 --> 00:20:42,809
Let us all stay in this city.

332
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,160
Definitely no.

333
00:20:44,802 --> 00:20:45,922
Konosuba.

334
00:20:49,389 --> 00:20:51,349
Let's go back to the inn.

335
00:20:58,086 --> 00:20:59,104
Are you alright?

336
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,640
How is it? Let me see.

337
00:21:02,824 --> 00:21:04,224
It's just a scratch.

338
00:21:04,344 --> 00:21:06,742
Thank you, brother and sister.

339
00:21:07,877 --> 00:21:10,637
<i>In this city that is full of
religious nutcases,</i>

340
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,908
<i>at least, this young girl
still blooms like a flower.</i>

341
00:21:13,668 --> 00:21:14,688
There.

342
00:21:15,329 --> 00:21:16,569
How are you, are you still in pain?

343
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:19,515
I'm fine, thank you.

344
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:22,893
Kind brother, tell me your name.

345
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,400
Kazuma, Satou Kazuma.

346
00:21:25,715 --> 00:21:27,915
And this fierce-looking
sister is called Darkness.

347
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,115
Don't make such a weird introduction.

348
00:21:30,211 --> 00:21:33,211
Am I fierce looking?

349
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,140
How do you write "Satou Kazuma"?

350
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,280
Can you show me, brother?

351
00:21:39,521 --> 00:21:41,601
Alright, my name is like...

352
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:54,083
