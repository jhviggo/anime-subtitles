1
00:00:08,601 --> 00:00:12,001
I've prepared the highest quality
black tea, Mr. Kazuma.

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,280
Alright.

3
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:19,446
This is just hot water.

4
00:00:20,796 --> 00:00:23,236
So careless of me.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,160
Don't tell me that you have
purified the black tea.

6
00:00:26,492 --> 00:00:28,652
I'm sorry, Mr. Kazuma.

7
00:00:28,797 --> 00:00:30,317
You can just make the tea again.

8
00:00:30,468 --> 00:00:33,200
Thank you, Aqua. I'll drink this.

9
00:00:35,027 --> 00:00:36,907
Yes, this is hot water.

10
00:00:37,082 --> 00:00:39,060
This is so disgusting!

11
00:00:47,584 --> 00:00:53,624
(KONOSUBA:
God's Blessing on This Wonderful World! 2)

12
00:02:10,636 --> 00:02:11,676
(Episode 7:
An Invitation for This Knucklehead!)

13
00:02:11,776 --> 00:02:13,395
I apologize for the incident that
happened a few days ago.

14
00:02:13,504 --> 00:02:16,160
So, please turn yourself back
to the previous Kazuma.

15
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,580
The incident that happened
a few days ago?

16
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,900
What do you mean by Excalibur,
the sacred sword?

17
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,240
Do you mean that incident?

18
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,650
As they say, rich people don't argue.

19
00:02:26,882 --> 00:02:29,602
By the way, would you like
to drink some tea, Megumin?

20
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,920
I happened to have some
high-quality tea leaves.

21
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,962
It's my fault.

22
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,728
Please turn yourself back
to the previous Kazuma.

23
00:02:37,805 --> 00:02:40,672
The Kazuma now is very disgusting.

24
00:02:40,778 --> 00:02:42,418
What are you talking about?

25
00:02:42,648 --> 00:02:44,568
I have always been like this.

26
00:02:44,755 --> 00:02:48,435
I've prepared the highest quality
black tea again, Mr. Kazuma.

27
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,720
This is just hot water.

28
00:02:55,046 --> 00:02:56,686
You have purified it again.

29
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,570
What's wrong with me? I'm so careless.

30
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,680
Never mind. You can make it again.

31
00:03:04,897 --> 00:03:06,257
Thank you, Aqua.

32
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,880
I shall drink this then.

33
00:03:08,974 --> 00:03:10,174
Actually...

34
00:03:10,785 --> 00:03:12,865
That Lolita!

35
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:14,899
I'll skin her when she's back.

36
00:03:14,997 --> 00:03:17,357
I'll definitely do it!

37
00:03:17,429 --> 00:03:20,096
And then, even this competitive
girl will cry piteously...

38
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:22,209
and beg my forgiveness.

39
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,560
Can you be more specific about the
method that will make Megumin wail?

40
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,490
Why are you making such
a ruckus early in the morning?

41
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,000
Please stay as calm as me, everyone.

42
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,144
Yesterday after I came back,
besides bathing,

43
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,440
I chilled here all day long.

44
00:03:36,526 --> 00:03:39,966
I don't wish to be criticized
by a good-for-nothing.

45
00:03:40,072 --> 00:03:42,720
Darn it! I won't forgive her!

46
00:03:42,837 --> 00:03:46,237
I can already imagine
her wailing face now.

47
00:03:46,324 --> 00:03:49,164
Can you be more specific about
how you will make her wail?

48
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:53,511
Is she back?

49
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,720
-Can you be more specific?
-Megumin, you wench!

50
00:03:57,273 --> 00:04:00,313
Are you expecting that abnormal girl
from the Crimson Magic Clan?

51
00:04:00,463 --> 00:04:02,223
Pity. It's just me.

52
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:04,192
Instead of that useless shopkeeper,

53
00:04:04,312 --> 00:04:07,432
you have me, a universally recognized
connoisseur, to negotiate with you.

54
00:04:07,521 --> 00:04:10,281
Rejoice and worship my appearance.

55
00:04:10,448 --> 00:04:13,048
Let me show you the products in our shop.

56
00:04:14,559 --> 00:04:15,771
Excuse me,

57
00:04:16,274 --> 00:04:18,639
how did you come in?

58
00:04:19,616 --> 00:04:21,088
That useless junk?

59
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,056
You call that a barrier?

60
00:04:24,182 --> 00:04:26,752
It is too weak.

61
00:04:26,871 --> 00:04:31,031
I thought it was a failed barrier
cast by a newbie priest.

62
00:04:31,124 --> 00:04:32,244
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:32,334 --> 00:04:36,938
I am too powerful that the barrier just
fell away when I walk through it.

64
00:04:41,945 --> 00:04:44,606
You are so out of shape from head to toe,

65
00:04:44,726 --> 00:04:46,606
super powerful Mr. Demon.

66
00:04:47,293 --> 00:04:48,493
What to do?

67
00:04:48,658 --> 00:04:51,552
I heard that you are the Duke of Hell.

68
00:04:51,672 --> 00:04:54,992
Did you suffer that much
from a mere barrier?

69
00:04:56,015 --> 00:04:58,055
This body is made out of the dirt.

70
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,044
I can never run out of it.

71
00:05:00,141 --> 00:05:04,661
I am quite interested in the thin veil
that covers this house.

72
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:09,181
It's quite well for a new priest.

73
00:05:09,355 --> 00:05:13,195
For human. Yes, it's quite well
for a new human priest.

74
00:05:14,456 --> 00:05:16,533
Calm down.

75
00:05:18,453 --> 00:05:19,853
-Kazuma.
-Yes.

76
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,720
I heard something about kotatsu.

77
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,870
-Is he here to discuss this?
-Yes.

78
00:05:24,968 --> 00:05:29,088
With this scum that lives on the
disgusted feelings of humans.

79
00:05:29,184 --> 00:05:33,227
-Your expression are over the top.
-This joke is not funny at all.

80
00:05:33,824 --> 00:05:34,880
But you are laughing.

81
00:05:34,976 --> 00:05:37,240
We demons are circumspect
with our agreement.

82
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:39,479
So you need not worry.

83
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,786
We are different from
the fraudulent group that...

84
00:05:41,859 --> 00:05:43,657
promises happiness with faith alone,

85
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,824
attracts those innocent
people with flattery,

86
00:05:45,926 --> 00:05:49,908
and makes money in the name of donations.

87
00:05:50,214 --> 00:05:52,734
What's their tenet again?

88
00:05:53,497 --> 00:05:54,697
Oh, right.

89
00:05:55,086 --> 00:05:59,146
God is always with you.

90
00:05:59,752 --> 00:06:00,832
But then, what happened?

91
00:06:00,941 --> 00:06:05,141
I saw the so-called God with my own eyes.

92
00:06:05,718 --> 00:06:07,744
The peeping Tom that was
caught a few days ago,

93
00:06:07,894 --> 00:06:11,494
the man that peeped around the
bathhouse and toilet lustfully...

94
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:13,147
happened to be a God.

95
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,224
Sacred Exorcism.

96
00:06:20,377 --> 00:06:21,408
That's a close call.

97
00:06:23,035 --> 00:06:24,475
A magnificent shedding.

98
00:06:31,555 --> 00:06:33,595
This is it, this is your original form.

99
00:06:33,675 --> 00:06:37,115
What should I do?
How should I get rid of it?

100
00:06:37,894 --> 00:06:39,214
Even if you want to destroy this mask...

101
00:06:39,284 --> 00:06:41,044
Don't try to take off the
mask while I'm still talking.

102
00:06:41,164 --> 00:06:43,328
-Stay calmly.
-My body can't take it anymore.

103
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,536
Calm down. At least wait for me
to finish my sentence.

104
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:46,792
Konosuba.

105
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,086
We can start the negotiation now.

106
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:50,607
According to our agreement,

107
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,780
I will pay you 10% of the
benefits that I get after selling.

108
00:06:54,656 --> 00:06:55,680
But how about this?

109
00:06:55,755 --> 00:06:58,635
Are you willing to sell off your
ownership rights for these objects?

110
00:06:59,361 --> 00:07:01,161
I'm willing to offer you
300 million Eris.

111
00:07:01,232 --> 00:07:02,592
300 million?

112
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,960
<i>This is an amount that can support me
for life without needing me to work.</i>

113
00:07:06,248 --> 00:07:09,528
The return interest on a monthly
basis is one million Eris per month.

114
00:07:09,609 --> 00:07:11,369
One million per month?

115
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,504
<i>There's no guarantee that
my products can be sold off.</i>

116
00:07:13,653 --> 00:07:15,413
<i>Isn't it better for me to accept
the 300 million offer?</i>

117
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,273
<i>No. One million per month can help me
avoid currency fluctuation.</i>

118
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,088
Think about it carefully.

119
00:07:23,311 --> 00:07:27,111
I'm worried about my shop,
so I shall take my leave now.

120
00:07:27,612 --> 00:07:30,752
My sacred home will be
contaminated by your stench.

121
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,269
Go out! Quick, go out!

122
00:07:38,824 --> 00:07:40,265
This is just hot water.

123
00:07:40,407 --> 00:07:42,327
What's wrong with me.

124
00:07:43,868 --> 00:07:46,388
They have been continuing on
like this after that incident.

125
00:07:46,657 --> 00:07:48,937
Now I know why they keep up
with the façade of nobility.

126
00:07:49,295 --> 00:07:51,735
But it's good that we have money.

127
00:07:51,903 --> 00:07:54,143
Alright, let's hunt for some monsters.

128
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,890
No, what are you talking about?

129
00:07:57,224 --> 00:07:58,720
We have so much money.

130
00:07:58,862 --> 00:08:01,102
Why do we need to work?

131
00:08:03,351 --> 00:08:04,351
Besides,

132
00:08:04,447 --> 00:08:07,167
I still died despite having
prepared the equipment

133
00:08:07,264 --> 00:08:08,567
and set up the battle plan.

134
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:11,569
I've made up my mind. From now on,
I'll conduct business instead.

135
00:08:11,684 --> 00:08:13,724
And give up this dangerous
career as an adventurer.

136
00:08:13,805 --> 00:08:15,845
I'm going to live a satisfying life.

137
00:08:16,036 --> 00:08:19,744
It'll be troublesome for me
if you do that, Mr. Kazuma.

138
00:08:19,936 --> 00:08:23,136
It will be difficult for me if we
don't defeat the Devil King's army.

139
00:08:23,232 --> 00:08:25,072
Then we shall earn more money...

140
00:08:25,184 --> 00:08:27,181
and hire more highly skilled adventurers.

141
00:08:27,326 --> 00:08:30,686
Then, they can help me battle
the Devil King's army.

142
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:34,030
We will lead an army of adventurers
and take down the Devil King's castle.

143
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:36,863
How about that?
Aren't you feeling hopeful?

144
00:08:37,088 --> 00:08:39,264
That's right. You are really great,
Mr. Kazuma.

145
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:42,272
You can recklessly order those
adventurers around with lots of money.

146
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,744
When the Devil King is weakened,

147
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,440
you can use the opportunity
to strike the last blow.

148
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,150
That's right.

149
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,120
I don't need to waste my time
fighting long and hard with him.

150
00:08:55,412 --> 00:08:59,412
Use the money to defeat the Devil King?
I won't agree to it.

151
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:00,782
I won't agree to it.

152
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,960
Who do you think the Devil King is?

153
00:09:03,086 --> 00:09:04,384
The Devil King...

154
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:07,293
is someone that we need to defeat
at the end of the final battle...

155
00:09:07,392 --> 00:09:09,664
using the ultimate mysterious power
that awakes within us.

156
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,240
But all you want is to hire strong
adventurers to defeat him.

157
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,868
Darkness, talk some sense into them.

158
00:09:14,944 --> 00:09:16,200
Darkness?

159
00:09:17,344 --> 00:09:21,719
No, it's just that Kazuma is getting
more useless by the day.

160
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:25,070
So I'm curious about what kind
of scum he will turn into.

161
00:09:25,778 --> 00:09:27,744
Gosh, what am I going to do?

162
00:09:27,876 --> 00:09:29,760
Don't lump me together with this pervert.

163
00:09:30,272 --> 00:09:33,820
Come to think of that, I just came
back to life after I snapped my neck.

164
00:09:33,913 --> 00:09:36,753
At least let me rest until
my old wound is healed.

165
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,784
Alright.

166
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,112
Let's heal Kazuma's wound, then.

167
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,990
It's nothing. I just need
to chill for a while.

168
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:46,765
Let's go to the hot spring
to heal your wound.

169
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,687
Let's go to the city of
water and hot springs.

170
00:09:48,776 --> 00:09:50,096
Arcanretia!

171
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,320
You needn't worry about my wound.

172
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:53,737
Did you say hot spring?

173
00:09:54,936 --> 00:09:56,640
Are you talking about Arcanretia?

174
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,490
Are you saying that we are going to...

175
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,441
the city of water and
hot springs, Arcanretia?

176
00:10:00,655 --> 00:10:02,455
Hot spring?

177
00:10:02,751 --> 00:10:06,231
We are exhausted after our continuous
battle with strong enemies.

178
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:08,969
It's nice to relax in the
hot spring once in a while.

179
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,240
Why do you sound so reluctant, Kazuma?

180
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:14,637
Konosuba.

181
00:10:15,171 --> 00:10:17,251
Are you ready, everyone?

182
00:10:17,365 --> 00:10:19,725
Of course, I'm ready.

183
00:10:19,988 --> 00:10:23,988
Seriously? Every day, the two of them
call us the good-for-nothing.

184
00:10:24,071 --> 00:10:25,551
But how much longer are
they going to sleep?

185
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:28,096
I'll go wake them up.

186
00:10:28,243 --> 00:10:30,123
Kazuma, head to the
carriage waiting area.

187
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,280
Make sure that we can get the best seats.

188
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,943
Of course. Leave it to me.

189
00:10:36,664 --> 00:10:37,744
Welcome.

190
00:10:38,644 --> 00:10:40,580
What brings you here
so early in the morning?

191
00:10:40,842 --> 00:10:42,322
I'm going to the hot spring.

192
00:10:42,445 --> 00:10:44,925
Another thing. About that deal,

193
00:10:45,008 --> 00:10:46,928
I hope that you can wait
for me until I get back.

194
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:48,419
Is that so?

195
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,307
Then, go on and relax...

196
00:10:50,485 --> 00:10:52,480
and look forward to the mixed bathing.

197
00:10:52,576 --> 00:10:55,017
Mixed bathing? I wasn't thinking of that.

198
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,200
I just want to heal the old wound
on my neck that still throbs.

199
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,060
Wait, why is Wiz all burnt up?

200
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,320
What?

201
00:11:07,493 --> 00:11:09,693
This is a very valuable object.

202
00:11:10,006 --> 00:11:12,486
You can definitely resell it.

203
00:11:12,867 --> 00:11:14,187
So, Mr. Vanir,

204
00:11:14,313 --> 00:11:16,953
please don't come near me
while you are preparing that...

205
00:11:17,056 --> 00:11:19,003
Murder Ray of yours!

206
00:11:22,672 --> 00:11:23,808
That's the whole story.

207
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,560
I wanted to return these junks,
so I was just packaging them up.

208
00:11:27,661 --> 00:11:28,701
Do you want to buy one?

209
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,574
What kind of magic item is this?

210
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,840
This is a portable toilet for
emergency use during a trip.

211
00:11:34,096 --> 00:11:36,384
This flushable toilet will emit a sound to

212
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,160
provide the users some privacy
when they use it.

213
00:11:38,287 --> 00:11:39,607
That's great!

214
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,160
The downside is the noise it emits
is loud enough to attract monsters.

215
00:11:44,426 --> 00:11:46,746
And the mechanism for generating
water is too powerful...

216
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,969
that it will create a
terrible mess all around.

217
00:11:49,095 --> 00:11:51,901
Does this shop own
any normal magic items?

218
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,846
Our useless owner...

219
00:11:56,096 --> 00:11:58,213
has this unparalleled
talent when it comes to...

220
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,460
purchasing totally useless merchandise.

221
00:12:00,832 --> 00:12:02,624
If I wasn't careful enough,

222
00:12:02,739 --> 00:12:04,736
she would purchase all kinds
of bizarre merchandise.

223
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,907
Back to the previous topic.

224
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:09,067
You said that you are
going to the hot spring?

225
00:12:15,513 --> 00:12:17,073
Welcome.

226
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,931
Didn't I tell you to get us
some good seats first?

227
00:12:22,118 --> 00:12:23,718
What is it that you are carrying?

228
00:12:25,297 --> 00:12:26,617
Konosuba.

229
00:12:27,711 --> 00:12:30,631
I would like to buy this as a present.
Can you help me wrap it up?

230
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,776
Of course.

231
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,400
Please open the door.

232
00:12:35,232 --> 00:12:38,045
We shall settle our score today, Megumin.

233
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,280
Be prepared for it!

234
00:12:41,922 --> 00:12:44,002
Anybody home?

235
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,178
Do we have to take care of her?

236
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,760
That's fine with me.

237
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,760
But she's becoming more
and more transparent.

238
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:55,425
Are you alright? Healing Magic.

239
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:58,245
No, it won't work for the undead.

240
00:12:58,552 --> 00:12:59,552
Traveling?

241
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,640
My father brought me to the
capital city when I was a child.

242
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,990
Aren't you Mr. Kazuma?

243
00:13:11,669 --> 00:13:12,989
This is an emergency.

244
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,640
Among us, your vitality is the strongest.

245
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,120
Kazuma.

246
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,000
We are going to use this carriage.

247
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:23,510
Based on my good judgment,
this carriage is the comfiest one.

248
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,280
Another thing, I would like
to sit beside the window.

249
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:27,644
I would like to reserve a seat
with the best scenery view.

250
00:13:27,795 --> 00:13:29,875
Kazuma, go and buy the tickets.

251
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,160
Before the tickets for that
carriage are sold out.

252
00:13:32,256 --> 00:13:34,087
Quick, go and buy the tickets.

253
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,919
Mister, why is that seat occupied?

254
00:13:41,338 --> 00:13:42,360
What is this?

255
00:13:42,464 --> 00:13:45,720
That's a red baby dragon, Miss.

256
00:13:45,856 --> 00:13:48,576
That seat was already paid for.

257
00:13:48,717 --> 00:13:50,477
So one of you will have to...

258
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,496
sit with the luggage although
it's uncomfortable.

259
00:13:54,686 --> 00:13:56,246
If that's the case...

260
00:13:56,672 --> 00:13:57,680
Scissors-paper-stone.

261
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,920
This situation calls for a round
of rock paper scissors.

262
00:14:01,142 --> 00:14:04,022
If that's the case,
I'll sit with the luggage.

263
00:14:04,196 --> 00:14:06,516
No, Wiz. Let's do this fair and square.

264
00:14:06,736 --> 00:14:08,976
Alright, Aqua, rock paper scissors then.

265
00:14:09,303 --> 00:14:11,063
Let's start.

266
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,400
Rock paper scissors.

267
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:15,361
I won.

268
00:14:15,431 --> 00:14:18,951
Wait, I didn't say that the
winner can walk away.

269
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:22,778
The five of us have to keep playing
until we have a loser.

270
00:14:23,006 --> 00:14:25,006
How about just you and me?

271
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,880
Three times. If you win even once,

272
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:29,879
I'll go sit with the luggage.

273
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,800
-Truly?
-Yes.

274
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:34,085
Do you know how probability works?

275
00:14:34,162 --> 00:14:37,882
It's impossible for you to win
three rounds straight, Kazuma.

276
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:42,609
I never lose in rock paper scissors.

277
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,264
This is too weird.

278
00:14:47,405 --> 00:14:49,984
You've cheated. Please, again.
Just one more time.

279
00:14:50,091 --> 00:14:52,576
Truly? Will this be the last time?

280
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,960
Do you accept? You have
accepted it, right, Kazuma?

281
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,184
Although I don't know what trick you used,

282
00:14:57,287 --> 00:15:00,087
I have had a trick up
my sleeve since you did it.

283
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,710
Blessing.

284
00:15:02,532 --> 00:15:05,412
This is so despicable. You used
magic to increase your luck.

285
00:15:05,496 --> 00:15:07,576
Luck can be considered a strength too.

286
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,790
So, the magical capability
is a part of luck too.

287
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,230
Bring it on.

288
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,120
Rock paper scissors.

289
00:15:13,274 --> 00:15:15,074
Why?

290
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:18,781
Even when I was young, I never
lost in rock paper scissors.

291
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,874
You are so despicable.
It doesn't count. It's not fair.

292
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,240
It's cheating. It's a cheating skill.

293
00:15:23,374 --> 00:15:26,174
Are you born with that ability?

294
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:28,672
If that's the case, the utmost
gracious gift that...

295
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,521
I've bestowed upon you is invalid now.

296
00:15:30,624 --> 00:15:33,375
Send me back. Send me back to heaven.

297
00:15:33,504 --> 00:15:35,920
-You dirty swine!
-You wench!

298
00:15:36,032 --> 00:15:38,816
Are you saying that my ability is in
winning rock paper scissors?

299
00:15:38,976 --> 00:15:42,296
Are you dumb? How can
I use that to fight monsters?

300
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:43,776
But...

301
00:15:43,852 --> 00:15:45,252
The most detesting thing is

302
00:15:45,376 --> 00:15:48,280
you described yourself as the
utmost gracious gift?

303
00:15:48,384 --> 00:15:49,856
What a joke.

304
00:15:49,973 --> 00:15:51,133
Gracious gift?

305
00:15:51,264 --> 00:15:53,720
I would have done it long ago

306
00:15:53,803 --> 00:15:55,683
if I could give you back
in exchange for a special ability!

307
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,930
You shouldn't have said that, Kazuma!

308
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,560
Stop, don't pull on my face.

309
00:16:05,367 --> 00:16:08,581
We will depart for Arcanretia now.

310
00:17:15,352 --> 00:17:17,072
<i>Even this scenery is new to her...</i>

311
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,000
<i>even though she is the
daughter of an aristocrat.</i>

312
00:17:24,775 --> 00:17:26,975
Chomusuke is cuter.

313
00:17:27,886 --> 00:17:29,646
I've never thought that...

314
00:17:29,877 --> 00:17:31,917
<i>I could travel like this in this world.</i>

315
00:17:33,101 --> 00:17:34,181
<i>It's quite nice.</i>

316
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,460
Mr. Kazuma.

317
00:17:36,613 --> 00:17:39,333
My backside is quite painful.

318
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,080
Someone, please exchange with me.

319
00:17:45,178 --> 00:17:47,578
I'll change to you
when we stop for a break.

320
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,760
For now, you have to endure it.

321
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,280
No way!

322
00:17:58,311 --> 00:17:59,911
Engage my farsight.

323
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,030
What is that?

324
00:18:04,269 --> 00:18:08,829
I'm sorry, but there's a dust cloud
heading toward us.

325
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,531
Do you know what that is?

326
00:18:11,689 --> 00:18:14,569
Well, I can't see it.

327
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,160
The thing that can kick up
a cloud of dust around here...

328
00:18:17,283 --> 00:18:19,715
would be a pack of Lizard Runners.

329
00:18:20,573 --> 00:18:24,453
But I heard that the Queen Runner
was defeated a while ago.

330
00:18:24,535 --> 00:18:28,320
Or it could be a Sand Whale
that kicked up the dust.

331
00:18:28,465 --> 00:18:31,585
The only other thing is the
Charging Ostriches.

332
00:18:31,662 --> 00:18:35,142
-Charging ostriches.
-This is a serious matter, Mister.

333
00:18:35,253 --> 00:18:37,733
They are dangerous monsters.

334
00:18:37,828 --> 00:18:39,948
During the mating season,
in order to woo the females,

335
00:18:40,064 --> 00:18:41,760
the males will court the females
through a race called...

336
00:18:41,857 --> 00:18:44,497
"Chicken Race" to prove their bravery.

337
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,758
They will charge toward
the hardest thing...

338
00:18:46,848 --> 00:18:48,726
and turn away when they almost hit it.

339
00:18:49,192 --> 00:18:52,000
But usually, they will choose
some nearby rocks as targets.

340
00:18:52,137 --> 00:18:53,216
So we should be fine.

341
00:18:53,344 --> 00:18:54,760
Nothing to be worried about, then.

342
00:19:01,704 --> 00:19:04,864
But looks like they are still heading
towards us quite menacingly.

343
00:19:06,095 --> 00:19:08,215
That should be the charging ostriches.

344
00:19:08,286 --> 00:19:11,646
But it's weird that they
are heading toward us.

345
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:13,408
Is it possible that we have...

346
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,520
really hard minerals in our carriage?
Minerals like adamantite?

347
00:19:19,968 --> 00:19:21,408
Looks like they are heading here.

348
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,560
I should say,
heading towards our carriage.

349
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,860
Something as tough as adamantite?

350
00:19:27,491 --> 00:19:29,089
-Dark...
-Kazuma!

351
00:19:29,196 --> 00:19:32,676
A group of incredibly fast creatures
is charging toward us.

352
00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:35,372
I can feel their heavy gaze.

353
00:19:35,721 --> 00:19:37,481
Such intense looks.

354
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:38,995
Is that you?

355
00:19:39,072 --> 00:19:41,034
Sir, we are going to stop our carriages.

356
00:19:41,153 --> 00:19:44,873
Our fellow adventurer guards
will protect you and the carriage.

357
00:19:45,455 --> 00:19:48,066
<i>I'm sorry that our crusader is too tough.</i>

358
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,040
Darkness, you are the monsters' target.

359
00:19:51,222 --> 00:19:53,632
They like to charge hard objects.

360
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,399
And their target is your
rock-hard muscles!

361
00:19:56,584 --> 00:19:59,624
Kazuma, I'm still a
young woman, after all.

362
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:01,539
It's not my rock-hard muscles,
it's my Armour.

363
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:05,989
My Armour is partly adamantite.

364
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,713
They must be here because of that.

365
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,560
It's true.

366
00:20:10,688 --> 00:20:12,168
So don't look at me like that.

367
00:20:12,264 --> 00:20:14,340
My body is not that hard.

368
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,360
Megumin, Aqua, you are up!

369
00:20:16,704 --> 00:20:18,704
This really isn't our battle,

370
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,880
but we are the ones who
attracted them here.

371
00:20:20,985 --> 00:20:23,225
We need to clean up our own mess.

372
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,040
Let me help too.

373
00:20:25,176 --> 00:20:28,016
Wiz, stay in the carriage
to protect our driver.

374
00:20:28,087 --> 00:20:29,127
Alright.

375
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:32,199
Sir, you have already paid for it.

376
00:20:32,283 --> 00:20:33,523
Please find somewhere to hide.

377
00:20:33,715 --> 00:20:36,275
I'm sorry, but this is
our companion's fault.

378
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:40,070
We shall leave this to you,
our fellow adventurers.

379
00:20:40,211 --> 00:20:41,851
-Leave.
-This matter.

380
00:20:41,952 --> 00:20:43,395
-To us.
-Step away.

381
00:20:48,494 --> 00:20:50,611
Megumin, be prepared to release
your explosion magic.

382
00:20:50,763 --> 00:20:52,203
Understood.

383
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:54,919
That crusader over there.

384
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,640
You are not one of the guards,
please step back!

385
00:20:58,248 --> 00:21:02,031
The monsters are charging
toward that crusader.

386
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,960
She's a decoy.

387
00:21:04,261 --> 00:21:06,021
That crusader is using her Decoy skill...

388
00:21:06,126 --> 00:21:07,686
to become bait.

389
00:21:07,772 --> 00:21:08,972
That crusader...

390
00:21:09,052 --> 00:21:11,772
is not a guard, but she's willing
to take on all those monsters.

391
00:21:12,069 --> 00:21:14,349
<i>I'm sorry, but she
doesn't have that skill.</i>

392
00:21:14,445 --> 00:21:17,205
She won't budge even though she's
facing a large number of monsters.

393
00:21:17,396 --> 00:21:18,916
She's so brave.

394
00:21:19,163 --> 00:21:22,043
<i>I'm sorry, but being brave
is not her reason at all.</i>

395
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:25,359
She is a customer.
She is not a paid guard.

396
00:21:25,472 --> 00:21:26,970
She can't be exposed to danger.

397
00:21:27,056 --> 00:21:28,256
I'll back her up!

398
00:21:28,327 --> 00:21:29,603
Bind!

399
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,752
What?

400
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,840
Are you worried that the monsters...

401
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,456
will target me instead if I use Bind?

402
00:21:43,597 --> 00:21:45,317
Is that why you sacrificed yourself?

403
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,423
I'm sorry, I just want to help you.

404
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,986
But I've brought trouble to you instead.

405
00:21:49,106 --> 00:21:50,506
Please forgive me.

406
00:21:50,704 --> 00:21:52,824
Forgive me.

407
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,392
I'm sorry.

408
00:21:55,515 --> 00:21:56,864
Please forgive my companion.

409
00:21:56,976 --> 00:22:01,256
Truly, please forgive this pervert
for the trouble that she's caused.

410

Sightseeing in This Pitiful City!)
