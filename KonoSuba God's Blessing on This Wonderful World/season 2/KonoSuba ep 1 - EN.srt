ENTER REVIVAL SPELL

00:00:02,349 --> 00:00:05,909
KAZUMA IS INVINCIBLE IN WONDERFUL WORLD

00:00:06,066 --> 00:00:09,146
SPELL INCORRECT
THE ADVENTURE BOOK IS FADING AWAY

00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,970
GOD'S BLESSING ON THIS WONDERFUL WORLD

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,230
<i>My name is Satou Kazuma,</i>

6
00:00:16,576 --> 00:00:19,168
<i>I am the Etranger who is
fated to defeat the Devil.</i>

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,252
<i>The Goddess of Fate led and
reincarnated my soul in another world.</i>

8
00:00:23,744 --> 00:00:26,031
<i>I am in an unknown world
of destruction and chaos.</i>

9
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,510
<i>However, I have fellows bond
with strong ties.</i>

10
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:31,691
<i>They are the greatest witch,
the noble and beautiful knight,</i>

11
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:35,158
<i>and the pretty Goddess willingly
joined to the journey.</i>

12
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,510
<i>The fate of the Gear has been
spinning faster and faster.</i>

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,080
<i>To save this wonderful world,
our adventure starts again!</i>

14
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,070
<i>Arrest him!</i>

15
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,928
This can't be it!

16
00:01:05,976 --> 00:01:07,336
(Episode 1)
I want to go home,

17
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,870
(Give Me Deliverance from this Judicial Injustice!)
I want to go back to Japan.

18
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,990
I am Sena,
the prosecutor of this kingdom.

19
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,640
Adventurer Satou Kazuma,
you are now suspected of treason.

20
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,910
Hold on, Kazuma.
What have you done again?

21
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,327
Apologize now.

22
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:27,047
We'll apologize together.
Say sorry right away!

23
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,710
What do you mean by 'again'?
You know I didn't do anything.

24
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:35,910
The teleportation spell you ordered
blew up the Governor's mansion.

25
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,090
What?

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,090
Fortunately, there were no casualties.

27
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:43,950
We suspect you are a terrorist
and a spy for the Devil King.

28
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,377
Hold on a moment!

29
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,630
In the battle with Destroyer,
if it wasn't for Kazuma's idea,

30
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,950
the outcome could have been much worse.

31
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,150
Megumin.

32
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:57,310
The worst crimes he committed
are mere harassments.

33
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,910
Ma'am, there must be a misunderstanding.

34
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,242
Darkness?

35
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,310
This man here doesn't have the guts.

36
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:06,950
He stared at me like a hungry beast
in the inn, yet he never asked me out.

37
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,870
He is nothing but a coward.

38
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,270
No! I wasn't staring at you!

39
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,150
Don't get so arrogant just because
you have a nice figure!

40
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,646
I have the right to choose too!

41
00:02:18,165 --> 00:02:21,845
You! You did that nasty thing to me
at the bathing pool.

42
00:02:21,952 --> 00:02:24,310
That's because I was being controlled
by the dream spirit!

43
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,350
You used that chance to
scrub my back as well.

44
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,470
How easy can you possibly be?

45
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,230
So you do remember everything!

46
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:37,556
I am the guardian knight of Lord Eris,
I am even a virgin!

47
00:02:38,144 --> 00:02:41,030
How dare you label me as easy.
I will kill you!

48
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,150
Come on!

49
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,726
Right, Kazuma is an adventurer,
not a criminal.

50
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,470
You are abusing the law of this kingdom.

51
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,510
The adventurers are free!

52
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,150
Freedom!

53
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,590
The treason charge...

54
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,990
also applies to those
who are not the main perpetrators.

55
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:03,008
If you wish to join this man
in prison, I won't stop you.

56
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,950
Are you kidding me? Come on, rally up!

57
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:11,100
Right, Kazuma did say this back then.

58
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,590
It's okay, I will take full
responsibility for this.

59
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,880
Don't look down on me,
I am quite lucky, you know.

60
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,056
Yes!

61
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,060
Seriously?

62
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,590
-If...
-If?

63
00:03:20,676 --> 00:03:22,796
If I was at the scene,

64
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,640
I'd definitely stop him.

65
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,550
But I couldn't do anything
since I wasn't there.

66
00:03:28,638 --> 00:03:30,398
Yes, there was nothing I could do.

67
00:03:30,517 --> 00:03:32,237
You traitors.

68
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,310
Wait, that's it!

69
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,590
I am the main perpetrator,
I gave him the order.

70
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,750
So, there must be a
prison sentence for me!

71
00:03:38,821 --> 00:03:41,184
No. I mean, please, I deserve
a cruel punishment!

72
00:03:41,312 --> 00:03:44,567
What? You just made yourself
the human shield.

73
00:03:46,903 --> 00:03:48,503
I haven't seen that in a while.

74
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,080
So,

75
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,742
-we used teleportation...
-Wiz, no.

76
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,550
It's best to just let him
take the blame alone.

77
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,280
It's cruel, but just hold on.
You have to bear with this.

78
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:03,635
Let's wait for him to
serve safely and come out.

79
00:04:03,814 --> 00:04:06,214
Don't say it like I am
going to jail for sure!

80
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:11,229
Besides, I have the comrades from
the guild even if you abandon me.

81
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,310
Look, there is dust here.

82
00:04:23,334 --> 00:04:24,694
Take him down!

83
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:30,150
Damn it, they call this
a town for newcomers?

84
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:35,310
If this were a game, the rebels
would have come to my rescue by now.

85
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,030
-What?
-Kazuma!

86
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:44,870
Aqua!

87
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,190
Why did you come here?

88
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:51,350
I am here to save you.
You are our important comrade.

89
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,093
You should have defended me just now.

90
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,030
Megumin is casting an
explosion spell nearby.

91
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,230
All the security guards are scattered.

92
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,950
Darkness is now carrying Megumin,
who has just finished her spell...

93
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,214
out of that place.

94
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:11,470
But escaping will only make things worse.

95
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,830
The punishment for treason
is the death sentence.

96
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:19,430
Even a no-name like you can
be wronged and executed.

97
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,270
This is undoubtedly a
medieval fantasy world.

98
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,590
But how do I get out of here?

99
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,616
Use this pin to open the lock.

100
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,830
Then, use your stealth magic
to run away from here.

101
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:42,910
Once you return to the inn,
we'll plan for your escape.

102
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,750
I will wait for you
in front of the building.

103
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,270
But this is a combination lock.

104
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,630
Off you go!

105
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,856
Back to sleep.

106
00:06:10,322 --> 00:06:12,882
Kazuma! Wake up, Kazuma.

107
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,950
You are here again?

108
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,390
What happened yesterday?
Is everyone okay?

109
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,670
They came back without
being seen by anyone.

110
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,376
But they are being accused of
causing the explosion.

111
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,528
Well...

112
00:06:26,624 --> 00:06:28,737
Their investigation is rather efficient.

113
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,790
-But don't worry.
-What?

114
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,600
I forced them to cover
their faces with bags.

115
00:06:33,765 --> 00:06:35,325
Things should go well tonight.

116
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:37,846
But that was for casting
the explosion spell.

117
00:06:38,528 --> 00:06:42,579
I was waiting for you all night,
why didn't you come out?

118
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,430
I had layers of snow on my head
and was questioned so many times.

119
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,840
What a drag.

120
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,390
The lock is a combination lock.

121
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,470
Not bad.

122
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,390
I didn't see this coming in
our flawless escape plan.

123
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,630
But not tonight.

124
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,870
A saw? You want me to use that?

125
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,670
Smart boy. There isn't much time left.
We have to work together.

126
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,310
Hurry up.

127
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,272
I am not tall enough to reach.

128
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,830
It's okay. I am not a fool.
I brought you a footrest.

129
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:19,480
I see.

130
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,080
But how do you get that in here?

131
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,470
Hold on a minute.

132
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,350
No!

133
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:36,230
I brought this because
Kazuma really needs it.

134
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,070
I've never heard anyone bring
a footrest as a gift.

135
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:41,047
Besides, how did you
come up with this idea?

136
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:44,070
-You were here yesterday too.
-That fool is so optimistic,

137
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,910
I am actually impressed.

138
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,832
Off you go!

139
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:50,976
Back to sleep.

140
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,670
Do you know what this is?

141
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,880
It's a magic item that detects lies.

142
00:08:05,856 --> 00:08:06,944
First of all,

143
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,550
tell me your birthplace and job
before becoming an adventurer.

144
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,164
<i>She started with the tough questions.</i>

145
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:18,470
I was born in Japan
and went to school there.

146
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,310
Why did it ring?

147
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,430
Faking birthplace and experience.
Write them down.

148
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,750
Wait, I didn't lie!

149
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,990
I was born in Japan.

150
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:41,190
I stayed home every day
and lived a wasted life.

151
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,470
Why did you bluff that you are a student?

152
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,590
I wasn't bluffing.

153
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,230
That's enough.

154
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,710
<i>Curse that magic item!</i>

155
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,470
I have never heard of
a place called Japan.

156
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,950
So, why did you become an adventurer?

157
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:06,190
To save the people who are
tormented by the Devil King.

158
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,830
Adventurer looks cool.

159
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,070
I wanted to make a lot of money...

160
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,360
and be surrounded by ladies.

161
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,270
Very well, next question.

162
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,230
What is your grudge against the governor?

163
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,320
I heard you were complaining
everywhere when you were in debt.

164
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,310
The money we earned from defeating
Beldia is used as a mortgage...

165
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:35,910
for the repair of the streets,
that's why we were in debt.

166
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,670
We said we would save the town,

167
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,270
but I know if we destroyed the town
it would become pointless.

168
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:49,350
Yes, I used this reason to
persuade my angry friends.

169
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:53,390
Honestly, I saved the town but
am now treated like a sinner,

170
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,470
I sure want to kill that guy.

171
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:59,670
Is that so? Next question.

172
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,720
Hold on a moment.

173
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,750
Just be straightforward
with the questions.

174
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:08,950
I told you many times
I did it to save the town.

175
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,910
It seems like I was right.

176
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:19,590
All the rumors about you
are bad and loathsome.

177
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,550
I am sorry for that.

178
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:26,430
<i>That was gentle.
Was her harsh tone only for criminals?</i>

179
00:10:27,587 --> 00:10:28,987
Seriously?

180
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,510
Judging a man on rumors?
What a lousy prosecutor you are.

181
00:10:33,594 --> 00:10:35,074
I am sorry.

182
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,270
Do you know about my splendid records?

183
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,550
I contributed the most in
the battle against Beldia.

184
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,910
I was a great commander in
the battle against Destroyer.

185
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:47,990
I got no gratitude but
accusations for that!

186
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,680
I am sorry, but this is my job.

187
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:55,350
Of course, I know about your records.
However...

188
00:10:55,456 --> 00:10:58,190
However what?

189
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:02,390
Right, I am yet to be proven guilty,
but I didn't even get a cup of tea.

190
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,830
If possible, I would like
a nice bowl of rice with meat.

191
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:08,030
Rice with meat?
I am sorry, but we don't have that.

192
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,270
I will get you the tea right away.

193
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,030
This is awful!

194
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,550
A prosecutor can't even
make a good cup of tea?

195
00:11:17,622 --> 00:11:19,102
I am sorry.

196
00:11:19,574 --> 00:11:24,174
I bet you don't have a boyfriend
because of your bad temper.

197
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,509
Tell me now.

198
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:28,214
I am sure you have something
that can be attractive.

199
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,344
None at all.

200
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:34,350
Yes, I can't get a boyfriend
despite my age...

201
00:11:34,453 --> 00:11:36,373
all because of my bad temper.

202
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,934
Are you satisfied with that answer?

203
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,230
Don't be too arrogant.

204
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,830
I am sorry.

205
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,240
Do you know what
the people say about you?

206
00:11:47,318 --> 00:11:50,118
-What?
-Human filth and dirtbag.

207
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,400
That is too much! Who gave me such names?

208
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,990
As a precaution, I will ask you again.

209
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:01,541
Are you really not
one of the Devil King's men?

210
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,070
Have you been in contact with
the Devil King's officers?

211
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,870
Of course not!

212
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:08,000
I am...

213
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,960
Do I really look like
I am capable of such a thing?

214
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:20,230
<i>Oh no, Wiz is one of
the Devil King's generals!</i>

215
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:37,310
We will now start the trial
of the suspect Satou Kazuma.

216
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,070
Are you nervous?

217
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:58,990
Don't worry, I will make
that prosecutor cry like a baby.

218
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:04,030
Relax, Kazuma.
You have done nothing wrong.

219
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,270
<i>Reliable, they are really reliable.</i>

220
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,550
<i>However...</i>

221
00:13:08,951 --> 00:13:12,551
It's okay, just leave everything to me.

222
00:13:12,846 --> 00:13:14,246
<i>She is the real problem.</i>

223
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,539
Hey, I think he is looking at us.

224
00:13:20,726 --> 00:13:23,546
That is the governor, Alderp.

225
00:13:25,183 --> 00:13:27,543
Prosecutor, please come forth.

226
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:37,590
Anything that threatens
the governor's life

227
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,150
is a matter that will cause
disruption to the land.

228
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:45,230
So, I hereby charge the suspect
Satou Kazuma of treason.

229
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,510
Witness, come forth.

230
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,630
Chris?

231
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,550
For some reason, I was brought here.

232
00:13:55,027 --> 00:13:56,507
SATOU KAZUMA ROBBED THE PANTIES

233
00:13:57,648 --> 00:14:03,128
He took Chris' panties with Steal
in front of everyone?

234
00:14:03,608 --> 00:14:04,648
Is that correct?

235
00:14:04,968 --> 00:14:08,288
That was what happened, but...

236
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:09,704
I saw it!

237
00:14:12,048 --> 00:14:15,448
He was waving the panties on the street!

238
00:14:15,528 --> 00:14:16,928
Who is the man you speak of?

239
00:14:22,088 --> 00:14:24,848
We just need to verify
the truth from the witness.

240
00:14:26,608 --> 00:14:27,968
Thank you.

241
00:14:28,928 --> 00:14:30,568
SATOU KAZUMA STOLE
THE DEMON SWORD AND RESOLD IT

242
00:14:31,648 --> 00:14:36,168
I heard Kazuma stole your sword
and sold it to someone else.

243
00:14:36,968 --> 00:14:38,328
Yes, that's what happened.

244
00:14:38,448 --> 00:14:41,008
But I was the one that started...

245
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,471
-Thank you.
-I have something else to say!

246
00:14:43,648 --> 00:14:45,248
SATOU KAZUMA THREATENED THE LADIES

247
00:14:46,248 --> 00:14:49,804
When the two ladies there
took the sword back,

248
00:14:49,968 --> 00:14:53,033
he threatened you to show
your panties in public?

249
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,648
Yes, he threatened us!

250
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,160
He said he is a feminist and didn't
hold back even if we are girls.

251
00:14:59,296 --> 00:15:00,576
You filthy pervert!

252
00:15:00,648 --> 00:15:05,208
Yes! He said his Steal will
go amok in front of everyone!

253
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,645
I saw his hand, it was very suspicious.

254
00:15:08,928 --> 00:15:11,168
The gesture of his hand
is very suspicious!

255
00:15:12,088 --> 00:15:13,688
Thank you.

256
00:15:14,008 --> 00:15:15,568
-Pervert.<i>-That is awful.</i>

257
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:16,848
Worthless scum.

258
00:15:17,368 --> 00:15:18,728
This is bad!

259
00:15:19,288 --> 00:15:21,888
<i>Things are getting real bad here!</i>

260
00:15:22,048 --> 00:15:25,008
That is enough, execute him now.

261
00:15:25,088 --> 00:15:26,168
Objections!

262
00:15:26,848 --> 00:15:29,248
I admit Kazuma has a twisted personality.

263
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:32,928
But mere statements cannot
be used as evidence.

264
00:15:33,056 --> 00:15:34,176
Megumin.

265
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,240
If you say he is a terrorist,
you need more proof for such a claim.

266
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,992
That's right, we want proof!

267
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,216
Proof?

268
00:15:41,514 --> 00:15:42,523
Very well.

269
00:15:42,768 --> 00:15:43,888
First of all,

270
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,799
he defeated Beldia, yet
he flooded the whole town.

271
00:15:50,088 --> 00:15:51,208
Secondly,

272
00:15:51,568 --> 00:15:55,593
the explosions near the town changed
the landscape and Eco-system.

273
00:15:55,728 --> 00:16:00,528
They even caused unease
during the nights lately.

274
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:02,808
<i>My advocates are no good at all.</i>

275
00:16:02,888 --> 00:16:04,508
And thirdly,

276
00:16:04,808 --> 00:16:07,208
someone saw him use a skill
only the Undead can use.

277
00:16:07,288 --> 00:16:10,208
That particular skill is Drain Touch.

278
00:16:11,528 --> 00:16:14,168
I won't answer that!
I'll retain my right to remain silent!

279
00:16:14,248 --> 00:16:17,333
These are hard facts even
if you close your ears.

280
00:16:17,608 --> 00:16:19,232
And for the most obvious evidence,

281
00:16:19,368 --> 00:16:22,728
when I asked you if you were in
contact with the Devil King's men,

282
00:16:22,928 --> 00:16:25,528
the magical lie detector
caught you lying.

283
00:16:26,768 --> 00:16:29,088
Are these not the evidence?

284
00:16:31,488 --> 00:16:35,488
No! All hope is lost!
Kazuma is the criminal!

285
00:16:35,584 --> 00:16:37,848
My Lord, what should I do now?

286
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,720
-That is enough.
-He is always so wasted,

287
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:43,147
-he must be connected to the Devil.
-And now he is a criminal!

288
00:16:43,328 --> 00:16:47,765
-He is now a criminal!
-Good, this is my chance.

289
00:16:47,928 --> 00:16:52,608
He blew up my mansion. Execute him now.

290
00:16:52,688 --> 00:16:53,696
No.

291
00:16:54,088 --> 00:16:57,921
I am not the Devil King's man,
nor am I a terrorist.

292
00:16:58,088 --> 00:16:59,488
Still trying to buy your way out?

293
00:16:59,696 --> 00:17:02,996
I have confirmed
your statements are lies.

294
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,600
Good, watch this!

295
00:17:05,696 --> 00:17:06,752
Here I go.

296
00:17:06,848 --> 00:17:12,568
I am neither the Devil King's spy
nor a terrorist!

297
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,400
How could that happen? Your Excellency...

298
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,691
With that said, I can't take the
prosecutor's statement as evidence.

299
00:17:32,128 --> 00:17:34,464
Suspect Satou Kazuma,

300
00:17:34,968 --> 00:17:37,528
the evidence against your crimes
is insufficient.

301
00:17:37,608 --> 00:17:40,288
-You are hereby declared...
-Hold on, Your Excellency.

302
00:17:40,728 --> 00:17:42,008
Lord Alderp?

303
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:45,208
Are you trying to humiliate me?

304
00:17:48,128 --> 00:17:50,088
That is such a dirty trick!

305
00:17:50,608 --> 00:17:52,448
Only an adventurer will fall for that.

306
00:17:53,088 --> 00:17:55,181
<i>That is why I hate medieval time.</i>

307
00:17:56,248 --> 00:18:01,768
The suspect is guilty
and shall now be sentenced to death.

308
00:18:01,888 --> 00:18:06,128
This is totally wrong!

309
00:18:06,528 --> 00:18:10,568
Your Excellency, please hear me out.

310
00:18:12,248 --> 00:18:13,368
Darkness?

311
00:18:16,488 --> 00:18:19,688
That is the family crest
of House of Dustiness!

312
00:18:22,088 --> 00:18:23,488
House of Dustiness?

313
00:18:23,712 --> 00:18:27,112
The noble family was known by
the name 'King's Blade'.

314
00:18:27,768 --> 00:18:31,968
That lady seems to have
a tale to tell all along.

315
00:18:32,088 --> 00:18:33,586
But I never see this coming.

316
00:18:33,688 --> 00:18:35,888
I kept the secret for you.

317
00:18:36,168 --> 00:18:37,648
He is very crafty.

318
00:18:38,328 --> 00:18:40,488
You would be dead by now
if I hadn't said that.

319
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,920
Can I have the authority
to handle this case?

320
00:18:47,404 --> 00:18:50,084
I am not asking you to pretend
nothing has happened.

321
00:18:50,592 --> 00:18:54,864
Give me time, and
I will prove his innocence.

322
00:18:54,936 --> 00:18:58,136
Even with your background of Dustiness...

323
00:18:58,248 --> 00:19:00,686
I will owe you once for this.

324
00:19:01,024 --> 00:19:05,048
I will do anything you ask
that is within my capability.

325
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,240
-Anything I want?
-Yes, anything.

326
00:19:11,368 --> 00:19:13,808
-Lady Darkness.
-Darkness.

327
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:16,848
Yes, Kazuma didn't do anything bad!

328
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,440
He gave me a voucher!

329
00:19:18,528 --> 00:19:20,448
Go to hell, judge.

330
00:19:20,608 --> 00:19:22,528
Kazuma!

331
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:27,520
Kazuma!

332
00:19:27,648 --> 00:19:33,568
-Order!
-Kazuma!

333
00:19:33,688 --> 00:19:37,488
Order! I order you to shut it, you dirt!

334
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:46,248
Since this is the request
from Miss Dustiness,

335
00:19:46,368 --> 00:19:48,408
we will trust you with this case.

336
00:19:50,008 --> 00:19:53,728
The suspect, Satou Kazuma, shall
remain innocent for now.

337
00:19:55,568 --> 00:19:56,928
That is great, Kazuma!

338
00:19:57,056 --> 00:19:58,944
I may not understand much,
but not having a death sentence...

339
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:00,546
is worth celebrating.

340
00:20:01,047 --> 00:20:02,967
Here are the elements for the celebration!

341
00:20:04,048 --> 00:20:06,928
My mind and defense have worked well too.

342
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,824
You gave up a long time ago.

343
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,560
SATOU KAZUMA REMAINS INNOCENT
AND BE MONITORED AS A SUSPECT

344
00:20:18,168 --> 00:20:20,208
I must thank you for today.

345
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:23,088
Don't celebrate so soon.

346
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,528
But I will handle Alderp.

347
00:20:25,663 --> 00:20:27,648
Are you sure about that old man?

348
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,528
The way he looked at you was weird.

349
00:20:29,648 --> 00:20:31,808
He might ask something nasty from you.

350
