1
00:00:03,897 --> 00:00:05,497
What the hell!

2
00:00:05,664 --> 00:00:08,164
Ask the person in charge to come out.
I want to teach him a lesson!

3
00:00:08,288 --> 00:00:10,176
How can I help you?

4
00:00:10,252 --> 00:00:12,572
Are you here to convert?
Or to be baptized?

5
00:00:12,643 --> 00:00:14,763
Or do you want me?

6
00:00:15,948 --> 00:00:18,228
You? What do you mean by you?

7
00:00:18,575 --> 00:00:22,055
I'm just kidding. Why are you so serious?

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,250
-Nothing wrong with your head, right?
-I feel like I want to hit her.

9
00:00:25,475 --> 00:00:27,275
Our High Priest, Sir Zesta...

10
00:00:27,389 --> 00:00:29,029
is out fooling around in
the name of preaching.

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,688
-I mean, he's out...
-What did you say?

12
00:00:30,784 --> 00:00:32,725
spreading the glorious name
of our Goddess Aqua.

13
00:00:32,965 --> 00:00:35,005
Please come back next time.

14
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:38,264
Did a magician and
an archpriest come by here?

15
00:00:39,171 --> 00:00:40,811
Do you mean the two of them?

16
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:47,328
By the way, the one that
followed you here...

17
00:00:47,524 --> 00:00:50,124
is being stoned by the children.

18
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,600
What are you doing, you little demons?

19
00:00:53,972 --> 00:00:57,213
Kazuma, even the woman and
children in this city

20
00:00:57,324 --> 00:00:58,924
are quite advanced in all aspects.

21
00:00:58,994 --> 00:01:01,594
Tuck away your Eris insignia.

22
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:03,023
-Are you doing that on purpose?
-I refuse.

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,240
I refuse!

24
00:01:06,016 --> 00:01:08,256
Aqua.

25
00:01:17,472 --> 00:01:19,577
Welcome, stray soul.

26
00:01:20,913 --> 00:01:22,713
Confess your sins to me truthfully.

27
00:01:22,928 --> 00:01:24,488
God will listen.

28
00:01:24,678 --> 00:01:26,878
And God will pardon you for your sins.

29
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,560
(KONOSUBA:
God's Blessing on This Wonderful World! 2)

00:02:57,646 --> 00:02:59,168
(Episode 9:
A Goddess for This Corrupt Hot Springs Town!)

31
00:02:59,265 --> 00:03:02,225
Listen, it's me.

32
00:03:02,324 --> 00:03:03,787
What is wrong with this city?

33
00:03:03,964 --> 00:03:06,125
Please control your believers.

34
00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:10,588
I see. You are trying to scam me
by pretending that you know me.

35
00:03:10,936 --> 00:03:13,336
Please repent of your sin.

36
00:03:13,504 --> 00:03:17,744
If you do that, the kind-hearted
Goddess, Aqua, will pardon you.

37
00:03:18,451 --> 00:03:20,288
Why are you feigning this madness?

38
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,560
Now I know. You are enjoying it.

39
00:03:22,695 --> 00:03:25,615
You are happy that you can
try out this decent priest job.

40
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,620
Do you have any other confessions?

41
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:30,272
If not, please leave this room.

42
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:32,521
Continue your life with positivity.

43
00:03:32,705 --> 00:03:33,760
Excuse me.

44
00:03:33,856 --> 00:03:37,216
You are the archpriest worshipped
by the people in this city, right?

45
00:03:37,377 --> 00:03:40,320
Give some instruction to your believer
and this can be solved right away.

46
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,680
Let them conduct themselves with dignity.

47
00:03:44,218 --> 00:03:46,418
Looks like you are done.

48
00:03:46,512 --> 00:03:50,272
I shall wait for the next stray soul.

49
00:03:50,382 --> 00:03:51,648
Alright then, please leave.

50
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,040
What did you say?

51
00:03:53,138 --> 00:03:54,498
Are you kicking me out of this room?

52
00:03:54,593 --> 00:03:57,673
Get out! You should get out
after your confession.

53
00:03:58,752 --> 00:04:00,360
<i>That wench.</i>

54
00:04:05,677 --> 00:04:08,531
Actually, I have something to confess.

55
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,080
Tell me about it.

56
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,550
Confess your sins and repent.

57
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,960
Is it because you are interested
in the crusader's laundry?

58
00:04:18,144 --> 00:04:21,904
Or is it because you desire to
smell a magician's black hair?

59
00:04:22,156 --> 00:04:24,196
Or is it because you lust
for the beautiful...

60
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,400
and gracious priest even though
you are of different status?

61
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,386
Actually, I accidentally broke
my companion's party cup,

62
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:34,258
which is well-cherished and
is used especially for performance.

63
00:04:35,932 --> 00:04:36,960
Besides that,

64
00:04:37,088 --> 00:04:40,300
she was always bragging
about her rare wine.

65
00:04:40,395 --> 00:04:44,275
I just wanted to sneak a try
out of curiosity.

66
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,160
But it was better than expected.
In the end, I finished it.

67
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,565
Then, I filled it back...

68
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,320
with cheap wine.
She can't tell them apart anyway.

69
00:04:50,627 --> 00:04:53,024
What did you say, Kazuma?
What did you say?

70
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,360
That priest can cause
troubles way too easily.

71
00:04:56,444 --> 00:04:57,684
So, before I came here,

72
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,680
I stuck a pamphlet about
an opening for a priest...

73
00:04:59,853 --> 00:05:03,573
in the Eris Cult on the
adventurer guild's notice board.

74
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,057
Traitor.

75
00:05:06,299 --> 00:05:09,339
Come on, I was just joking around.

76
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,360
So you aren't really looking
for a new priest?

77
00:05:13,442 --> 00:05:16,640
Besides the first two,
the last one is fake.

78
00:05:16,788 --> 00:05:18,708
Wait. Did you say besides the first two?

79
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:23,307
Quick. Let's go home now.

80
00:05:26,384 --> 00:05:29,384
I beg of you. Please, listen to me.

81
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:33,550
I believe in the Axis Cult and
I've long worshipped Goddess Aqua.

82
00:05:33,676 --> 00:05:34,676
But...

83
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,920
the well-filled-out chest on the
portrait of Goddess Eris...

84
00:05:38,022 --> 00:05:39,982
has clouded my thoughts.

85
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,560
That chest is the devil's chest.

86
00:05:42,703 --> 00:05:48,463
Please pardon me for my sinful
thoughts towards another Goddess.

87
00:05:50,942 --> 00:05:52,222
Rest assured.

88
00:05:52,302 --> 00:05:54,142
God will forgive you.

89
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:56,901
No matter your preference
for large breasts...

90
00:05:57,012 --> 00:05:59,412
or your preference for small breasts,

91
00:06:00,064 --> 00:06:02,803
Axis Cult teaches forgiveness
in all things.

92
00:06:03,207 --> 00:06:06,087
No matter if you are a lolicon, NEET,

93
00:06:06,307 --> 00:06:08,867
or a fan of girls with animal ears
that are neither human nor animal.

94
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,104
As long as you are not interested
in the undead or devil girls,

95
00:06:11,351 --> 00:06:13,711
as long as you have love
and break no laws,

96
00:06:13,888 --> 00:06:15,372
then everything can be forgiven.

97
00:06:19,702 --> 00:06:22,042
My faithful believer,

98
00:06:22,397 --> 00:06:25,632
I shall teach you a holy incantation
to help you avoid the devil's temptation.

99
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,720
Eris's chest is padded.

100
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:31,148
Next time, if you are tempted again,

101
00:06:31,237 --> 00:06:32,597
chant these words.

102
00:06:32,739 --> 00:06:34,859
If others are tempted as well,

103
00:06:34,989 --> 00:06:37,311
it will be kind of you
to share this with them.

104
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,840
Eris's chest is padded.

105
00:06:40,636 --> 00:06:43,756
I feel like I've been enlightened!

106
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,770
Let's chant it together again.

107
00:06:45,895 --> 00:06:48,055
Eris's chest is padded.

108
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:51,210
Thank you for your holy incantation.

109
00:06:51,973 --> 00:06:55,773
As a Goddess, how could you back-stab
another younger Goddess?

110
00:06:55,897 --> 00:06:59,617
The number of believers and the heart
of faith are important to God.

111
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,200
Because they will directly
affect a God's power.

112
00:07:02,441 --> 00:07:05,161
Although I don't have a
large number of believers,

113
00:07:05,233 --> 00:07:08,113
but my believers have strong faith in me.

114
00:07:08,982 --> 00:07:11,302
To protect these adorable believers,

115
00:07:11,383 --> 00:07:13,245
I am willing to do anything.

116
00:07:13,735 --> 00:07:14,784
Konosuba.

117
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,560
I'm back.

118
00:07:17,826 --> 00:07:18,950
Welcome back.

119
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,520
Are you well?

120
00:07:20,704 --> 00:07:23,784
I've fully recovered after a bath.

121
00:07:24,008 --> 00:07:25,288
Great.

122
00:07:25,454 --> 00:07:26,592
There are no other people...

123
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,160
in the mixed bath. It feels like
I've booked the whole place.

124
00:07:30,299 --> 00:07:31,779
Does that mean...

125
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,263
Anyway, how did your sightseeing go?

126
00:07:35,932 --> 00:07:38,652
The believers of the Axis Cult
are too terrifying.

127
00:07:38,746 --> 00:07:40,266
As for me,

128
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,580
I would like to go sightseeing
again tomorrow.

129
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,000
You...

130
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,371
Fine, do as you wish.

131
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,520
I am going to take a bath.

132
00:07:51,544 --> 00:07:52,624
I am taking a bath.

133
00:07:52,975 --> 00:07:54,175
We heard that.

134
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,800
Enjoy your bath.

135
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,320
-I am...
-Just go.

136
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,050
The water is nice.

137
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:10,809
It would be nice if I were you.

138
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,490
I am just here for
the hot spring treatment.

139
00:08:15,023 --> 00:08:17,592
You seem rather exhausted.

140
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,760
This is the realm of the Devils.

141
00:08:21,491 --> 00:08:23,811
You must have been through a lot.

142
00:08:24,835 --> 00:08:26,395
So...

143
00:08:34,661 --> 00:08:37,541
That man over there
has been staring at me.

144
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:42,336
It makes me feel so awkward
when you are staring at me.

145
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,514
Just ignore me.

146
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:45,709
Right.

147
00:08:45,952 --> 00:08:47,646
This is a mixed bath, after all.

148
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:48,968
Just pretend I'm not here.

149
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:58,501
She is quite a shy lady.

150
00:09:05,981 --> 00:09:08,821
I am just a traveler,

151
00:09:08,912 --> 00:09:11,712
all the people I met kept
asking me to join their cult.

152
00:09:11,786 --> 00:09:15,386
I have had enough of their
nonsensical gibberish!

153
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,000
He must have been through quite a lot.

154
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,007
This city is just...

155
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,170
I better not be so nosy.

156
00:09:35,035 --> 00:09:36,755
How is it, sir?

157
00:09:36,848 --> 00:09:39,128
Yes, right over there.

158
00:09:40,318 --> 00:09:42,718
This soap I use is very foamy.

159
00:09:42,847 --> 00:09:44,087
Yeah, you are right.

160
00:09:45,093 --> 00:09:47,253
It can cure all kinds of sicknesses!

161
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,880
And this soap is even edible!

162
00:09:50,952 --> 00:09:52,792
The ingredients are holy and natural!

163
00:09:52,894 --> 00:09:55,894
-Join us and you will get one for free!
-No!

164
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,136
You will get double the points
for now! It's free!

165
00:09:59,244 --> 00:10:02,656
Stop trying to sugar-coat it with points!

166
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,320
Konosuba.

167
00:10:07,156 --> 00:10:09,436
I want to go back.
I really want to go back.

168
00:10:10,396 --> 00:10:13,116
Megumin, swimming is prohibited here!

169
00:10:13,226 --> 00:10:15,466
It's fine, stop nagging!

170
00:10:15,592 --> 00:10:19,752
-What are you doing?
-Why are you acting so shy now?

171
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,163
Our jobs need us to be open,
we can't afford to be shy.

172
00:10:23,261 --> 00:10:24,704
Your logic is simply twisted.

173
00:10:24,805 --> 00:10:25,845
The towel!

174
00:10:30,976 --> 00:10:34,296
I brought Kazuma along so
he could stop wasting his life at home.

175
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:37,088
While we are at it, we can kill
the undead that comes after Aqua.

176
00:10:37,228 --> 00:10:38,908
That's why I brought him along.

177
00:10:39,498 --> 00:10:41,458
That's what this is all about?

178
00:10:42,249 --> 00:10:45,225
But what is going on with him?

179
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:47,349
I always thought he was a stuffy coward.

180
00:10:47,431 --> 00:10:48,960
Yet he cares nothing
about the social gaps.

181
00:10:49,114 --> 00:10:51,874
He would even confront
the nobles head-on.

182
00:10:52,157 --> 00:10:54,477
Is this strange, or is it amazing?

183
00:10:54,555 --> 00:10:55,715
The mixed bath is right next to us.

184
00:10:56,845 --> 00:10:58,662
Which do you think he will choose

185
00:10:58,828 --> 00:11:02,912
if there is a mixed bath
and a man-only bath?

186
00:11:03,049 --> 00:11:06,449
He is cautious. He always
runs away when there is danger.

187
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:08,041
But with just reasons,

188
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:09,933
he will choose the mixed bath
without hesitation.

189
00:11:13,188 --> 00:11:15,748
Kazuma, are you there?

190
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:18,624
I bet you are sticking
your ear to the wall,

191
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,991
imagining the scene of
Darkness taking a bath...

192
00:11:21,088 --> 00:11:22,592
with a face of a total pervert.

193
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,280
Megumin, why did you drag me into this?

194
00:11:25,447 --> 00:11:28,407
Kazuma, are you there?
You are there, aren't you?

195
00:11:30,395 --> 00:11:32,275
It seems like he is not.

196
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,788
I must have wronged him this time.

197
00:11:36,347 --> 00:11:39,507
Let's buy him juice and
pretend nothing happened.

198
00:11:39,923 --> 00:11:42,043
This is a little inadequate.

199
00:11:42,171 --> 00:11:43,571
Either way,

200
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,280
he is reliable.

201
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,030
He may look like a coward,

202
00:11:48,145 --> 00:11:50,080
but when his friends are in need,

203
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:52,119
he never refuses to offer help.

204
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:53,696
He is a liar.

205
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,690
But his is undoubtedly good in nature.

206
00:11:56,168 --> 00:11:59,408
<i>I am blushing just by
eavesdropping on them.</i>

207
00:11:59,514 --> 00:12:00,672
By the way, Megumin,

208
00:12:00,859 --> 00:12:03,619
that thing on your bottom is...

209
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:05,767
Even if it's you,

210
00:12:05,852 --> 00:12:08,448
I won't show any mercy
if you pry on me about it.

211
00:12:08,558 --> 00:12:09,598
Please, stop!

212
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,240
Seriously, these two things
on you are simply outrageous!

213
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,152
Now!

214
00:12:25,914 --> 00:12:27,680
Did he see anything?

215
00:12:27,808 --> 00:12:30,208
-He was there the whole time!
-He was really there!

216
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:32,507
I can always sense his perverted eyes.

217
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,840
There is no way a man warped by lust
won't go to the mixed bath!

218
00:12:37,015 --> 00:12:38,735
Create Water!

219
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,440
It's so cold!

220
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,336
Don't toss your cat here!

221
00:12:46,525 --> 00:12:49,565
As the punishment for eavesdropping,
you will clean him up!

222
00:12:50,464 --> 00:12:53,224
Having a freak like you as the owner
must have been hard on the cat.

223
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,528
Konosuba.

224
00:13:04,489 --> 00:13:05,809
They are too much!

225
00:13:06,124 --> 00:13:09,604
I was just on a trip to the hot spring.

226
00:13:10,732 --> 00:13:14,812
Aqua, your tears make me
feel a stinging pain.

227
00:13:15,473 --> 00:13:18,473
Just how many troubles
have you caused today?

228
00:13:18,554 --> 00:13:20,034
What is that supposed to mean?

229
00:13:20,138 --> 00:13:23,018
Why must you point the finger at me?

230
00:13:23,276 --> 00:13:26,436
After Aqua went to the secret
hot spring at the headquarters,

231
00:13:26,526 --> 00:13:29,206
the warm water of
the spring became hot water.

232
00:13:29,292 --> 00:13:31,273
And they chased me out!

233
00:13:31,794 --> 00:13:35,474
Why do I have to be chased out
of the cult that worships me?

234
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:37,879
Why?

235
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:41,110
<i>By the way, you purified the
tea into hot water.</i>

236
00:13:41,415 --> 00:13:43,975
The most outrageous
of them all is the manager.

237
00:13:45,642 --> 00:13:48,402
I apologize for turning
the hot spring into hot water.

238
00:13:48,568 --> 00:13:50,592
But this is not something
I can help with.

239
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,512
Yes, if anything,

240
00:13:52,864 --> 00:13:54,584
that is because I am
the Goddess of Water.

241
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,800
Behold, I am Aqua herself!

242
00:14:01,722 --> 00:14:03,122
I am a goddess!

243
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,370
I am a goddess!

244
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,240
This city is full of dangerous dangers.

245
00:14:14,364 --> 00:14:16,484
What is a dangerous danger?

246
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:18,826
You cried the whole night.

247
00:14:18,933 --> 00:14:21,053
Just like the manager said,

248
00:14:21,664 --> 00:14:25,584
the quality of the hot spring
has gotten worse lately.

249
00:14:26,295 --> 00:14:31,255
The Devil King must have thought
he had no chance against us,

250
00:14:31,444 --> 00:14:34,432
that's why he went after our
income source, the hot spring.

251
00:14:34,615 --> 00:14:37,175
-Is that so, he's good.
-Trust me on this!

252
00:14:37,903 --> 00:14:41,383
But the Axis Cult is shunned
by the people of this town.

253
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,040
Having such an indirect approach
seems unnecessary.

254
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,840
To protect the city,
I must stand out and fight!

255
00:14:48,101 --> 00:14:51,006
So, you will lend me your help, right?

256
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,560
I am busy, I plan to have
a walk around here.

257
00:14:55,834 --> 00:14:59,274
I know how terrifying the Axis Cult is.

258
00:14:59,504 --> 00:15:01,304
I don't want to have
anything to do with them.

259
00:15:02,763 --> 00:15:04,283
Why?

260
00:15:04,384 --> 00:15:06,224
Having a walk or not is
not important at all!

261
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,400
Megumin, don't hate the members
of the cult so much.

262
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,090
What about you, Darkness?

263
00:15:11,423 --> 00:15:14,263
I have to do the...

264
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,955
Please!

265
00:15:16,046 --> 00:15:17,486
Fine, I will go with you!

266
00:15:17,632 --> 00:15:20,768
I will go with you,
don't cleanse my grape juice!

267
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:24,477
Wiz is always so nice to you,
I am sure she will go with you.

268
00:15:24,785 --> 00:15:26,825
I was crying the whole night,

269
00:15:26,956 --> 00:15:28,636
she was gone this morning.

270
00:15:28,775 --> 00:15:30,495
Let her have some sleep for now.

271
00:15:30,618 --> 00:15:33,018
<i>Come. Come to me.</i>

272
00:15:33,097 --> 00:15:35,297
We should save Wiz now, not the city!

273
00:15:35,544 --> 00:15:37,244
Come, over here!

274
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,520
Now that I see it,
this is a nice and normal place.

275
00:15:47,784 --> 00:15:49,144
Yeah.

276
00:15:49,307 --> 00:15:52,064
The scenery is nice,
and the foods are decent.

277
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,120
The only problem here is the people.

278
00:15:54,231 --> 00:15:58,951
The weather is so good today!
This must be Lady Aqua's blessing!

279
00:15:59,053 --> 00:16:02,213
-Here they go again.
-By the way,

280
00:16:02,525 --> 00:16:03,925
this pot doesn't stick!

281
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,800
Join the cult now and you will get one!

282
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,040
Don't go! Don't be so shy!

283
00:16:11,876 --> 00:16:14,716
Are you going for a stroll?
Take a look at this.

284
00:16:14,792 --> 00:16:16,032
You too, miss.

285
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,286
Everyone can get an extra now!

286
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:22,099
Excuse me, why won't you
look me in the eyes?

287
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,440
This is all for your own good!

288
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,400
Can we drink the soap?

289
00:16:34,137 --> 00:16:38,054
I don't have that much to wash...

290
00:16:39,062 --> 00:16:42,022
-Liquid soap detergent...
-It's edible.

291
00:16:42,322 --> 00:16:45,322
-Liquid soap detergent...
-It's edible.

292
00:16:45,486 --> 00:16:48,766
-Liquid soap detergent...
-It's edible.

293
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,980
Liquid soap detergent...

294
00:16:53,085 --> 00:16:55,245
How can you drink that thing?

295
00:16:55,487 --> 00:16:57,407
Good riddance.

296
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,550
Kazuma!

297
00:17:07,232 --> 00:17:09,184
Wiz, you are okay?

298
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:11,209
Yes, all thanks to you.

299
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:15,092
Some time ago, I saw my party
member, who are adventurers...

300
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:19,109
waving at me not to go over the border.

301
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:21,113
So, I recovered in an instant.

302
00:17:21,337 --> 00:17:22,697
<i>That is just...</i>

303
00:17:23,268 --> 00:17:25,148
What are you doing here?

304
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,870
Actually...

305
00:17:27,653 --> 00:17:30,318
Where is the guy from just now?

306
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,628
There were liquid soap detergents.
There was a man.

307
00:17:33,728 --> 00:17:37,808
-It's that so?
-Kill the Devils and the Devil King!

308
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,100
That voice...

309
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,720
I have a bad feeling about this.

310
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,040
Kill the Devils and the Devil King!

311
00:17:44,251 --> 00:17:46,731
My beloved members of the Axis Cult,

312
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,240
the forces of the Devil King
are conducting sabotage here.

313
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,790
-Sabotage?
-What happened, you may ask.

314
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,555
The hot springs in this city
have been poisoned.

315
00:17:57,748 --> 00:17:59,268
I confirmed it myself.

316
00:17:59,353 --> 00:18:02,713
Many of our hot springs
are being sabotaged.

317
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,240
We confirmed it.

318
00:18:04,435 --> 00:18:08,315
I was in the hot spring earlier,
but nothing happened to me.

319
00:18:08,411 --> 00:18:13,051
That's because I purified the water.

320
00:18:13,154 --> 00:18:16,114
That fool, did she go to
every spring in the city?

321
00:18:16,515 --> 00:18:18,675
But don't celebrate too soon.

322
00:18:18,778 --> 00:18:20,978
I need a favor from all of you.

323
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:25,280
Before this disaster is over,
do not go to any hot springs.

324
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,700
But Priestess, this is
a city of hot springs.

325
00:18:28,832 --> 00:18:32,302
Do you want us to stop going to the
place that symbolizes the city?

326
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,112
That is simply unimaginable!

327
00:18:34,226 --> 00:18:36,556
Besides, what does the Devil King
want with the springs?

328
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,384
He wants to cut off the financial
resource of the Axis Cult.

329
00:18:40,832 --> 00:18:44,493
Yes, the Devil King fears
the members of the Axis Cult.

330
00:18:44,743 --> 00:18:48,023
This is not about me not
having to enjoy the spring...

331
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,145
and making you suffer
the same bad luck as I had.

332
00:18:51,451 --> 00:18:55,811
-My advent members of the cult...
-There you are!

333
00:18:55,923 --> 00:18:58,848
She is the wicked woman that turned
all the springs into boiling water...

334
00:18:58,922 --> 00:19:00,602
so no one can enjoy them!

335
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:02,914
-Wait a minute...
-Get her!

336
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:04,899
Beat her up with the straw mat!

337
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:08,330
-I knew something was strange.
-You were trying to trick us?

338
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,680
Another scamming plot?
What do you want from us?

339
00:19:10,771 --> 00:19:13,811
We were making so many efforts
to make this world better!

340
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,461
How did things escalate so quickly?

341
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,800
No, I have a reason for this...

342
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,120
-Lady Aqua is going to cry.
-That's not it!

343
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:24,043
Please, calm down. Hear me out!

344
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,704
Darkness, stop standing there,
say something for me.

345
00:19:26,808 --> 00:19:29,347
Just tell them what I told you.

346
00:19:29,472 --> 00:19:35,480
Say this, "Please, Axis Cult."
Don't be shy, say it now!

347
00:19:36,763 --> 00:19:39,803
Please, Axis Cult.

348
00:19:39,882 --> 00:19:42,322
We can't hear what the blonde girl says.

349
00:19:42,441 --> 00:19:43,488
Poor girl.

350
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:47,184
Fine, I have to reveal
my true identity now!

351
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,960
The advent members of Axis Cult
that are gathering here,

352
00:19:50,948 --> 00:19:52,668
my name is Aqua.

353
00:19:53,184 --> 00:19:56,499
Yes, I am the person you worship,

354
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,842
Aqua, the Goddess of Water.

355
00:19:59,959 --> 00:20:03,999
I descended to this city
in order to help you.

356
00:20:09,587 --> 00:20:11,107
Stop kidding around!

357
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:14,688
Did you claim to be Lady Aqua just
because of the blue hair and eyes?

358
00:20:14,792 --> 00:20:15,992
You'll be punished for that!

359
00:20:16,094 --> 00:20:19,854
By using the straw mat!
The straw mat fell into the lake.

360
00:20:19,931 --> 00:20:21,371
If you are the Goddess of Water,

361
00:20:21,504 --> 00:20:23,618
there should be no problem
if you fall into the water.

362
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,360
Liar!

363
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:30,730
I bet you are here to ruin
the hot springs industry.

364
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,720
You are working for the Devil King!

365
00:20:34,138 --> 00:20:38,578
It's true! I really am
the Goddess of Water!

366
00:20:40,683 --> 00:20:43,043
I am the Goddess of Water!

367
00:20:43,978 --> 00:20:45,138
That was too much!

368
00:20:46,326 --> 00:20:50,246
Why do I have to be stoned
by my own worshipers?

369
00:20:50,846 --> 00:20:54,806
Lady Aqua. Have a drink and calm down.

370
00:20:54,938 --> 00:20:58,698
The energy released from
your agitated cry is affecting me.

371
00:21:01,285 --> 00:21:02,445
I need booze.

372
00:21:03,022 --> 00:21:04,968
You didn't care that much, did you?

373
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:07,382
We know you are trying very hard.

374
00:21:07,507 --> 00:21:09,947
But claiming to be a
Goddess is too reckless.

375
00:21:10,025 --> 00:21:15,185
But people will get sick if
they use the tainted hot springs.

376
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,200
I see no reason to help them
after what they did to you.

377
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:24,138
But my beloved worshipers will be...

378
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,800
Kill the Devils and the Devil King!

379
00:21:30,054 --> 00:21:33,534
Kill the Devils and the Devil King!

380
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:37,270
Kill the Devils and the Devil King!

381
00:21:37,531 --> 00:21:41,011
Kill the Devils and the Devil King!

382
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:44,408
Kill the Devils and the Devil King!

383
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,784
-Kill the Devils and the Devil King!
-There is a mob.

384
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,920
What? Did they believe
my words and come to me?

385
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,140
There she is!

386
00:21:52,251 --> 00:21:54,811
The witch who claims to be Lady Aqua!

387
00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:00,026
Kill the witch!

388
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:39,026
