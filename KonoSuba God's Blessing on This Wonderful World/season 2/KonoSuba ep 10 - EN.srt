1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,180
Kill the Devils and the Devil King!

2
00:00:03,294 --> 00:00:05,894
The witch who claims to be Lady Aqua!

3
00:00:06,016 --> 00:00:08,160
Use the straw mat to wrap her up!

4
00:00:08,235 --> 00:00:10,915
Who gave you permission
to dye your hair blue?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Imposter!

6
00:00:15,158 --> 00:00:17,798
The imposter is getting away!

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,561
(Episode 10:
God's Blessing on This Wonderful Party!)

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,720
The source of the spring is suspicious.

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,080
Indeed. If we cleanse it,
the spring will be back to normal.

10
00:00:28,268 --> 00:00:30,428
Cleansing starts from the source.

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,080
We found her! There is the imposter!

12
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:37,729
Since they scold you,
you don't have to save them.

13
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,240
But they are all my beloved worshippers.

14
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:46,978
I am the archpriest of the Axis Cult.

15
00:00:47,078 --> 00:00:49,798
Take a good look at my Adventurer Card.

16
00:00:50,048 --> 00:00:52,848
Being the archpriest
won't do you any good.

17
00:00:53,152 --> 00:00:57,400
The manager told us on his way in,
he said not to let anyone through.

18
00:00:57,587 --> 00:00:58,627
Manager?

19
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,320
My advent followers of the Axis Cult.

20
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,040
This is a serious matter.
It is the right thing to do.

21
00:01:08,132 --> 00:01:10,612
Let us through and we can save...

22
00:01:10,682 --> 00:01:12,242
I am from the Eris Cult.

23
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,072
What? Please, I beg of you,
let me through!

24
00:01:15,168 --> 00:01:16,920
The spring source in there is in danger.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,520
-I just want to save the town.
-Let's wait and see.

26
00:01:19,834 --> 00:01:22,714
-No is no.
-That's enough, go back.

27
00:01:23,187 --> 00:01:26,507
Hold on, I have a feeling that...

28
00:01:26,794 --> 00:01:28,954
you have a mysterious charm with you.

29
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:32,570
Your side profile looks like
Red Dragon. That is so cool.

30
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,200
Do you mean I look like a salamander?

31
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:40,109
Fine, since you won't let me go in there,

32
00:01:40,673 --> 00:01:43,593
I don't care what people
from the Eris Cult will say about me,

33
00:01:43,764 --> 00:01:45,924
I must breach into
the building of Axis Cult.

34
00:01:46,004 --> 00:01:47,644
What are you talking about?

35
00:01:47,744 --> 00:01:50,464
That's right! All the people
from Axis Cult are crazy.

36
00:01:50,572 --> 00:01:51,892
And your blue hair,

37
00:01:51,968 --> 00:01:55,560
you must be the prankster that turned
the hot spring into hot water.

38
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:58,944
No, I simply cleansed the spring.
That's all.

39
00:01:59,113 --> 00:02:01,728
So it is you!
We can't let someone like you get in.

40
00:02:01,807 --> 00:02:03,407
-Just turn back!
-I knew this would happen.

41
00:02:03,527 --> 00:02:05,207
-Wait!
-Darkness,

42
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,960
this is the rare chance
you have to do something.

43
00:02:07,114 --> 00:02:10,674
My rare chance?
I have always been useful in the team.

44
00:02:10,784 --> 00:02:13,513
Hey, stop pushing me. What are you doing?

45
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,040
Stop this bewilderment now!

46
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,999
Do you have any idea who she is?

47
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:22,851
She is the daughter of Dustiness.
Dustiness Ford Lalatina!

48
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:25,629
This is an emergency situation.

49
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:29,433
Come on, Miss. Show them the crest
you hide in your chest as proof.

50
00:02:29,887 --> 00:02:32,367
Miss, stop resisting. Miss!

51
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,680
Miss, hand it over!

52
00:02:34,795 --> 00:02:36,672
Kazuma, hold her right there.

53
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:37,888
I am right behind you.

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,240
It hurts! Darkness, it hurts!

55
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,340
Wiz, take the crest now!
Now is the chance to take it!

56
00:02:43,424 --> 00:02:45,400
Wiz, come over here now!

57
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,472
Aqua will hold her arm.

58
00:02:47,562 --> 00:02:48,989
-Hurry up!
-Miss!

59
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,815
-Resisting is futile.
-Wiz, quick!

60
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,680
-Wiz, come on!
-Miss!

61
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,760
I am sorry, Miss Darkness! I am sorry.

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,960
Stop it, all of you! The power of
the Dustiness must not be abused!

63
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,080
It's real. We apologize for the rudeness.

64
00:03:07,286 --> 00:03:08,406
Konosuba.

65
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:12,517
What a bothersome woman you are.

66
00:03:12,587 --> 00:03:16,547
Do you want us to see you as a noble
or a friend of ours? Tell us.

67
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:18,271
Don't call me bothersome!

68
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:20,559
I am older than you!

69
00:03:22,008 --> 00:03:25,768
That's because I see you as my friend.

70
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:29,486
Yes. To me, you are not Lalatina
from the noble family.

71
00:03:29,581 --> 00:03:31,821
You are a reliable crusader, Darkness.

72
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,160
Is that so?

73
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:37,107
Then, I think it's okay.

74
00:03:37,369 --> 00:03:39,009
-She is easy to please.
-Very easy.

75
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,440
-So easy.
-Hello, everyone.

76
00:03:42,636 --> 00:03:43,756
I can see it.

77
00:03:43,914 --> 00:03:45,754
The water is black.

78
00:03:45,848 --> 00:03:49,048
It's poisoned! There is no doubt at all!

79
00:03:49,223 --> 00:03:50,503
Judging by the situation,

80
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:53,939
the source may have been contaminated.

81
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
Let's go now.

82
00:04:00,393 --> 00:04:02,193
Wait, someone is here.

83
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:08,988
That is...

84
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:11,959
How can you drink that thing?

85
00:04:12,061 --> 00:04:13,941
Good riddance.

86
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:18,570
Soap Detergent? Looks like he is
planning to end his life.

87
00:04:18,928 --> 00:04:22,408
That man was troubled by
the people from Axis Cult.

88
00:04:22,503 --> 00:04:23,520
Wait.

89
00:04:25,822 --> 00:04:26,880
Watch out!

90
00:04:27,804 --> 00:04:30,484
You can't just give up
on your life so easily!

91
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,216
Konosuba

92
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:39,482
Are you here for sightseeing?

93
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:42,961
The hot spring can treat waist pain
and shoulder sores and relieve fatigue.

94
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:46,361
It's good against anxiety, jinx
and all kinds of spell buffs.

95
00:04:46,441 --> 00:04:50,601
It received good ratings
all over the land!

96
00:04:50,704 --> 00:04:51,824
So...

97
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,320
This man seems familiar.

98
00:04:54,505 --> 00:04:57,385
That is not possible.
We have never met before.

99
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,640
Mr. Hans? Mr. Hans, is that you?

100
00:05:01,251 --> 00:05:04,331
What are you talking about?
I am the manager of this place.

101
00:05:04,448 --> 00:05:06,462
Mr. Hans, long time no see!

102
00:05:06,623 --> 00:05:09,783
It's me, Wiz the lich!

103
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,840
What are you talking about?

104
00:05:11,962 --> 00:05:15,922
If I remember correctly,
you are a mutant of Deadly Slime, right?

105
00:05:16,292 --> 00:05:19,772
Are you the one that has been
poisoning the spring?

106
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:22,266
-Slime?
-Deadly Slime?

107
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:26,409
Mr. Hans, why are you ignoring me?
It's me, Wiz!

108
00:05:26,512 --> 00:05:28,432
-Mr. Hans!
-I don't know anything.

109
00:05:28,544 --> 00:05:30,596
I don't know you at all.

110
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,680
Stop it, stop shaking me!

111
00:05:32,786 --> 00:05:35,706
Did you really forget about me?

112
00:05:35,865 --> 00:05:38,425
Do you remember?
Back in the Devil King's castle...

113
00:05:40,269 --> 00:05:43,109
I have works to do.
I must go back to the town.

114
00:05:44,318 --> 00:05:46,518
Where do you think you are going, Hans?

115
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:48,671
We won't let you leave so easily, Hans.

116
00:05:48,962 --> 00:05:51,882
Do you really think a lousy
excuse can help you escape, Hans?

117
00:05:53,123 --> 00:05:57,539
Stop resisting and show
your true form, Hans!

118
00:05:58,643 --> 00:05:59,763
Hans!

119
00:05:59,898 --> 00:06:03,552
Curse you, stop with the naming!

120
00:06:03,656 --> 00:06:06,464
Wiz, didn't you say you
want to open a shop?

121
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,080
Stop wandering in this town
and get back to work!

122
00:06:09,314 --> 00:06:11,874
That is so mean! I am working hard too.

123
00:06:11,953 --> 00:06:14,673
But for some reason,
I am getting poorer by the minute.

124
00:06:15,391 --> 00:06:18,751
I spent so much time
doing this with stealth.

125
00:06:19,293 --> 00:06:24,893
Wiz, you said you would help to
reinforce the Devil King's barrier.

126
00:06:25,037 --> 00:06:28,077
So, we have no reason to be enemies.

127
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,800
We shouldn't get involved
in each other's work.

128
00:06:30,914 --> 00:06:32,874
Why do you have to get in my way?

129
00:06:32,966 --> 00:06:35,806
Did I interrupt your work?

130
00:06:35,888 --> 00:06:38,968
I was just greeting a friend
I hadn't seen in a long time.

131
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,000
And you ruined my work here!

132
00:06:41,974 --> 00:06:45,414
Do you know how much I have been through?

133
00:06:45,628 --> 00:06:46,908
You better get ready for this.

134
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,320
What's the matter, Wiz?
Are you trying to go against me?

135
00:06:50,865 --> 00:06:55,265
These people are my friends.
Can't we just talk it through?

136
00:06:55,347 --> 00:06:59,187
Same as always. You turned into
a coward after becoming a lich.

137
00:06:59,273 --> 00:07:03,193
You are the mighty arch-wizard!
You never tried to talk it through...

138
00:07:03,296 --> 00:07:06,421
while you were hunting us!

139
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,440
I couldn't see the surrounding
clearly back then.

140
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,080
Wiz, you know this man?

141
00:07:12,778 --> 00:07:15,858
There is no need for you to fight him.
Stand down.

142
00:07:17,775 --> 00:07:19,481
I am Satou Kazuma.

143
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:22,486
I have defeated many mighty foes!

144
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:28,069
Kazuma, I do want to
avoid any conflict, but...

145
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:30,745
Let's go, my partner.

146
00:07:30,937 --> 00:07:32,297
-Chunchunmaru.
-No.

147
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:34,261
Very well.

148
00:07:34,429 --> 00:07:39,392
Any who saw my true form have begged
for my mercy and surrendered.

149
00:07:39,545 --> 00:07:41,625
You seem to have some guts in you.

150
00:07:41,714 --> 00:07:44,954
A weakling-like slime
shouldn't be bluffing.

151
00:07:45,241 --> 00:07:48,961
Judging by the name 'Deadly,'
I bet you use poison to attack.

152
00:07:49,126 --> 00:07:51,846
We have Aqua with us
and she can cleanse it.

153
00:07:51,963 --> 00:07:53,843
There is no way we could lose.

154
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:56,561
I am Hans.

155
00:07:56,672 --> 00:07:58,618
I am the lieutenant of Devil King's army.

156
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,880
I am Hans, the Deadly Python Slime.

157
00:08:02,068 --> 00:08:04,348
What did you say?
A lieutenant from Devil King's army?

158
00:08:04,511 --> 00:08:08,391
The bounty on his head is higher
compared to other lieutenants.

159
00:08:08,553 --> 00:08:10,313
He is very strong. Be careful.

160
00:08:10,504 --> 00:08:13,504
Slimes are easy to kill, right?
Are they easy to kill?

161
00:08:13,856 --> 00:08:15,980
Don't be silly.

162
00:08:16,433 --> 00:08:17,953
Slimes are very powerful foes.

163
00:08:18,189 --> 00:08:20,469
Physical attacks won't work on them.

164
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,920
You are as good as dead
if he got a hold of you.

165
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,280
You will be melted by digestive fluid.
You will be choked to death.

166
00:08:26,357 --> 00:08:27,837
What? This is terrifying!

167
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,998
His venom can poison
the water of the whole town.

168
00:08:32,306 --> 00:08:34,226
We might get killed instantly
if we touch him.

169
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:35,514
Instant kill?

170
00:08:36,835 --> 00:08:40,195
It's okay, Kazuma.
You have me to help you if you die.

171
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:43,938
But don't get eaten. I can't
revive you if you are digested.

172
00:08:47,354 --> 00:08:49,536
EMERGENCY MISSION:
Come on, brave adventurers!

173
00:08:49,648 --> 00:08:54,128
DEFEAT THE DEVIL KING'S DEADLY SLIME
Let me have some fun!

174
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,520
I am sorry! I am truly sorry!

175
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:05,367
Why are you running away?

176
00:09:05,455 --> 00:09:07,295
Are you stupid? Run for your life!

177
00:09:07,433 --> 00:09:10,193
<i>Oh no! He is the strongest enemy
we have ever met!</i>

178
00:09:11,001 --> 00:09:12,921
Slime.

179
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,640
Darkness!
This is about life and death here.

180
00:09:18,731 --> 00:09:19,744
That is...

181
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,560
Kill the Devils and the Devil King!

182
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,681
Let's give up on the spring, shall we?

183
00:09:26,972 --> 00:09:29,532
The people from Axis Cult
are useless anyway.

184
00:09:29,609 --> 00:09:31,329
What did you say?

185
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,072
The Axis Cult from this town
will be burned to the ground!

186
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,640
That sounds nice.

187
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,605
Please, stop being so mean to Aqua.

188
00:09:40,693 --> 00:09:42,133
I've had enough of this!

189
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:48,405
Is it really okay?

190
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,357
Things might get even worse.

191
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,760
We really don't have other options now.

192
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,910
Look at you.

193
00:10:04,653 --> 00:10:07,744
You are a poisonous slime.
No one liked you, you are too gloomy.

194
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,160
You joined the Devil King's army
because you are an outcast.

195
00:10:11,231 --> 00:10:13,431
-It's time for you to repent!
-What did you say?

196
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,640
Aqua!

197
00:10:15,057 --> 00:10:16,128
Kazuma.

198
00:10:17,476 --> 00:10:21,596
You bunch of worthless vermin
dare to come back here?

199
00:10:22,553 --> 00:10:27,353
I won't have to stay here any longer
if I can finish tainting the spring.

200
00:10:27,566 --> 00:10:32,726
Finally! I can finally bid
this cursed town farewell!

201
00:10:32,802 --> 00:10:34,922
I can relate to that.

202
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,856
Right, what happened to the real manager?

203
00:10:40,358 --> 00:10:41,408
I ate him.

204
00:10:41,582 --> 00:10:43,782
What did you say?

205
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,020
I told you, I ate him.

206
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,280
I am a slime. Devouring is in my nature.

207
00:10:50,892 --> 00:10:51,904
Wiz?

208
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,800
Cursed Crystal Prison!

209
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,800
The condition for me to remain neutral...

210
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,560
is that no life will be harmed.

211
00:11:06,702 --> 00:11:10,262
-Right?
-Wiz, stop the spell.

212
00:11:10,357 --> 00:11:14,117
It's normal if an adventurer
loses his life.

213
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:19,680
They took the lives of monsters
as a means of livelihood.

214
00:11:19,994 --> 00:11:23,314
You should have the resolve
to be killed too.

215
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:24,821
As for the knights,

216
00:11:25,095 --> 00:11:29,015
they collect taxes, and in return,
they will protect the people.

217
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,560
Nothing can be helped
if life is traded for rewards.

218
00:11:34,398 --> 00:11:37,438
-However...
-The whole area will be contaminated.

219
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:42,109
The manager has done
nothing wrong, has he?

220
00:11:42,472 --> 00:11:44,552
Wiz looks so scary.

221
00:11:44,672 --> 00:11:48,472
If my opponent is the renowned lich,

222
00:11:48,576 --> 00:11:49,856
that leaves me with no choice.

223
00:11:53,634 --> 00:11:56,434
I will use my instinct
to consume all of you.

224
00:12:05,487 --> 00:12:06,528
This is...

225
00:12:09,547 --> 00:12:12,267
What a shame,
this is such a gorgeous slime!

226
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:15,650
If it wasn't venomous,
I would keep it as my pet.

227
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,280
Have you lost your brain?

228
00:12:26,152 --> 00:12:27,912
It's too dangerous, come back here!

229
00:12:28,591 --> 00:12:32,351
What is that? Is it poisoning our water?

230
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,720
Purification!

231
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,860
Purification!

232
00:12:37,984 --> 00:12:39,720
It's burning me!

233
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:42,039
Just leave it, we have to go now!

234
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:45,489
But if I don't save this place,
my beloved followers will...

235
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,640
Look, the girl with blue hair
was telling the truth.

236
00:12:49,758 --> 00:12:51,297
Kill that thing!

237
00:12:54,271 --> 00:12:56,431
Heal!

238
00:12:56,546 --> 00:12:58,066
It's burning me!

239
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,360
Purification!

240
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:05,441
Keep it up, miss!

241
00:13:05,572 --> 00:13:06,592
Watch out!

242
00:13:09,572 --> 00:13:11,812
Fall back, it's too dangerous out here.

243
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,470
What are you talking about,
you Eris cultist?

244
00:13:15,901 --> 00:13:17,421
You heathen!

245
00:13:19,662 --> 00:13:23,342
I will use my explosion spell
and blow it to kingdom come!

246
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:26,389
No, the mountain would be contaminated!

247
00:13:26,526 --> 00:13:29,166
Curse it! Wiz, is there any plan
that you can think of?

248
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,320
With my remaining power,
I can't freeze a monster of that size.

249
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,480
But I might be able to if it's smaller.

250
00:13:35,758 --> 00:13:38,272
How dare you taint
our precious hot springs!

251
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,800
Cursed monster!

252
00:13:50,186 --> 00:13:52,306
Even slime can be choosy.

253
00:13:52,401 --> 00:13:53,472
-Kazuma.
-What?

254
00:13:53,576 --> 00:13:57,096
Think of something smart as
you did before.

255
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,816
What do you mean by "something smart"?

256
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,008
Bones.

257
00:14:04,502 --> 00:14:07,582
-It's the manager of the hot spring!
-He ate the old man.

258
00:14:07,695 --> 00:14:08,815
That is unforgivable!

259
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:12,644
<i>He is yet to be completely digested.</i>

260
00:14:13,127 --> 00:14:14,207
<i>I have no other option now.</i>

261
00:14:14,927 --> 00:14:18,927
Aqua, can you revive me
as long as I am not digested?

262
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,840
Yes, I can.

263
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,120
Wiz, you can freeze it
if it's smaller, right?

264
00:14:25,803 --> 00:14:28,643
Yes, about half of its current size.

265
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,840
Megumin, wait for my command.
You'll have your chance to use magic.

266
00:14:31,931 --> 00:14:35,171
Really? I will do it!

267
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,910
I will just have to protect
everyone from the spilling slime.

268
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,480
Right, I leave that to you.

269
00:14:43,225 --> 00:14:45,821
<i>A lieutenant in the hot spring town?</i>

270
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,880
<i>Seriously, what is wrong with
the game balance in this world?</i>

271
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,960
Purification!

272
00:15:05,481 --> 00:15:08,356
I am your snack, right here!

273
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,538
Berserk...

274
00:15:16,126 --> 00:15:20,086
I am the greatest magician
of the greatest explosion spells.

275
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:23,345
Megumin be my name, the strike I make...

276
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,776
in the name of my love for my comrades,

277
00:15:25,947 --> 00:15:28,067
will use all its might to raze the world,

278
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,160
brace for the extreme tremor!

279
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:35,304
Coming to this town
is the worst fate you ever have.

280
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,966
Too bad you met us!

281
00:15:43,807 --> 00:15:46,647
I leave everything to you now!

282
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,320
Pitiful being,

283
00:15:54,523 --> 00:15:56,363
merge with the crimson smoke,

284
00:15:56,535 --> 00:15:58,655
repent in your suffocating screams!

285
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,680
Pierce through, Explosion!

286
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,560
-Let go of me, heathen!
-Fall back!

287
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,880
Miss.

288
00:16:20,107 --> 00:16:23,059
Cursed Crystal Prison!

289
00:16:56,573 --> 00:17:00,613
I am able to stop Hans
before my power runs out.

290
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:01,969
That is a relief.

291
00:17:03,668 --> 00:17:04,828
Did it work?

292
00:17:05,631 --> 00:17:08,391
I never thought you could
push me back so far.

293
00:17:08,724 --> 00:17:09,792
What?

294
00:17:17,732 --> 00:17:19,412
It's not over yet.

295
00:17:19,642 --> 00:17:23,722
I will devour all of you.

296
00:17:25,485 --> 00:17:30,125
Kill the Devils and the Devil King.

297
00:17:30,314 --> 00:17:35,074
Kill the Devils and the Devil King.

298
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:37,687
Kill the Devil King!

299
00:17:37,934 --> 00:17:41,854
Kill the Devils and the Devil King.

300
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:49,777
God Blow!

301
00:17:55,416 --> 00:18:00,656
I was expecting something stronger,
your feeble attack won't kill me.

302
00:18:00,817 --> 00:18:03,817
You worthless archpriest!

303
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,560
Miss!

304
00:18:09,507 --> 00:18:11,427
The code of Axis Cult!

305
00:18:11,585 --> 00:18:15,345
You will make it if you work hard.
You are all capable people.

306
00:18:15,435 --> 00:18:18,075
Failing is not your fault.

307
00:18:18,187 --> 00:18:20,547
Failing is the world's fault.

308
00:18:20,747 --> 00:18:22,707
Just run away from anything
that is unpleasant.

309
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,120
Running away is not a failure.
Running away is our victory!

310
00:18:27,313 --> 00:18:31,713
Any answer after prolonged hesitation
will end in regret.

311
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:35,713
If you are going to regret it anyway,
just enjoy any happiness you have now!

312
00:18:35,975 --> 00:18:37,815
What is this light?

313
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:40,544
Do not be concerned about your age.

314
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,220
Not even god can tell if you
are going to smile in the future.

315
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,880
Just enjoy the present!

316
00:18:46,987 --> 00:18:50,187
Kill the Devils and the Devil King!

317
00:18:50,524 --> 00:18:53,705
Kill the Devils and the Devil King!

318
00:18:54,516 --> 00:18:58,436
You tainted the hot springs
of my beloved worshippers.

319
00:18:58,632 --> 00:19:00,320
You deserve endless deaths for this sin!

320
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,893
Repent, repent to your Goddess!

321
00:19:04,692 --> 00:19:07,452
Kill the Devils and the Devil King!

322
00:19:07,793 --> 00:19:12,153
What? Eris's chest is padded!

323
00:19:12,448 --> 00:19:20,768
God Requiem!

324
00:19:24,126 --> 00:19:29,566
The cursed goddess they worship...

325
00:19:30,641 --> 00:19:33,241
is actually you?

326
00:19:41,953 --> 00:19:43,422
<i>The battle is over.</i>

327
00:19:44,272 --> 00:19:48,392
<i>We were thanked for saving the day
in the commotion of tainted springs.</i>

328
00:19:48,548 --> 00:19:49,748
<i>Or so we thought we will.</i>

329
00:19:50,052 --> 00:19:54,892
I worked so hard to cleanse it,
why is everyone so mad at me?

330
00:19:55,071 --> 00:19:57,151
<i>Aqua's God Requiem...</i>

331
00:19:57,352 --> 00:20:01,392
<i>turned all the hot springs
in Arcanretia into hot water.</i>

332
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,045
Hot water!

333
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:07,530
<i>The attempt to cut off the Axis Cult's
income by the Devil King...</i>

334
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,880
<i>actually ended up in success.</i>

335
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:14,984
<i>We planned to use Wiz's
teleportation to go home,</i>

336
00:20:15,354 --> 00:20:17,754
<i>but Purification took a toll on her.</i>

337
00:20:17,857 --> 00:20:19,697
<i>She almost disappeared.</i>

338
00:20:20,384 --> 00:20:22,704
Come over here.

339
00:20:23,072 --> 00:20:26,895
<i>So, we had to call for a cart
to bring us home.</i>

340
00:20:29,949 --> 00:20:32,829
<i>In the end, this wasn't
a healing trip at all.</i>

341
00:20:33,716 --> 00:20:38,836
Look, we can see Axel from here.

342
00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:55,698
Did you go to the hot spring?
It must be nice.

343
00:20:55,841 --> 00:20:56,885
Welcome back.

344
00:20:56,993 --> 00:20:59,553
Kazuma, let's have a drink
at the Guild tonight.

345
00:21:01,036 --> 00:21:04,076
Welcome back, you must be tired.

346
00:21:06,829 --> 00:21:08,349
You look fresh.

347
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:10,715
Well.

348
00:21:11,381 --> 00:21:13,101
No. My mind is playing tricks on me.

349
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,908
Welcome back, everyone.

350
00:21:17,114 --> 00:21:19,634
Megumin, let's have a duel today!

351
00:21:19,843 --> 00:21:22,163
You came here every day
while we were gone.

352
00:21:22,265 --> 00:21:25,825
No! I just came by occasionally.

353
00:21:26,701 --> 00:21:28,141
What a drag.

354
00:21:28,518 --> 00:21:30,518
We haven't fought in a while.
I'll entertain your challenge.

355
00:21:30,965 --> 00:21:32,378
-Really?
-Yes.

356
00:21:33,658 --> 00:21:35,698
-I am back.
-We are back.

357
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,441
Home is the best, after all.

358
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,506
<i>Winter leaves as spring arrives.</i>

359
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,437
<i>I fall asleep here
and wake up at the same place.</i>

360
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,800
<i>Now, my life here</i>

361
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:51,866
<i>is to bring blessing upon this
unreasonable, weird, cruel...</i>

362
00:21:52,082 --> 00:21:54,482
<i>and wonderful world and you.</i>

363
00:21:54,967 --> 00:21:59,167
Kazuma, the hot water is not coming out!

364
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,720
I am coming!
