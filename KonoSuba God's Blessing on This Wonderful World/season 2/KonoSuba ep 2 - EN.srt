1
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:06,699
It's so cold.

2
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:10,779
Someone, please give me warmth.

3
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:14,019
What's with the screaming?

4
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:17,699
Don't you understand?
Darkness went to the governor's mansion.

5
00:00:17,819 --> 00:00:19,859
She hasn't come back the whole night.

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,200
She is now...

7
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:28,619
Megumin?

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,792
What's with the cat?

9
00:00:30,499 --> 00:00:32,960
It won't cause you any trouble.

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,080
-You want to adopt it?
-Can I?

11
00:00:37,773 --> 00:00:38,813
That hurts.

12
00:00:38,933 --> 00:00:42,693
Why is it so fierce against me?
What's wrong with the cat?

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,840
With that black fur and
big-headed attitude,

14
00:00:45,933 --> 00:00:48,253
I sense something sinister here.

15
00:00:48,413 --> 00:00:51,053
What is the name of this monster?

16
00:00:51,221 --> 00:00:52,341
Chomusuke.

17
00:00:54,373 --> 00:00:56,053
-What did you say just now?
-Chomusuke.

18
00:00:58,496 --> 00:01:00,928
What were you arguing about just now?

19
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:04,493
You sure look calm. Darkness is now...

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,400
I heard some rumors
about the governor too.

21
00:01:07,493 --> 00:01:10,693
-But Darkness won't be so easily...
-Kid is so naive!

22
00:01:10,813 --> 00:01:13,653
Don't you understand he is a pervert?

23
00:01:16,013 --> 00:01:18,253
You can take away my body...

24
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:21,533
But you will never get my heart!

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,680
That's what she will say.

26
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:29,040
What? Darkness is in danger!
What should we do, Kazuma?

27
00:01:29,293 --> 00:01:30,613
It's too late.

28
00:01:30,773 --> 00:01:34,933
Listen, once she returns,
be nice to her like usual.

29
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,453
Okay.

30
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:40,893
Darkness has been to the adult world,
we can't ask her what happened.

31
00:01:42,093 --> 00:01:45,413
-Darkness!
-Satou Kazuma, are you here?

32
00:01:54,653 --> 00:02:00,653

34
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:27,213
No!

(A Friend For This Crimson Demon Girl!)<i>Megumin cast explosion spells...</i>

37
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,146
<i>all over the place.</i>

38
00:03:35,413 --> 00:03:39,453
<i>She woke up the giant toads
that were hibernating.</i>

39
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:43,093
<i>So, we are here to clean up the mess.</i>

40
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,440
I don't want to be the toad's snack! No!

41
00:03:46,653 --> 00:03:49,933
The toad is agile, as always,
even in this cold weather.

42
00:03:50,013 --> 00:03:51,773
How stubborn is it?

43
00:03:51,853 --> 00:03:54,053
We can't be left out
of the action either.

44
00:03:54,816 --> 00:03:56,613
I must become stronger.

45
00:03:56,893 --> 00:03:58,333
I have to survive...

46
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:00,453
in this cruel world.

47
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:01,728
-I'll save you now!
-No.

48
00:04:01,973 --> 00:04:03,296
Save Aqua first.

49
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,853
The weather is cold, but
the inside of the toad is warm.

50
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:10,933
After exhausting myself
with the explosion spell,

51
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:12,992
I can only stall it.

52
00:04:14,048 --> 00:04:15,424
I'll leave it to you then.

53
00:04:16,064 --> 00:04:18,361
-Is that really okay?
-Kazuma!

54
00:04:18,493 --> 00:04:22,773
I can't take it anymore! Hurry up!

55
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:27,812
<i>Our team has Darkness
as our sturdy shield.</i>

56
00:04:28,013 --> 00:04:30,813
<i>However, no one is effective
at ranged attacks.</i>

57
00:04:31,296 --> 00:04:34,093
<i>So, I learned a new skill.</i>

58
00:04:34,304 --> 00:04:36,773
<i>That skill is called Snipe.</i>

59
00:04:38,613 --> 00:04:39,973
<i>Snipe.</i>

60
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,400
<i>Those with higher luck
have higher accuracy.</i>

61
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,413
<i>It suits me perfectly.</i>

62
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,800
Kazuma!

63
00:04:54,773 --> 00:04:58,238
Seriously? Your arrow went through
the charm point on my head!

64
00:05:00,293 --> 00:05:02,013
Aqua!

65
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,588
Skill, my skill.

66
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:15,769
Is this how you usually operate?

67
00:05:16,356 --> 00:05:18,636
Look, the toads!

68
00:05:20,276 --> 00:05:22,756
<i>Wait, we don't have enough snacks...</i>

69
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,539
<i>No, I mean bait for them!</i>

70
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,896
Aqua, you will be the bait.

71
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,890
No, be the bait yourself!

72
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,040
Don't be stupid, you don't have
the power to defeat the toad.

73
00:05:34,176 --> 00:05:36,019
If we can kill one, then
it will only be two left.

74
00:05:36,096 --> 00:05:38,620
You and Sena will be able to stall them.

75
00:05:39,054 --> 00:05:42,934
I am here to monitor you,
don't drag me into this.

76
00:05:47,796 --> 00:05:50,716
Kazuma, this is the chance
to kill the toad!

77
00:05:54,156 --> 00:05:56,636
You fools!

78
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:59,996
Excuse me, but I am
slowly being swallowed.

79
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:03,043
Can you save me from this thing now?

80
00:06:03,385 --> 00:06:06,446
Seriously? I wish Darkness is here now!

81
00:06:21,476 --> 00:06:23,716
This is the end!

82
00:06:23,996 --> 00:06:26,356
Light of Saber!

83
00:06:45,796 --> 00:06:47,756
Honestly, I would rather
not touch the slime.

84
00:06:50,196 --> 00:06:51,556
You should be able to walk now.

85
00:06:51,732 --> 00:06:53,972
I don't know who you are,
but you saved us back there.

86
00:06:55,196 --> 00:06:57,836
No, I wasn't trying to help.

87
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,160
It would be embarrassing
if my rival is eaten by toads.

88
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:05,619
Rival?

89
00:07:08,704 --> 00:07:10,464
Long time no see, Megumin.

90
00:07:10,692 --> 00:07:13,852
We have to settle the score today.

91
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:15,579
Who are you?

92
00:07:16,756 --> 00:07:20,636
Isn't it weird that you didn't
even tell us your name?

93
00:07:21,036 --> 00:07:25,396
This must be a scamming plot
Kazuma told me about.

94
00:07:25,504 --> 00:07:27,243
Fine!

95
00:07:27,716 --> 00:07:30,396
This is embarrassing in front
of people I don't know.

96
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,596
I am Yunyun.

97
00:07:33,836 --> 00:07:37,236
I am the arch-wizard that uses
the highest level of magic.

98
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,160
I will soon become the leader
of the Crimson Magic Clan!

99
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,200
Right, she is Yunyun.

100
00:07:42,636 --> 00:07:44,276
Her father is the chief
of the Crimson Magic Clan.

101
00:07:44,356 --> 00:07:46,076
She claims to be my rival.

102
00:07:46,156 --> 00:07:47,756
You clearly remember everything.

103
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,013
I see.

104
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,440
I am her adventure partner, Kazuma.

105
00:07:51,956 --> 00:07:53,276
Nice to meet you, Yunyun.

106
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:57,676
What? You didn't laugh at
my name after hearing it.

107
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,360
In this wonderful world,

108
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,040
some people have more
than just weird names.

109
00:08:02,196 --> 00:08:04,276
Even their nicknames are strange.

110
00:08:04,352 --> 00:08:06,680
For example, 'Explosion Girl
with Serious Mental Issue.'

111
00:08:06,776 --> 00:08:09,416
Are you talking about me?
Is that what you mean?

112
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:13,789
That nickname was given
before I even realized it.

113
00:08:13,888 --> 00:08:17,568
Not bad, Megumin.
You found a great partner.

114
00:08:17,796 --> 00:08:19,670
This is how my rival should be.

115
00:08:19,796 --> 00:08:23,360
I'll defeat you and be the champion
of the Crimson Magic Clan.

116
00:08:23,476 --> 00:08:26,777
Come on, Megumin!
Let's have a duel right now!

117
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,960
No, it's so cold out here.

118
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,320
Why? Please, duel me!

119
00:08:33,396 --> 00:08:35,648
-No.
-Come on, just once.

120
00:08:36,596 --> 00:08:38,516
You finished the job today.

121
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,800
But it is possible you are
putting up an act to fool me.

122
00:08:43,075 --> 00:08:44,128
Goodbye.

123
00:08:44,356 --> 00:08:49,556
I'll head to the guild for paperwork
and have them remove the toads.

124
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:53,089
This can be a pain if I am
the only one left here.

125
00:08:55,596 --> 00:08:57,156
What a drag.

126
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,600
I can't use any magic for today.

127
00:09:00,716 --> 00:09:04,276
Let's fight with the martial art
you are specialized in.

128
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,368
Is that really okay?

129
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,960
But you never paid any attention
during the gym class.

130
00:09:10,156 --> 00:09:13,916
You used petty tricks
once we had a break time.

131
00:09:13,996 --> 00:09:17,236
You always took away my lunch
after you picked a fight with me.

132
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,760
-Hey.
-This was life and death for me too.

133
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,320
For family reasons, her lunch
was my hope of salvation.

134
00:09:26,723 --> 00:09:29,203
Okay, we'll fight with martial arts.

135
00:09:29,876 --> 00:09:31,876
-What? Really?
-Fine.

136
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:35,096
Come on, show me what you got!

137
00:09:40,116 --> 00:09:43,276
<i>Judging by their physique,
Yunyun has the advantage.</i>

138
00:09:43,556 --> 00:09:47,156
<i>Megumin may act tough, but she is
not good at hand-to-hand combat.</i>

139
00:09:52,596 --> 00:09:53,632
Megumin,

140
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:58,196
your whole body is
flickering with shines.

141
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,280
Yes, the slime on my body is
the excretion from the toad.

142
00:10:04,516 --> 00:10:08,636
Once you close in, I'll hold onto you

143
00:10:08,716 --> 00:10:11,516
and slam you right to the ground.

144
00:10:11,596 --> 00:10:13,076
What?

145
00:10:13,576 --> 00:10:17,367
You are trying to diminish my spirit
and make me surrender.

146
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,560
Right?

147
00:10:20,323 --> 00:10:22,603
We are friends.

148
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:27,187
As friends, we have to
carry each other's burden.

149
00:10:27,756 --> 00:10:31,636
-No!
-Slime, slime, slime, slime!

150
00:10:31,796 --> 00:10:36,076
I surrender! Don't come any closer!

151
00:10:37,876 --> 00:10:41,116
I surrender!

152
00:10:41,188 --> 00:10:42,548
I won again today.

153
00:10:45,116 --> 00:10:46,756
Stop it!

154
00:10:46,876 --> 00:10:48,876
You scoundrels!

155
00:10:49,196 --> 00:10:50,636
I'll kill you!

156
00:10:51,796 --> 00:10:54,236
She ran away in tears.

157
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,840
Kazuma, this is the trophy.
Use this to pay the mortgage.

158
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:00,196
Are you okay with that?

159
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,960
For an extraordinary magician like me,

160
00:11:04,051 --> 00:11:05,691
this thing is completely useless.

161
00:11:07,236 --> 00:11:09,632
Do you want to learn skills
other than explosion spells?

162
00:11:09,728 --> 00:11:11,836
-No.
-I thought so.

163
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,600
What's wrong?

164
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:19,419
I feel like Megumin is much
prettier than the other girl.

165
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:21,787
Wait!

166
00:11:22,436 --> 00:11:26,996
Thank you, let me hug you
as a token of my gratitude.

167
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,208
-Don't come any closer.
-Come on, cheer up.

168
00:11:30,336 --> 00:11:36,236
There are others who would spend
money to hug a slimy girl.

169
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,180
The stench of a toad!

170
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,796
I had never experienced such
a terrible hug before.

171
00:11:44,276 --> 00:11:46,716
Chomusuke, how are you?

172
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,080
I am going to take a bath.

173
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,508
What?

174
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,280
Lady first, don't you know that?

175
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,480
I am a man that pursues gender equality.

176
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:03,076
I won't allow anyone to use
feminism for her own convenience.

177
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:07,556
You ask the men to do everything
when it's inconvenient for you.

178
00:12:13,116 --> 00:12:15,476
If you want to have
the privilege of being a lady,

179
00:12:15,556 --> 00:12:17,956
you must first become a lady!

180
00:12:18,036 --> 00:12:20,356
Do you take me as a mere kid?

181
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,916
Listen, only three parts of me
haven't gone through puberty.

182
00:12:22,996 --> 00:12:27,116
You are just another kid to me.
Nothing you say can change that.

183
00:12:27,236 --> 00:12:29,156
This man really started stripping.

184
00:12:29,236 --> 00:12:32,076
I won't let you win, never!

185
00:12:32,156 --> 00:12:34,445
Leave now if you understand what I mean.

186
00:12:34,596 --> 00:12:39,316
Is that so? Fine.
You really don't see me as a woman.

187
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:42,505
Well, we can take a bath together!

188
00:12:42,716 --> 00:12:45,036
Sure, that makes things a lot easier.

189
00:12:45,756 --> 00:12:50,716
Wait, I am not a person that says
Fools, how could you do that

190
00:12:50,796 --> 00:12:53,236
and get away by acting all shy.

191
00:12:53,316 --> 00:12:57,396
Listen, normal logic won't work on me.

192
00:12:57,654 --> 00:13:02,528
For example, if Megumin likes me
while another girl is wooing me,

193
00:13:02,676 --> 00:13:05,356
I will not hesitate to retaliate
if you use an explosion spell on me...

194
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,320
simply because you are jealous.

195
00:13:07,436 --> 00:13:09,316
I am a man that does what must be done!

196
00:13:09,396 --> 00:13:11,716
Bear that in mind!

197
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,373
Doing what must be done
seems inappropriate here.

198
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:18,596
Forget it.

199
00:13:18,716 --> 00:13:21,716
I said so much to provoke you,
and you're not taking a bath with me?

200
00:13:21,876 --> 00:13:23,236
Coward.

201
00:13:23,356 --> 00:13:26,316
What? Who are you calling a coward here?

202
00:13:26,396 --> 00:13:28,196
-Yes.
-How dare you to say that!

203
00:13:28,316 --> 00:13:30,596
I'll do it! It's just a bath!

204
00:13:30,716 --> 00:13:34,636
Stop covering yourself
with the towel, get in there!

205
00:13:34,716 --> 00:13:37,156
Stop it, pervert!
Can't you act like a girl?

206
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:38,419
Here it goes!

207
00:13:46,756 --> 00:13:48,916
I thought cats hated water.

208
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,540
It likes to keep itself clean.

209
00:13:54,596 --> 00:13:56,596
Can we really just leave her alone?

210
00:13:56,716 --> 00:13:58,476
She will come again sooner or later.

211
00:13:58,635 --> 00:14:01,355
She said I was her rival.
She will search everywhere for me.

212
00:14:02,043 --> 00:14:04,243
You are the same age as her, right?

213
00:14:04,731 --> 00:14:08,331
I dare you to tell me what's on
your mind while you stare at me.

214
00:14:09,707 --> 00:14:11,827
Puberty goes differently for everyone.

215
00:14:11,902 --> 00:14:15,222
-Stop, you'll cause a heart attack!
-Darker than the darkness...

216
00:14:15,836 --> 00:14:20,516
One or two years from now, my figure
will make Yunyun jealous as well.

217
00:14:22,676 --> 00:14:25,236
Don't stare at me like that!

218
00:14:27,219 --> 00:14:29,859
Why am I taking a bath with Megumin?

219
00:14:30,043 --> 00:14:34,083
You are acting all calm now?

220
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,400
This can be hard to explain
if anyone sees us.

221
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,520
I am back!

222
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,200
Is no one home?
I got the money for selling the toads.

223
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,892
The lock! Did you lock the dressing room?

224
00:14:48,036 --> 00:14:49,716
No.

225
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:51,716
What should we do now?

226
00:14:51,876 --> 00:14:54,996
Kazuma, Megumin, I am back!

227
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,680
Come on, say something to me!

228
00:14:58,316 --> 00:14:59,996
Are you taking a bath?

229
00:15:00,755 --> 00:15:02,915
Freeze!

230
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,256
Will I perish, or
will my magic hold it off?

231
00:15:08,356 --> 00:15:09,356
This is the decisive moment!

232
00:15:09,636 --> 00:15:11,809
Do not waver, my magical power!

233
00:15:11,956 --> 00:15:13,476
If Aqua finds out about this,

234
00:15:13,568 --> 00:15:18,952
she will tell everyone about
the nasty 'Lolicon Kazuma'!

235
00:15:21,524 --> 00:15:23,724
I don't even have
the strength to stand now.

236
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,080
Megumin, let's have lunch together
after you finish the bath.

237
00:15:29,156 --> 00:15:33,436
And be quick with it, I am all slimy too.

238
00:15:38,316 --> 00:15:40,636
That was a close call.

239
00:15:40,756 --> 00:15:44,116
I was almost mistaken for a Lolicon.

240
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,520
Megumin, excuse me.
I can't move, help me scrub my back.

241
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,360
Taking a bath with me
makes you a Lolicon?

242
00:15:54,476 --> 00:15:56,916
You better explain what that means.

243
00:15:57,036 --> 00:15:59,360
Stop, what do you want?

244
00:15:59,476 --> 00:16:00,704
You will be seen as a maniac!

245
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:05,156
Wait, Aqua! I am being bullied by a Loli!

246
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,656
Nasty Lolicon.

247
00:16:11,148 --> 00:16:13,388
TODAY'S ACHIEVEMENT:
KILLING 12 GIANT TOAD

248
00:16:18,076 --> 00:16:20,716
<i>The second day after I got
the loathsome nickname,</i>

249
00:16:20,828 --> 00:16:25,188
<i>we went to Wiz's shop to discuss
settling the debt.</i>

250
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:28,547
I am sorry, can we sell this here?

251
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,240
-This is...
-I am Yunyun.

252
00:16:33,316 --> 00:16:36,736
What a coincidence!
This must be fate's planning.

253
00:16:36,956 --> 00:16:40,676
We actually meet each other here.
We really are rivals.

254
00:16:41,244 --> 00:16:45,684
She's been waiting the whole morning
after I told her you often come here.

255
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:47,956
What are you talking about, lady boss?

256
00:16:48,051 --> 00:16:50,611
I am just here to buy magical equipment.

257
00:16:50,688 --> 00:16:53,880
Please, I want to buy this.

258
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,544
I see.

259
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,080
You don't have to take a detour.
Just come straight to our house.

260
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,640
I can't go to other's house so suddenly.

261
00:17:03,744 --> 00:17:06,656
You deserve to be alone
for being so whiny.

262
00:17:06,848 --> 00:17:07,904
Really?

263
00:17:07,996 --> 00:17:11,276
Yunyun is a freak.
She thinks her name invites mockery.

264
00:17:11,556 --> 00:17:14,516
She always ate her lunch alone in school.

265
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,756
I purposely used petty moves on her,

266
00:17:17,876 --> 00:17:20,796
but she still came here all
cheered up for a fight.

267
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:24,236
It's not as bad as you said.
I do have friends.

268
00:17:24,516 --> 00:17:28,196
I heard the keyword. You have a friend?

269
00:17:28,356 --> 00:17:30,876
Yes, I have friends and they are real.

270
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:34,476
Funifura and Dodonko are both my friends.

271
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:37,108
Then I bought both of them a meal.

272
00:17:37,276 --> 00:17:40,116
That's enough,
we don't want to hear anything more.

273
00:17:40,276 --> 00:17:43,456
I can only use explosion spells.

274
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:46,032
I would rather avoid any magical battle.

275
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,540
You can always learn other magic.

276
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:51,036
I am sure you earned
a lot of skill points.

277
00:17:51,139 --> 00:17:52,419
I did earn a lot.

278
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,240
I spent them all on
upgrading explosion magic...

279
00:17:56,316 --> 00:17:58,356
and high-speed incantations.

280
00:17:58,436 --> 00:18:01,596
Fool, why are you so obsessed
with explosion spells?

281
00:18:01,676 --> 00:18:03,556
Sure, keep her talking.

282
00:18:03,636 --> 00:18:05,206
She is always so stubborn.

283
00:18:05,316 --> 00:18:08,436
Duel, duel, duel. They are schoolmates,
yet she is so bloodthirsty.

284
00:18:08,768 --> 00:18:09,824
Hey!

285
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,800
This can be useful.
The Crystal of Friendship.

286
00:18:14,116 --> 00:18:17,356
If a magician doesn't have
the required skill,

287
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:19,048
she can't use this item to its fullest.

288
00:18:19,236 --> 00:18:22,276
Can I make new friends
if I use it properly?

289
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,716
Yes.

290
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,160
Okay, let's try it out.

291
00:18:26,276 --> 00:18:29,476
There is no reason for us
to be good friends.

292
00:18:29,596 --> 00:18:31,436
Are you afraid, Megumin?

293
00:18:32,036 --> 00:18:33,147
In other words,

294
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,040
any who can use it correctly
is the better magician.

295
00:18:37,459 --> 00:18:38,979
Megumin, let's duel!

296
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:42,234
If you say so, I will have to show you...

297
00:18:42,476 --> 00:18:44,876
the power of a true magician!

298
00:18:44,996 --> 00:18:47,556
Let's settle it once and for all today!

299
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,480
Crimson Magic Clan sure is impressive.

300
00:18:54,586 --> 00:18:57,596
Crystal, show me your power!

301
00:18:57,691 --> 00:19:00,131
The crystal's energy is activating.

302
00:19:08,076 --> 00:19:10,556
I have never seen so
many projections at once before.

303
00:19:10,686 --> 00:19:12,246
They are both amazing.

304
00:19:12,427 --> 00:19:14,827
What is this?

305
00:19:22,316 --> 00:19:24,636
She is collecting bread crust.

306
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,880
Wait.

307
00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:32,299
Happy Birthday!

308
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,676
She was all alone?

309
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,280
Stop!

310
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,760
Big Sister, you are awesome!

311
00:19:47,716 --> 00:19:49,636
Not bad, how about this move?

312
00:19:52,676 --> 00:19:55,076
You are amazing!

313
00:20:04,676 --> 00:20:07,076
Big Sister, you are awesome!

314
00:20:07,756 --> 00:20:10,516
Making friends with a demon
is not bad, either.

315
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:14,476
She worked odd jobs just
to buy her friends a meal?

316
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,120
What is that? They are eating bugs.

317
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,076
What is this thing?

318
00:20:21,196 --> 00:20:23,916
Lady boss, I thought you say
this is the Crystal of Friendship.

319
00:20:23,996 --> 00:20:27,596
This is a value-for-money item

320
00:20:27,676 --> 00:20:30,036
that improves relationships...

321
00:20:30,116 --> 00:20:34,219
by showing each other your darkest past.

322
00:20:34,716 --> 00:20:38,476
Megumin, can we be friends?

323
00:20:38,596 --> 00:20:41,519
Here it goes!

324
00:20:47,436 --> 00:20:49,836
I will put this in Kazuma's bill.

325
00:20:49,956 --> 00:20:52,556
Wait, Megumin is the one who broke it.

326
00:20:52,756 --> 00:20:56,636
Yunyun wanted to use that item.
She should pay the bill.

327
00:20:56,716 --> 00:20:59,036
A duel. A memorable duel.

328
00:20:59,116 --> 00:21:00,824
When are you going to stop sobbing?

329
00:21:00,956 --> 00:21:03,904
But in the end, we can't tell
who the winner is.

330
00:21:04,036 --> 00:21:05,673
Can we make this a draw?

331
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:07,636
I am fine with that.

332
00:21:08,276 --> 00:21:11,716
I am not a kid who will
grudge against this kind of thing.

333
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,400
Right, we once promised to see
who grew up faster.

334
00:21:16,516 --> 00:21:19,956
Since you said you are not a kid,
we can have a match on that.

335
00:21:20,076 --> 00:21:24,516
When I said I am not a kid,
I meant something else.

336
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:27,236
That's because...

337
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,400
I am so close to Kazuma that
we even shared the same bath.

338
00:21:34,476 --> 00:21:36,236
-Wait!
-What?

339
00:21:39,556 --> 00:21:40,836
What are you talking about?

340
00:21:40,956 --> 00:21:43,996
This big mouth of yours!
Are you trying to spread rumors with it?

341
00:21:44,332 --> 00:21:45,979
Today...

342
00:21:46,436 --> 00:21:50,276
Today, I have completely lost to her!

343
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:52,928
Please, come again!

344
00:21:53,036 --> 00:21:54,436
What a bothersome kid.

345
00:21:54,567 --> 00:21:55,687
Speak of yourself.

346
00:21:58,476 --> 00:21:59,699
Another victory today!

347
00:23:30,016 --> 00:23:39,925
(Episode 3:
Peace for the Master of This Labyrinth!)
