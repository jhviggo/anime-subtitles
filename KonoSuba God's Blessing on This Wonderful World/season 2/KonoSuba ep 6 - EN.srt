1
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:06,489
No!

2
00:00:06,566 --> 00:00:09,326
It's still so cold outside!

3
00:00:09,577 --> 00:00:11,897
Why do you both want to
go outside so badly?

4
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:14,935
We can't use Explosion Magic
if we don't go outside!

5
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:17,729
The monsters are very active
when early spring comes.

6
00:00:17,855 --> 00:00:19,455
It's time for the adventurers to show up!

7
00:00:19,994 --> 00:00:21,248
You both are not children anymore!

8
00:00:21,367 --> 00:00:24,367
Are you both on the same level
as the children who want to play outside?

9
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:27,561
Since you both really wanted to go
outside, you should both just go!

10
00:00:27,659 --> 00:00:29,339
Who are you calling "children"?

11
00:00:29,424 --> 00:00:32,024
Aqua was more like a child just now!

12
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,280
If this continues,

13
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,360
you'll turn into "that."

14
00:00:37,694 --> 00:00:40,694
I don't want to turn into "that," too.

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,800
But before persuading me, do something
about that good-for-nothing!

16
00:00:44,938 --> 00:00:48,138
Hey, you three. I might be easygoing,
but I get angry when it's necessary.

17
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,168
You all just called me "that" and
said I was "good-for-nothing."

18
00:00:51,265 --> 00:00:52,345
That was too rude.

19
00:00:54,378 --> 00:00:57,058
If you have an opinion,
come out and say it.

20
00:01:08,691 --> 00:01:14,452
(KONOSUBA:
God's Blessing on This Wonderful World! 2)

21
00:02:31,514 --> 00:02:32,854
(Episode 6:
Goodbye to This Irritating Living World!)

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,018
<i>We defeated Devil King's general,
demon Vanir.</i>

23
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:41,788
<i>But, we couldn't enjoy
and celebrate our victory.</i>

24
00:02:42,668 --> 00:02:45,308
<i>Wiz is one of Devil King's generals too.</i>

25
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:50,465
<i>We need to clarify the brutal truth
about us attacking her comrade.</i>

26
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,762
I'll tell her about Vanir.

27
00:02:54,029 --> 00:02:55,365
Although it wasn't long

28
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,600
we wreaked havoc together
while sharing one body too.

29
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:01,178
As a crusader who serves Goddess Eris,

30
00:03:01,312 --> 00:03:03,632
I probably shouldn't be saying this.

31
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,680
But he wasn't hateful at all.

32
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:19,559
-Wiz, I have something to say to you!
-Welcome!

33
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:23,759
The girl with a distant look in her
eyes who said embarrassing things...

34
00:03:23,922 --> 00:03:26,082
in front of the shop,
I want to tell you something.

35
00:03:26,179 --> 00:03:28,659
"But he wasn't hateful at all."

36
00:03:28,753 --> 00:03:31,993
However, demons have no gender.

37
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:35,007
Even if you confessed to me
so shyly, I can't accept it.

38
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,888
Such a strong negative emotion
of embarrassment!

39
00:03:38,074 --> 00:03:39,354
Delicious!

40
00:03:39,435 --> 00:03:41,664
What's wrong? You're crouching while
burying your face in your hands.

41
00:03:41,776 --> 00:03:44,616
Did you really think that I've perished?

42
00:03:45,036 --> 00:03:46,116
There, there.

43
00:03:46,586 --> 00:03:48,426
Mr. Kazuma, I've heard about it!

44
00:03:48,584 --> 00:03:51,504
You all defeated Mr. Vanir and
cleared your suspicion as a spy!

45
00:03:51,847 --> 00:03:54,727
-Congratulations!
-Let's not talk about this.

46
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:57,322
Why is he still alright after
being blasted by Explosion Magic?

47
00:03:57,408 --> 00:03:58,976
He's completely unharmed! What happened?

48
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,560
After that attack, even I
couldn't have been unharmed.

49
00:04:03,668 --> 00:04:05,548
Take a good look at my mask.

50
00:04:07,432 --> 00:04:10,552
I've lost one life.
I'm now the second generation.

51
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:12,419
Are you kidding me?

52
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:16,723
Mr. Vanir planned to resign as
the Devil King's army's general.

53
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,520
So now, Mr. Vanir isn't in charge of...

54
00:04:18,624 --> 00:04:20,852
maintaining the barrier of
the Devil King's Castle﻿.

55
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,810
He's totally harmless.

56
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,080
Harmless?

57
00:04:26,716 --> 00:04:29,156
You, the guy who traveled from afar,

58
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,190
helping us with our business
is beneficial.

59
00:04:32,568 --> 00:04:34,008
There's a good opportunity.

60
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,040
Do you want to hear it?

61
00:04:36,702 --> 00:04:39,102
Vanir's "moneymaking business" was...

62
00:04:39,253 --> 00:04:43,773
to produce and sell the products
from my original world here in bulk.

63
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,169
<i>I'm in charge of developing the products.</i>

64
00:04:46,274 --> 00:04:49,514
<i>Vanir guarantees batch production
and the sales channel.</i>

65
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:53,139
<i>The first stage of this plan
is this kotatsu.</i>

66
00:04:54,448 --> 00:04:57,968
I know the heating system of
Kazuma's world is excellent,

67
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,832
but it's almost time
to begin our work, no?

68
00:05:00,922 --> 00:05:02,162
That's right, Kazuma.

69
00:05:03,162 --> 00:05:04,962
-Come out.
-Freeze!

70
00:05:11,108 --> 00:05:13,588
This guy is retaliating!

71
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,840
Kazuma, that's just about enough!

72
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,635
Stop retaliating! Behave yourself!

73
00:05:19,977 --> 00:05:21,777
My head!

74
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,770
Don't underestimate me.

75
00:05:25,077 --> 00:05:28,597
I'm Kazuma, who has dealt with Devil
King's generals and other big shots.

76
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,290
Re-challenge me after
you've improved your skills!

77
00:05:33,298 --> 00:05:36,858
I won't yield just because of
these petty tricks!

78
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,960
How dare you steal my magic!
You scoundrel!

79
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,620
I won't lose to anyone right now.

80
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,057
It's an emergency.

81
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,476
I might sound selfish, but
let's call it a ceasefire for a while.

82
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:59,520
Sorry, could you both lift
the mat under the kotatsu

83
00:05:59,663 --> 00:06:02,143
and bring me to the toilet like this?

84
00:06:04,602 --> 00:06:06,002
They're quite compliant.

85
00:06:06,485 --> 00:06:09,125
Let's throw this guy outside together
with his kotatsu.

86
00:06:09,248 --> 00:06:12,068
Alright. Aqua! Please open the door.

87
00:06:12,203 --> 00:06:15,616
Stop! Are you all still human?

88
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,550
-Stop! Wait! No!
-One, two!

89
00:06:24,796 --> 00:06:26,316
It's still so cold.

90
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,160
Fireplace. Sofa.

91
00:06:29,828 --> 00:06:32,148
Kazuma, why are we taking it this way?

92
00:06:32,418 --> 00:06:34,630
The guild is not this way.

93
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:40,321
Don't assume that I was just
nesting in the kotatsu.

94
00:06:40,926 --> 00:06:43,766
-Hello!
-Welcome!

95
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:45,111
Sir, is it done?

96
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:47,123
My katana is almost done, right?

97
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:49,509
Yes, it's done.

98
00:06:49,605 --> 00:06:52,384
I made it according to
the shape that you wanted.

99
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:53,792
Here.

100
00:06:57,809 --> 00:07:02,329
I didn't understand the technical
things like quenching and so on.

101
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,842
But it was still quite
an interesting job.

102
00:07:06,841 --> 00:07:10,281
Is that your new partner?

103
00:07:11,235 --> 00:07:13,555
My new partner.

104
00:07:14,086 --> 00:07:16,446
Kazuma, when did you
make a sword like this?

105
00:07:16,597 --> 00:07:20,197
I let him here learn some
blacksmithing techniques before.

106
00:07:21,365 --> 00:07:24,245
It's necessary for that moneymaking
opportunity before, right?

107
00:07:24,467 --> 00:07:28,067
At the same time, I wanted to change
my equipment to new ones too.

108
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,477
So, I asked for his help.

109
00:07:30,215 --> 00:07:31,775
To finish up,

110
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,740
you just need to write its name on
this paper and stick it onto the hilt.

111
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:37,312
Give it a cooler name.

112
00:07:37,578 --> 00:07:38,698
Also,

113
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,156
this is the full-plate Armour.

114
00:07:42,507 --> 00:07:46,667
It's considered very fancy equipment
even for this town's adventurers.

115
00:07:46,927 --> 00:07:48,247
Wear it well.

116
00:07:49,163 --> 00:07:52,523
-This is the true fantasy equipment!
-So cool!

117
00:07:52,647 --> 00:07:57,767
Now, I might've witnessed
the birth of a new hero.

118
00:08:04,998 --> 00:08:06,958
Clothes make the man indeed.

119
00:08:07,056 --> 00:08:10,936
It's even difficult for us crusaders
to get awesome Armour like this.

120
00:08:11,027 --> 00:08:13,152
Kazuma, raise your sword!

121
00:08:22,422 --> 00:08:23,456
Kazuma?

122
00:08:24,676 --> 00:08:28,036
Top-notch warriors won't show
their unique skills easily.

123
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,200
Looks like it's too heavy
that you can't move it, right?

124
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:32,507
Can someone remove the
metal components on my back?

125
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,320
It's best to use the equipment
that you're used to.

126
00:08:37,945 --> 00:08:40,745
It's good to have made a new weapon too.

127
00:08:48,622 --> 00:08:51,258
I'm counting on you, partner!

128
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:08,928
I'm sorry!

129
00:09:10,513 --> 00:09:12,473
Well then, thank you.

130
00:09:29,724 --> 00:09:31,524
It's different than what I imagined!

131
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,240
Your partner has shrunk a lot.

132
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:43,605
Shut up!

133
00:09:44,468 --> 00:09:47,748
I wanted to at least give it a cool name.

134
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,075
Muramasa?

135
00:09:50,735 --> 00:09:51,776
Masamune?

136
00:09:52,094 --> 00:09:54,715
-Kotetsu?
-Kazuma! Megumin!

137
00:09:55,724 --> 00:09:57,604
We have a great quest.

138
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,200
The monsters are called "Lizard Runners."

139
00:10:01,724 --> 00:10:03,124
During mating season,

140
00:10:03,234 --> 00:10:05,914
the Male Runners will gather around
the Princess Runner and...

141
00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:10,989
form a huge lizard group, and start
competing for the Princess Runner.

142
00:10:11,268 --> 00:10:12,348
Competing?

143
00:10:13,553 --> 00:10:14,713
Racing.

144
00:10:14,962 --> 00:10:19,522
A large group of lizards ran and
destroyed everything in their path.

145
00:10:19,624 --> 00:10:22,264
The fastest male will become
the King Runner...

146
00:10:22,364 --> 00:10:24,284
and mate with the Princess Runner.

147
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,560
This sounded really irritating.

148
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,160
The quest this time is to get rid
of the Lizard Runners.

149
00:10:30,238 --> 00:10:33,118
Due to their large amount,
I know that it's very difficult...

150
00:10:34,146 --> 00:10:35,194
It's alright.

151
00:10:36,354 --> 00:10:39,834
No matter what monster it is,
it'll be no match for this guy and I.

152
00:10:40,065 --> 00:10:43,105
Right? Partner...

153
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,720
-Kiku Ichimonji? Kogarasu Maru?
-Chunchunmaru.

154
00:10:47,868 --> 00:10:50,308
-What did you just say?
-I said, "Chunchunmaru."

155
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,840
This sword's name is "Chunchunmaru".

156
00:10:52,928 --> 00:10:55,328
Who would give it such a bizarre name?

157
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,400
As my favorite blade,
I must give it a cool name.

158
00:11:03,943 --> 00:11:06,343
From today onwards, this sword
will be called "Chunchunmaru."

159
00:11:06,463 --> 00:11:09,063
What have you done?

160
00:11:10,859 --> 00:11:12,299
Say,

161
00:11:12,569 --> 00:11:15,769
if I defeat the Devil King
with this katana,

162
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:19,066
"The legendary hero's sacred sword,
Chunchunmaru," or something similar,

163
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,320
will be written on its edge and
be displayed in the museum.

164
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,280
I especially gave it a cool name
for you. Why are you dissatisfied?

165
00:11:28,071 --> 00:11:32,071
KILL QUEST TO GET RID OF
THE LIZARD RUNNERS ARMY.

166
00:11:33,051 --> 00:11:34,771
Everyone! Are you ready?

167
00:11:37,245 --> 00:11:39,265
I'm all set!

168
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:42,799
I've also let Aqua use
her Support Magic on me

169
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:44,736
so that I can handle them
regardless of their amount!

170
00:11:44,864 --> 00:11:48,264
If there are any that escape,
just leave them to me.

171
00:11:48,643 --> 00:11:50,883
I'll get rid of them.

172
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:53,216
<i>Good! Let's start according to the plan!</i>

173
00:11:53,357 --> 00:11:56,517
<i>First, I'll snipe at the King Runner
and the Princess Runner.</i>

174
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,805
<i>As long as those two are down,</i>

175
00:11:59,897 --> 00:12:02,144
<i>the Lizard Runners' army will disperse.</i>

176
00:12:02,281 --> 00:12:04,201
<i>We can ignore the rest of
the insignificant ones.</i>

177
00:12:04,388 --> 00:12:07,588
<i>If the sniping fails
and they come this way</i>

178
00:12:07,675 --> 00:12:09,152
<i>while Darkness is blocking them,</i>

179
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:12,779
<i>I'll snipe at the King Runner and
the Princess Runner again.</i>

180
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,601
<i>If this fails, too, we'll settle them all</i>

181
00:12:17,677 --> 00:12:20,157
<i>before getting surrounded by
Megumin's Explosion Magic.</i>

182
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,160
<i>I'll shoot those that have escaped
from above.</i>

183
00:12:24,178 --> 00:12:26,098
<i>Aqua will be in charge of
backing all of us up!</i>

184
00:12:28,032 --> 00:12:29,792
Here we go!

185
00:12:37,594 --> 00:12:39,874
I can tell that this is
the Princess, but...

186
00:12:40,438 --> 00:12:42,838
Hey, Aqua! Which one is the King?

187
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,856
The most stuck-up one
should be the King, no?

188
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,118
I was foolish to have asked you.

189
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,760
That's it! The King should
run the fastest, right?

190
00:12:51,856 --> 00:12:53,976
I'll summon them with magic
that attracts monsters.

191
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,753
The one that gets here first is the King!

192
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,440
-What did you say?
-Force Fire!

193
00:13:10,368 --> 00:13:13,008
No! You big idiot!

194
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:16,038
Are you not satisfied if you don't
mess things up every time?

195
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,870
We can easily settle it by secretly
dealing with the King and Princess!

196
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:20,888
Why did you attract them here?

197
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:22,349
Why are you suddenly saying this?

198
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:26,220
I did it because I wanted to help!
Don't be angry!

199
00:13:26,322 --> 00:13:29,460
After this, it'll definitely be
the same as always, anyway!

200
00:13:29,555 --> 00:13:33,555
I'll definitely be ravaged by
those Runners until I cry!

201
00:13:33,632 --> 00:13:36,480
I know! It always happens this way!

202
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:39,280
Just kill me!

203
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,853
Don't just lie there!

204
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,473
You'll really die if you
get trampled by them!

205
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:53,364
I got it!

206
00:13:59,776 --> 00:14:02,080
Hey! I clearly shot the one
that looked like the King!

207
00:14:02,211 --> 00:14:04,251
But they've become more aggressive now!

208
00:14:04,448 --> 00:14:08,048
If you kill the King first,
one of them can become the new King.

209
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,160
The lizards will, of course, be excited.

210
00:14:10,535 --> 00:14:13,255
You need to settle
the Princess Runner first.

211
00:14:13,568 --> 00:14:15,011
You should've said it sooner!

212
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,560
Leave it to me!

213
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,400
Megumin!

214
00:14:20,355 --> 00:14:22,955
Have a taste of my Explosion Magic!

215
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,000
Explosion!

216
00:14:26,624 --> 00:14:27,786
My magic power!

217
00:14:27,917 --> 00:14:31,917
Kazuma! I don't have enough magic
power to activate my Explosion Magic!

218
00:14:32,756 --> 00:14:34,243
Why now, when it's this urgent?

219
00:14:35,864 --> 00:14:38,224
Was it my fault?

220
00:14:39,977 --> 00:14:41,217
Just come at me!

221
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,752
Darkness!

222
00:14:46,932 --> 00:14:49,292
Kazuma!

223
00:14:49,732 --> 00:14:53,252
Darkness! Hang in there!
I'll take care of it right away!

224
00:14:53,985 --> 00:14:57,865
Don't mind me! Take your time.

225
00:15:19,268 --> 00:15:20,348
Snipe!

226
00:15:29,682 --> 00:15:31,282
That was so close.

227
00:15:48,057 --> 00:15:50,937
Kazuma! Are you alright?

228
00:15:51,123 --> 00:15:53,163
Aqua! Kazuma fell down in a weird pose!

229
00:15:53,257 --> 00:15:55,177
Quick! Use Healing Magic...

230
00:16:03,543 --> 00:16:05,543
Please live more carefully.

231
00:16:05,656 --> 00:16:09,696
I went through a lot last time when I
violated the rules to resurrect you.

232
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,840
I'm sorry. I'm speechless this time.

233
00:16:14,713 --> 00:16:17,633
As an adventurer,

234
00:16:17,826 --> 00:16:20,146
I know that you'll be in danger anytime.

235
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,120
You're too careless this time.

236
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:25,939
Um, was everyone okay after I died?

237
00:16:26,176 --> 00:16:29,344
Yes. The senior who was lying there...

238
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,600
get trampled by the lizards
and started crying midway.

239
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,424
But, when Darkness was holding them back,

240
00:16:35,591 --> 00:16:39,191
the lizards dispersed after
they'd lost their Princess Runner.

241
00:16:39,349 --> 00:16:42,829
Megumin was fine, too,
thanks to Darkness's protection.

242
00:16:43,014 --> 00:16:46,214
Right now, senior is healing your body.

243
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,200
That's great!

244
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:52,470
Since that's the case, could you
let me wait here for a while?

245
00:16:52,618 --> 00:16:55,978
That's fine. But you're really calm.

246
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,904
I've been through this kind of thing
multiple times.

247
00:17:10,169 --> 00:17:13,209
It must be boring to stay in
this empty room all the time, right?

248
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:18,480
If I'm bored,
it means that everyone's safe.

249
00:17:18,825 --> 00:17:21,210
There's nothing better than being bored.

250
00:17:22,411 --> 00:17:25,451
<i>What is this? Oh, no. My chest is aching.</i>

251
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,720
<i>Is it?</i>

252
00:17:27,217 --> 00:17:28,737
<i>I've always felt that...</i>

253
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,920
<i>there's something missing
in my parallel world life.</i>

254
00:17:32,175 --> 00:17:35,375
<i>Everyone is actually quite good-looking.</i>

255
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:38,195
<i>Although they're not bad,</i>

256
00:17:39,126 --> 00:17:41,766
<i>however, what I'm after is not sexiness.</i>

257
00:17:41,924 --> 00:17:44,484
<i>But, a gentle and knowledgeable girl!</i>

258
00:17:44,729 --> 00:17:47,889
<i>That's right! The heroine is right here!</i>

259
00:17:48,352 --> 00:17:52,512
Actually, I'm not always here too.

260
00:17:52,976 --> 00:17:56,056
I'll secretly go to the surface
to have fun every once in a while.

261
00:17:56,749 --> 00:17:57,869
Regarding this,

262
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:00,329
you must keep it a secret.

263
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:05,546
Kazuma! Can you hear me?

264
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,080
I've used Resurrection!
You can come back now!

265
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,120
Please ask Eris to open the gate!

266
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:14,695
Wait for a while!

267
00:18:14,866 --> 00:18:17,346
I want to chat with Goddess Eris
for a little longer!

268
00:18:17,466 --> 00:18:19,906
Take good care of my body!

269
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,356
Stop talking nonsense! Come back quickly!

270
00:18:25,427 --> 00:18:29,667
Level up and defeat the Devil King
sooner, then I can go back to heaven!

271
00:18:30,325 --> 00:18:32,125
The Devil King?

272
00:18:32,709 --> 00:18:34,109
After resurrecting,

273
00:18:34,242 --> 00:18:38,080
I'll need to go defeat the Devil King
with those three.

274
00:18:38,866 --> 00:18:40,401
-Kazuma!
-Should I continue to work hard?

275
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,214
-Will my special powers be awakened?
-Are you listening?

276
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,080
-Will I also defeat the Devil King?
-Eris! What are you doing?

277
00:18:44,172 --> 00:18:48,224
This harsh world won't be so easy.
I'll surely die again, multiple times.

278
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:52,599
I've worked this hard,
but what did I get?

279
00:18:52,704 --> 00:18:55,456
Her words are as fake as her chest!
Be careful!

280
00:18:55,577 --> 00:18:58,496
-I'll tell you something crazier!
-Mr. Kazuma!

281
00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:00,832
That just another pretty-face
goddess is, actually...

282
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:04,150
Hey, Aqua! I'm tired of living too!

283
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:07,073
I want to be reborn as a baby
and start a new life!

284
00:19:07,535 --> 00:19:09,495
Say hi to everyone for me!

285
00:19:11,431 --> 00:19:15,031
What nonsense are you saying? Wait!

286
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,440
So, this is it. I'll leave it to you.

287
00:19:18,988 --> 00:19:20,628
I won't ask for much.

288
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:22,816
I just want to be a male, too,
in my next life.

289
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:27,072
Also, I want a pretty older stepsister
and a cute younger stepsister!

290
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:31,230
-Please wait for a second!
-Kazuma!

291
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:35,190
Darkness said that she'll draw on your
face if you're still not coming back!

292
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:37,835
She's already excited
with a pen in her hand!

293
00:19:38,415 --> 00:19:41,135
I won't be bothered by this puny matter.

294
00:19:41,282 --> 00:19:43,420
I'm dead anyway! Whatever.

295
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,781
What is Megumin doing?

296
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,390
What are you going to do
with Kazuma's clothes?

297
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,760
-Megumin! Wait!
-Hey! Stop it!

298
00:19:50,884 --> 00:19:52,924
What are you all doing to my body?

299
00:19:53,007 --> 00:19:55,567
Don't mess around with the dead!
You'll get your karma!

300
00:19:55,648 --> 00:20:00,487
Megumin! Kazuma! Quick! Come back!

301
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:03,936
Hey! Stop it! Aqua!
Stop Megumin quickly! Stop...

302
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,880
Goddess Eris, please, open the gate!

303
00:20:14,108 --> 00:20:15,508
Well then, Mr. Kazuma,

304
00:20:15,694 --> 00:20:18,814
I wholeheartedly wish that
you won't come here again.

305
00:20:19,202 --> 00:20:21,082
Goddess Eris! I...

306
00:20:21,598 --> 00:20:23,558
Please take care.

307
00:20:24,176 --> 00:20:27,176
I like just a pretty face too!

308
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,501
Hey, what are you doing?

309
00:20:37,411 --> 00:20:39,771
Apart from your name and
being an explosion freak,

310
00:20:39,904 --> 00:20:42,270
you're supposed to be the only
knowledgeable one here.

311
00:20:42,438 --> 00:20:44,689
What actually did you do to me?

312
00:20:45,047 --> 00:20:48,447
Hey! Just say it if you have
something against my name!

313
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,719
It's your fault for making that
stupid joke about not coming back.

314
00:20:52,111 --> 00:20:54,351
If you repeat something stupid
like this the next time,

315
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,440
I'll do something worse for you.

316
00:21:05,274 --> 00:21:09,114
You. What do you want a
sacred goddess like me to say?

317
00:21:09,812 --> 00:21:11,866
What actually have they done to me?

318
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,594
What's actually happening?

319
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:33,917
Megumin! Where's Megumin?

320
00:21:34,032 --> 00:21:37,392
Megumin said she wanted to
stay over at Yunyun's for a few days.

321
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,096
-Hey, Kazuma.
-What?

322
00:21:40,192 --> 00:21:42,280
It's a good thing to
have self-confidence.

323
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,600
But it's also bad to show off too much.

324
00:21:44,782 --> 00:21:49,862
Idiot! Weren't you there too when
Megumin wrote this on my body?

325
00:21:50,736 --> 00:21:52,456
This is an abomination!

326
00:21:52,569 --> 00:21:57,649
What did she mean by the
sacred sword, Excalibur?

327
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:39,968
