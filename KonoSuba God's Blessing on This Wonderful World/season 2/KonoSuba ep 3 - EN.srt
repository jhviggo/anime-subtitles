1
00:00:02,524 --> 00:00:05,884
Explode, explode, lalala...

2
00:00:06,058 --> 00:00:09,587
Explode, explode, lalala...

3
00:00:10,087 --> 00:00:11,751
<i>Although the suspicion is still there,</i>

4
00:00:12,018 --> 00:00:14,418
<i>Megumin and I carry on
with our daily tasks.</i>

5
00:00:14,984 --> 00:00:16,464
Explosion.

6
00:00:20,025 --> 00:00:21,345
<i>Rainy day.</i>

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,757
Losion.

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,520
<i>Snowy day.</i>

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,260
<i>A peaceful afternoon.</i>

10
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,050
What do you think about
such a beautiful rainbow?

11
00:00:43,241 --> 00:00:44,598
120 marks!

12
00:00:47,927 --> 00:00:50,327
<i>What am I doing?</i>

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,680
I can't continue like this.

14
00:01:00,367 --> 00:01:06,087
(KONOSUBA:
God's Blessing on This Wonderful World! 2)

15
00:02:23,193 --> 00:02:24,256
(Episode 3:
Peace for the Master of This Labyrinth!)

16
00:02:24,417 --> 00:02:26,097
The food and booze here are the best!

17
00:02:33,273 --> 00:02:35,513
-We're going to the dungeon tomorrow.
-No.

18
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:36,713
We are going.

19
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,891
-No!
-We are going!

20
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:41,792
My existence is worthless in the dungeon!

21
00:02:41,926 --> 00:02:43,726
I can't utilize my explosion magic.

22
00:02:43,846 --> 00:02:46,126
I will become a totally
normal human being.

23
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,060
Remember when you first join the team?

24
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,728
You said you're willing to do anything,

25
00:02:49,824 --> 00:02:51,232
including carrying luggage.

26
00:02:52,787 --> 00:02:56,147
Can't we wait for Darkness before
we make any decision?

27
00:02:56,304 --> 00:02:59,624
Don't you know? Our external debt
is as high as the state budget.

28
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,914
If this continues,
we will die of starvation.

29
00:03:01,993 --> 00:03:04,928
The unit price for stacking
milk cartons has increased.

30
00:03:05,045 --> 00:03:07,605
Besides that, we have been out
to sell vegetables.

31
00:03:07,682 --> 00:03:10,272
The little income we gained
by doing these odd jobs...

32
00:03:10,388 --> 00:03:12,068
is not enough to pay off the debt.

33
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,953
Keele's Dungeon, especially
for new recruits.

34
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,760
I thought there was nothing left
after it was looted.

35
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,298
Actually,

36
00:03:21,809 --> 00:03:24,889
a new passage was found.

37
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:29,216
I'm about to post the drafted
investigation mission notice.

38
00:03:29,395 --> 00:03:32,515
I implored her to make an exception
and assign the task to us.

39
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:36,092
That is why she hasn't told
the other adventurers yet.

40
00:03:36,196 --> 00:03:37,268
I see.

41
00:03:37,376 --> 00:03:41,388
There must be quite a few treasures
left in the unchecked areas.

42
00:03:41,894 --> 00:03:42,949
Treasures?

43
00:03:43,037 --> 00:03:45,917
What is it? A profitable job?

44
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,288
This is a severe problem.

45
00:03:50,695 --> 00:03:52,415
I wouldn't want to drag you down.

46
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,289
This is a discount voucher,
expiring today.

47
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,038
Cherish it.

48
00:03:57,917 --> 00:03:59,157
Leave this to me.

49
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:05,614
It's not easy for me to acquire
this chance to make some cash.

50
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,640
I'm not foolish enough
to let others join in too.

51
00:04:08,365 --> 00:04:12,205
We have no idea how dangerous
it might be. Be careful.

EXPLORATION MISSION: EXPLORE THE NEWLY
DISCOVERED ROUTE IN KEELE'S DUNGEON

00:04:18,746 --> 00:04:20,186
LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY: UNKNOWN

54
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:24,955
This is especially for newbies,
yet, it's so far, such bravery.

55
00:04:25,122 --> 00:04:28,242
This is a secluded place.
We can just leave them here.

56
00:04:28,761 --> 00:04:30,934
We need to go to the bottom.
Never leave them behind.

57
00:04:31,456 --> 00:04:32,456
Never leave them behind.

58
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:35,466
A long time ago,

59
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,200
the country's most powerful
wizard built the dungeon.

60
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,560
Why would he hide inside here?

61
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:44,871
Who knows?

62
00:04:44,943 --> 00:04:47,503
After his death, this place
is turned upside down.

63
00:04:47,622 --> 00:04:49,142
It's hard to imagine.

64
00:04:49,397 --> 00:04:53,197
Alright, I will scout it out first.

65
00:04:53,318 --> 00:04:54,958
Wait here, both of you.

66
00:05:04,893 --> 00:05:07,693
<i>By using the skills of bandits, skills
of sensing enemies and concealment,</i>

67
00:05:08,115 --> 00:05:11,475
<i>I can avoid any encounter with enemies
and properly investigate this dungeon.</i>

68
00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:13,842
<i>Then, I can use my farsight skill...</i>

69
00:05:15,278 --> 00:05:20,078
<i>to master the space and location
of the dungeon, even in darkness.</i>

70
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:27,363
<i>This is a rare skill among adventurers.</i>

71
00:05:27,497 --> 00:05:30,097
<i>Meanwhile, I have the privilege of
learning various professional abilities.</i>

72
00:05:30,521 --> 00:05:33,681
<i>During this critical moment, I need to
use my only specialty well.</i>

73
00:05:34,656 --> 00:05:37,695
Can you really see everything?

74
00:05:39,023 --> 00:05:40,343
Yes, I can.

75
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,690
Have you forgotten about what I said?

76
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:46,273
You can't see anything even
if you follow me into this dark place.

77
00:05:47,255 --> 00:05:49,375
Have you forgotten who I am?

78
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,600
Archpriest is just a fake identity.

79
00:05:52,014 --> 00:05:53,294
Tell me.

80
00:05:53,444 --> 00:05:56,684
Although Megumin and Darkness
wouldn't believe it no matter what,

81
00:05:56,861 --> 00:05:59,461
tell me, what's my profession?

82
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:01,059
The Goddess of Debt.

83
00:06:01,184 --> 00:06:03,639
No! It's the Goddess of Water.

84
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,782
I am a Goddess, after all.

85
00:06:05,952 --> 00:06:08,173
Although I've become weaker
after I drop down to earth,

86
00:06:08,253 --> 00:06:12,173
I still possess a few of my divine powers.

87
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,570
Even though I can't
see through everything,

88
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,800
this level of darkness is nothing to me.

89
00:06:17,464 --> 00:06:20,304
But it seems like only
some empty boxes are left.

90
00:06:20,824 --> 00:06:23,704
<i>-You might be able to see,</i>
-It's so painful.

91
00:06:24,074 --> 00:06:26,754
<i>but who knows what
silly things you might do.</i>

92
00:06:27,236 --> 00:06:30,396
There is a lot of undead in the dungeon.

93
00:06:30,517 --> 00:06:33,917
They can locate the living
through their life force.

94
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:37,971
Thus, your lie-low technique
won't work on the undead.

95
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,559
That's why I have to come with you.

96
00:06:43,538 --> 00:06:48,538
-Treasures.<i>-I only have bad feelings about this.</i>

97
00:06:50,402 --> 00:06:51,962
Treasures.

98
00:06:52,602 --> 00:06:53,963
My power.

99
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:55,434
My blade.

100
00:06:56,665 --> 00:06:59,105
My wild arrogance.

101
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:00,689
No one will get past me
and my wild arrogance!

102
00:07:04,566 --> 00:07:05,566
Is it here?

103
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:15,485
It will be uncharted
territory starting here.

104
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:17,579
There must be a mountainous
worth of treasures.

105
00:07:17,715 --> 00:07:19,715
It'll be worrisome otherwise.

106
00:07:20,266 --> 00:07:21,426
Let's go.

107
00:07:35,903 --> 00:07:38,663
With my crystal clear eyesight,

108
00:07:38,764 --> 00:07:42,496
I can see your shivering body
walking down the stairs clearly.

109
00:07:42,624 --> 00:07:43,658
Same with me.

110
00:07:43,738 --> 00:07:48,698
Your pitiful shivering form whenever
there's a tiniest noise is as clear.

111
00:07:49,032 --> 00:07:51,632
I can still escape even from here.

112
00:07:51,744 --> 00:07:54,018
If you can feel any monster
nearing us, tell me.

113
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:57,590
And don't molest my butt
because it's dark.

114
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,724
Let me tell you what I am thinking now.

115
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:04,576
I'm seriously contemplating
how to dump you...

116
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,560
into the deepest part of the
dungeon and return by myself.

117
00:08:09,908 --> 00:08:13,788
You are so funny, Kazuma.

118
00:08:13,941 --> 00:08:15,381
You are so silly, Aqua.

119
00:08:15,516 --> 00:08:17,676
We have known each other for so long.

120
00:08:17,792 --> 00:08:20,378
You should know that
I'm just telling the truth.

121
00:08:24,859 --> 00:08:25,979
Something is approaching.

122
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:28,099
My ability to sense enemies is triggered.

123
00:08:31,405 --> 00:08:32,445
What is it?

124
00:08:32,608 --> 00:08:34,325
Are you playing shadow hand with me?

125
00:08:34,401 --> 00:08:36,281
Give me some light.

126
00:08:36,396 --> 00:08:38,876
I'm not going to do some low-end
shadows like fox or rabbit.

127
00:08:38,954 --> 00:08:41,274
I'm going to show you the
Mobile Fortress Destroyer.

128
00:08:41,377 --> 00:08:42,464
It's not that!

129
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,097
I'm hand signaling you to run away
because an enemy is approaching!

130
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:57,621
What creature is that?

131
00:08:57,711 --> 00:09:01,231
I can only see the outline but not
its true form using my farsight.

132
00:09:02,652 --> 00:09:04,928
It's a low-class demon called Gremlin.

133
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,920
Some weak demons will pop out
in the dungeon occasionally.

134
00:09:09,245 --> 00:09:12,965
You can see quite clearly in the dark.

135
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:15,125
About as clear as day.

136
00:09:15,402 --> 00:09:19,562
Before this, you told me you
saw me creeping around the stables.

137
00:09:19,854 --> 00:09:21,454
I didn't see anything.

138
00:09:21,564 --> 00:09:24,684
I'll just turn to my back and continue
sleeping when there is noise.

139
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,760
Thank you, Lady Aqua.

140
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:50,682
What is it? The remains
of the adventurers?

141
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:53,409
Did someone else come to this place?

142
00:09:54,911 --> 00:09:56,591
What's that in front?

143
00:09:57,318 --> 00:09:59,398
Wait, Kazuma.

144
00:10:00,755 --> 00:10:03,955
The soul that perished
with unresolved grievances.

145
00:10:04,594 --> 00:10:07,074
Rest in peace.

146
00:10:12,983 --> 00:10:14,272
Alright, it's done.

147
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,832
Aqua, today, you...

148
00:10:16,987 --> 00:10:19,136
Kazuma, why did you yell so loudly?

149
00:10:19,284 --> 00:10:20,724
The one who puts on airs and
insists on coming to this dungeon...

150
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,030
is yelping so loudly.

151
00:10:23,684 --> 00:10:26,364
<i>It's better if I leave her here.</i>

152
00:10:34,877 --> 00:10:37,397
Stab through! Explosion!

153
00:10:42,472 --> 00:10:45,112
<i>We should be looking for traps,</i>

154
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,440
<i>but after being terrified
by the monsters,</i>

155
00:10:47,598 --> 00:10:48,678
<i>she's drawing maps...</i>

156
00:10:48,804 --> 00:10:51,884
<i>while gingerly treading forward.</i>

157
00:10:52,108 --> 00:10:54,912
<i>This is such an underhanded meaning
for those who came here...</i>

158
00:10:55,057 --> 00:10:56,617
<i>with a serious intent
to explore this place.</i>

159
00:10:59,388 --> 00:11:00,898
There's nothing valuable here.

160
00:11:01,106 --> 00:11:02,666
-Kazuma.
-I'm here.

161
00:11:02,747 --> 00:11:06,592
Your words make me feel like I'm a thief.

162
00:11:06,758 --> 00:11:07,918
Don't say it like that.

163
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,280
I have the same thought too,
and now I feel guilty.

164
00:11:12,186 --> 00:11:13,786
Look! Treasures.

165
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:14,986
A treasure chest.

166
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:16,226
I've found it.

167
00:11:16,346 --> 00:11:17,626
Wait.

168
00:11:17,768 --> 00:11:19,568
Such an obvious treasure chest.

169
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,968
As expected.

170
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,160
My enemy-sensing ability is triggered.

171
00:11:39,251 --> 00:11:40,704
This is so disgusting.

172
00:11:40,837 --> 00:11:41,888
Come to think of it,

173
00:11:42,022 --> 00:11:45,422
I've heard from the guild to be aware of
the shape-shifting monster in the dungeon.

174
00:11:45,707 --> 00:11:49,952
Sometimes, they will shape-shift into
humanoid forms to hunt for monsters.

175
00:11:50,093 --> 00:11:52,133
They even eat monsters?
This is too disgusting.

176
00:11:52,715 --> 00:11:53,995
<i>The survival of the fittest law...</i>

177
00:11:54,118 --> 00:11:56,598
<i>applies in this dungeon too?</i>

178
00:11:57,402 --> 00:12:00,282
<i>It's such a hardship
living in this world.</i>

179
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:02,820
Stop!

180
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,360
Stop it. Hand over this
disgraceful thing to me.

181
00:12:06,523 --> 00:12:10,523
Wench! I'll kill you all.

182
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,120
Turn Undead.

183
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,760
To all the lost souls in
this cold and dark dungeon.

184
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,680
Rest in peace.

185
00:12:25,175 --> 00:12:27,215
<i>Aqua is quite different today.</i>

186
00:12:27,395 --> 00:12:30,463
<i>She's a very presentable and
outstanding Goddess.</i>

187
00:12:32,358 --> 00:12:34,158
-Teacher.
-Turn Undead.

188
00:12:34,677 --> 00:12:36,837
-Teacher.
-Turn Undead.

189
00:12:37,504 --> 00:12:38,560
Teacher.

190
00:12:38,656 --> 00:12:42,972
Turn Undead.

191
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:47,134
The power of flowers, birds,
wind and moon, God's Blow!

192
00:12:55,288 --> 00:12:56,728
I'm saved.

193
00:12:56,837 --> 00:12:59,237
It'd be very dangerous
if I were to come alone.

194
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,560
Finally, you are appraising me
with the correct value.

195
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,820
You can admire me a little bit more.

196
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:07,872
But don't you think this is too strange?

197
00:13:08,033 --> 00:13:09,056
Why is it?

198
00:13:09,152 --> 00:13:11,296
There is too many undead around.

199
00:13:11,527 --> 00:13:14,272
Without a team of archpriests,
It'll be troublesome...

200
00:13:14,381 --> 00:13:15,861
-to deal with them.
-Wait.

201
00:13:16,034 --> 00:13:18,754
I can feel the presence of
the undead over there.

202
00:13:18,888 --> 00:13:22,368
Smell.

203
00:13:22,691 --> 00:13:23,811
Smell.

204
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:25,786
There's nothing.

205
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,760
Strange. I did feel the
presence of the undead.

206
00:13:32,551 --> 00:13:33,991
Are you alright?

207
00:13:34,151 --> 00:13:37,231
A priest is present?

208
00:13:41,274 --> 00:13:42,994
I am Keele.

209
00:13:43,121 --> 00:13:47,761
I am the evil wizard that
built this dungeon and...

210
00:13:48,925 --> 00:13:51,725
kidnapped the aristocrat's daughter.

211
00:13:55,178 --> 00:13:57,458
Wizard Keele.

212
00:13:57,664 --> 00:14:00,384
You are devoted to our country.

213
00:14:00,502 --> 00:14:03,382
I'll fulfill one of your wishes.

214
00:14:04,973 --> 00:14:07,453
I have only one wish.

215
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:13,158
I wish for happiness and no more
bullying toward the girl I love.

216
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,260
You...

217
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:19,780
She is married here to
appease you, my King.

218
00:14:19,874 --> 00:14:24,954
But she wasn't favored and was
bullied by the people in the palace.

219
00:14:25,263 --> 00:14:26,377
If...

220
00:14:26,623 --> 00:14:29,796
If you don't need her,
please bestow her to me.

221
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:35,270
Just like that, I took away the daughter.

222
00:14:36,107 --> 00:14:38,587
In other words,
you are not an evil wizard

223
00:14:38,675 --> 00:14:40,395
but a kind one?

224
00:14:40,471 --> 00:14:42,176
That was before.

225
00:14:42,273 --> 00:14:44,960
After I proposed to the lady
that I had kidnapped,

226
00:14:45,047 --> 00:14:47,447
she agreed immediately.

227
00:14:47,741 --> 00:14:50,581
Thus, the lady and I began the
fleeing game of love while...

228
00:14:50,651 --> 00:14:52,811
playing the grand banquet
of magic with the king.

229
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,880
It was a happy time.

230
00:14:56,337 --> 00:15:00,866
By the way, that's the lady
that I have kidnapped.

231
00:15:00,945 --> 00:15:04,745
What do you think?
She has a very nice collarbone, right?

232
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:06,429
What is happening here?

233
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,520
-She is resting in peace.
-So pretty.

234
00:15:09,683 --> 00:15:12,064
And then, I need to ask you a favor.

235
00:15:12,217 --> 00:15:13,280
A favor?

236
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,440
Can you purify me?

237
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:22,456
This priest has that ability, right?

238
00:15:28,832 --> 00:15:32,312
<i>Keele was seriously injured
while protecting her.</i>

239
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,070
<i>But in order to guard her forever,</i>

240
00:15:34,245 --> 00:15:37,045
<i>he forsook his identity as human
and became a lich.</i>

241
00:15:38,025 --> 00:15:39,145
I can't help but...

242
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,004
think that this lich is very handsome.

243
00:15:43,784 --> 00:15:45,744
Everything is prepared.

244
00:15:45,851 --> 00:15:47,328
That's great.

245
00:15:47,465 --> 00:15:51,277
It's too unrealistic for
the undead to commit suicide.

246
00:15:51,357 --> 00:15:53,344
Before that, I plan to just wait
until my spirit vanishes.

247
00:15:53,462 --> 00:15:55,808
But I felt a surge of
extraordinary sacred power.

248
00:15:55,929 --> 00:15:59,329
That's why I woke up
from my deep slumber.

249
00:16:04,776 --> 00:16:08,832
The wizard discarded the law of
deity and chose the path of the lich.

250
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,048
Keele.

251
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:14,097
I shall pardon your sins in the
name of the Goddess of Water, Aqua.

252
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,520
<i>Who is she really?</i>

253
00:16:17,773 --> 00:16:18,853
When you awake,

254
00:16:18,987 --> 00:16:20,667
the one who appears in front of you...

255
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:23,387
should be Goddess Eris with
an unnaturally large chest.

256
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,470
If you are willing to disregard age,

257
00:16:25,544 --> 00:16:27,304
disregard any possible relationship...

258
00:16:27,455 --> 00:16:29,535
and in any other forms,

259
00:16:30,117 --> 00:16:31,597
please beg her.

260
00:16:31,915 --> 00:16:34,115
Tell her that you want to see
this lady for one last time.

261
00:16:34,548 --> 00:16:37,708
She will definitely fulfill your wish.

262
00:16:38,323 --> 00:16:39,963
Thank you.

263
00:16:43,905 --> 00:16:46,066
Sacred Turn Undead.

264
00:16:54,605 --> 00:16:57,565
<i>Darling, I'm coming to accompany you now.</i>

265
00:17:06,673 --> 00:17:07,680
Let's go back.

266
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:14,848
With the treasures left by Keele for us,

267
00:17:15,032 --> 00:17:16,992
we left the room.

268
00:17:18,026 --> 00:17:19,746
-Aqua.
-What is it?

269
00:17:19,856 --> 00:17:24,696
That guy said that he woke up because
he felt an extraordinary divine power.

270
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,800
We've repeatedly encountered
much undead in the dungeon.

271
00:17:29,165 --> 00:17:31,605
Are you the reason behind it?

272
00:17:34,838 --> 00:17:37,118
No way.

273
00:17:37,237 --> 00:17:39,557
It's impossible.

274
00:17:39,701 --> 00:17:40,736
I think so.

275
00:17:42,918 --> 00:17:45,758
Now that I've thought about it,
when Dullahan attacked us last time,

276
00:17:45,948 --> 00:17:48,748
you were also chased by
his undead minions, right?

277
00:17:48,989 --> 00:17:50,709
Kazuma.

278
00:17:50,808 --> 00:17:52,808
Why do you distance yourself from me so?

279
00:17:52,942 --> 00:17:55,062
We should walk together more closely

280
00:17:55,149 --> 00:17:58,149
to prevent a sudden attack from monsters.

281
00:18:00,938 --> 00:18:03,698
You want to leave me here
and go back by yourself.

282
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,280
-I won't let you succeed.
-Let go.

283
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,136
Without me to defeat the undead,

284
00:18:07,249 --> 00:18:09,129
you can't go back by yourself, Kazuma.

285
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,280
Please, don't leave me.

286
00:18:11,392 --> 00:18:14,180
As I said, you are the one
who lured the undead here.

287
00:18:14,284 --> 00:18:18,444
No, there are other monsters,
don't leave me behind.

288
00:18:25,383 --> 00:18:26,423
Conceal.

289
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:29,015
Wait, Kazuma.

290
00:18:29,603 --> 00:18:31,243
How can you conceal yourself only?

291
00:18:31,335 --> 00:18:33,632
Seriously? Don't joke around with me.

292
00:18:33,742 --> 00:18:36,032
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

293
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,280
I was wrong. Please give me
some of your concealment power.

294
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,976
I'm sorry, Kazuma.

295
00:18:41,135 --> 00:18:42,495
Master Kazuma.

296
00:18:48,338 --> 00:18:50,658
Can I ask what happened?

297
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,574
-Kazuma...
-Don't blame me.

298
00:18:54,685 --> 00:18:58,045
You are the one who easily
attracted those undead.

299
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,987
But I am born brimming
with such divine life force.

300
00:19:02,067 --> 00:19:04,347
You can't blame me for it.

301
00:19:04,672 --> 00:19:05,832
Are you saying that...

302
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:07,624
I should dim down my divine halo...

303
00:19:07,744 --> 00:19:10,304
and end up like Kazuma, who stays
at home and lives off his parents?

304
00:19:10,392 --> 00:19:11,712
If that happens,

305
00:19:11,806 --> 00:19:15,808
my devoted Axis Cult worldwide
will be devastated.

306
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:18,514
You are not repenting at all.

307
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,520
Learn properly from those two and...

308
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,690
try to understand that kind of purity.

309
00:19:23,105 --> 00:19:24,825
How dare you ask a goddess
to learn from the undead?

310
00:19:24,928 --> 00:19:26,016
You home-bound-living-off-
your-parents brat.

311
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,552
TODAY'S ACHIEVEMENT: KEELE'S DUNGEON
INVESTIGATION COMPLETE

312
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:28,672
SPECIAL PRIZE: KEELE'S TREASURES

313
00:19:33,035 --> 00:19:34,795
Cheers!

314
00:19:35,872 --> 00:19:38,592
I wish I could experience it too.

315
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:41,521
Thanks to me, this time,
the mission was successful.

316
00:19:41,594 --> 00:19:43,234
We can split it nine to one.

317
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:46,149
Stupid, we need to use it
to pay off our debt.

318
00:19:46,233 --> 00:19:48,553
But today, I can order
another drink, right?

319
00:19:48,751 --> 00:19:51,831
Excuse me, please bring me
more of the foamy beer.

320
00:19:51,922 --> 00:19:54,402
All I did was wait outside.

321
00:19:54,472 --> 00:19:56,192
It wouldn't do for me
to accept the payment.

322
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,400
-Give me more.
-It's too early, kid.

323
00:19:58,501 --> 00:20:01,760
-You are too cunning.
-Let me drink it.

324
00:20:01,856 --> 00:20:02,880
Let me drink it.

325
00:20:03,008 --> 00:20:05,438
It's nothing, drink more foamy beer.

326
00:20:05,568 --> 00:20:09,248
I can't continue with the odd jobs,
I want to do missions.

327
00:20:09,387 --> 00:20:10,867
With the power of flowers,
birds, wind and moon.

328
00:20:10,968 --> 00:20:12,688
There it is!

329
00:20:14,195 --> 00:20:17,635
Sister, you've saved us this time.

330
00:20:18,024 --> 00:20:20,904
This is on me, please enjoy the drink.

331
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,624
Alright.

332
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,800
What? A treat?

333
00:20:23,967 --> 00:20:28,247
Is it true? Everybody,
Kazuma is going to treat us today.

334
00:20:28,384 --> 00:20:29,536
It's great!

335
00:20:29,656 --> 00:20:30,856
Kazuma is the man.

336
00:20:30,926 --> 00:20:32,366
Your generosity is on point.

337
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,720
You are the man, Brother Kazuma.

338
00:20:33,824 --> 00:20:37,888
-Kazuma.
-Kazuma.

339
00:20:38,386 --> 00:20:41,346
Alright then, drink to your
heart's content, everyone.

340
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,560
Kazuma, do that trick.

341
00:20:43,704 --> 00:20:46,664
Alright, since you insisted.

342
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:54,638
-Steal.
-Steal.

343
00:20:55,231 --> 00:20:57,071
Steal.

344
00:20:57,701 --> 00:20:59,301
I heard it's your treat tonight.

345
00:21:05,028 --> 00:21:06,668
No!

346
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,000
Give me back my panties.

347
00:21:12,485 --> 00:21:14,445
-Steal.
-Stop it.

348
00:21:14,575 --> 00:21:18,455
I know how to do it too. Steal.

349
00:21:20,042 --> 00:21:21,362
They've gone too far.

350
00:21:22,177 --> 00:21:23,577
Megumin.

351
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,300
It is such a coincidence
to meet you here.

352
00:21:26,397 --> 00:21:27,597
Just the right time.

00:21:32,062 --> 00:21:33,582
Alright, I accept.

<i>Our external debt is still there
and we are still under suspicion.</i>

357
00:21:41,782 --> 00:21:42,942

00:21:43,174 --> 00:21:45,454
<i>I guess I'm an adventurer, after all.</i>

00:21:58,883 --> 00:22:00,443
<i>I'll be doomed if this continues.</i>
