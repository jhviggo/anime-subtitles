1
00:00:00,746 --> 00:00:02,386
Satou Kazuma!

2
00:00:02,513 --> 00:00:05,833
After investigating the case of
the monsters that emerged around town,

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,200
we realized they came from Keele's
Dungeon, which you visited a few days ago!

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,740
Why are you blaming everything on us?

5
00:00:13,128 --> 00:00:16,368
Just to be sure, you all know
nothing about this, right?

6
00:00:16,728 --> 00:00:20,448
I don't know about anything if
it doesn't relate to Explosion Magic.

7
00:00:20,573 --> 00:00:21,693
Me too.

8
00:00:22,242 --> 00:00:24,802
There shouldn't be a problem usually.

9
00:00:25,023 --> 00:00:26,143
What about you?

10
00:00:26,382 --> 00:00:30,382
Of course not!
You're too suspicious of me!

11
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:34,906
Regarding that dungeon, the monsters
can't go near it, thanks to me.

12
00:00:35,271 --> 00:00:37,071
Thanks to you?

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,120
Come here for a bit.

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,768
Tell me more.

15
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:46,014
Actually, I especially made that
magic circle in the lich's room.

16
00:00:46,188 --> 00:00:48,068
It's still perfectly
maintained there now.

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,049
It should be keeping away
all the evil things.

18
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:52,590
What did you say?

19
00:00:52,774 --> 00:00:55,414
Why are you suddenly asking me?
I've told you.

20
00:00:55,508 --> 00:00:57,984
The magic circle that
I seriously drew is still there.

21
00:00:58,097 --> 00:00:59,537
That is why the monsters
can't go near it.

22
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:04,032
You idiot!

23
00:01:04,417 --> 00:01:06,688
(Episode 5:
Servitude for This Masked Knight!)

24
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:09,509
It shouldn't be my fault.

25
00:01:09,688 --> 00:01:11,128
You do this every time.

26
00:01:11,207 --> 00:01:15,127
Do you have the 'agony if you don't
sabotage our reward' disease?

27
00:01:15,258 --> 00:01:16,512
Let's not talk about monsters first.

28
00:01:16,632 --> 00:01:19,112
As an adventurer, I can't just
ignore the people in danger.

29
00:01:19,272 --> 00:01:20,712
Please let us help out.

30
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:24,330
We managed past that at last.
But we must erase that magic circle.

31
00:01:33,246 --> 00:01:36,326
I see. They're unknown monsters indeed.

32
00:01:36,572 --> 00:01:37,972
-Mr. Satou.
-Please call me Satou.

33
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,700
Thank you for your help.

34
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:43,508
It looks like someone is
summoning the monsters.

35
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,850
So, please defeat the magician,

36
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,200
and stick this in the
summoning magic circle.

37
00:01:48,998 --> 00:01:50,718
This is a powerful Sealing Talisman.

38
00:01:50,852 --> 00:01:54,772
I can't stand those dolls' masks
on a physiological level.

39
00:01:54,963 --> 00:01:58,523
I wonder why. I feel so angry.

40
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:02,358
Wait. What?

41
00:02:02,727 --> 00:02:04,167
What...

42
00:02:04,365 --> 00:02:07,085
What's the matter?
Is it asking for attention?

43
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,880
Although the mask angers me a lot,
but it looks kind of cute now.

44
00:02:15,645 --> 00:02:16,685
As you all can see,

45
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:20,196
this type of monster has the habit of
exploding after sticking onto a human.

46
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:24,129
-Is it?
-How could you all be this calm?

47
00:02:32,942 --> 00:02:35,302
I'll lead and clear the path.

48
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,640
-Kazuma shall stay behind me.
-Alright.

49
00:02:38,836 --> 00:02:39,876
Kazuma.

50
00:02:40,341 --> 00:02:43,381
I'll only be a bother.
I'll just be on standby here.

51
00:02:43,461 --> 00:02:46,421
-Then, me too.
-You must come with!

52
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,719
I've had enough of dungeons!

53
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,120
I'll definitely get abandoned again
if I enter the dungeon!

54
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,998
I don't want to enter the dungeon. No!

55
00:02:58,198 --> 00:03:00,438
Then, it'll be just Darkness and me.

56
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,212
It'll be just Kazuma and me?

57
00:03:02,437 --> 00:03:06,117
Compared to monsters,
I feel that Kazuma is more dangerous.

58
00:03:06,204 --> 00:03:08,284
I can abandon you in the dungeon too.

59
00:03:08,401 --> 00:03:11,321
So that you'll develop
the same trauma as Aqua.

60
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:14,419
EXPLORATION MISSION OF INVESTIGATING
KEELE'S DUNGEON'S PECULIARITIES.

61
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,400
The interior looks different
compared to before.

62
00:03:17,511 --> 00:03:19,880
It's so bright.
It's like the owner is just inside.

63
00:03:20,174 --> 00:03:23,094
Do the unknown monsters cause this too?

64
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,919
I got them!

65
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:31,559
Look, Kazuma! They're bumping
themselves against my sword!

66
00:03:31,718 --> 00:03:33,629
You're really happy about it.

67
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:36,101
But, with these people around,

68
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:38,311
I can't secretly erase
Aqua's magic circle.

69
00:03:38,412 --> 00:03:41,132
Wait! Slow down!

70
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:44,491
It sticks itself onto me!
Somebody get it off me!

71
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,040
Don't come here!

72
00:03:47,807 --> 00:03:49,847
Alright, Darkness!
Just move on like this!

73
00:03:49,918 --> 00:03:50,976
Just leave it to me!

74
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:53,469
This is so exciting!

75
00:03:54,474 --> 00:03:56,234
As a crusader, I feel like this is...

76
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,560
the first time I'm utilizing
my true abilities!

77
00:03:58,646 --> 00:04:00,486
Konosuba!

78
00:04:02,204 --> 00:04:03,644
What's the matter?

79
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,380
He looks like the doll's master,
without a doubt.

80
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,680
Hey!

81
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:14,265
Are you the culprit?

82
00:04:17,481 --> 00:04:20,401
You actually made it this far.

83
00:04:21,215 --> 00:04:24,135
Welcome to my dungeon, adventurers!

84
00:04:24,512 --> 00:04:27,761
I'm the root of sins,
the initiator of evil.

85
00:04:27,945 --> 00:04:32,345
I'm also the Devil King's
army's general, the Duke of Hell.

86
00:04:32,832 --> 00:04:35,512
I'm Vanir, the archdemon who

87
00:04:37,054 --> 00:04:38,454
sees through the whole world.

88
00:04:38,608 --> 00:04:41,728
THE EMERGENCY MISSION OF DEFEAT VANIR,
THE DEVIL KING'S ARMY'S GENERAL.

89
00:04:42,437 --> 00:04:44,117
The Devil King's army's general?

90
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:45,970
Hey, let's escape!

91
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:50,142
As someone who serves Goddess Eris,
how can I yield in front of a demon?

92
00:04:51,502 --> 00:04:56,062
Do you want to defeat me, who's
probably as strong as the Devil King?

93
00:04:57,603 --> 00:04:59,125
Just calm down.

94
00:04:59,331 --> 00:05:01,251
Although I'm the Devil King's
army's general,

95
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:03,617
I'm just maintaining the city's barriers.

96
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,553
You could say I'm a general only in name.

97
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,400
The Devil King asked me to
investigate Verdia's case.

98
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,039
Meanwhile, I came to Axel to look for...

99
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,240
that good-for-nothing shopkeeper...

100
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:20,659
who has a weird talent for becoming
poorer the more she works.

101
00:05:21,915 --> 00:05:25,835
Moreover, I belong to the demon clan.

102
00:05:26,007 --> 00:05:27,847
Demons' favorite food is...

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,904
humans' negative emotions
when they're disgusted.

104
00:05:32,068 --> 00:05:34,519
We'd be so excited whenever one of you

105
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,600
was born that we'd run around!

106
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:40,691
These dolls kept appearing
from this dungeon.

107
00:05:40,761 --> 00:05:43,881
-The humans are very much bothered.
-What?

108
00:05:44,216 --> 00:05:47,760
I used them to get rid of
the monsters in this dungeon.

109
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:52,829
Since they're outside, it means that
there are no more monsters here.

110
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Then...

111
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,680
I'll proceed to the next plan.

112
00:05:59,191 --> 00:06:00,751
What's your intention?

113
00:06:00,965 --> 00:06:02,125
How rude!

114
00:06:02,245 --> 00:06:04,928
You're a guy who became uneasy
and worried so much...

115
00:06:05,094 --> 00:06:08,574
just because the armored girl
didn't go back for a few days.

116
00:06:08,662 --> 00:06:09,862
Shut up!

117
00:06:09,982 --> 00:06:12,102
Why are you saying it as if
you witnessed it yourself?

118
00:06:13,246 --> 00:06:15,246
And you, stop getting embarrassed too!

119
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,012
I have a sublime destruction wish.

120
00:06:20,078 --> 00:06:21,958
I'll get a dungeon first.

121
00:06:22,271 --> 00:06:25,631
Then, I'll let the demons await their
orders in each room and set up traps.

122
00:06:25,854 --> 00:06:28,774
The skilled adventurers will
come for the challenge!

123
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:31,609
After they've passed the brutal trials,

124
00:06:31,695 --> 00:06:35,015
the brave adventurers will
reach the innermost room!

125
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,320
Of course, I'll be waiting in that room!

126
00:06:37,495 --> 00:06:39,872
Luckily, you're here, adventurers!

127
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:43,360
Defeat me and get your
incredible rewards!

128
00:06:43,556 --> 00:06:45,937
The final battle will finally begin!

129
00:06:46,474 --> 00:06:50,274
After a fierce battle,
I'm finally defeated!

130
00:06:50,373 --> 00:06:52,773
A sealed treasure chest
appears at the back.

131
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:57,498
After all the trouble,
when the adventurers open it,

132
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:00,159
there's a paper with
"you failed" written on it.

133
00:07:00,769 --> 00:07:03,849
<i>While watching the confused looks
on the adventurers...</i>

134
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:08,185
I die away.

135
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,310
In order to carry out this plan,

136
00:07:13,508 --> 00:07:17,988
I planned to earn money through my
friend's shop to build a huge dungeon.

137
00:07:18,173 --> 00:07:20,293
I passed by this place by chance.

138
00:07:20,485 --> 00:07:21,965
It seemed like the owner was
not here anymore,

139
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,796
so I decided to use this dungeon.

140
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,220
But there's a very powerful
magic circle in there.

141
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,500
I can't enter.

142
00:07:30,588 --> 00:07:31,948
It was her again!

143
00:07:33,172 --> 00:07:35,412
Your comrade drew the magic circle?

144
00:07:36,354 --> 00:07:37,474
What is it?

145
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,600
Let me see.

146
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:45,741
Incredible!

147
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:50,730
Your archpriest comrade has drawn
such a troublesome magic circle!

148
00:07:50,995 --> 00:07:53,075
I see it. I can see it.

149
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:56,559
I can see that priest is resting
while drinking tea.

150
00:07:56,738 --> 00:07:57,895
That brat!

151
00:07:58,018 --> 00:07:59,818
You, the girl who has lost
her bet against that guy

152
00:07:59,968 --> 00:08:05,080
and has been helplessly and shyly
anticipating his unduly request!

153
00:08:05,223 --> 00:08:07,703
I'm not helpless or shy!

154
00:08:07,797 --> 00:08:09,117
Don't say something ridiculous!

155
00:08:09,877 --> 00:08:11,117
Don't say it!

156
00:08:11,213 --> 00:08:12,453
And you, the guy who's
nervously thinking of...

157
00:08:12,557 --> 00:08:16,237
your request for her
after everything's settled!

158
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,193
I'm not nervous!

159
00:08:18,284 --> 00:08:21,404
-I'm not!
-Step aside!

160
00:08:21,587 --> 00:08:25,467
Although not killing humans
is my principle,

161
00:08:26,218 --> 00:08:28,778
yes, I don't kill humans.

162
00:08:29,344 --> 00:08:31,144
But, it only applies to humans.

163
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:34,501
The one who made this
annoying magic circle,

164
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,920
let me teach you a lesson!

165
00:08:37,066 --> 00:08:39,072
He knows Aqua's true identity!

166
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:42,970
Since you're going to harm Aqua,
we can't stand down!

167
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,305
The girl who has not only strong abs
but is also headstrong,

168
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:46,696
let me pass through right now!

169
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:49,831
Then, you both can carry on
with your unduly requested...

170
00:08:49,952 --> 00:08:52,473
without any disturbance!

171
00:08:52,797 --> 00:08:56,037
Don't listen to this demon's words!
Don't be deluded by him!

172
00:08:56,198 --> 00:08:57,918
I won't be deluded by him!

173
00:08:58,001 --> 00:09:00,361
You're the one who needs to
consider the time and place!

174
00:09:00,464 --> 00:09:04,784
What? I was clearly tempted.

175
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,200
Enough! Talking to you
will only mess with my mind!

176
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:15,780
Then, you both shall rest well in that
magic circle room before you go back.

177
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,700
Kazuma, stop hesitating!

178
00:09:17,838 --> 00:09:21,838
We live in the same house! How can we
have that kind of weird relationship?

179
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:22,950
Get a hold of yourself!

180
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,350
She's pretty and her body is my type,
but her inner beauty isn't flattering.

181
00:09:27,524 --> 00:09:28,844
I must get a hold of myself.

182
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,951
You'll regret it when we get back!

183
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:37,765
You looked threatening,
but you're missing all your attacks.

184
00:09:42,309 --> 00:09:44,229
Where did that random guy go?

185
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,380
Compared to this brainless crusader,
he should be harder to deal with.

186
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,700
Where are you looking at?
I'm your opponent!

187
00:09:53,805 --> 00:09:55,865
-What a pity!
-This is my chance!

188
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,515
I got it!

189
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:01,909
What?

190
00:10:07,518 --> 00:10:10,038
Am I really going to die here?

191
00:10:13,445 --> 00:10:14,525
Is it settled?

192
00:10:14,707 --> 00:10:18,067
Gosh! I can't believe
there's a ball there.

193
00:10:18,347 --> 00:10:21,387
But we've really succeeded, right?

194
00:10:22,161 --> 00:10:24,721
You both were anticipating it,
but now you're disappointed!

195
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,560
Did you think I'd been defeated?

196
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,960
What a pity! No harm was done at all.

197
00:10:33,164 --> 00:10:37,856
The negative emotions of
both of you are very delicious.

198
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,720
Darkness!

199
00:10:45,121 --> 00:10:46,161
Darkness!

200
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,280
Hey! Answer me!

201
00:10:54,474 --> 00:10:56,074
Listen up, brat!

202
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,784
-With my power...
-What do I do, Kazuma?

203
00:10:58,912 --> 00:11:00,480
My body has been taken over!

204
00:11:00,615 --> 00:11:03,935
What now, brat?
If you're able to attack her...

205
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:06,880
Don't mind me at all.
Just attack me all you want.

206
00:11:07,008 --> 00:11:09,740
Quick! This is the perfect opportunity!

207
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,260
This is so noisy! What's wrong with you?

208
00:11:14,846 --> 00:11:16,446
How is this possible?
What's wrong with...

209
00:11:16,566 --> 00:11:18,246
-Amazing.
-this woman?

210
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,880
-How headstrong is she?
-I'm a good example of a crusader.

211
00:11:23,008 --> 00:11:24,827
This is so annoying!

212
00:11:27,316 --> 00:11:31,196
She's extraordinary to be
able to resist my control.

213
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:34,673
-It was nothing.
-But the more you endure it,

214
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,240
-the more painful your body will be.
-What?

215
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,320
How much longer can you keep it up?

216
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,648
What's happening?

217
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,935
The feeling of joy?

218
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,575
Please excuse me.

219
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:54,910
-I won't yield to this mere pain!
-You're very bold!

220
00:11:55,141 --> 00:11:58,901
But you'll go insane
if you endure it any longer.

221
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:02,669
Are you enjoying this feeling
by any chance?

222
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:07,469
Alright, Darkness. Let's meet up
with Aqua and escape quickly.

223
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:10,049
Stop right there, brat!

224
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,680
Kazuma, don't mind me and go first.

225
00:12:12,873 --> 00:12:17,600
-Actually, in your heart...
-I've wanted to say that!

226
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,760
You don't want to harm
this cute girl too, right?

227
00:12:22,852 --> 00:12:25,452
If she keeps on enduring my power...

228
00:12:25,568 --> 00:12:27,953
Kazuma! This self-proclaimed
all-knowing demon said something...

229
00:12:28,064 --> 00:12:31,528
-that I minded very much just now!
-This is so annoying!

230
00:12:34,892 --> 00:12:37,132
This body is such a failure.

231
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:40,048
Hey! It's very rude to call
someone's body a failure!

232
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,886
This is so annoying!

233
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:44,868
-I'm getting out now.
-No, you're not.

234
00:12:45,242 --> 00:12:46,402
What talisman is this?

235
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:48,762
Wait, Kazuma! This is...

236
00:12:48,882 --> 00:12:51,082
It's the Sealing Talisman that Sena gave.

237
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:54,487
Just go out like this
and let Aqua purify him.

238
00:12:54,609 --> 00:12:55,616
-What?
-What?

239
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,902
Konosuba!

240
00:12:58,636 --> 00:13:02,396
Brat, this girl is resisting my control.

241
00:13:02,466 --> 00:13:04,546
Her body is experiencing intense pain.

242
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:07,609
If this continues,
her heart won't be able to stand it.

243
00:13:07,744 --> 00:13:09,318
This is it, Kazuma!

244
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,360
This is the first time
I've felt this intense feeling!

245
00:13:11,584 --> 00:13:13,216
He's the Devil King's
army's general, indeed!

246
00:13:13,303 --> 00:13:14,783
I'm about to give in!

247
00:13:14,912 --> 00:13:18,212
Hang in there! We'll make you feel
better after we get to the surface!

248
00:13:18,722 --> 00:13:19,722
There's no need to.

249
00:13:20,993 --> 00:13:22,113
-What did you just say?
-What did you just say?

250
00:13:22,534 --> 00:13:23,614
There's no need to.

251
00:13:24,031 --> 00:13:26,071
Darkness! Luckily, you didn't give up!

252
00:13:27,494 --> 00:13:28,512
Darkness?

253
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,040
-I've completely taken over her.
-No way!

254
00:13:35,531 --> 00:13:38,011
Your archpriest will be
welcoming us with her guard down.

255
00:13:38,105 --> 00:13:40,905
I must let her suffer!

256
00:13:41,005 --> 00:13:42,645
Darkness! Wake up!

257
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,579
-You can do better than this!
-It's useless, brat!

258
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:49,979
Now, the touching reunion scene
where the comrades returned safely.

259
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,326
What will my detestable arch-enemy do

260
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,200
when she faces the possessed
body of her comrade?

261
00:13:57,344 --> 00:13:59,428
Sacred Exorcism!

262
00:14:04,586 --> 00:14:06,266
Darkness!

263
00:14:06,426 --> 00:14:09,306
Fool! Don't use your magic
all of a sudden!

264
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,360
I felt an evil aura heading my way,
so I used it.

265
00:14:13,493 --> 00:14:17,373
The Devil King's army's general has taken
over Darkness's body!

266
00:14:17,467 --> 00:14:19,277
The Devil King's army's general?

267
00:14:19,498 --> 00:14:21,418
So smelly! Why is it so smelly?

268
00:14:21,517 --> 00:14:24,117
That's right! It's the aura of a demon!

269
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,916
Darkness, don't come near me!

270
00:14:27,897 --> 00:14:29,497
I'll introduce myself first.

271
00:14:29,624 --> 00:14:31,224
The archpriest with the same name as...

272
00:14:31,311 --> 00:14:33,711
the infamously detestable
Goddess of Water!

273
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:37,792
-My name is...
-Aqua! I can't smell myself!

274
00:14:37,924 --> 00:14:40,364
-I'm Vanir!
-Kazuma should smell me, too!

275
00:14:40,448 --> 00:14:42,760
-I shouldn't be smelly!
-This is so annoying!

276
00:14:43,755 --> 00:14:45,195
I'm Vanir.

277
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:47,509
We just met and you've used
the Sacred Exorcism.

278
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,720
This is why Axis Cult's people
are so infamously detestable.

279
00:14:52,018 --> 00:14:53,618
Don't you have any manners?

280
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,773
Gosh, we're talking about
"manners" with a demon?

281
00:14:57,849 --> 00:14:59,769
You can't live without
humans' negative emotions.

282
00:14:59,871 --> 00:15:01,631
Aren't you a parasite?

283
00:15:05,476 --> 00:15:08,076
Sacred Highness Exorcism!

284
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,692
-You're too unskilled!
-That was close!

285
00:15:09,828 --> 00:15:13,188
Darkness! Why did you dodge? Don't move!

286
00:15:13,261 --> 00:15:15,936
-Easy for you to say!
-That's too sly!

287
00:15:16,035 --> 00:15:17,962
I want that mask too!

288
00:15:18,191 --> 00:15:20,192
My Crimson Magic Clan heart
is strongly induced by it!

289
00:15:20,373 --> 00:15:22,893
Idiot! That mask is his main body!

290
00:15:23,003 --> 00:15:26,163
He's that all-knowing demon
on the wanted notice indeed!

291
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,840
Everyone, arrest him quickly!

292
00:15:34,619 --> 00:15:38,659
Darkness, don't move!
Do you want to be saved or not?

293
00:15:38,752 --> 00:15:41,221
I can't believe Darkness is
so difficult to deal with!

294
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:44,411
I kept missing! She blocked us
with her sword so easily!

295
00:15:45,117 --> 00:15:46,917
This body's condition is very good.

296
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:49,524
It has both strength and stamina.

297
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,570
Luckily, she can withstand the magic
of those detestable gods too.

298
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,130
I'm sorry, everyone.

299
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:59,618
Just come at me,
you incompetent adventurers!

300
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:03,941
Darkness! You're arrogant just because
your swordsmanship improved a little!

301
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:07,543
I've always thought you were the most
upright one at Kazuma's party!

302
00:16:07,648 --> 00:16:11,206
Surround her!
Let's surround this lame crusader!

303
00:16:12,293 --> 00:16:17,253
The adventurers who'd usually speak
to me nicely are looking down upon me!

304
00:16:17,681 --> 00:16:19,761
I feel a vague sense of happiness.

305
00:16:20,095 --> 00:16:21,775
What's happening?

306
00:16:22,113 --> 00:16:23,793
Please think of something!

307
00:16:24,592 --> 00:16:26,952
Mr. Satou, are you not
going to join the battle?

308
00:16:28,057 --> 00:16:29,537
Kazuma!

309
00:16:30,154 --> 00:16:35,194
It's a huge crisis now!
It's the largest crisis so far!

310
00:16:35,312 --> 00:16:37,992
Kazuma!

311
00:16:38,955 --> 00:16:41,395
I wanted to take this opportunity
to teach Sena a lesson!

312
00:16:41,569 --> 00:16:44,049
It's not me who's
causing trouble every time!

313
00:16:44,352 --> 00:16:46,369
I'm just being dragged into trouble!

314
00:16:46,615 --> 00:16:48,575
Am I considered lucky like this?

315
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,000
Kazuma!

316
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:55,010
There's no other way!

317
00:16:57,944 --> 00:17:01,064
Darkness! Why did you get tamed
by a demon so easily?

318
00:17:01,392 --> 00:17:04,512
Are you a frivolous and wanton woman?

319
00:17:04,594 --> 00:17:07,234
It's useless! She can't hear you!

320
00:17:07,392 --> 00:17:09,183
Who are you calling frivolous and wanton?

321
00:17:09,285 --> 00:17:11,085
I'm not tamed by him!

322
00:17:13,176 --> 00:17:14,696
She has such a resolute spirit.

323
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,760
I'm going to remove
the seal on the mask now.

324
00:17:17,901 --> 00:17:20,941
Then, take the opportunity to regain
control of your body from Vanir!

325
00:17:21,056 --> 00:17:22,768
Take off and throw away the mask!

326
00:17:22,982 --> 00:17:24,542
You're just a good-for-nothing.

327
00:17:24,639 --> 00:17:27,839
And I've maximized her full potential.

328
00:17:27,976 --> 00:17:30,136
How are you going to break the seal?

329
00:17:30,656 --> 00:17:33,413
I feel like I won't lose to
anyone right now.

330
00:17:35,858 --> 00:17:38,912
-If you really can overpower me...
-This talisman...

331
00:17:39,011 --> 00:17:40,608
-Remove it...
-Then...

332
00:17:40,704 --> 00:17:42,712
-If you can...
-Just come at me!

333
00:17:42,784 --> 00:17:44,144
This is so annoying!

334
00:17:44,616 --> 00:17:46,336
Don't steal my exclusive lines!

335
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:53,070
Steal! Kazuma will surely use
his signature 'Steal,' right?

336
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:55,596
Hey! You've exposed my moves!
What do I do?

337
00:17:55,676 --> 00:17:58,436
Kazuma! You have me to back you up!

338
00:17:58,517 --> 00:18:00,077
Be brave and just do it!

339
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:03,288
Hey, Darkness!
This time, too, let's make a bet!

340
00:18:03,379 --> 00:18:04,739
If I win,

341
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:09,712
I'll add something more unreasonable
to last time's unduly request!

342
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,064
I can't believe you're saying this here!

343
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,351
You! Stop being deceived
by his flowery speech!

344
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,800
Boost your magic power
and beware of his "Steal"!

345
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,080
Darkness! You must keep on resisting
so that Vanir is stuck!

346
00:18:20,254 --> 00:18:22,894
Do you think an adventurer's
"Steal" will work?

347
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,530
Here I go!

348
00:18:24,732 --> 00:18:25,792
-Just do it!
-Just do it!

349
00:18:28,443 --> 00:18:30,723
Tinder!

350
00:18:40,426 --> 00:18:42,426
That's too cunning,
you despicable Kazuma!

351
00:18:42,634 --> 00:18:45,434
I can't believe you can deceive
an all-knowing demon.

352
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,440
Hey, Darkness! Show some willpower!

353
00:18:48,203 --> 00:18:49,403
I can't take it off!

354
00:18:50,483 --> 00:18:53,163
-What?
-Kazuma! What do we do?

355
00:18:53,256 --> 00:18:55,376
-Can I attack now?
-No!

356
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,040
This way, Darkness can withstand it
even if we use magic.

357
00:19:00,717 --> 00:19:01,728
Just do it.

358
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,960
If Aqua's magic won't work,

359
00:19:04,856 --> 00:19:05,920
then that's fine too.

360
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,720
Just use Explosion Magic on me.

361
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:13,819
No way! Compared to before,
my Explosion Magic has become...

362
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:16,625
much stronger after continuous training!

363
00:19:16,808 --> 00:19:18,528
Even if it's Darkness, she...

364
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:27,239
Vanir, although it was a short time,

365
00:19:27,479 --> 00:19:29,559
but being together with
you wasn't bad at all.

366
00:19:31,002 --> 00:19:32,122
So, at least,

367
00:19:32,576 --> 00:19:33,600
please make a choice.

368
00:19:33,831 --> 00:19:35,871
Leave my body and get purified,

369
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,200
or bear the Explosion Magic together?

370
00:19:40,727 --> 00:19:44,247
For a destructionist,
this will be the best choice.

371
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:48,511
I can't believe my destruction wish
will come true like this.

372
00:19:51,032 --> 00:19:55,024
For me, possessing your body
was quite fun.

373
00:19:58,191 --> 00:20:00,031
I'm a demon!

374
00:20:00,764 --> 00:20:04,324
I'll never choose to be purified
by my enemies, the gods!

375
00:20:04,581 --> 00:20:06,141
Do it, Megumin!

376
00:20:10,003 --> 00:20:13,883
If anything happens,
just say that it was my order.

377
00:20:14,266 --> 00:20:15,866
You shall be the witness.

378
00:20:16,768 --> 00:20:19,568
This time, I'll take
full responsibility too!

379
00:20:23,654 --> 00:20:24,736
Megumin!

380
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,920
The upended skyscraper that
has been concealed in this world

381
00:20:32,054 --> 00:20:35,014
rises before my still spirit.

382
00:20:35,278 --> 00:20:36,318
The time has come!

383
00:20:36,571 --> 00:20:38,651
Awake now,

384
00:20:38,812 --> 00:20:42,172
prepare yourselves through my pride,
and link yourselves!

385
00:20:42,387 --> 00:20:44,347
Explosion!

386
00:20:54,464 --> 00:20:56,657
Adventurer Satou Kazuma,

387
00:20:57,125 --> 00:21:01,125
to honor you, our town is presenting
you with a certificate of appreciation.

388
00:21:01,222 --> 00:21:05,222
At the same time, we deeply apologize
for doubting you before this.

389
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,890
<i>After battling Vanir,</i>

390
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,040
<i>someone who's related to
the Devil King's army...</i>

391
00:21:12,144 --> 00:21:15,624
<i>wouldn't have risked his life
to defeat the general.</i>

392
00:21:15,725 --> 00:21:19,205
<i>Based on this reason, my suspicion as
the Devil King's spy has been cleared.</i>

393
00:21:19,642 --> 00:21:22,802
<i>Firstly, I'm very happy not to worry
about being executed anymore.</i>

394
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:24,800
Next,

395
00:21:25,132 --> 00:21:27,172
Dustiness Ford Lalatina.

396
00:21:27,697 --> 00:21:30,377
You've made great sacrifices
regarding this case.

397
00:21:30,677 --> 00:21:33,317
Your actions have lived up to
the name of the Dustiness indeed.

398
00:21:33,514 --> 00:21:35,449
The royals are presenting you with
a certificate of appreciation.

399
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:38,434
Also, to make up for the Armour
that you've lost in the battle,

400
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:42,089
we're presenting you the Armour
that the top craftsmen made.

401
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,270
Due to Megumin's Explosion Magic,

402
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,513
Darkness was injured badly
and almost lost her life.

403
00:21:47,804 --> 00:21:49,884
She lost her favorite Armour too.

404
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,240
After that, she recovered
thanks to Aqua's care.

405
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:59,279
-Congratulations, Lalatina!
-Lalatina, well done!

406
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,410
-It's Lalatina, indeed!
-Lalatina, you're too cute!

407
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,560
This is so embarrassing! This isn't
the "unduly request" I had in mind!

408
00:22:10,817 --> 00:22:15,497
Hey, Darkness! I think the name
"Lalatina" is very cute!

409
00:22:15,618 --> 00:22:18,618
Kazuma spread your name
"Lalatina" as a joke.

410
00:22:18,723 --> 00:22:20,883
I'll teach him a lesson for you later on!

411
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:24,130
So, you must have faith in
the name "Lalatina"!

412
00:22:25,531 --> 00:22:29,571
Next, adventurer Satou Kazuma
and his party...

413
00:22:30,305 --> 00:22:34,385
have contributed a lot in defeating
the Mobile Fortress Destroyer.

414
00:22:35,007 --> 00:22:37,967
This time, as for defeating the
Devil King's army's general, Vanir,

415
00:22:38,137 --> 00:22:40,817
we won't be able to make it
without your excellent performance.

416
00:22:41,036 --> 00:22:43,996
So, I hereby clear you of your debts...

417
00:22:44,105 --> 00:22:48,585
and your compensation
regarding the manor house.

418
00:22:48,863 --> 00:22:50,983
I present you the remaining
40 million Eris...

419
00:22:51,198 --> 00:22:53,438
after all your debts are cleared,

420
00:22:53,741 --> 00:22:55,981
in honor of your contribution!

421
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,176
It's really noisy.

422
00:23:04,553 --> 00:23:07,193
<i>But this kind of day is not bad too.</i>

423
00:23:09,035 --> 00:23:10,035
<i>Nature is beautiful.</i>

424
00:23:10,738 --> 00:23:13,218
<i>Now, I've been released from...</i>

425
00:23:14,105 --> 00:23:16,265
<i>my heavy burden...</i>

426
00:23:21,016 --> 00:23:24,776
and gained my freedom at last!

427
00:23:25,228 --> 00:23:27,948
DEFEATED THE DEVIL KING'S GENERAL,
VANIR. INVESTIGATED KEELE'S DUNGEON.

428
00:23:28,064 --> 00:23:29,952
DEBTS CLEARED. GAINED 40 MILLION ERIS.

429
00:23:30,912 --> 00:23:40,929
(Episode 6:
Goodbye to This Irritating Living World!)
