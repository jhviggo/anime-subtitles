00:05.100 --> 00:08.210
Devil King's Army attack alert.

00:08.210 --> 00:10.590
This is a large-scale attack.

00:10.590 --> 00:12.950
All adventurers in the royal capital,

00:12.950 --> 00:15.710
please go to the battlefield.

00:34.690 --> 00:39.200
(God's Blessing on This Wonderful World!
Season 3)

01:51.000 --> 01:53.590
(Episode 5: A Bad Friend for The Princess)

01:53.590 --> 01:55.500
Protect the royal capital!

01:55.500 --> 01:58.090
The Devil King's Army is nothing to fear.

01:59.200 --> 02:01.800
Are you Mr. Kazuma Satou?

02:02.500 --> 02:04.000
I'm sorry.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.500
People below level 30…

02:07.000 --> 02:08.210
It doesn't matter.

02:08.210 --> 02:11.000
That man has many achievements.

02:11.700 --> 02:12.600
Claire.

02:12.600 --> 02:13.600
I've heard of him.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.900
He's the one who destroyed that Destroyer.

02:15.900 --> 02:17.490
I heard that in Arcanletia,

02:17.500 --> 02:20.700
he defeated the Deadly Poison Slime, Hans.

02:20.700 --> 02:22.490
After all, he is the hero of Axel,

02:22.490 --> 02:23.910
Kazuma Satou.

02:23.910 --> 02:31.100
Kazuma…

02:31.100 --> 02:32.800
Everyone, calm down.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.290
I'm just about to become a legend.

02:44.310 --> 02:47.000
Leave it to me, I'll do my best.

02:49.200 --> 02:50.900
Mr. Kazuma.

02:50.900 --> 02:52.710
Smart as I am, I've learned my lesson.

02:52.710 --> 02:54.890
Something is sure to go wrong in the end.

02:54.890 --> 02:55.700
For example,

02:55.700 --> 02:58.300
someone with a screw loose
will use Explosion

02:58.300 --> 02:59.200
and drag me into trouble.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.010
Or someone with a muscle for a brain
will summon monsters

03:01.010 --> 03:02.610
and drag me into trouble too.

03:02.610 --> 03:04.300
Who's the one with a screw loose?

03:04.300 --> 03:05.320
You tell me.

03:05.320 --> 03:07.600
Don't you dare say
I have a muscle for a brain!

03:07.600 --> 03:09.910
I want to go back to Axel.

03:11.700 --> 03:14.420
The enemies are just small fries
who win by numbers.

03:15.900 --> 03:17.910
I will show them my true abilities.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.100
Then let's go.

03:24.100 --> 03:26.920
Devil King's Army subjugation team,
on the move.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.560
(Konosuba)

03:38.900 --> 03:41.200
Long time no see, Lady Eris.

04:00.810 --> 04:02.290
That's not it!

04:02.290 --> 04:04.600
Lady Eris, that's not it!

04:04.600 --> 04:07.200
That's right, it went well until halfway.

04:07.200 --> 04:11.570
Mr. Kazuma!

04:11.990 --> 04:13.690
Snipe.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.510
What are you doing?

04:18.510 --> 04:19.800
You're a goddess, aren't you?

04:19.800 --> 04:21.740
How can you be defeated by a lowly Kobold?

04:21.740 --> 04:23.100
How?

04:25.800 --> 04:29.400
I'll make them regret
insulting a Goddess.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.600
Tremble under the wrath of the deities.

04:31.990 --> 04:35.410
Divine Light Fist.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.600
God Requiem!

04:37.610 --> 04:38.790
- It seems I need not worry about her.
- God Requiem!

04:38.790 --> 04:40.200
Kachoufugetsu.

04:40.200 --> 04:41.100
God Requiem.

04:42.090 --> 04:43.600
A Kobold.

04:44.300 --> 04:47.410
For me, who has fought Leaders
of Devil King's Army multiple times,

04:47.410 --> 04:49.000
you are simply not a match.

04:50.200 --> 04:51.800
Stop right there!

04:54.410 --> 04:56.870
The Devil King's Army
that endangers peace,

04:57.400 --> 04:59.900
turn into the rust
on my sword Chunchumaru…

05:07.500 --> 05:10.710
What now? This is so embarrassing.

05:10.710 --> 05:12.710
Looking smug before the battle,

05:12.710 --> 05:15.650
only to be killed by Kobolds.

05:16.600 --> 05:19.500
Even Lady Eris was left speechless.

05:20.200 --> 05:22.290
You must not sexually harass others.

05:24.410 --> 05:27.500
The other day, to my follower.

05:29.900 --> 05:33.310
Lady Eris, you can see
what happened on the ground.

05:33.310 --> 05:34.400
That's why…

05:35.010 --> 05:37.200
No, that was unavoidable.

05:37.200 --> 05:38.800
When I caught her,

05:38.800 --> 05:41.360
I felt her chest was flat,
so I thought she was a man.

05:41.690 --> 05:43.410
That's what happened.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
I'm sorry!

05:48.000 --> 05:49.810
I won't make any more excuses!

05:51.690 --> 05:53.300
Fine.

05:53.300 --> 05:56.110
I won't forgive you next time.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.010
Thank you.

05:58.600 --> 05:59.600
Oh dear.

05:59.610 --> 06:01.310
I was just thinking about what I should do

06:01.310 --> 06:04.110
if a precious classic female character
like Lady Eris dislikes me.

06:04.110 --> 06:05.800
You are flattering me.

06:06.410 --> 06:08.300
Haven't you recently been overjoyed

06:08.300 --> 06:10.120
by getting a new sister?

06:11.690 --> 06:12.600
You…

06:13.200 --> 06:14.590
Just how much have you seen?

06:14.590 --> 06:15.400
Lady Eris.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.400
I'll stop teasing you.

06:24.400 --> 06:27.200
Actually, I have a favor to ask of you.

06:27.200 --> 06:28.200
A favor?

06:29.410 --> 06:32.100
It's a task for which
you won't be rewarded,

06:32.100 --> 06:34.500
nor will you gain any fame from it.

06:37.190 --> 06:40.690
It's something I can only entrust
to someone I deem reliable.

06:41.690 --> 06:45.120
Could you help retrieve
the sacred treasure?

06:51.600 --> 06:54.410
Mr. Kazuma, who was killed by the Kobolds,

06:54.410 --> 06:55.710
welcome back.

06:56.190 --> 06:57.500
Hey.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.200
Don't say that to someone
who has just been resurrected.

07:00.200 --> 07:02.590
Let's finish the remaining
Devil King's Army.

07:02.590 --> 07:04.310
Those who can still move, follow me.

07:04.310 --> 07:06.180
Yes.

07:08.200 --> 07:09.410
What should we do?

07:09.410 --> 07:11.400
Things have become tricky.

07:12.310 --> 07:14.300
This Useless Goddess

07:14.300 --> 07:15.310
doesn't seem to know

07:15.310 --> 07:18.000
where the sacred treasure
she bestowed on the reincarnated is.

07:19.200 --> 07:21.100
The first one doesn't require a price

07:21.100 --> 07:24.190
and can summon monsters at random.

07:24.190 --> 07:27.620
But controlling the monsters has a price.

07:28.700 --> 07:32.100
The other one allows body swapping.

07:32.100 --> 07:35.010
This thing has a time limit for its use.

07:36.200 --> 07:37.110
It is said that these two items

07:37.110 --> 07:39.010
can have a great impact on the world

07:39.010 --> 07:41.800
even if used by someone
other than the reincarnated.

07:43.800 --> 07:45.610
I want to go home.

07:46.310 --> 07:48.400
Kazuma, have you been resurrected?

07:48.400 --> 07:49.700
Yes.

07:49.700 --> 07:51.420
How do you feel?

07:51.420 --> 07:52.700
Your performance just now

07:52.700 --> 07:54.120
touched me greatly!

07:54.120 --> 07:55.890
Thinking of how you
resisted powerful magic

07:55.890 --> 07:58.100
and charged into the Devil King's Army,

07:58.100 --> 07:59.130
I just…

07:59.600 --> 08:01.700
Bring it on!

08:02.190 --> 08:05.100
Their army commander
was frightened by you.

08:05.100 --> 08:06.320
He looked shocked.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.120
It was unforgettable.

08:08.910 --> 08:10.510
No, I…

08:10.510 --> 08:11.700
Kazuma,

08:11.700 --> 08:13.200
don't push yourself.

08:13.200 --> 08:14.700
Rest well!

08:14.700 --> 08:16.400
Okay.

08:16.400 --> 08:17.700
Make way.

08:17.710 --> 08:20.000
The biggest hero is coming through.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.600
Clear a path.

08:23.790 --> 08:25.410
Miss Megumin is tired.

08:25.410 --> 08:28.190
Wanna get blown away by Explosion?

08:28.190 --> 08:31.000
The top magician in Axel,

08:31.000 --> 08:32.900
the one who turns everything to ashes,

08:32.900 --> 08:35.000
Miss Megumin is passing through!

08:35.820 --> 08:37.280
What's that all about?

08:37.290 --> 08:39.100
It was exhilarating.

08:39.110 --> 08:40.000
Whenever the enemy commander

08:40.010 --> 08:41.500
is in crisis,

08:41.510 --> 08:43.890
he always says
that this is just the vanguard.

08:43.900 --> 08:45.900
Next time, he will lead
an army many times larger

08:45.900 --> 08:48.300
and turn the royal capital to ashes.

08:48.300 --> 08:49.600
Trying to threaten us.

08:49.600 --> 08:50.690
Just when he said that…

08:51.690 --> 08:53.620
Explosion!

08:59.400 --> 09:01.200
I am Megumin,

09:01.200 --> 09:03.820
the top magician in Axel

09:03.820 --> 09:06.310
who controls explosion magic.

09:07.100 --> 09:11.410
You're the ones who will turn to ashes.

09:12.390 --> 09:13.900
Yet you countered him.

09:14.910 --> 09:18.890
And cast that grand spell
with all your power.

09:18.890 --> 09:21.310
Right?

09:21.310 --> 09:23.400
Facing my fatal spell,

09:23.400 --> 09:25.810
no one can survive.

09:25.810 --> 09:29.690
After all, even that Destroyer
was annihilated.

09:29.690 --> 09:32.000
Even that Destroyer?

09:32.000 --> 09:34.300
What a great Arch Wizard.

09:34.300 --> 09:35.200
Miss Megumin.

09:35.200 --> 09:38.190
Please show us other advanced magic.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.510
I want to see too.

09:41.100 --> 09:43.690
I do want to show you,

09:43.690 --> 09:45.810
but my magic power is depleted now.

09:46.400 --> 09:47.400
Pity.

09:47.400 --> 09:49.100
No matter, you can show us tomorrow.

09:49.110 --> 09:49.840
Miss Megumin.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.590
I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

09:51.590 --> 09:54.090
I'll tell the others.

09:54.090 --> 09:58.200
Tomorrow, well...

09:58.200 --> 09:59.390
Kazuma! Kazuma...

09:59.390 --> 10:01.600
You've successfully revived?

10:01.600 --> 10:03.910
You must have some trouble adjusting.

10:03.910 --> 10:06.010
I'll take care of you tomorrow.

10:06.010 --> 10:09.850
(Konosuba)
Kazuma!

10:16.100 --> 10:20.100
Didn't you say you'd take care of me?

10:20.100 --> 10:21.010
Kazuma.

10:21.010 --> 10:23.000
Let's return to Axel tomorrow.

10:23.000 --> 10:23.860
Early in the morning.

10:27.910 --> 10:29.910
Elder brother, I am glad you are safe.

10:29.910 --> 10:31.090
Elder brother?

10:31.090 --> 10:32.590
Yeah.

10:32.590 --> 10:34.800
Not exactly safe though.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.600
Since I died and then came back to life.

10:37.600 --> 10:39.100
Are you alright?

10:39.100 --> 10:40.180
Before the victory celebration,

10:40.180 --> 10:41.510
you should take some rest.

10:41.510 --> 10:44.090
Your room has been kept
just as it was, elder brother.

10:44.090 --> 10:45.600
'Elder brother' again?

10:50.910 --> 10:53.110
This room is really nice.

10:53.810 --> 10:56.800
I can understand why you
didn't want to go back.

10:56.800 --> 10:58.200
Right?

10:58.200 --> 11:00.400
The food is delicious,
and people respect me.

11:00.990 --> 11:01.830
If you lived here,

11:01.830 --> 11:03.810
you wouldn't want to go back either.

11:04.890 --> 11:08.190
But I haven't been very active.

11:08.190 --> 11:10.190
Back to Axel tomorrow?

11:11.090 --> 11:13.000
Although I like showing off

11:13.000 --> 11:14.720
in the royal capital,

11:18.810 --> 11:20.310
I still prefer

11:20.310 --> 11:22.810
the four of us in Axel

11:22.810 --> 11:25.700
completing missions together.

11:26.600 --> 11:28.070
It was a lively life,
even if we quarreled.

11:30.300 --> 11:32.600
Well, that's true.

11:32.600 --> 11:35.200
But being too lively can also be a problem.

11:39.190 --> 11:40.290
Elder brother,

11:40.990 --> 11:42.890
I am very sorry.

11:42.890 --> 11:43.910
I pleaded with Claire

11:43.910 --> 11:47.700
to let you stay in the city, but…

11:47.700 --> 11:49.100
There's no helping it.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.710
I'm sorry I couldn't be of help.

11:54.710 --> 11:56.810
You need not apologize.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.010
Because you literally

11:59.010 --> 12:01.810
fought with your life on the line.

12:03.910 --> 12:04.960
Sorry.

12:04.960 --> 12:08.200
Your brother was besieged by Kobolds,

12:09.500 --> 12:10.700
You two.

12:10.700 --> 12:12.600
Have you forgotten that I'm here too?

12:12.600 --> 12:13.900
We haven't forgotten!

12:13.900 --> 12:15.210
Iris is right.

12:15.210 --> 12:16.920
How could we possibly forget?

12:17.810 --> 12:18.490
Alas.

12:21.390 --> 12:23.500
I didn't notice it before.

12:23.500 --> 12:25.600
You're wearing a powerful magical item.

12:26.510 --> 12:30.500
I can feel immense magic
from that necklace.

12:30.500 --> 12:34.600
Someone offered this to my brother Jadice.

12:34.600 --> 12:36.600
In place of him, who is on an expedition,

12:36.600 --> 12:38.210
it's in my safekeeping.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
What kind of power does it have?

12:41.000 --> 12:44.090
Can it destroy the world?

12:44.090 --> 12:45.410
No, well…

12:46.010 --> 12:49.270
We still haven't figured out
how to use it.

12:49.270 --> 12:51.480
You are flaunting your interest.

12:51.480 --> 12:54.200
There's a script etched on this.

12:55.410 --> 12:58.400
But the scholars in town
couldn't decipher it.

12:59.010 --> 13:00.700
Isn't this Japanese?

13:00.700 --> 13:02.410
Let me see.

13:02.410 --> 13:04.700
What's yours is mine.

13:04.710 --> 13:06.800
What's mine is yours.

13:06.800 --> 13:08.810
Let me become you.

13:08.810 --> 13:10.100
Is this an insult?

13:10.100 --> 13:12.000
You can understand this?

13:13.000 --> 13:14.290
This is called Japanese…

13:14.290 --> 13:17.310
Hey, the necklace is glowing!

13:17.310 --> 13:19.020
Iris, throw it away!

13:19.020 --> 13:22.310
Throw it out of the window!

13:26.400 --> 13:27.320
Eh?

13:27.320 --> 13:29.190
Nothing happened.

13:31.100 --> 13:32.920
I thought something would happen

13:32.920 --> 13:34.590
and impact the whole world.

13:34.590 --> 13:36.410
It's disappointing.

13:37.900 --> 13:40.100
How long are you going
to stare at each other?

13:40.100 --> 13:41.000
Just like before.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.510
Don't forget that I'm here too.

13:43.510 --> 13:44.700
No, Megumin.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.990
Something shocking has indeed happened.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.250
Calling me by my name?

13:48.600 --> 13:49.690
Listen,

13:49.690 --> 13:51.810
I am older than you.

13:51.810 --> 13:52.910
You should call me Sister Megumin.

13:52.910 --> 13:54.710
Well…

13:59.900 --> 14:02.500
I am Iris, actually.

14:07.510 --> 14:10.700
Alright, what should we do next?

14:11.390 --> 14:12.270
Personally, I'm willing

14:12.270 --> 14:15.600
to live on as a beautiful girl.

14:15.600 --> 14:18.150
But it's also hard to separate

14:18.150 --> 14:19.390
from my old body.

14:19.390 --> 14:20.610
Why are you so calm?

14:20.620 --> 14:22.700
You just casually said
something astonishing.

14:23.310 --> 14:26.910
Men are really strong.

14:26.910 --> 14:29.410
I want to go on an adventure
just like this.

14:30.100 --> 14:31.800
I'm sorry.

14:31.800 --> 14:33.920
Speaking like this with that face.

14:34.700 --> 14:36.500
It's really a headache.

14:36.500 --> 14:39.710
Repeating the script
failed to switch back.

14:39.710 --> 14:42.200
It can swap bodies.

14:42.200 --> 14:45.670
Such a powerful magical item
is unprecedented.

14:46.590 --> 14:48.490
A magical item, huh.

14:49.090 --> 14:50.490
If it's some sort of curse,

14:50.500 --> 14:52.000
we just have to ask Aqua,

14:52.910 --> 14:56.310
The other one allows body swapping.

14:56.310 --> 14:58.000
This thing has a time limit for its use.

15:00.400 --> 15:03.560
This is it!

15:05.300 --> 15:06.500
Don't worry.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.500
I know what this magical item is.

15:09.300 --> 15:10.910
This thing has a time limit.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.800
We'll be able to swap back.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.910
Really?

15:14.910 --> 15:17.400
I got the information
from the most reliable source.

15:17.400 --> 15:18.420
Don't worry.

15:19.300 --> 15:21.700
Brother…

15:22.310 --> 15:23.410
What is it?

15:29.000 --> 15:31.410
Iris, you're in the midst of puberty.

15:31.410 --> 15:34.100
Don't play with my body, okay?

15:34.100 --> 15:36.150
I… I wouldn't do that.

15:38.400 --> 15:39.700
I…

15:39.700 --> 15:41.400
Just this once.

15:41.400 --> 15:44.170
I want to go outside the city
without my retainers.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.100
Outside the city?

15:46.110 --> 15:47.110
Yes.

15:47.110 --> 15:50.090
It's possible
with your current appearance.

15:50.090 --> 15:52.420
But just you alone…

15:53.200 --> 15:54.600
Can't I?

15:58.310 --> 15:59.800
I'll accompany her.

15:59.800 --> 16:00.910
Megumin?

16:02.100 --> 16:05.600
I can't follow Kazuma,
who is now the princess.

16:05.600 --> 16:09.200
I won't be as meddlesome
as those retainers.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.810
Really, Sister Megumin?

16:13.000 --> 16:15.210
I did ask you to call me that,

16:15.210 --> 16:17.450
but you can stick with Megumin.

16:17.900 --> 16:20.690
Miss Megumin, thank you.

16:20.690 --> 16:22.090
Leave it to me.

16:22.090 --> 16:23.810
From how to bargain when shopping

16:23.810 --> 16:25.610
to how to deal with others' provocations,

16:25.610 --> 16:27.460
I will teach you all sorts of things.

16:28.300 --> 16:30.410
Is it really okay?

16:30.910 --> 16:31.960
Yay!

16:31.960 --> 16:33.450
(Konosuba)
Konosuba.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.410
Oh no, this is addictive.

16:50.200 --> 16:52.010
Princess Iris.

16:52.010 --> 16:54.090
Did that man

16:54.090 --> 16:55.210
teach you bad things again?

16:55.990 --> 16:59.700
Claire, Mr. Kazuma is
an outstanding person.

16:59.700 --> 17:02.610
His name could be in a history textbook.

17:02.620 --> 17:05.360
Did he really impart something to you?

17:06.120 --> 17:09.410
It's better to get rid of him.

17:10.210 --> 17:13.600
Please don't have
such frightening thoughts right behind me.

17:14.500 --> 17:15.810
Princess Iris.

17:16.890 --> 17:18.090
Mr. Mitsurugi.

17:19.790 --> 17:23.000
I've heard that you've again
had a great performance.

17:23.000 --> 17:23.930
Not at all.

17:24.500 --> 17:26.400
It's nothing remarkable.

17:29.900 --> 17:32.210
So you can look like that too.

17:33.500 --> 17:36.510
Because I consider protecting the citizens

17:36.510 --> 17:38.510
and Princess Iris as my mission.

17:40.190 --> 17:41.000
Claire.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.110
Execute this man
who dares to touch my head.

17:44.110 --> 17:45.210
What?

17:45.790 --> 17:47.900
You've been weird since earlier.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.300
What happened?

17:49.710 --> 17:50.780
I'll forgive your disrespect

17:50.780 --> 17:53.600
on account of Claire.

17:53.600 --> 17:55.200
Now get lost.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.910
Scram now.

17:56.910 --> 17:57.810
Go away.

17:58.410 --> 18:01.300
My apologies.

18:02.210 --> 18:03.600
Heck.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.410
I'm not strolling through the castle

18:05.410 --> 18:06.990
to see you.

18:07.700 --> 18:09.000
Right, Claire.

18:09.010 --> 18:10.050
Yes.

18:10.050 --> 18:11.800
Where is Lalatina?

18:11.800 --> 18:13.210
I want to tease her…

18:15.500 --> 18:17.590
She has worked hard in this battle.

18:17.590 --> 18:20.080
I want to reward her.

18:20.080 --> 18:22.300
Lord Dustiness got covered in ash

18:22.300 --> 18:24.010
in the battle.

18:24.010 --> 18:26.510
She is taking a bath.

18:27.100 --> 18:28.810
Take me there immediately!

18:28.810 --> 18:31.590
I want to join in and wash her back!

18:31.590 --> 18:34.610
How can a royalty wash a retainer's back?

18:35.610 --> 18:37.600
I want to wash your back too.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.910
Thank you for your hard work.

18:40.610 --> 18:41.890
Could it be

18:42.600 --> 18:43.820
you don't like it?

18:44.810 --> 18:46.410
How could I not like it?

18:46.410 --> 18:48.100
Come on, Princess Iris.

18:48.100 --> 18:48.910
Let's go.

18:48.910 --> 18:50.310
Let's go right now.

18:50.310 --> 18:53.100
It's the highest honor.

18:53.110 --> 18:54.800
Come, come.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.310
Eh?

18:57.310 --> 18:59.810
This lady's gaze upon Iris is…

19:01.010 --> 19:02.600
Is she from that side?

19:02.600 --> 19:04.200
I thought she was serious and strict.

19:04.200 --> 19:06.310
She is from over there?

19:06.310 --> 19:08.710
Is there no decent female character
in this world?

19:10.080 --> 19:12.390
But it suits me fine.

19:12.920 --> 19:16.010
(Konosuba)
Konosuba.

19:17.200 --> 19:18.690
Princess Iris.

19:18.690 --> 19:21.210
Are you taking a bath before the party?

19:23.600 --> 19:24.700
Princess Iris?

19:28.700 --> 19:32.800
I want to wash your back,
as you fought hard in the battle.

19:35.010 --> 19:37.700
But it seems I'm late.

19:39.200 --> 19:40.510
What a pity.

19:41.600 --> 19:44.600
Princess Iris's kindness cannot be wasted.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.200
I'll wash it again.

19:46.200 --> 19:49.100
Undressing in front of me?

19:49.100 --> 19:51.200
She's too careless.

19:51.200 --> 19:52.690
I'm not mentally prepared.

19:52.690 --> 19:53.600
Calm down.

19:53.600 --> 19:55.490
Calm down, Kazuma Satou.

19:55.490 --> 19:57.600
Darkness and you
have bathed together before.

19:57.600 --> 19:59.900
What's wrong?

20:00.600 --> 20:02.990
Your face is so red.

20:04.300 --> 20:05.730
She smells good.

20:05.730 --> 20:09.090
No, that's not the point.

20:09.090 --> 20:10.590
If I have the scent of soap on me,

20:10.590 --> 20:13.280
Iris will find out that I took a bath.

20:13.280 --> 20:14.860
Oh my gosh!

20:14.860 --> 20:17.700
It's such a tempting scene.

20:17.700 --> 20:18.600
Endure.

20:18.600 --> 20:19.800
I must endure.

20:19.800 --> 20:21.810
If she discovered…

20:21.810 --> 20:23.510
Are you feeling unwell?

20:24.520 --> 20:26.400
Something has been off since a while ago.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.210
I understand

20:34.110 --> 20:37.520
why the reincarnated would
want this sacred treasure.

20:39.310 --> 20:41.510
Whatever.

20:41.510 --> 20:42.810
So what if Iris finds out I took a bath

20:42.810 --> 20:46.010
because of the soap's scent?

20:50.790 --> 20:53.100
The great ancestors of Japan

20:53.800 --> 20:56.420
left us with this saying,

20:58.110 --> 21:02.410
'Leave tomorrow's matters to tomorrow.'

21:04.210 --> 21:06.630
The goddess of fortune, Lady Eris,

21:08.000 --> 21:10.100
I am now wholeheartedly grateful

21:10.910 --> 21:14.300
for my good luck.

21:20.610 --> 21:22.900
Asking for a beating, brat?

21:22.900 --> 21:24.830
Are you prepared for the consequences?

21:24.830 --> 21:27.590
Look, Big Brother is all disheartened.

21:27.590 --> 21:29.690
I… I'm not disheartened at all.

21:29.690 --> 21:33.310
It's just the first time
I've been insulted so harshly.

21:33.310 --> 21:36.290
That's right, you've said it well.

21:36.300 --> 21:38.310
Crush them with your next sentence.

21:38.310 --> 21:39.810
From the moment
you strutted with your lackeys,

21:39.810 --> 21:41.430
you were destined to be a nobody,

21:41.430 --> 21:43.010
an overwhelmingly insignificant nobody,

21:43.010 --> 21:46.010
a waste that can't even
contribute to others' points.

21:48.710 --> 21:52.300
How dare you look down on me!

23:30.040 --> 23:31.010
(Episode 6: Farewell to the Good Life)

23:31.010 --> 23:32.500
Welcome.

23:32.510 --> 23:34.910
Three bowls of Slime Red Bean Soup left.

23:36.120 --> 23:37.710
Hello, I'm Hans.

23:37.710 --> 23:39.210
May I have a word?

23:39.210 --> 23:40.210
Sometimes I wonder…
