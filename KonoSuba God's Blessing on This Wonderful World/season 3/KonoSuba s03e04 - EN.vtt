WEBVTT

00:01.360 --> 00:02.730
So...

00:03.090 --> 00:06.230
You just brazenly show up here, is that it?

00:06.230 --> 00:08.600
Yeah, reluctantly.

00:08.600 --> 00:13.280
Seriously, Kazuma, do you have a fatal 
allergy to <i>not</i> getting wrapped up in trouble?

00:13.280 --> 00:15.290
I guess I'm stuck helping you,

00:15.290 --> 00:17.860
but you're in no position to 
whine about me anymore!

00:17.860 --> 00:20.370
Because you're just as bad! 
Just as bad, Kazuma!

00:20.370 --> 00:21.700
Indeed he is!

00:21.700 --> 00:25.770
And he can hardly refer to us as 
troublemakers anymore, can he?

00:25.770 --> 00:27.500
Granted, as his friends,

00:27.500 --> 00:30.290
we will gladly help him instead of 
leaving him to his own devices!

00:31.070 --> 00:33.060
If it isn't the demented little wizard.

00:33.060 --> 00:37.420
You'd better not be planning to blow 
away my property like you did before.

00:37.420 --> 00:38.540
Excuse me?!

00:39.240 --> 00:40.800
That said...

00:40.800 --> 00:46.470
I do feel somewhat insulted that the 
unsavory rumors people spread about me

00:46.470 --> 00:48.130
are being so easily believed.

00:48.130 --> 00:52.100
I-It's only a part of the investigation...

00:52.100 --> 00:55.560
Oh, I understand, Lady Dustiness.

00:55.560 --> 00:59.890
You, at least, are welcome to 
stay for as long as you'd like.

01:00.570 --> 01:03.580
He said we could stay as long as we'd like!

01:04.250 --> 01:06.760
I get the biggest guest room!

01:06.760 --> 01:08.310
No fair, Kazuma!

01:08.310 --> 01:10.450
I want the one closest to the dining room!

01:10.450 --> 01:13.920
I would be best suited to the 
room with the highest altitude!

01:11.130 --> 01:12.740
Hey, wait a—

01:13.920 --> 01:16.480
Damn it, Aqua! Who said 
you could come up here?!

01:15.990 --> 01:18.380
What, I'm not allowed to pick an upstairs room?!

01:16.960 --> 01:19.390
I'm... so sorry about them.

01:17.650 --> 01:19.260
Quit being so selfish!

01:19.260 --> 01:22.500
You two should be fine sleeping downstairs!

01:20.970 --> 01:24.470
You... certainly seem to have 
your hands full, Lady Dustiness.

01:22.500 --> 01:22.950
No fair!

01:22.950 --> 01:25.180
You always try to hog the rewards, Kazuma!

01:24.470 --> 01:27.080
You two should be downstairs anyway!

01:24.770 --> 01:28.980
I'm sorry... I am so sorry about them.

01:25.180 --> 01:26.050
I work hard, too!

01:27.080 --> 01:28.980
I will be the one in the highest room!

01:28.980 --> 01:31.250
So sorry!

01:39.870 --> 01:48.300
<b>KONOSUBA!
God's Blessing on this Wonderful World! 3</b>

02:59.040 --> 03:03.740
<b>Episode 4: Divine Punishment for This Handsome Gentleman Thief!</b>

03:00.310 --> 03:03.740
<i>My plans took a strange twist.</i>

03:03.740 --> 03:07.020
<i>Man, I wish I was back in that cozy castle...</i>

03:07.020 --> 03:09.410
<i>But, Iris, your big brother's gonna try hard!</i>

03:10.320 --> 03:13.330
<i>If a thief is coming, 
it'll probably be at night.</i>

03:15.220 --> 03:16.440
<i>What's that room?</i>

03:20.470 --> 03:22.750
O-Oh, it's you.

03:22.550 --> 03:23.740
I'm Kazuma.

03:22.750 --> 03:24.310
Nothing of note in here.

03:24.310 --> 03:26.890
I wouldn't wander around 
unless you've got good reason.

03:28.230 --> 03:29.390
What were you looking at?

03:29.390 --> 03:29.880
Hey!

03:34.400 --> 03:35.700
The baths?!

03:36.360 --> 03:38.030
Is this a magic mirror?!

03:38.680 --> 03:40.580
You were making sure it 
was in perfect condition

03:40.580 --> 03:42.830
since Darkness is staying 
the night, weren't you?

03:42.830 --> 03:45.580
C-Care to join me?

03:45.580 --> 03:48.410
I will obviously not be 
swayed by your wicked ways.

03:48.410 --> 03:51.410
Now, get on out. I'm going to use this room.

03:54.970 --> 03:57.010
Hold on! <i>You're</i> going to use it?!

03:57.010 --> 04:00.190
Come on, quit thinking like a deviant.

04:00.190 --> 04:03.140
I am going to sleep in this room to keep 
my friends from getting creeped on!

04:03.140 --> 04:04.420
Don't try and play me!

04:04.420 --> 04:08.570
I won't allow some sprout like you 
to gaze upon Lalatina's body!

04:08.570 --> 04:12.360
Too bad! 'Cuz I've already been 
in the bath with Darkness before!

04:12.360 --> 04:15.430
You want me to let the whole 
mansion know about this room?

04:15.430 --> 04:17.290
We're making a deal!

04:17.290 --> 04:20.760
If you don't want your entire maid staff 
pissed at you, then keep your mouth shut!

04:21.530 --> 04:24.860
Being sexually harassed is part 
of a maid's job description!

04:24.860 --> 04:27.710
I should be the one making you an offer.

04:27.710 --> 04:31.200
I'm not sure why, but I feel 
we may be two of a kind.

04:31.200 --> 04:34.220
Why not choose the friendly option?

04:34.220 --> 04:35.690
Ba-dump!

04:36.560 --> 04:38.720
What an interesting offer.

04:38.720 --> 04:41.470
Let's hear the terms, by all means.

04:44.690 --> 04:46.800
This pervert was trying to peep on—

04:49.350 --> 04:50.620
Sorry.

04:52.490 --> 04:56.210
<i>It's been three days since we arrived. 
Mansion life is comfortable enough.</i>

04:56.730 --> 04:59.500
<i>There's been nothing of note happening...</i>

05:07.240 --> 05:09.990
Oho. Enjoying a bit of lunch, Kazuma?

05:09.990 --> 05:11.250
Yeah. Good morning.

05:11.900 --> 05:14.500
It's actually afternoon already.

05:14.500 --> 05:18.750
I was up all night keeping an 
eye out for the thief, thanks!

05:18.750 --> 05:24.870
Besides, I heard you were up late every 
night while I was away from Axel.

05:25.430 --> 05:29.780
That was... well... I was worried 
because you were suddenly taken away!

05:29.780 --> 05:33.130
More importantly, was there 
any sign of the thief?

05:33.130 --> 05:35.220
What's got you so anxious?

05:35.220 --> 05:37.410
You were seriously worried about me?

05:37.410 --> 05:38.520
That's pretty cute.

05:38.520 --> 05:43.490
I-It's just because you always tend to get 
wrapped up in trouble, despite being weak!

05:43.490 --> 05:45.150
To say nothing of how easily you die!

05:45.150 --> 05:48.310
I-It's not like I <i>try</i> to get into trouble!

05:48.310 --> 05:50.570
Much like how I wasn't dying on purpose!

05:51.040 --> 05:53.790
<i>Oh my God, this is just like a rom-com!</i>

05:53.790 --> 05:58.390
How am I supposed to react when 
you're suddenly being so sweet?!

05:58.770 --> 06:01.790
Kazuma, when you're done 
with your breakfast,

06:01.790 --> 06:04.050
would you like to join me for a date?

06:04.870 --> 06:06.800
Ba-dump!

06:10.610 --> 06:12.630
Explosion!

06:20.080 --> 06:22.690
I figured it'd be something like this!

06:26.700 --> 06:28.230
...plosion!

06:29.690 --> 06:32.200
What's that? The Demon King Army?

06:36.440 --> 06:37.590
...sion!

06:39.960 --> 06:42.400
What the hell is happening?!

06:43.230 --> 06:47.140
You realize the capital's already 
getting complaints about you, right?

06:47.140 --> 06:49.960
My name has begun to resound, is that it?

06:50.270 --> 06:53.510
Maybe I should've had you learn 
advanced magic after all...

06:53.510 --> 06:56.560
I don't appreciate what you just said!

06:56.560 --> 06:58.190
<i>And so...</i>

06:58.190 --> 07:01.690
Hey! You think you can screw 
with a water goddess?

07:01.690 --> 07:05.700
I know you've got fancier stuff! Bring me that!

07:01.690 --> 07:05.700
<i>Aqua spent the week drinking all 
the best booze in the mansion.</i>

07:07.600 --> 07:10.870
It was then that my Explosion 
magic burst forth,

07:10.870 --> 07:14.820
laying waste to the pitiful general 
of the Demon King's army, Hans!

07:14.820 --> 07:18.590
Then came the time I battled 
another general, Sylvia...

07:17.090 --> 07:19.630
<i>Megumin regaled us daily, at length,</i>

07:18.590 --> 07:22.910
Now, that was a tale of 
truly epic accomplishment!

07:19.630 --> 07:21.150
<i>about her heroic triumphs.</i>

07:21.150 --> 07:22.910
<i>And as for me...</i>

07:23.920 --> 07:27.560
Miss, miss! Can I get my usual massage?

07:27.560 --> 07:30.470
For dinner tonight, can we 
get giant beef sukiyaki?

07:30.470 --> 07:32.800
Also, the down blanket 
I ordered should be coming,

07:32.800 --> 07:34.560
so go ahead and put it on my bed.

07:34.870 --> 07:37.060
L-Lady Dustiness...

07:38.040 --> 07:43.470
Well... I do realize I said to 
make yourself at home, but...

07:42.890 --> 07:44.680
You don't need to finish the thought!

07:44.680 --> 07:47.190
We'll be leaving as soon as possible!

07:49.080 --> 07:52.220
<i>I slept so much in the afternoon 
that I'm wide awake now.</i>

07:52.220 --> 07:54.270
<i>Time for a midnight snack.</i>

07:55.450 --> 07:58.430
<i>It sucks that we have to leave tomorrow...</i>

08:01.360 --> 08:02.600
Is that Aqua?

08:02.600 --> 08:05.950
There aren't any guards... 
Maybe I'm being paranoid?

08:07.710 --> 08:10.730
Looks like the last day hit the jackpot!

08:10.730 --> 08:13.220
Thank you so much, Eris, goddess of luck!

08:14.090 --> 08:16.840
I just felt the weirdest presence.

08:16.840 --> 08:18.250
<i>Lurk.</i>

08:18.770 --> 08:20.680
I'm probably imagining things.

08:19.460 --> 08:21.290
Sneak, sneak, sneak...

08:20.680 --> 08:23.550
So, Detect Treasure says that 
what I'm looking for...

08:24.750 --> 08:26.600
should be over this way.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.860
Gotcha!

08:28.860 --> 08:31.650
Now, you infamous rogue, 
it's time to come along quietly!

08:31.650 --> 08:33.260
You picked the wrong mansion to rob!

08:33.260 --> 08:35.130
You're not dealing with 
some two-bit security!

08:35.130 --> 08:39.240
I've taken down Devil King generals!
You'd better not think you can escape!

08:38.020 --> 08:39.620
S-Stop it!

08:39.620 --> 08:41.620
Hang on, are you...

08:41.620 --> 08:44.740
Wait, where do I know that voice from?

08:44.740 --> 08:46.350
Is that you, Kazuma?

08:46.350 --> 08:49.010
And whoa, watch your hands, please!

08:49.490 --> 08:51.910
No, I'm just restraining a trespasser, see?

08:52.770 --> 08:54.510
It's me!

08:57.060 --> 08:59.650
So Chris is the noble thief 
that's the talk of the town.

08:59.650 --> 09:01.360
No one will ever wanna marry me now...

09:01.360 --> 09:04.150
What did you expect? 
I thought you were a thief!

09:04.150 --> 09:07.440
What are you even doing 
here in the first place?!

09:07.440 --> 09:10.200
What? Darkness is here, too?!

09:10.200 --> 09:14.110
That's bad! Really bad! 
She's gonna be so mad if she finds out!

09:14.110 --> 09:17.570
They probably won't kill 
you if you apologize.

09:17.570 --> 09:19.020
Just pay your debt to society.

09:19.020 --> 09:22.910
Hang on! You've got it all wrong! 
I'm doing this for a good reason!

09:27.130 --> 09:28.410
They're gone...

09:28.410 --> 09:31.850
I guess I'll have to tell 
you the whole truth.

09:32.910 --> 09:33.740
It all began with—

09:33.740 --> 09:34.900
Don't! I don't wanna hear it!

09:34.900 --> 09:35.540
Why not?!

09:35.540 --> 09:38.220
Because this is how I get dragged 
into trouble every single time!

09:38.220 --> 09:39.500
B-But...

09:39.500 --> 09:40.790
Whatever!

09:40.790 --> 09:43.590
Just get out of here before anyone comes! 
Your secret's safe with me!

09:43.590 --> 09:46.320
Yeah, but I was hoping you could help me...

09:46.320 --> 09:47.810
I do not want to hear it, okay?!

09:47.810 --> 09:49.340
Besides, think about it!

09:49.340 --> 09:52.750
You know the lord of this place 
is a nasty pervert, right?

09:52.750 --> 09:55.270
If he sees you caught, oh lordy...

09:55.970 --> 09:57.660
I think I heard something.

09:57.660 --> 10:01.520
I-I'll clear out for today, then! 
I can explain another time.

10:01.780 --> 10:03.220
Don't bother, please!

10:03.220 --> 10:07.540
Oh, and tie me up! 
That way I can say you escaped!

10:07.540 --> 10:09.790
O-Okay! Bind!

10:10.320 --> 10:11.560
See ya!

10:13.720 --> 10:15.540
Kazuma! Are you all right?

10:16.120 --> 10:17.630
Were you hit with Bind?!

10:17.630 --> 10:18.540
Where's the thief?

10:18.930 --> 10:22.290
I hate to say it, but they 
got away at the last second.

10:22.290 --> 10:25.550
I was so careless! 
Could you untie me, please?

10:25.820 --> 10:27.640
They've escaped, then...

10:27.640 --> 10:30.430
Are you hurt? What was the thief like?

10:30.430 --> 10:34.320
Uh... I think it was a guy 
in a weird-looking mask?

10:34.320 --> 10:37.810
He might've been way tougher than 
a Devil King general, even.

10:37.810 --> 10:40.690
Th-The foe was that fearsome?

10:40.690 --> 10:45.700
Incidentally, Kazuma, you look snug as a bug 
in a rug. Can you even move right now?

10:45.700 --> 10:49.990
That should be obvious! 
I nearly had the guy, but...

10:49.990 --> 10:52.320
Just hurry up and untie me. 
This is uncomfortable.

10:54.740 --> 10:56.060
Y'know, Kazuma...

10:56.060 --> 11:00.290
This might not be a great time, 
but I owe you an apology.

11:00.730 --> 11:02.470
Why? What for?

11:02.820 --> 11:08.520
Well... you know how you never came back 
after getting taken to the castle?

11:08.520 --> 11:10.130
Huh? Yeah...

11:10.130 --> 11:13.990
I started digging around in 
your room because I was bored.

11:14.290 --> 11:17.720
And I found this doll-looking 
thing you had apparently made...

11:17.720 --> 11:19.230
which broke after I messed with it.

11:19.230 --> 11:20.970
You little—

11:20.970 --> 11:22.690
I-It's fine! Don't worry about it.

11:22.690 --> 11:25.110
I can always put it back together. 
Now, if you'd untie me...

11:25.110 --> 11:27.030
You forgive me?!

11:27.030 --> 11:29.550
In that case, I might as well clear 
the air while I've got the chance.

11:29.550 --> 11:30.940
At the time,

11:30.940 --> 11:33.140
I figured it'd be fine 
since you weren't around,

11:33.140 --> 11:34.700
so I started drinking in your room.

11:34.700 --> 11:37.700
Y'know how cleaning up the snack 
leftovers and empty bottles is a pain

11:37.700 --> 11:39.610
when you drink in your own room?

11:39.610 --> 11:43.680
Anyway, I was pretty hammered, 
and I broke a bunch of other stuff, too.

11:44.880 --> 11:46.060
Sorry!

11:46.510 --> 11:48.520
<i>I wanna smack her head off her shoulders!</i>

11:48.520 --> 11:51.400
D-Don't sweat it! 
We're good pals, aren't we?

11:51.400 --> 11:53.210
And it's my fault for not coming home!

11:53.210 --> 11:56.000
Now, if you could just untie me...

11:57.140 --> 12:01.870
You know, Aqua has a point 
about this situation.

12:01.870 --> 12:04.910
I believe we're in for quite a lot of fun.

12:06.640 --> 12:08.880
What's going on here?!

12:09.800 --> 12:12.060
Help!

12:11.270 --> 12:15.100
Go on, say it! Say how sorry you are 
for being a cocky bastard lately!

12:15.100 --> 12:18.340
Apologize for the endless 
grief you've put me through!

12:18.340 --> 12:20.640
"I'm sorry for humiliating you!" Say it!

12:20.640 --> 12:24.470
I'm sorry! I'm sorry for causing trouble!

12:24.470 --> 12:27.880
I want to hear you say it again, Kazuma!

12:27.880 --> 12:30.370
You remember what you said!

12:30.370 --> 12:31.520
How many points was it?

12:31.520 --> 12:33.490
How many points does my Explosion magic get?

12:33.490 --> 12:34.200
Please stop!

12:34.200 --> 12:36.300
That stuff is memorable 
because it's only ever said once!

12:36.300 --> 12:37.820
No, go on, say it!

12:37.820 --> 12:40.700
Don't be shy! Let's hear it!

12:39.990 --> 12:42.020
It's too embarrassing!

12:42.830 --> 12:45.310
Just let me go, please!

12:42.830 --> 12:46.040
I had no idea turning the 
tables could be so much fun!

12:45.310 --> 12:46.710
Someone!

12:51.280 --> 12:52.840
I see.

12:52.840 --> 12:56.820
Despite all your confident 
claims, you failed...

12:56.820 --> 13:01.220
And the thief wore a mask 
and was very formidable?

13:01.220 --> 13:05.730
R-Right! I'm not sure I'd call 
it a total failure, though!

13:05.730 --> 13:09.350
If I hadn't been there, who's to say what 
would've happened to old man Alderp?

13:09.350 --> 13:10.790
In the end, he was worthless.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.230
A worthless adventurer.

13:15.180 --> 13:19.160
Given that this is coming from Sir Kazuma, 
who has battled the Devil King's generals,

13:19.160 --> 13:22.950
I'm certain this thief must've 
been quite the threat indeed.

13:22.950 --> 13:24.830
Wait, Kazuma—

13:28.450 --> 13:32.900
Well... in any event, 
thank you for your service.

13:32.900 --> 13:35.880
You did not fail to apprehend the thief,

13:35.880 --> 13:38.790
but successfully prevented 
him from stealing anything.

13:39.200 --> 13:42.710
You've done nothing to earn any derision.

13:45.530 --> 13:48.780
You should be grateful for 
Princess Iris's mercy.

13:48.780 --> 13:52.300
That said, there is no reason for 
you to remain in the castle.

13:52.300 --> 13:53.980
Now, take your leave.

14:00.680 --> 14:04.520
The bubbly around the capital 
doesn't live up to the hype...

14:04.520 --> 14:06.080
Souvenir shopping, huh?

14:06.080 --> 14:09.780
You are seriously insensitive. 
I'm kinda depressed here.

14:09.780 --> 14:12.130
It's not like we have anything 
else to do today, right?

14:12.130 --> 14:13.280
You little...

14:13.280 --> 14:18.700
Michael from Axel has way better 
stuff in his store, to be honest.

14:18.700 --> 14:20.800
Who the hell is Michael?

14:20.800 --> 14:24.210
Man, you've really turned into a 
social butterfly back home, huh?

14:24.640 --> 14:26.760
Some dude came by the mansion the other day

14:26.760 --> 14:30.350
and left a bunch of expensive meat 
as thanks for your healing him.

14:31.140 --> 14:33.460
Wait. I hadn't heard about this before.

14:33.460 --> 14:36.230
And I don't remember getting any meat!

14:36.230 --> 14:39.140
Yeah, because I had Darkness 
cook it and we ate—

14:39.140 --> 14:42.290
Excuse me?! And I didn't get a single bite?!

14:39.140 --> 14:43.490
Ow, ow, ow! What the hell?! Let go, you—

14:42.290 --> 14:45.610
Oh, Aqua-sama, what a coincidence 
running into you here!

14:50.270 --> 14:51.120
Who are you?

14:51.120 --> 14:54.420
You still have a wonderful 
sense of humor, Aqua-sama.

14:54.420 --> 14:57.360
Okay, this guy is being weirdly familiar...

14:57.360 --> 15:02.650
U-Uh, it's me. The Sword Master 
you granted the cursed sword to.

15:02.650 --> 15:04.780
It's Katsuragi-san! Remember 
him, from a while back?

15:04.780 --> 15:06.620
Who's Katsuragi?! I'm <i>Mitsurugi</i>!

15:06.620 --> 15:08.140
It's Mitsurugi!

15:09.000 --> 15:11.010
I guess Mitsurugi isn't enough of a clue.

15:11.010 --> 15:13.290
He's got the cursed sword. 
The cursed sword, remember?

15:13.950 --> 15:16.770
You didn't actually forget my name, did you?

15:16.770 --> 15:19.670
How about you say the whole 
thing, just to make sure?

15:19.670 --> 15:22.870
We're not really close enough 
to be on a given-name basis.

15:22.870 --> 15:27.150
It's Kyouya! Just admit it if you've 
forgotten! Mitsurugi Kyouya!

15:28.580 --> 15:32.120
No matter. More importantly, Aqua-sama...

15:33.280 --> 15:36.510
I'd like to express my 
gratitude for our reunion.

15:37.090 --> 15:38.950
What? For me?

15:40.520 --> 15:43.230
It's just something I picked 
up during my travels.

15:43.630 --> 15:46.420
I'm not sure if you'll like it...

15:46.830 --> 15:49.930
<i>Oh, he's such a gentleman. 
Such a hot, gentlemanly move!</i>

15:49.930 --> 15:51.300
<i>Pisses me off!</i>

15:53.500 --> 15:55.920
Looks like it's too small.

15:59.420 --> 16:01.590
Yeah, sorry, could I get 
three glasses of bubbly?

15:59.640 --> 16:01.940
<b>KONOSUBA</b>

16:07.180 --> 16:08.420
Wake up.

16:10.330 --> 16:12.240
Come on, wake up.

16:16.180 --> 16:17.240
Come on, Kazu—

16:17.240 --> 16:18.700
Intruder!

16:19.230 --> 16:20.600
It's just me, okay?!

16:20.600 --> 16:25.290
Cut it out! Don't touch me there! 
Darkness! Darkness, help!

16:25.080 --> 16:26.340
<b>KONOSUBA</b>

16:25.290 --> 16:26.330
Oh, it's you, Chris.

16:26.590 --> 16:27.830
Yes, it is!

16:28.340 --> 16:32.220
Be honest! Did you jump on on 
the intruder knowing it was me?

16:32.220 --> 16:34.180
You roll up in a guy's room for a booty call,

16:34.180 --> 16:37.170
and then scream when you get 
touched? Is this a honey trap?

16:37.170 --> 16:39.680
It was neither a booty call nor a honey trap!

16:39.680 --> 16:43.090
I told you I was gonna come by and explain!

16:43.240 --> 16:47.100
Hey! Hang on! You there! 
Don't pretend you can't hear me!

16:47.480 --> 16:49.910
I told you, I don't wanna hear it!

16:49.910 --> 16:53.230
You should come back later! 
Like, next year, specifically!

16:53.230 --> 16:55.200
This needs to be handled <i>now</i>!

16:55.200 --> 16:56.760
Come on, hear me out! Please?

16:56.760 --> 16:59.940
Please, please, please, please, please....

16:59.280 --> 17:01.330
Fine, damn it! What is it?!

17:01.330 --> 17:06.670
I've been gathering these incredibly 
powerful rare items known as Divine Treasures.

17:06.670 --> 17:08.130
Divine Treasures?

17:08.360 --> 17:10.400
That already sounds like trouble. 
Can we stop now?

17:10.400 --> 17:14.510
No! Now, these items are generally only 
given to adventurers with dark hair,

17:14.510 --> 17:16.910
dark eyes, and funny-sounding names.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.570
Weird ones like yours.

17:18.570 --> 17:19.900
Don't call my name weird.

17:19.900 --> 17:22.040
<i>Wait, is she talking about the cheat items</i>

17:22.040 --> 17:24.590
<i>that reincarnations get 
when they first show up here?</i>

17:24.590 --> 17:26.550
<i>That's what Chris is looking for?</i>

17:26.550 --> 17:30.610
They all have different effects. 
Some can do a lot of damage,

17:30.610 --> 17:33.200
some can bring incredible wealth...

17:33.570 --> 17:34.670
Wealth?

17:42.900 --> 17:49.470
That was you?!

17:44.080 --> 17:47.450
Look, I'm sorry! But they're really dangerous!

17:47.450 --> 17:49.470
They need to be collected!

17:49.470 --> 17:51.020
By who? For what reason?

17:51.020 --> 17:52.170
Well, I...

17:52.490 --> 17:55.560
My client says I can't share the details.

17:55.560 --> 17:56.930
I don't care, then!

17:57.540 --> 17:59.090
But this is the important part!

17:59.090 --> 18:02.860
I can sense the presence of an incredible 
treasure coming from the castle!

18:02.860 --> 18:05.890
That sounds like the most obvious 
thing you could've said!

18:05.890 --> 18:08.470
True, which is why I wanted 
to ask for your help...

18:08.470 --> 18:11.930
Here it comes! Nope! I am through 
getting mixed up in bad news!

18:11.930 --> 18:14.360
You have the Night Vision skill, right?

18:14.360 --> 18:18.460
Along with Lurk and Enemy Detection? 
Could you use those to help me?

18:18.460 --> 18:21.410
Quit trying to turn me into a criminal!

18:21.410 --> 18:24.770
Man, I was right about all of this! 
No way am I helping!

18:24.770 --> 18:27.710
Come on, don't be like that, you meanie!

18:27.710 --> 18:30.140
Get out! Get out of here right now!

18:30.140 --> 18:34.710
Or else I'll use that Bind skill I learned from 
you before harassing you in a sexual fashion!

18:35.770 --> 18:37.350
I'm gonna head back for now.

18:37.620 --> 18:39.710
We can talk more tomorrow.

18:39.710 --> 18:42.470
I said no! Biiii...

18:43.070 --> 18:45.940
I'll let you off for now!

18:49.010 --> 18:50.100
Damn it.

18:51.750 --> 18:53.940
I wish I could catch a break.

18:54.980 --> 18:57.900
Ugh, Eris-sama...

18:57.900 --> 19:01.660
I'll convert to your church 
when I get back to Axel,

19:01.660 --> 19:05.300
so please grant me peace and quiet...

19:16.170 --> 19:19.340
<i>Devil King Army alert! Devil King Army alert!</i>

19:19.340 --> 19:21.490
<i>A force believed to belong to the 
Devil King's army has deployed</i>

19:21.490 --> 19:24.990
<i>to the field near the capital! 
All knights are to ready for action!</i>

19:24.990 --> 19:28.170
<i>Any high-level adventurers in the 
castle are requested to assist!</i>

19:28.420 --> 19:31.260
Kazuma! There's trouble! 
Get your gear together, quickly!

19:31.550 --> 19:32.770
I'm asleep.

19:32.770 --> 19:36.220
This is no time for jokes! 
The Devil King's army is here!

19:36.220 --> 19:38.020
We need to join the response!

19:38.020 --> 19:39.890
Sounds like you're the one joking!

19:39.890 --> 19:44.110
You heard the announcement, right?! 
"High-level," she said!

19:44.110 --> 19:45.890
Calling me "mid" would be 
a compliment, frankly!

19:45.890 --> 19:48.750
Isn't this city supposed to be 
crawling with badass adventurers?!

19:48.750 --> 19:50.680
They can handle it without us!

19:50.680 --> 19:52.330
You can be such a coward!

19:52.330 --> 19:55.630
Whatever! I'm taking Aqua 
and Megumin and going!

19:55.630 --> 19:58.350
Why don't you cower in bed, 
you low-level adventurer?!

20:02.730 --> 20:07.680
No! That sounds dangerous! 
Why do I have to go?!

20:07.680 --> 20:10.250
I just came to the capital to play around!

20:10.250 --> 20:13.370
I am not going to battle against 
the Devil King's army!

20:12.580 --> 20:14.720
Stop being so selfish, Aqua!

20:14.720 --> 20:17.690
You can never have too many healers!

20:17.690 --> 20:20.360
Look at Megumin! She's absolutely raring to go!

20:20.360 --> 20:23.870
Darkness, I'm going on ahead to 
confront the Devil King's forces.

20:23.870 --> 20:27.470
If the battle starts and different 
factions become tangled up in a melee,

20:27.470 --> 20:29.710
I won't be able to use my magic!

20:29.710 --> 20:31.840
The first strike belongs to me!

20:31.840 --> 20:36.500
More likely, my powered-up magic will 
both begin and end the battle at once!

20:36.750 --> 20:38.740
Wait, Megumin! Don't be reckless!

20:38.740 --> 20:40.810
And Aqua, just give up already!

20:40.810 --> 20:44.370
Oh, come on, Kazuma! I need your help!

20:43.760 --> 20:46.690
Oh, would you all shut up for one second?!

20:46.690 --> 20:50.250
There's no reason for us to butt in on a 
dangerous battle and risk our necks...

20:51.520 --> 20:53.200
<i>Wait. Hang on.</i>

20:53.600 --> 20:56.880
<i>If I'm able to show off a bit 
in a situation like this,</i>

20:56.880 --> 20:59.120
<i>I might be able to return to the castle.</i>

20:59.440 --> 21:03.100
<i>I mean, there's already a bunch of 
cheat-empowered adventurers in the capital!</i>

21:03.410 --> 21:05.870
<i>That makes it unlikely the bad guys will win.</i>

21:05.870 --> 21:10.860
<i>And it's not like I need to single-handedly 
wipe the floor with the Devil King's guys.</i>

21:11.140 --> 21:15.130
<i>As long as I put on a decent 
enough show, that should do it!</i>

21:15.130 --> 21:16.990
Stop, Darkness!

21:16.990 --> 21:20.390
I have a bad feeling about this! 
Goddess's intuition!

21:20.390 --> 21:23.950
You can have one of my breakfast sausages, 
so let's put this on hold until tomorrow!

21:23.950 --> 21:26.730
When the royal army arrives 
at the battlefield,

21:26.730 --> 21:29.720
they will see the smoldering 
remains of the Devil King's army,

21:29.720 --> 21:31.680
and a wizard taking her well-earned leave...

21:31.680 --> 21:35.530
That's what I wanna do! And now's my chance!

21:35.530 --> 21:36.890
Let me go!

21:36.890 --> 21:40.640
Kazuma, I can't handle them both! 
Do something about these two!

21:43.170 --> 21:46.410
Ladies. The kingdom's in danger. 
What're you doing?

21:48.020 --> 21:52.540
Off we go! Now it's our turn!

21:54.500 --> 21:58.220
No!

23:30.050 --> 23:40.050
Strike! Striiiiiiiike!!
 Howdy! The weather's great over here. It's me, Verdia!
 Y'know, no matter how many times I shout here in the afterlife,
no one shows up! Not that I mind. The guys from the Devil King
Army do good enough work. Although we do have our fair share
of traitors (laughs). ...Leaving the front lines to open up a magic
item store. I'm sure she had her reasons for making a decision like that.
Treacherous as they may be. Hahahahaha! Not that it matters anymore!
 Now then, Devil King, I wish you good health. Strike! Striiiiiiiike!!
