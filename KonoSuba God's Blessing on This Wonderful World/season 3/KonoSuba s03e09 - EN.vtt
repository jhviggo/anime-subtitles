00:00.800 --> 00:03.840
Hey, why you stayed out all night?

00:03.840 --> 00:05.100
Yeah.

00:05.100 --> 00:06.600
You even left this kind of letter!

00:06.610 --> 00:09.310
We absolutely disagree!

00:09.310 --> 00:12.010
Darkness, Darkness!

00:12.010 --> 00:13.110
- Please go back.
- Darkness!

00:13.110 --> 00:18.200
- The young lady says
she is not going to see anyone.
- Darkness!

00:18.700 --> 00:22.500
This thing came loose from your pocket.

00:23.100 --> 00:26.000
That's right, as long as you let us in…

00:26.000 --> 00:28.390
I-I don't need this!

00:28.390 --> 00:29.820
What does it mean

00:29.820 --> 00:31.080
that you write this kind of letter?

00:31.080 --> 00:33.800
We want an explanation from you!

00:34.410 --> 00:37.300
Darkness, Darkness!

00:37.300 --> 00:39.010
- G-Guards!
- Darkness!

00:39.010 --> 00:41.310
- Quick, get the guards!
- Darkness!

00:43.100 --> 00:44.700
We will get lunch ready and wait for you!

00:44.700 --> 00:47.200
Come back before that!

01:01.010 --> 01:05.500
(God's Blessing on This Wonderful World!
Season 3)

02:17.000 --> 02:18.830
(Episode 9: Preaching to the Runaway Girl)
She's a pain in the ass.

02:18.830 --> 02:19.930
Don't care, don't care!

02:19.930 --> 02:20.820
I don't care about her anymore!

02:20.830 --> 02:22.620
Yes, you say that,

02:22.620 --> 02:25.310
but are not you still
making things for Darkness?

02:25.310 --> 02:27.300
That is not at all how it is.

02:27.300 --> 02:29.930
I only want to make my life easier
and scam a significant sum of money.

02:29.930 --> 02:31.130
All right, all right.

02:31.130 --> 02:32.000
Listen.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.430
The advice of the demon

02:33.430 --> 02:34.130
is generally not a good one.

02:34.130 --> 02:36.250
(Konosuba)
All I want to do is put off work!

02:42.310 --> 02:44.220
Hey, I'll give you pocket money.

02:44.220 --> 02:45.610
Can you please go back to the mansion?

02:46.300 --> 02:50.610
I should totally get to
pick a new team member.

02:54.720 --> 02:57.420
To actually ditch the buddies
who went through good times and bad,

02:57.420 --> 02:58.710
you are a devil.

02:58.710 --> 02:59.720
Devil.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.220
I am not.

03:01.220 --> 03:03.710
Darkness is the one who wants us
to pick a new team member.

03:05.620 --> 03:07.040
I see.

03:07.040 --> 03:10.120
All three of us have
zero stamina, like, at all!

03:10.120 --> 03:12.300
(Konosuba)
We need a shield role!

03:18.200 --> 03:19.810
I was just introducing myself.

03:19.810 --> 03:21.800
Don't reveal your cards!

03:22.200 --> 03:23.640
I'm Megumin,

03:24.000 --> 03:26.420
the top magician in Axel

03:26.420 --> 03:28.830
who controls explosion magic!

03:28.830 --> 03:30.630
In Axel,

03:30.630 --> 03:33.110
I go by the nickname
"crazy explosive girl"!

03:34.700 --> 03:36.710
Is she the one they are rumored about?

03:36.710 --> 03:37.710
I'm sorry!

03:37.720 --> 03:39.220
I can't handle this job!

03:39.220 --> 03:40.830
Please find someone else!

03:41.610 --> 03:43.810
I had a tough time
getting everyone interested,

03:43.810 --> 03:44.530
but look at what you have done!

03:44.930 --> 03:46.330
You screamed,

03:46.330 --> 03:48.930
and now everyone's too scared
to even look at us.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.530
Can't be helped.

03:53.010 --> 03:54.800
Let's just go back for today.

03:55.290 --> 03:56.820
You totally did that on purpose, right?

03:56.820 --> 03:57.620
You are keeping everyone away on purpose--

03:57.620 --> 03:59.130
Kazuma!

03:59.830 --> 04:01.620
What is up? You seem super flustered.

04:01.630 --> 04:04.130
Something bad happened,
can you help me out?

04:04.140 --> 04:06.330
This dude previously went off to attack
a water snake all by himself before,

04:06.330 --> 04:07.830
and now he is freaking out like this.

04:09.720 --> 04:11.220
It is like a pretty big deal.

04:11.220 --> 04:12.640
Megumin, I will be out for a sec.

04:12.640 --> 04:13.820
(Konosuba)

04:13.820 --> 04:16.320
Rin have a boyfriend?

04:16.320 --> 04:17.610
Yeah.

04:17.620 --> 04:19.820
I am really concerned
because my close friend

04:19.820 --> 04:21.140
has been tricked by some random guy.

04:21.140 --> 04:22.810
R-Right.

04:23.530 --> 04:26.620
You know, Rin has been so difficult
to get in touch with lately.

04:27.100 --> 04:27.950
It has been bothering me,

04:27.950 --> 04:29.320
so I ended up spending
the whole day following her.

04:29.320 --> 04:32.430
And guess what? I found out she went to
a motel with an unknown man.

04:32.930 --> 04:33.620
That's…

04:33.620 --> 04:34.430
That's stalk--

04:34.430 --> 04:36.130
I was just sorta worried about my buddy!

04:36.130 --> 04:37.830
Please, help me out!

04:39.110 --> 04:41.210
I don't think that's a good idea…

04:41.910 --> 04:42.700
Alright.

04:43.510 --> 04:45.030
You're so nice, Kazuma.

04:45.030 --> 04:46.030
Here, these are for you.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.230
Here it is.

04:48.230 --> 04:51.130
The jerk who tricked Rin is right here.

04:51.710 --> 04:53.810
So, you are not planning
on going in straight, huh?

04:53.810 --> 04:56.340
How long do you think
I have been an adventurer?

04:57.320 --> 04:59.020
If I do not watch my back and be smart,

04:59.020 --> 05:01.120
I will not make it
in this gig for much longer.

05:06.120 --> 05:07.920
The walls are super thin,
so we gotta be careful.

05:08.620 --> 05:09.330
That's…

05:09.330 --> 05:10.420
That's stalk--

05:10.820 --> 05:12.110
Miss Rin.

05:12.120 --> 05:14.830
Now that I have fallen for you,
there is nothing I can do.

05:14.830 --> 05:16.010
C-Calm down.

05:16.020 --> 05:18.620
How can a noble like you
fall for an adventurer?

05:20.430 --> 05:22.030
I understand that
our statuses may not align…

05:22.030 --> 05:22.920
But at least…

05:22.920 --> 05:26.520
At least let me take a photo
with this magic camera.

05:26.520 --> 05:27.640
Calm down.

05:27.640 --> 05:28.820
Please calm down!

05:28.820 --> 05:30.120
Keep your reason!

05:30.120 --> 05:31.510
I see.

05:31.520 --> 05:34.130
He knows they can't be together,

05:34.130 --> 05:36.430
so he hopes to at least snap a photo?

05:36.430 --> 05:38.330
He is not, like, a bad person or anything.

05:38.330 --> 05:41.010
I'd like to see something sensational.

05:41.020 --> 05:42.420
Like this! More sensational!

05:42.420 --> 05:44.230
He's a piece of shit!

05:45.030 --> 05:47.310
I am going to pummel him.

05:47.310 --> 05:49.010
Hey, wait, don't go!

05:49.010 --> 05:49.820
Calm down.

05:49.820 --> 05:51.720
Alright, just clean your heart first.

05:51.730 --> 05:53.920
Let's head downstairs
and grab a cup of tea.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.510
- Calm down, please!
- Please

05:55.510 --> 05:57.820
(Konosuba)
I'd like to see something sensational!

06:03.900 --> 06:05.290
Really?

06:06.040 --> 06:07.530
Unforgivable.

06:07.530 --> 06:08.510
This jerk!

06:08.510 --> 06:09.420
I am going to screw it up!

06:09.420 --> 06:11.010
Hey, if you mess up the room…

06:12.130 --> 06:13.620
Ouch.

06:17.720 --> 06:18.730
Kazuma.

06:18.730 --> 06:19.210
Yes?

06:19.210 --> 06:21.130
Just grab that camera over there
and snap a pic of me.

06:21.820 --> 06:24.620
I want to fill up all the photo film
with my nudity

06:24.620 --> 06:27.040
and leave him with some serious
long-term psychological scars.

06:32.900 --> 06:35.690
Don't you run away.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.210
(Konosuba)
Of course.

06:38.210 --> 06:39.430
Very good, Dust.

06:39.430 --> 06:40.720
That's right.

06:46.830 --> 06:50.530
So, how many pics did we actually snap?

06:52.440 --> 06:55.030
I stand on the table,
looking down at Dust,

06:55.530 --> 06:57.330
and roll around on the ground,

06:57.330 --> 07:00.030
shooting him fiercely from all angles.

07:00.520 --> 07:01.430
Good!

07:01.430 --> 07:03.730
Now, give it a cool vibe.

07:03.740 --> 07:05.420
Spread your legs. Squat low.

07:05.420 --> 07:07.500
Yes, that's right.

07:09.020 --> 07:10.620
Go on!

07:25.100 --> 07:26.810
So, what are you doing?

07:27.900 --> 07:29.190
Sorry.

07:30.220 --> 07:32.420
I totally got hooked on taking photos.

07:33.610 --> 07:35.620
You had me freaking out for no reason.

07:36.100 --> 07:38.410
Feel free to handle that jerk.

07:39.520 --> 07:40.320
Okay, Kazuma.

07:40.320 --> 07:41.130
Let's go.

07:41.130 --> 07:43.430
Nah, letting them both
stay together is kinda…

07:43.430 --> 07:44.430
Enough, hurry up.

07:49.690 --> 07:52.390
I was not expecting to see you in my room.

07:53.010 --> 07:54.620
What? Got any issues with that?

07:55.330 --> 07:56.130
Right.

07:56.130 --> 07:58.830
How about we have a candid and
honest conversation, just between us guys?

08:01.120 --> 08:02.630
Be prepared.

08:03.930 --> 08:05.220
Hey, Rin.

08:05.220 --> 08:06.830
We should probably stop them.

08:06.830 --> 08:08.030
At this rate…

08:08.030 --> 08:09.620
I have put in a lot of effort, you know.

08:09.620 --> 08:11.620
Yeah, a lot.

08:12.230 --> 08:14.620
But he showed up in the room
dressed that way in the end.

08:14.620 --> 08:16.930
It is like a fool just walking right
into the trap, ya know?

08:16.930 --> 08:18.720
I could not even save him, man.

08:22.020 --> 08:24.020
I am really touched.

08:24.020 --> 08:26.320
I never saw it coming…

08:26.320 --> 08:27.140
You would be completely wrong

08:27.150 --> 08:27.830
if you assumed that

08:27.830 --> 08:28.940
I would be scared just
because you are a noble.

08:29.620 --> 08:32.930
I gotta say, I am pretty used to dealing
with royal families and nobles.

08:33.510 --> 08:34.430
Used to…

08:35.120 --> 08:37.120
So there really is a god.

08:37.820 --> 08:40.330
I am glad I joined the order.

08:41.030 --> 08:42.040
Listen.

08:42.040 --> 08:43.910
There are two men here.

08:43.920 --> 08:45.460
Nothing more than that!

08:45.460 --> 08:46.420
Wha--

08:46.420 --> 08:48.220
Forget about the status.

08:49.830 --> 08:52.220
Today is so freaking awesome!

08:52.220 --> 08:54.030
I appreciate you very much,

08:54.030 --> 08:56.030
Lady Aqua.

08:58.930 --> 09:00.030
Actually,

09:00.030 --> 09:02.140
that noble dude is into Dust.

09:02.850 --> 09:04.690
What'd you just say?

09:04.690 --> 09:05.940
That noble

09:05.940 --> 09:08.220
told me he likes Dust,

09:08.220 --> 09:09.520
and he came to talk to me about it.

09:10.220 --> 09:13.510
I politely told him that
there is probably no chance,

09:13.510 --> 09:16.340
but he said he hopes
to get a photo of Dust, at least.

09:16.340 --> 09:18.820
So this means, Dust…

09:30.000 --> 09:31.600
Today, nothing went down.

09:32.120 --> 09:33.530
R-Right.

09:34.090 --> 09:35.880
Speaking of nobles…

09:35.880 --> 09:36.680
Stop it!

09:36.680 --> 09:38.280
I am so over this whole nobles thing!

09:38.280 --> 09:39.490
No, no, it's not that.

09:39.490 --> 09:41.090
I'm talking about Lalatina.

09:41.090 --> 09:42.190
Darkness?

09:42.890 --> 09:44.790
Everyone is buzzing about it -

09:45.290 --> 09:46.990
the young lady from the Dustiness family

09:46.990 --> 09:49.490
is about to tie the knot with Aldarp.

09:50.570 --> 09:51.480
Huh?

09:55.180 --> 09:56.900
Tell me more.

09:58.510 --> 09:59.520
Marriage?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.630
This is really annoying.

10:01.630 --> 10:03.820
Then it will totally match up
with the demon's fortune-telling.

10:04.330 --> 10:06.220
Do you really believe it?

10:06.820 --> 10:09.820
I think Vanir talks about
a lot of stuff in a vague way,

10:09.820 --> 10:11.520
but anything about that lord

10:11.520 --> 10:14.520
is a whole different story.

10:15.110 --> 10:17.610
We gotta track down Darkness
and ask for some clarification!

10:17.620 --> 10:19.210
Right, right?

10:20.610 --> 10:22.250
Really!

10:22.250 --> 10:24.320
That guy has been a real pain
in the butt since forever.

10:24.320 --> 10:26.320
Since Rin told us about this,

10:26.320 --> 10:28.120
I don't have any other option.

10:28.120 --> 10:29.830
Don't have any other option.

10:31.530 --> 10:33.020
So, Aqua, I am counting on you.

10:33.520 --> 10:34.530
Leave it to me.

10:35.020 --> 10:35.920
Powered.

10:35.920 --> 10:37.210
Speed Gain.

10:37.210 --> 10:38.720
Resist Magic.

10:38.720 --> 10:40.620
Versatile Entertainer.

10:42.110 --> 10:43.220
What's the last one for?

10:43.720 --> 10:45.610
Magic that transforms one
into a master of talents.

10:45.610 --> 10:48.410
It hurts!

10:48.410 --> 10:50.930
- Are you going by yourself?
- Don't pull so hard, okay?

10:50.930 --> 10:53.320
- Since I have got this lurk skill,
- Ouch!

10:53.320 --> 10:54.730
it would be way easier for me
to succeed if I went alone.

10:54.730 --> 10:56.730
Just wait for me in the mansion.

10:57.220 --> 10:58.220
You must do a good job.

10:58.930 --> 11:00.020
I'll be back shortly.

11:02.420 --> 11:04.020
That's strange.

11:04.020 --> 11:06.610
Nothing is going on, Norris.

11:06.620 --> 11:08.120
Hey, let us head to the kitchen downstairs

11:08.130 --> 11:09.400
and fix us a late-night snack.

11:09.400 --> 11:12.910
I think I heard something.

11:13.510 --> 11:14.830
Alright.

11:15.610 --> 11:17.120
Where's Darkness?

11:18.500 --> 11:20.210
That's right, the kitchen…

11:20.210 --> 11:22.710
If Darkness orders a late-night snack,

11:22.710 --> 11:25.130
I could just go to her room
with the delivered meal.

11:25.720 --> 11:27.010
It does not really seem doable.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.430
I wish I could imitate voices…

11:33.920 --> 11:35.720
My name is Norris.

11:37.310 --> 11:38.710
I was just trying.

11:38.710 --> 11:40.810
Can a master of talents truly
accomplish something like this?

11:40.810 --> 11:42.420
Mr. Kazuma is amazing.

11:42.420 --> 11:44.320
Hold me.

11:44.320 --> 11:45.810
This is so useful.

11:45.810 --> 11:47.110
This is extremely useful.

11:47.120 --> 11:49.110
Once I am back, I gotta say sorry to Aqua.

11:53.610 --> 11:55.300
I have got some food for you.

11:56.120 --> 11:57.320
I don't think I ordered anything.

11:58.400 --> 12:00.100
But Mr. Norris said…

12:00.920 --> 12:02.010
Sorry.

12:02.020 --> 12:03.210
Just give me a break, okay?

12:03.710 --> 12:04.920
Sorry.

12:08.520 --> 12:09.520
Young lady.

12:09.520 --> 12:12.510
A man named Kazuma Satou
is coming in the middle of the night…

12:12.510 --> 12:14.330
I already told you,
no need to tell me these.

12:16.420 --> 12:18.230
He actually comes at this hour.

12:19.100 --> 12:20.030
Geez.

12:20.810 --> 12:21.720
Geez.

12:22.230 --> 12:23.820
But, young lady,

12:23.820 --> 12:25.430
that Kazuma man told me

12:25.430 --> 12:26.720
that if I do not tell you,

12:26.730 --> 12:28.120
he will tell everyone in the guild

12:28.130 --> 12:31.820
your embarrassing secret.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.120
That guy really is…

12:34.720 --> 12:36.320
Tell him to do as he likes.

12:36.830 --> 12:39.120
I am not going to go to
the guild again, anyway.

12:39.120 --> 12:40.620
But, young lady,

12:40.620 --> 12:41.920
that guy told me

12:41.920 --> 12:45.810
that you have abs now,

12:45.810 --> 12:46.920
and that made him uneasy.

12:46.920 --> 12:49.600
He thinks you should eat less protein.

12:49.610 --> 12:50.380
Wha…

12:50.910 --> 12:52.810
He also said you would
put on a cute dress,

12:52.810 --> 12:54.510
look at yourself in the mirror,

12:54.510 --> 12:56.210
and then laugh to yourself.

12:56.210 --> 12:59.110
He wants us to get you such cute clothes.

12:59.110 --> 13:01.020
T-Those are lies.

13:01.020 --> 13:02.520
Don't let him fool you.

13:02.520 --> 13:06.210
But he said something
even more mind-blowing.

13:06.210 --> 13:07.220
Can I say it?

13:08.820 --> 13:09.930
Let's hear it.

13:10.710 --> 13:14.320
You can't hold on
your curvy body all the time,

13:14.320 --> 13:15.230
every night…

13:18.320 --> 13:20.330
Break in!

13:22.020 --> 13:23.840
I have been boosted by some support magic,

13:23.840 --> 13:26.420
so I will not easily
lose to your strength.

13:33.120 --> 13:34.710
D-Don't get me wrong.

13:34.710 --> 13:36.820
I just want to ask some questions.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.030
Hey!

13:40.030 --> 13:41.920
Don't close your eyes
like you are giving up!

13:41.920 --> 13:42.630
Don't close your eyes.

13:42.630 --> 13:43.630
Don't close your eyes!

13:44.020 --> 13:44.720
Listen.

13:44.720 --> 13:45.770
I'm letting go of you now.

13:45.770 --> 13:47.020
Don't scream, okay?

13:52.820 --> 13:53.710
Okay.

13:53.710 --> 13:55.120
Then, I'm going to let go.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.510
Thief!

13:59.710 --> 14:01.410
You set me up!

14:01.410 --> 14:03.120
Ugh, I have been way too careless!

14:03.120 --> 14:04.620
L-Lady Lalatina!

14:05.210 --> 14:06.620
How dare you set me up?

14:09.210 --> 14:10.320
What happened?

14:10.320 --> 14:11.380
I'll open the door right away!

14:11.380 --> 14:12.420
Don't!

14:12.420 --> 14:15.110
I can't be seen in this outfit right now.

14:15.110 --> 14:17.010
I was playing this really intense game

14:17.020 --> 14:19.320
and I couldn't help but scream
because it was so exciting!

14:20.320 --> 14:22.510
Is it really late at night to play games?

14:22.520 --> 14:24.510
It is a game that adults
can play by themselves.

14:24.510 --> 14:26.110
Please, don't make me say it.
It is really embarrassing.

14:27.320 --> 14:28.820
Y-Young lady.

14:28.820 --> 14:30.320
- What?
- Seriously?

14:30.320 --> 14:31.830
So, you are saying you want to
make sure I am safe,

14:31.830 --> 14:33.820
but you are actually interested
in seeing my less refined side, huh?

14:33.820 --> 14:35.220
You are quite the pervert!

14:36.420 --> 14:37.710
What's wrong with you?

14:38.410 --> 14:39.310
I-It's nothing!

14:39.310 --> 14:42.120
I totally forgot to turn off
that erotic, magical toy!

14:42.120 --> 14:44.360
I-It's going to break!

14:45.420 --> 14:47.910
Things are about to get really weird!

14:47.910 --> 14:50.330
If this keeps going like this,
it is going to break!

14:50.330 --> 14:52.000
S-Sorry to interrupt!

15:00.210 --> 15:01.720
Geez.

15:01.720 --> 15:03.710
From tomorrow on, people at home

15:03.710 --> 15:05.520
will start calling me
a perverted young lady.

15:07.220 --> 15:09.520
You just thought that might
not be a bad idea, right?

15:09.520 --> 15:10.520
(Konosuba)
Not that I thought.

15:10.520 --> 15:11.810
That is exactly what you thought.

15:13.220 --> 15:14.410
In debt?

15:14.410 --> 15:15.420
That's right.

15:15.930 --> 15:18.930
So basically, the nobleman's daughter
has to marry the person who lent us money.

15:19.410 --> 15:20.820
That is all there is to it.

15:23.420 --> 15:25.620
You are familiar with my interests
and hobbies, aren't you?

15:27.110 --> 15:28.520
I guess the guy will be
starving and thirsty,

15:28.520 --> 15:31.020
craving my body.

15:31.020 --> 15:32.220
It's really exciting.

15:33.420 --> 15:34.530
Idiot.

15:35.720 --> 15:39.720
Why do you look so lonely,
if that is the case?

15:41.220 --> 15:43.820
That's why you are hoping we can
take on the water snake on our own?

15:44.820 --> 15:46.110
I ended up getting a bunch of people

15:46.120 --> 15:47.620
involved and interfering.

15:50.120 --> 15:51.610
How much is the debt?

15:52.120 --> 15:53.120
For the insufficient money…

15:53.120 --> 15:55.030
Don't say you're going to pay, Kazuma.

15:55.620 --> 15:56.910
I am a noble.

15:57.530 --> 15:59.510
How can I allow the regular folks,
whom I am supposed to look out for,

15:59.520 --> 16:01.420
to use the money they earn
from their hard work

16:01.420 --> 16:03.220
to pay off my debt?

16:04.110 --> 16:05.710
If that is the situation,
I would rather just sell myself.

16:20.520 --> 16:21.610
I would rather have

16:22.310 --> 16:25.720
my body taken away by that lord.

16:32.030 --> 16:33.820
Hey, Kazuma.

16:33.820 --> 16:34.520
Yes?

16:35.010 --> 16:37.830
How about we…

16:39.830 --> 16:41.020
Darkness…

16:43.220 --> 16:44.330
You…

16:47.710 --> 16:49.620
You really do have abs.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.420
(Konosuba)

16:52.420 --> 16:54.500
Sorry, it's my fault!

16:54.500 --> 16:56.420
I really can't handle this atmosphere!

16:56.420 --> 16:58.920
There are definitely times
when I get really angry.

16:58.920 --> 17:00.830
How dare you do this to a woman
who's made up her mind…

17:00.830 --> 17:02.210
I'm going to kill you!

17:03.420 --> 17:04.510
What?

17:04.510 --> 17:06.210
You are really into me, huh?

17:06.210 --> 17:09.220
Just say it straight up, young lady!

17:09.220 --> 17:11.320
I will not like someone like you, dummy!

17:11.320 --> 17:12.710
It is so frustrating, you know?

17:12.710 --> 17:14.610
And stop calling me young lady!

17:14.620 --> 17:16.420
Young lady, I'm going to open the door!

17:16.420 --> 17:17.740
Don't!

17:17.740 --> 17:19.420
Lalatina is totally naked at the moment!

17:19.420 --> 17:21.420
- You can't look!
- Totally…

17:21.420 --> 17:22.950
My deepest apologies!

17:22.950 --> 17:26.010
Don't use my voice to say that!

17:26.010 --> 17:27.330
Hey, there's an intruder!

17:27.330 --> 17:29.450
He has got this skill
where he can imitate my voice.

17:29.450 --> 17:30.830
Yes, we'll go in right away!

17:30.830 --> 17:32.020
Damn it.

17:32.020 --> 17:33.210
Create Earth.

17:34.520 --> 17:35.820
Everyone, close your eyes!

17:35.820 --> 17:37.320
Wind Breath.

17:40.420 --> 17:42.060
(Konosuba)
Lurk.

17:42.620 --> 17:44.190
We must not allow him to get away!

17:44.190 --> 17:45.520
Kazuma!

17:45.520 --> 17:46.140
If you will only step out now

17:46.140 --> 17:48.320
and take ten full punches from me,
I will let you go.

17:48.320 --> 17:50.310
You better believe I will not

17:50.310 --> 17:52.920
give you much of a pass
if I track you down.

17:52.920 --> 17:55.030
This is bad. Things are looking bleak.

17:55.520 --> 17:56.420
Let's go back.

18:02.210 --> 18:03.110
Okay.

18:03.520 --> 18:05.020
All I have to do
is jump out of the window…

18:05.020 --> 18:07.120
Is anybody there?

18:10.610 --> 18:12.710
It's you.

18:13.820 --> 18:15.910
Why did you come here
in the middle of the night?

18:16.510 --> 18:18.210
W-Well.

18:18.710 --> 18:20.520
I see.

18:20.520 --> 18:23.630
It looks like my daughter
has found an amazing companion.

18:26.120 --> 18:28.510
A true confidant
of the kingdom, I must say.

18:28.510 --> 18:30.520
He totally gets why I came here.

18:31.520 --> 18:34.210
I'm sorry to be a bother
when you're not feeling well.

18:34.210 --> 18:36.430
Your daughter is really mad.

18:36.430 --> 18:38.020
Can you go and convince her?

18:38.420 --> 18:39.610
I see.

18:39.610 --> 18:42.010
My daughter has been feeling
really down lately,

18:42.010 --> 18:43.830
and now she is getting so angry.

18:44.630 --> 18:46.730
This is not funny at all.

18:47.820 --> 18:49.820
I heard you have debts.

18:50.410 --> 18:51.280
I honestly don't think

18:51.280 --> 18:54.120
you would borrow money
from someone like that.

18:56.520 --> 19:00.320
You are pretty smart, Kazuma, aren't you?

19:00.320 --> 19:03.720
I think I should trust you
with my daughter.

19:04.210 --> 19:05.120
What?

19:05.120 --> 19:06.320
I'm sorry.

19:06.320 --> 19:09.330
Can you just take her
and run away somewhere else?

19:09.930 --> 19:11.720
I was just asking you about the debt.

19:11.720 --> 19:14.020
Why are you suggesting
that I elope with your daughter?

19:14.620 --> 19:15.920
I refuse.

19:15.920 --> 19:17.820
I absolutely refuse.

19:17.820 --> 19:19.590
It's your daughter who is chasing me.

19:19.590 --> 19:21.120
That is why I have run away to this room.

19:23.710 --> 19:25.220
Kazuma.

19:26.220 --> 19:28.620
Can you please not ask why?

19:29.420 --> 19:30.330
Don't worry.

19:30.330 --> 19:32.720
I will just sell this mansion

19:32.720 --> 19:35.520
after you run away with my daughter…

19:36.820 --> 19:38.320
Are you feeling unwell?

19:39.000 --> 19:42.320
Our team has this amazing Arch Priest
who is really great at healing magic.

19:43.410 --> 19:47.030
No, healing magic can't cure illness,

19:47.030 --> 19:49.800
and it can't resurrect someone

19:49.800 --> 19:51.940
who has died from a disease, either.

19:52.340 --> 19:54.420
When someone gets sick, it's like
they are getting closer to their end.

19:54.420 --> 19:56.420
If you are nearing the end,

19:56.420 --> 19:58.820
don't expect a miracle from God.

20:01.520 --> 20:02.650
There is

20:03.110 --> 20:05.420
no need for that face.

20:09.620 --> 20:10.910
Kazuma!

20:10.910 --> 20:12.030
Come out!

20:12.030 --> 20:14.700
I will definitely make you
regret imitating my voice!

20:15.310 --> 20:16.540
This time I must…

20:16.540 --> 20:19.220
Okay? I am trusting you with her.

20:19.220 --> 20:20.510
I'm going to kill you!

20:20.510 --> 20:22.730
Oh, I really don't want that.

20:24.120 --> 20:25.510
Gotcha!

20:25.510 --> 20:27.510
So, how do you plan on compensating me?

20:27.510 --> 20:29.330
Hey, please be quiet!

20:29.330 --> 20:30.620
Shut up!

20:30.630 --> 20:32.120
The person I am worried about

20:32.120 --> 20:33.490
hurt my image so badly

20:33.500 --> 20:35.220
in such a short time.

20:35.220 --> 20:37.100
What I just said is totally true!

20:37.110 --> 20:38.920
How could it be true?

20:39.420 --> 20:40.900
Forget about the debt.

20:40.900 --> 20:42.430
Let's all run away together!

20:42.820 --> 20:44.620
Aqua and Megumin
will not sit on their hands

20:44.620 --> 20:46.910
if I return alone.

20:46.910 --> 20:49.720
Megumin might just blow up
the wedding ceremony too!

20:49.720 --> 20:51.210
Go ahead and give it a shot
if you are up for it!

20:51.220 --> 20:52.720
Everyone's going to
be sentenced to hanging!

20:52.720 --> 20:54.610
Make sure to look after them for me!

20:54.610 --> 20:57.330
You are such an inflexible
and stubborn woman!

21:00.410 --> 21:01.620
I won't run away.

21:02.120 --> 21:03.320
If I run away,

21:03.320 --> 21:04.930
someone is going to
get implicated for sure.

21:08.020 --> 21:09.830
Forget it, do as you please!

21:10.410 --> 21:11.360
If you need me to save you,

21:11.360 --> 21:13.600
just come over to the mansion,
say sorry, and tell me,

21:13.600 --> 21:16.820
"I need Lord Kazuma's rescue."

21:18.820 --> 21:20.430
So hard…

21:22.710 --> 21:24.620
A-Are you okay, Kazuma?

21:27.110 --> 21:28.620
You should be the one saying,

21:28.620 --> 21:31.020
"Sorry, and please save me."

21:31.020 --> 21:32.920
I can provide medical treatment.

21:34.120 --> 21:36.120
D-Damn it.

21:36.510 --> 21:38.190
I will not save you until you come

21:38.190 --> 21:40.330
to me crying and begging, no doubt!

21:40.330 --> 21:42.500
Idiot, idiot!

21:42.500 --> 21:43.440
It hurts!

21:43.440 --> 21:45.520
It doesn't hurt, idiot!

21:54.700 --> 21:56.410
Aqua!

21:56.410 --> 22:00.120
Heal me.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.010
(Episode 10: Wishes for the Stubborn Bride)

23:31.020 --> 23:33.410
I am Beldia,
a leader of the Devil King's army.

23:34.320 --> 23:36.200
On behalf of the entire Devil King's Army,

23:36.200 --> 23:37.810
I congratulate

23:38.520 --> 23:40.120
Lalatina Ford Dustiness.
