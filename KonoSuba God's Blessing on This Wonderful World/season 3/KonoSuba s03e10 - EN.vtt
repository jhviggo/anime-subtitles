00:00.990 --> 00:03.900
Lord Aldarp is going to have a wedding.

00:03.900 --> 00:05.400
What a joyous occasion.

00:05.400 --> 00:06.690
- Aldarp
- The lady over there and the little boy,

00:06.700 --> 00:08.600
- might be getting impatient.
- take one too.

00:08.600 --> 00:10.010
Skipped various steps

00:10.010 --> 00:12.000
and set the wedding date.

00:14.010 --> 00:16.500
Kazuma, this isn't the time to fight.

00:19.010 --> 00:21.190
She said this was her decision, right?

00:21.810 --> 00:23.570
Before she apologizes to me in tears,

00:23.570 --> 00:24.700
I won't do anything.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.390
I won't agree to this.

00:28.390 --> 00:30.510
If you go on like this to the big day,

00:30.510 --> 00:32.290
I'll have my own plans.

00:32.290 --> 00:35.910
Hey, don't do anything dangerous.

00:35.920 --> 00:37.510
Alright, give that back to me.

00:37.510 --> 00:39.920
I've been working on it all morning.

00:41.300 --> 00:43.510
What is this?

00:45.400 --> 00:46.800
It's for popping.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.300
Pop them one by one.

00:48.300 --> 00:49.810
It's an entertainment

00:49.810 --> 00:51.770
to keep you relaxed.

00:53.100 --> 00:54.420
Is that it?

00:55.310 --> 00:56.320
That's it.

01:15.500 --> 01:20.500
(God's Blessing on This Wonderful World!
Season 3)

02:32.990 --> 02:34.490
Hello?

02:34.490 --> 02:37.510
(Episode 10 Wishes for the Stubborn Bride)
I have come here

02:37.510 --> 02:40.390
to consult with Mr. Kazuma.

02:42.590 --> 02:44.660
Has Darkness finally given in?

02:44.660 --> 02:48.160
She's asking for my help…?

02:49.090 --> 02:51.290
To the Dustiness family.

02:51.290 --> 02:52.490
I've received news through connections

02:52.490 --> 02:54.690
that a senior member
of the Devil King's Army

02:54.690 --> 02:56.530
will carry out a terrorist attack

02:56.530 --> 02:59.080
at Axel's Eris Order.

02:59.600 --> 03:02.180
The attack is scheduled
on the wedding day.

03:02.190 --> 03:04.390
If the wedding is not
canceled immediately,

03:04.390 --> 03:09.290
the church will be blown away
by Explosion on that day.

03:09.290 --> 03:13.190
I hope you will heed my advice.

03:13.200 --> 03:15.170
With kind regards, the magician.

03:15.170 --> 03:16.890
I am very sorry!

03:16.890 --> 03:19.440
I will give that idiot a good scolding!

03:19.450 --> 03:20.700
(Konosuba)
Megumin!

03:20.700 --> 03:22.680
I have something to say to you. Come out!

03:23.770 --> 03:26.800
The days without Darkness
passed by just like that.

03:27.590 --> 03:29.780
I've decided to leave it be.

03:29.780 --> 03:31.460
As for the two of them…

03:31.460 --> 03:34.790
Look, out of this tiny pouch,

03:34.790 --> 03:37.190
a Beginner's Bane will emerge.

03:37.190 --> 03:38.890
Don't let it out!

03:38.900 --> 03:40.390
Hey, what are you doing?

03:40.400 --> 03:41.490
Let me go.

03:41.490 --> 03:42.990
So many people are gathered here

03:43.000 --> 03:45.180
to watch my performance!

03:45.180 --> 03:47.130
That's why I was called here.

03:47.140 --> 03:48.350
What you're doing
at someone else's doorstep

03:48.350 --> 03:49.290
is causing them a lot of trouble.

03:49.290 --> 03:50.090
- I was told to stop you.
- Let me go!

03:50.090 --> 03:51.580
- Hey, show us!
- Everyone is waiting.

03:51.580 --> 03:53.600
- Yeah.
- Show us!

03:54.280 --> 03:56.290
Please don't tip.

03:56.290 --> 03:57.960
Because I am not a performer.

03:57.960 --> 03:59.780
Please don't tip.

04:00.490 --> 04:01.090
Kazuma.

04:01.090 --> 04:01.390
What?

04:01.400 --> 04:05.280
It's a strategy to lure Darkness
out of her home.

04:05.280 --> 04:06.090
What?

04:06.090 --> 04:06.890
Exactly.

04:06.890 --> 04:10.170
Don't you know the story of Amano-Iwato?

04:10.170 --> 04:11.180
Yes, that's it.

04:11.590 --> 04:14.780
Hey! Darkness, do you hear me?

04:14.780 --> 04:16.990
Come out quickly!

04:16.990 --> 04:17.590
Come!

04:17.590 --> 04:19.790
You'll regret it if you don't
come closer to watch.

04:19.790 --> 04:21.480
I'm going to perform my best act.

04:21.480 --> 04:22.900
Hey, Kazuma!

04:22.900 --> 04:25.480
What are you doing? Let me go!

04:25.480 --> 04:27.190
It's enough, we're going back.

04:27.190 --> 04:28.380
No!

04:28.380 --> 04:29.890
Before Darkness comes out,

04:29.890 --> 04:32.090
I will perform here every day.

04:32.100 --> 04:33.690
Hey, Darkness!

04:33.690 --> 04:36.790
Darkness!

04:37.190 --> 04:39.090
A few days later.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.890
I'm back.

04:44.890 --> 04:47.090
Has it been three days already?

04:47.690 --> 04:48.880
I told you, didn't I?

04:48.880 --> 04:51.500
You'll get arrested for
sending threatening letters.

04:53.790 --> 04:55.490
You better behave.

04:56.290 --> 04:58.290
Up to now, you and Aqua

04:58.290 --> 05:00.680
have only been causing trouble
for the Dustiness family.

05:01.990 --> 05:05.290
Kazuma, it's about time you help out.

05:06.590 --> 05:08.890
If Darkness asks me, I'll help.

05:10.390 --> 05:11.780
How cold-blooded.

05:11.790 --> 05:15.000
The people in town call you scum or trash.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.590
I thought no matter what they said,

05:16.590 --> 05:19.090
you wouldn't abandon a friend in trouble

05:19.090 --> 05:21.590
and would step up at critical times.

05:26.590 --> 05:29.180
At times like this, the one I love

05:30.680 --> 05:33.400
would look annoyed

05:33.400 --> 05:35.690
and complain,

05:35.690 --> 05:37.000
but he would still help me.

05:37.590 --> 05:39.190
That's the kind of person he is.

05:42.490 --> 05:44.320
If you think this vague confession

05:44.320 --> 05:45.390
will make me help you,

05:45.390 --> 05:46.780
you're greatly mistaken.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.680
I'm not so easily fooled.

05:51.140 --> 05:53.790
(Konosuba)
Stop it!

05:53.790 --> 05:55.120
Stop!

05:58.290 --> 05:59.780
And finally,

05:59.790 --> 06:02.380
the day of Darkness' wedding came.

06:04.790 --> 06:06.690
Let's go, Kazuma.

06:06.690 --> 06:08.990
Let's ruin the wedding.

06:10.180 --> 06:12.790
Magic can accidentally destroy the venue

06:12.790 --> 06:15.580
or the lord's house.

06:15.580 --> 06:17.190
It happens all the time.

06:18.090 --> 06:19.280
Hey, don't do that.

06:19.280 --> 06:20.390
I mean it.

06:20.900 --> 06:22.790
Not only will we end up in debt again,

06:22.790 --> 06:25.190
but this can make us criminals.

06:25.190 --> 06:27.090
You'll regret it if you don't go.

06:28.100 --> 06:29.390
I won't go.

06:29.400 --> 06:30.490
What?

06:33.090 --> 06:34.280
You don't care about that lord

06:34.290 --> 06:37.500
doing whatever he wants to Darkness?

06:37.500 --> 06:39.990
Do you really not care?

06:40.500 --> 06:42.190
Of course I care!

06:45.000 --> 06:46.790
Of course I care.

06:50.780 --> 06:52.500
You may not know

06:53.000 --> 06:54.480
that the man will stop at nothing

06:54.480 --> 06:57.800
to possess the women he desires.

06:57.800 --> 06:59.890
After he grows tired of them,

06:59.900 --> 07:01.590
he discards them with a small alimony.

07:02.200 --> 07:03.800
What's worse,

07:03.800 --> 07:05.690
despite his despicable behavior,

07:05.690 --> 07:08.390
we just can't find the crucial
evidence for some reason.

07:09.390 --> 07:10.990
His reputation is terrible.

07:13.780 --> 07:15.290
Then we should go.

07:15.290 --> 07:16.390
If you go,

07:16.390 --> 07:19.190
you should be able to
come up with some ideas.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.600
This time, I'm powerless.

07:24.890 --> 07:26.990
It's a wedding between nobles.

07:27.690 --> 07:29.380
The security is strict.

07:29.380 --> 07:30.890
No matter what we do,

07:30.890 --> 07:32.200
we can't get close to them.

07:33.480 --> 07:35.280
Rather, this is precisely why

07:35.280 --> 07:38.190
I've been waiting
for Darkness to ask me for help.

07:39.780 --> 07:40.800
Kazuma.

07:41.780 --> 07:44.090
Darkness' father is seriously ill.

07:45.090 --> 07:47.890
And I have no noble connections
who could introduce me.

07:49.280 --> 07:52.790
After all, I'm just
an insignificant adventurer.

07:56.590 --> 07:59.190
This is what they call
a disparity in social status.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.280
Besides,

08:01.980 --> 08:04.600
Darkness and we live in different worlds.

08:05.490 --> 08:07.800
That we've managed to go on
adventures together up till now

08:08.590 --> 08:10.190
is in itself a miracle.

08:21.290 --> 08:22.580
Now I know

08:22.580 --> 08:25.290
you're also trying to help her.

08:25.790 --> 08:29.090
For me, that's enough.

08:32.200 --> 08:34.980
I will figure out a way by myself.

08:34.980 --> 08:36.880
I'll embark on a path I won't regret.

08:36.880 --> 08:39.490
I hope you'll give it some thought

08:39.490 --> 08:42.490
and then set out on a path
you won't regret.

08:44.900 --> 08:45.900
I'm going.

08:53.190 --> 08:54.790
What can I do with her?

08:55.490 --> 08:56.780
Hi, hello!

08:56.780 --> 08:58.790
Leave your unreliable partners.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.380
A clairvoyant demon came to your rescue.

09:01.380 --> 09:02.390
Vanir?

09:02.390 --> 09:04.530
Weep with joy at my arrival.

09:04.530 --> 09:06.380
Cheer with all your might.

09:06.380 --> 09:07.190
Come,

09:07.190 --> 09:10.090
let me see all your
intellectual properties.

09:10.490 --> 09:11.380
What?

09:11.390 --> 09:12.970
Why must I do business with you

09:12.970 --> 09:15.500
when I'm so dispirited?

09:15.500 --> 09:17.800
Bring the beautiful lady manager.

09:18.380 --> 09:19.880
That debt-generating machine

09:19.880 --> 09:21.780
can't possibly do business properly.

09:22.280 --> 09:24.390
Yesterday, when I wasn't paying attention,

09:24.390 --> 09:27.500
'This can be sold to adventurer couple,'
she said,

09:27.500 --> 09:30.280
and purchased this necklace.

09:30.280 --> 09:31.390
What is that?

09:31.790 --> 09:34.790
When the one wearing this
suffers a fatal injury,

09:34.800 --> 09:38.510
it'll catch fire and explode
right before they die.

09:38.990 --> 09:40.180
The concept

09:40.780 --> 09:43.390
is to sacrifice one's life

09:43.390 --> 09:46.180
to protect someone important.

09:46.190 --> 09:48.480
Isn't that romantic?

09:49.090 --> 09:51.680
She said this with a smile.

09:51.680 --> 09:53.240
But its power is too strong.

09:53.240 --> 09:53.880
Not to mention the enemy,

09:53.880 --> 09:55.260
even the one who should
have been protected

09:55.260 --> 09:57.700
will be blasted away.

09:57.700 --> 09:59.190
This is an item that makes one question

09:59.190 --> 10:02.380
the store owner's intelligence.

10:03.080 --> 10:04.590
Do you want this?

10:05.200 --> 10:06.800
Nope.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.700
Right, what do you mean
you came to my rescue?

10:11.990 --> 10:13.580
It seems you've followed my advice

10:13.580 --> 10:16.000
and have been working hard on products.

10:16.890 --> 10:18.590
Therefore…

10:22.490 --> 10:26.190
These… are my intellectual properties.

10:26.190 --> 10:28.180
I have no intention of selling them cheap.

10:29.110 --> 10:30.770
You want to save her,

10:30.770 --> 10:32.730
yet you fear being rejected
by the girl in armor

10:32.730 --> 10:35.190
if you go there.

10:35.680 --> 10:38.590
The demon Vanir hereby declares

10:38.590 --> 10:41.580
to purchase all of your
intellectual property rights.

10:41.580 --> 10:43.400
The money in this bag

10:43.400 --> 10:45.280
will certainly fulfill your wishes.

10:48.120 --> 10:50.610
Then let me confirm

10:50.610 --> 10:52.510
all your properties and rights.

10:52.510 --> 10:53.840
Vanir,

10:53.840 --> 10:55.730
you can know many things, right?

10:56.760 --> 10:57.600
Hm.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.510
I can foresee most things.

10:59.510 --> 11:02.850
For example, the question you want to ask.

11:02.850 --> 11:04.110
Of course, I also know

11:04.710 --> 11:05.930
why the girl in armor

11:05.930 --> 11:08.720
owes the lord a huge debt,

11:09.310 --> 11:10.520
and why no evidence can be found

11:10.520 --> 11:15.630
after that lord have done so many evil things.

11:16.910 --> 11:17.820
Hey.

11:17.820 --> 11:19.420
- You are a demon…
- A demon,

11:19.420 --> 11:21.020
yet why so eager to help?

11:21.020 --> 11:23.430
Is there some ulterior motive?

11:24.230 --> 11:26.110
Of course, there is.

11:26.110 --> 11:28.630
After all, I am a demon.

11:29.110 --> 11:31.920
However, this time our interests align.

11:31.930 --> 11:33.110
That's why I would help you.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.890
For instance, I could take this chance

11:35.890 --> 11:37.330
to have you sell all sorts of rights

11:37.330 --> 11:38.630
you have hidden away for emergencies

11:38.630 --> 11:41.220
at a cheap price.

11:41.710 --> 11:43.330
The clairvoyant Mr. Demon.

11:43.330 --> 11:45.120
You're a tough opponent.

11:45.810 --> 11:46.730
So,

11:46.730 --> 11:48.420
since you know my questions,

11:48.420 --> 11:50.420
then you might as well just tell me.

11:50.420 --> 11:52.020
Alright, alright.

11:52.030 --> 11:53.610
I'll tell you.

11:53.610 --> 11:56.220
Sacred Exorcism!

12:00.220 --> 12:01.320
Wait!

12:01.320 --> 12:02.620
Aren't you a powerful demon?

12:02.620 --> 12:05.010
You couldn't possibly be defeated
by the Goddess of Toilets!

12:05.020 --> 12:05.620
What?

12:05.620 --> 12:07.120
I was away for a little bit.

12:07.120 --> 12:08.930
Why have you become a demon's friend?

12:08.930 --> 12:10.920
And besides, I am the Goddess of Water.

12:10.920 --> 12:12.800
You always meddle.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.500
Never to be seen when you're needed.

12:14.500 --> 12:17.020
I went to receive guests.

12:17.020 --> 12:18.930
What guest?

12:18.930 --> 12:21.020
The steward… Sir?

12:21.730 --> 12:24.910
You seem to be busy.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.720
Then I will take my leave.

12:27.720 --> 12:29.620
No, this is…

12:32.610 --> 12:34.190
Daring to ambush me? How bold.

12:34.200 --> 12:35.320
Rogue goddess.

12:35.320 --> 12:36.420
Look.

12:36.420 --> 12:39.210
My handsome mask is cracked.

12:39.210 --> 12:40.800
Shut it.

12:40.800 --> 12:42.920
Do I have to declare in advance

12:42.920 --> 12:46.100
every time I expel pests?

12:46.100 --> 12:47.520
Are you stupid?

12:47.520 --> 12:49.130
Pfft pfft.

12:49.130 --> 12:50.420
Pfft pfft.

12:50.420 --> 12:51.710
(Konosuba)
Hey, stop interfering with us.

12:52.520 --> 12:55.490
Alright, the man with
the goddess by his side

12:55.490 --> 12:58.210
yet cannot rely on her.

12:58.210 --> 12:59.940
What you want to know is

12:59.940 --> 13:02.700
why the girl in armor is in debt, right?

13:02.700 --> 13:03.820
Right.

13:04.820 --> 13:06.320
The cause of this

13:06.320 --> 13:07.910
is that you adventurers

13:07.910 --> 13:11.300
defeated the Mobile Fortress Destroyer.

13:11.300 --> 13:12.710
Destroyer?

13:13.730 --> 13:14.800
Do explain.

13:14.800 --> 13:17.390
Generally speaking,
when the Destroyer appears,

13:17.390 --> 13:19.520
Lords will lose their land.

13:20.320 --> 13:22.930
However, with your desperate efforts,

13:22.930 --> 13:24.530
this city did not come to that.

13:25.330 --> 13:26.620
Isn't that a good thing?

13:27.210 --> 13:29.020
The town itself was saved.

13:29.020 --> 13:31.030
Yes, I mean the town itself.

13:31.830 --> 13:34.230
But the granary areas along the way

13:34.230 --> 13:37.230
were ravaged by all sorts of things.

13:38.210 --> 13:40.300
Those farmers

13:40.300 --> 13:42.420
have practically lost everything.

13:43.020 --> 13:47.090
So they ran to the lord for help.

13:48.630 --> 13:51.320
Yes, as you expected,

13:51.320 --> 13:53.310
this is what the lord said.

13:53.810 --> 13:57.110
You should be grateful
that you're still alive.

13:57.110 --> 14:00.620
Even if left unattended,
weeds will still grow.

14:01.230 --> 14:02.030
Like that.

14:03.910 --> 14:06.310
It's impossible to describe it
as a natural disaster

14:06.320 --> 14:07.830
and have the people give up.

14:08.430 --> 14:10.130
They cried and pleaded,

14:10.130 --> 14:11.130
yes,

14:11.130 --> 14:12.960
to the Dustiness family

14:12.960 --> 14:14.720
who you know well.

14:15.420 --> 14:17.520
This is what those people said.

14:18.630 --> 14:20.340
The adventurers compensated

14:20.340 --> 14:22.910
for the buildings destroyed by the flood.

14:22.910 --> 14:25.130
The benevolent Lady Dustiness,

14:25.130 --> 14:27.720
please pity us too.

14:27.720 --> 14:28.620
Like this.

14:29.230 --> 14:30.720
What did you just say?

14:30.720 --> 14:32.910
About the buildings
destroyed by the flood.

14:35.420 --> 14:37.620
When they requested compensation from you,

14:37.620 --> 14:38.930
they said

14:39.510 --> 14:41.530
'I won't ask for full compensation,'

14:41.530 --> 14:44.420
'but please compensate at least a part.'

14:45.620 --> 14:46.720
The Dustiness family

14:46.720 --> 14:49.120
lost more than half of their property

14:49.120 --> 14:51.410
to compensate for the damage.

14:52.410 --> 14:53.920
And that's not all.

14:53.920 --> 14:57.130
To help those ravaged by the Destroyer,

14:57.130 --> 15:00.010
they went to borrow money from the lord

15:00.010 --> 15:01.330
who disclaimed responsibility.

15:02.520 --> 15:04.340
The lord proposed an attached condition.

15:05.930 --> 15:09.630
If you don't have money,

15:09.630 --> 15:12.420
repay me with your body.

15:16.530 --> 15:18.120
Kazuma.

15:18.120 --> 15:21.220
Pounding the table must hurt.

15:21.220 --> 15:22.520
It hurts, doesn't it?

15:24.120 --> 15:25.910
Then everything makes sense.

15:26.910 --> 15:29.220
How much money does Darkness owe?

15:31.810 --> 15:33.310
The property you own

15:33.320 --> 15:35.530
plus the money in this bag

15:35.530 --> 15:38.210
amounts exactly to the debt.

15:40.810 --> 15:43.420
So, let's talk business.

15:48.910 --> 15:51.420
Miss, you are very beautiful.

15:52.320 --> 15:53.710
After the wedding,

15:53.710 --> 15:56.720
please let the sick master

15:56.720 --> 15:59.120
take a look at you.

16:00.300 --> 16:01.710
Get lost!

16:01.710 --> 16:05.240
Lalatina is about to become mine anyway.

16:05.240 --> 16:09.620
Only people from the Dustiness House
can pass through here.

16:09.620 --> 16:11.020
Please go back.

16:11.020 --> 16:12.130
You fool!

16:12.130 --> 16:13.020
Listen.

16:13.020 --> 16:14.000
After the wedding,

16:14.000 --> 16:16.610
I will become your master.

16:17.130 --> 16:18.520
I cannot let you pass.

16:18.520 --> 16:21.510
You are not my master yet.

16:21.510 --> 16:22.520
Wha…

16:24.110 --> 16:25.730
I'll remember your face.

16:25.730 --> 16:28.350
Just you wait after the wedding.

16:30.720 --> 16:33.220
Can you ask the person outside to come in?

16:33.220 --> 16:34.330
I want to thank him.

16:34.330 --> 16:35.610
Yes.

16:37.650 --> 16:38.520
Please.

16:43.120 --> 16:45.120
Well, well.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.720
You are very beautiful.

16:47.830 --> 16:49.330
I'm sorry.

16:49.330 --> 16:50.630
I will talk to him.

16:50.630 --> 16:53.020
You will not be punished.

16:53.580 --> 16:54.930
Please don't mind.

16:55.520 --> 16:57.910
Since he is approved by the young lady,

16:57.910 --> 16:59.520
I am willing to serve him.

17:01.110 --> 17:03.130
I approved, huh?

17:06.130 --> 17:09.120
Seeing your smile

17:09.120 --> 17:11.110
makes me feel very happy, young lady.

17:17.510 --> 17:19.910
It might be a bit presumptuous.

17:19.910 --> 17:22.420
You are so beautiful.

17:22.420 --> 17:26.320
It's better not to play
intense games alone.

17:29.220 --> 17:30.430
Darn it.

17:30.430 --> 17:33.530
It's all that man's fault
for imitating my voice.

17:37.710 --> 17:40.920
A person born as a noble

17:40.920 --> 17:43.310
does not have the right

17:43.320 --> 17:44.420
to live as they please.

17:45.520 --> 17:46.720
Despite this,

17:47.220 --> 17:50.420
I am fortunate to have lived up till now

17:50.420 --> 17:52.510
with friends I can trust.

17:53.320 --> 17:54.410
It's enough.

17:55.220 --> 17:57.430
To desire more would be greedy.

17:58.120 --> 18:01.520
Now it's my turn to repay
everyone in the town.

18:02.610 --> 18:03.620
Young lady?

18:04.150 --> 18:05.200
Sorry.

18:05.780 --> 18:06.610
I'm fine.

18:07.540 --> 18:11.730
What will they think once they
know the reason for my debt?

18:13.020 --> 18:14.530
Megumin will probably get angry.

18:15.320 --> 18:18.120
Aqua might burst into tears.

18:19.220 --> 18:20.610
As for him,

18:20.610 --> 18:22.310
he'll likely lecture me

18:22.320 --> 18:24.100
that I've done a stupid thing.

18:24.100 --> 18:27.310
Precisely the last thing I want him to do.

18:27.310 --> 18:29.320
Carry it out then.

18:32.930 --> 18:34.630
Will he come?

18:36.430 --> 18:38.630
No, he won't come.

18:39.120 --> 18:40.610
Given his personality,

18:40.610 --> 18:42.130
he's definitely sulking

18:42.130 --> 18:44.120
alone at home.

18:47.820 --> 18:50.220
It's time, young lady.

18:50.220 --> 18:53.700
The priest blessing you today

18:53.710 --> 18:56.430
is the most influential person in town.

18:56.430 --> 19:00.310
This wedding will be great.

19:03.120 --> 19:04.420
I'm so happy.

19:06.010 --> 19:08.220
This year I spent with them,

19:08.920 --> 19:11.020
I was so cheerful every day.

19:11.020 --> 19:12.430
So happy.

19:20.510 --> 19:21.730
Don't push.

19:21.730 --> 19:23.630
Can't see inside at all.

19:25.830 --> 19:29.530
I wish you all the happiness, young lady.

20:33.590 --> 20:36.120
Bride Darkness

20:36.120 --> 20:40.430
is soon to marry this guy who
looks like a bear and pig combined.

20:40.430 --> 20:44.310
She follows a fate
not decided by me, a goddess,

20:44.310 --> 20:47.220
and becomes his wife.

20:48.110 --> 20:50.810
Do you swear that in health

20:50.810 --> 20:52.210
or sickness,

20:52.210 --> 20:53.620
in happiness

20:53.620 --> 20:55.220
or sadness,

20:55.220 --> 20:56.510
in wealth

20:56.510 --> 20:58.120
or poverty,

20:58.120 --> 20:59.930
you will love this old man,

20:59.930 --> 21:01.510
respect him,

21:01.510 --> 21:03.420
comfort him,

21:03.420 --> 21:05.310
help him,

21:05.310 --> 21:10.430
and be loyal to him for this life?

21:10.430 --> 21:12.420
Calling me an old man?

21:12.920 --> 21:14.520
You can't do it, can you?

21:15.920 --> 21:18.510
Darkness, I want to go back with you,

21:18.510 --> 21:20.620
eat the food made by Kazuma,

21:20.630 --> 21:22.930
and then have a drink.

21:24.420 --> 21:27.100
You… you're the woman who came to my house

21:27.100 --> 21:29.920
and caused me a lot of trouble!

21:37.720 --> 21:40.120
Dad, mom.

21:41.010 --> 21:43.810
You've always taught your darling son

21:43.810 --> 21:45.910
to be an upright person.

21:46.620 --> 21:49.920
- I no longer know what a mundane life is.
- Go, Kazuma! Show him what you've got.

21:49.920 --> 21:53.410
- I'm getting ready to fight
the most powerful person in the area
- Go! Kazuma!

21:53.410 --> 21:56.130
- and kidnap a noble young lady.
- Go! Show him!

21:57.420 --> 21:59.020
Let's go home, Darkness!

23:30.000 --> 23:30.990
(Episode 11
Blessings for the Unchanging Daily Life)

23:30.990 --> 23:32.600
Lord Demon King.

23:32.600 --> 23:33.470
We…

23:33.500 --> 23:34.880
We…

23:34.880 --> 23:38.290
are living on the beautiful Sanzu River.

23:38.290 --> 23:40.060
We will keep enjoying it to the fullest.
