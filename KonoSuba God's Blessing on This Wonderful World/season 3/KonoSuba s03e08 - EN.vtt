WEBVTT

00:09.080 --> 00:13.700
Oh, Kazuma! Death should not have taken thee!

00:10.270 --> 00:11.280
I'm Kazuma!

00:14.360 --> 00:16.130
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

00:16.130 --> 00:18.190
I've always wanted to say that.

00:18.190 --> 00:19.540
Kazuma!

00:19.540 --> 00:20.380
Yes, Kazuma here!

00:20.380 --> 00:23.590
I'm done reviving your body, 
so could you hurry it up?

00:23.590 --> 00:27.530
Darkness is really stinky and 
depressed for some reason!

00:27.530 --> 00:29.930
Get a move on! Pronto!

00:35.170 --> 00:37.180
Welcome home, Kazuma-san.

00:37.180 --> 00:39.330
What reeks?!

00:39.330 --> 00:41.010
And where are my clothes?!

00:41.670 --> 00:43.690
All digested.

00:43.690 --> 00:46.900
Your sword with the weirdo 
name is all that's left.

00:46.900 --> 00:52.530
Well, I do not appreciate you calling 
the name I gave that blade "weirdo!"

00:54.630 --> 00:57.040
Darkness, Eris-sama mentioned something...

00:57.620 --> 01:01.170
You let the hydra swallow you to rescue me?

01:05.030 --> 01:07.120
Jeez, that's not like you.

01:08.140 --> 01:10.920
Come on, let's head home and hit the bath!

01:10.920 --> 01:15.600
Y'know, Kazuma, inviting her into the 
bath while not dressed is a bad look.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.290
Are you a pervert?

01:17.630 --> 01:19.970
Are you a pervert?!

01:30.860 --> 01:39.290
<b>KONOSUBA!
God's Blessing on this Wonderful World! 3</b>

02:51.410 --> 02:54.560
You two need to get in the bath, fast.

02:52.020 --> 02:58.530
<b>Episode 8: An Eternal Rest for the Master of This Lake!</b>

02:54.560 --> 02:57.570
Especially considering Kazuma's 
gonna get reported at this rate.

02:57.570 --> 02:58.530
Quit yapping!

02:58.880 --> 03:01.430
Is the hydra not gonna be a problem?

03:01.430 --> 03:05.420
It'll probably be tied up 
re-fouling the lake for a while.

03:05.420 --> 03:08.200
Which is all thanks to me, who purified it!

03:08.200 --> 03:12.300
I feel as though whenever you're certain of 
something, there's a pitfall lying in wait...

03:13.070 --> 03:15.340
Unbelievable! You're unbelievable, Megumin!

03:15.340 --> 03:18.470
Keep talking like that and I'll have 
Kazuma or Darkness carry you instead!

03:18.470 --> 03:21.800
I'll apologize, okay?! 
Anything but that! Please!

03:22.150 --> 03:23.730
Let's get going, then.

03:23.730 --> 03:27.390
We've gotta talk up what 
we did as best we can!

03:27.390 --> 03:32.560
That way, even if we don't get the reward 
for slaying it, we might get a a bit of gold!

03:32.860 --> 03:36.520
Leave it to me! Explanation of the 
wonders of my Explosion magic

03:36.520 --> 03:39.100
is something I can go 
into great detail about!

03:44.130 --> 03:45.650
<i>According to Aqua,</i>

03:45.650 --> 03:49.620
<i>being digested by the hydra turned 
me into more of a "Kazuma-chan."</i>

03:53.430 --> 03:57.170
<i>This is the same size 
it was before, right?!</i>

03:57.810 --> 03:58.740
Kazuma.

03:58.740 --> 03:59.850
Yeah, I'm Kazuma—

03:59.850 --> 04:00.590
<i>"-chan"?!</i>

03:59.850 --> 04:02.590
You seem to be taking a while. 
Are you hurt anywhere?

04:02.590 --> 04:04.080
I-I'm good!

04:04.080 --> 04:07.840
I mean, remember how bad we stunk?
Just want to be thorough with the cleanup!

04:09.280 --> 04:13.730
Say, Kazuma... I'm... 
sorry for forcing the issue this time.

04:13.730 --> 04:16.180
What's done is done!

04:16.600 --> 04:19.990
Aqua and Megumin are probably 
chowing down at the guild,

04:19.990 --> 04:21.610
so we should hurry on over.

04:22.250 --> 04:24.710
Yeah. You're right.

04:28.990 --> 04:31.980
I'll leave your change 
of clothes here, then.

04:31.980 --> 04:36.590
Hey, is there some reason you 
needed to take that hydra down?

04:36.590 --> 04:39.190
N-Not at all!

04:39.190 --> 04:40.630
<i>So there is, then.</i>

04:39.190 --> 04:41.440
Of course not! H-How could there be?!

04:41.440 --> 04:44.900
It didn't work out today, but the 
next time we go after that thing,

04:44.900 --> 04:47.240
we'll come up with a proper plan first.

04:47.960 --> 04:52.430
Or what? After all that hot air you 
blew about protecting the town,

04:52.430 --> 04:54.400
have you already given up?

04:54.400 --> 04:57.050
Of course not! Who do you think I am?!

04:57.420 --> 05:01.500
Defending the people is a duty 
bestowed upon the Dustiness lineage!

05:01.500 --> 05:04.690
Next time, that hydra is dead meat!

05:08.320 --> 05:12.570
How is it possible that you people 
always make things worse?!

05:12.570 --> 05:16.020
You just had to piss off 
something as nasty as a hydra!

05:16.020 --> 05:20.330
Oh my gosh, Megumin, 
what did you do this time?!

05:23.230 --> 05:24.340
Kazuma!

05:25.300 --> 05:27.040
What are they so mad about?

05:27.470 --> 05:29.630
I thought the quest was 
posted as a stopgap measure,

05:29.630 --> 05:32.510
since a squad of knights was being deployed.

05:32.510 --> 05:36.550
Well, there's been a bit of an 
incident in the royal capital...

05:36.550 --> 05:37.790
In the capital?

05:38.580 --> 05:40.230
Big Brother!

05:40.780 --> 05:42.910
Hey, is the capital in trouble?!

05:42.910 --> 05:45.640
Is my cute little sister in danger?!

05:46.110 --> 05:50.020
Apparently some group called the 
Silver-Haired Thief Brigade

05:50.020 --> 05:51.900
snuck into the royal castle...

05:52.260 --> 05:56.910
And the knights are otherwise occupied 
trying to recover the stolen treasures.

05:59.010 --> 06:03.680
<i>Holy crap, I've got a bounty 
comparable to a Devil King general.</i>

06:04.030 --> 06:08.170
Wait, if some capital city crooks have 
their bounties posted in our town...

06:08.170 --> 06:10.330
Just between us,

06:10.740 --> 06:15.440
the authorities consulted a Crimson Demon 
fortune teller about the perpetrator's identity...

06:15.440 --> 06:17.900
It seems that 200,000,000 bounty

06:16.360 --> 06:17.900
Y-You've got it all wrong!

06:17.900 --> 06:20.320
is hiding here in Axel!

06:17.900 --> 06:20.320
Stop staring like that!

06:20.620 --> 06:22.060
Two hundred million?!

06:22.060 --> 06:26.160
Are you serious?! That's a lot juicier 
than taking down some monsters!

06:26.160 --> 06:26.990
I know, right?!

06:26.990 --> 06:29.730
With a price like that, 
who wouldn't join the manhunt?!

06:26.990 --> 06:29.730
Th-The Silver-Haired Thief Brigade?!

06:29.730 --> 06:31.150
In this town?!

06:31.420 --> 06:34.300
Two hundred million... 
Two hundred million eris, eh?

06:36.050 --> 06:38.580
Hey! What're you looking at me for?!

06:38.910 --> 06:42.190
Everyone! If we can capture the 
Silver-Haired Thief Brigade,

06:42.190 --> 06:45.180
the knights will come to Axel 
to deal with the hydra!

06:45.480 --> 06:49.710
That being the case, we'll be 
expecting your help, too, Kazuma!

06:51.210 --> 06:54.340
O-Of course! I'd love to help!

06:54.340 --> 06:55.670
KONOSUBA!

06:55.670 --> 07:00.420
Sleep well, little dragon.

06:58.620 --> 07:01.310
<i>And, of course, I shut myself indoors.</i>

07:00.420 --> 07:03.790
Such a good little dragon.

07:03.790 --> 07:10.820
When you're born, I'll take good care of you.

07:09.090 --> 07:10.820
Is that supposed to be...

07:10.820 --> 07:12.080
It's prenatal bonding!

07:12.570 --> 07:13.750
Isn't it?

07:14.200 --> 07:16.810
You don't have to stay on 
top of the egg, you know.

07:16.810 --> 07:19.290
It'll be plenty warm if you leave 
it in front of the fireplace.

07:19.290 --> 07:22.030
And if it ends up cooked, 
we can always eat it.

07:22.030 --> 07:25.170
Are you asking for a holy knuckle sandwich?

07:25.700 --> 07:27.990
I am channeling my magic power into the egg!

07:27.990 --> 07:31.340
Because he's going to reign 
over all other dragons!

07:31.340 --> 07:34.190
And as his foster mother,

07:34.190 --> 07:36.610
I'll do whatever I can to help!

07:36.610 --> 07:37.940
Isn't that right, Emperor Zel?

07:38.310 --> 07:40.720
<i>Of all the stupid names...</i>

07:40.720 --> 07:42.550
Kazuma! We need firepower!

07:42.550 --> 07:46.820
If the hydra won't fall from a single blow, 
we continue to strike away until it does!

07:47.050 --> 07:47.940
Huh?

07:47.940 --> 07:50.650
As we did with the Destroyer Mobile Fortress,

07:50.650 --> 07:54.140
Aqua's magic power and your 
Drain Touch will enable this!

07:54.140 --> 07:54.960
No way.

07:56.500 --> 08:00.860
Why exactly do I have to submit 
to some disgusting Lich skill?

08:00.860 --> 08:05.440
My holy magic power isn't meant to be shared 
with everybody at the drop of a hat!

08:05.440 --> 08:07.230
I don't care how Kazuma threatens me,

08:07.230 --> 08:08.960
or Darkness butters me up,

08:08.960 --> 08:10.410
or how crazy you go, Megumin!

08:10.410 --> 08:11.680
I am absolutely not doing it!

08:12.980 --> 08:16.770
What's got you so fired up 
for revenge anyway, Megumin?

08:18.780 --> 08:22.070
Well, considering this thing 
killed you, Kazuma...

08:22.070 --> 08:24.570
Why wouldn't I want to avenge that?

08:25.510 --> 08:27.280
I-I see...

08:29.600 --> 08:32.870
We've been using Darkness's 
Decoy skill every day,

08:32.870 --> 08:36.670
followed up with a blast of 
Explosion magic to harass it, but...

08:36.670 --> 08:40.300
I have to wonder if there's a more 
effective strategy we could use.

08:40.300 --> 08:42.550
What the hell, Darkness?

08:42.550 --> 08:44.660
It's usually your job to stop 
her when she's like this!

08:44.660 --> 08:48.820
B-But that hydra has to be dealt with...

08:48.820 --> 08:53.170
Besides, this should be effective 
at whittling down its magic power.

08:53.780 --> 08:55.640
<i>These two...</i>

08:55.640 --> 08:58.310
Well, we're out of luck for as long 
as the rain keeps up, anyway.

08:58.310 --> 09:00.400
That just gives the thing an advantage.

09:00.400 --> 09:03.890
Fortune tellers say the rain is 
likely to persist for a while.

09:04.440 --> 09:06.900
I'll get serious about it once the rain stops.

09:11.250 --> 09:14.490
Meaning you're not going to get 
serious for the foreseeable future?!

09:14.490 --> 09:17.700
What the heck?! Give her back! 
I need my Chomusuke!

09:17.700 --> 09:21.110
You little... Put her down! 
Gimme the cat or face the consequences!

09:32.420 --> 09:35.590
<i>The rain didn't let up in the following days,</i>

09:33.370 --> 09:35.580
Explosion, Explosion!

09:36.090 --> 09:40.430
<i>but Darkness and Megumin kept 
paying visits to the hydra.</i>

09:38.480 --> 09:40.900
Explosion, Explosion!

09:41.170 --> 09:42.630
We're home!

09:42.630 --> 09:46.270
Darkness is a bit of a mess, 
so could you get the bath ready?

09:47.770 --> 09:50.850
Seriously, stop this. It's dangerous.

09:51.300 --> 09:55.210
The fiend must be bothered by 
the daily Explosion magic...

09:55.210 --> 09:56.650
It ambushed us.

09:57.060 --> 09:59.130
Megumin was able to land her spell,

09:59.130 --> 10:01.970
which gave us the chance to flee 
while it was regenerating...

10:03.530 --> 10:06.210
This is proving even harder than I thought.

10:06.210 --> 10:07.690
Thank you, Aqua.

10:28.640 --> 10:37.130
You are a dragon, oh, what a wonderful dragon.

10:37.130 --> 10:45.700
Your mother is true and blue.

10:40.710 --> 10:42.920
Kazuma? What are you doing?

10:43.230 --> 10:45.700
Got bored, so I'm fixing your armor.

10:45.700 --> 10:48.290
Nothing else to do, with all the rain.

10:45.700 --> 10:49.730
And Eris pads her chest,

10:50.150 --> 10:52.780
You better not run back out 
there once it's fixed, either.

10:50.150 --> 10:53.770
because she's a loser.

10:54.910 --> 11:00.380
This reminds me of how you repaired my 
armor on the way to the hot springs.

11:00.380 --> 11:03.490
It'd be nice if we could all go there again.

11:03.490 --> 11:06.050
Hell no. I hate that place.

11:06.050 --> 11:08.340
It's like a whole town full of Megumins.

11:08.340 --> 11:11.810
Hey. And what exactly do you mean by that?

11:11.810 --> 11:15.470
Excuse me?! How could you be so 
cruel to my adoring faithful?!

11:15.470 --> 11:19.050
You, too, Aqua?! Maybe you can explain 
to me what this is supposed to mean!

11:19.050 --> 11:21.950
My faithful are all a bunch 
of sweet, earnest types!

11:21.950 --> 11:24.120
Are you implying I am 
neither sweet or earnest?!

11:22.390 --> 11:23.400
Even so,

11:24.120 --> 11:25.780
it'd be nice to go again.

11:24.430 --> 11:25.780
Take it back!

11:30.320 --> 11:32.370
Kazuma! Darkness is missing!

11:32.370 --> 11:34.660
Her equipment is gone, too!

11:34.660 --> 11:37.770
Damn it! And after I told her 
over and over not to go!

11:37.770 --> 11:39.830
It's too dangerous to attempt this alone!

11:39.830 --> 11:42.760
Unbelievable! That girl is so unbelievable!

11:42.760 --> 11:44.890
I'm going to drop the egg off with Wiz,

11:44.890 --> 11:47.330
and then I'm gonna give 
Darkness a piece of my mind!

11:50.930 --> 11:54.380
You two go on ahead and try 
to slow Darkness down!

11:54.380 --> 11:55.530
Where are you going?

11:55.820 --> 11:57.740
Got a few stops to make!

11:57.740 --> 12:00.220
Don't let her take that thing on solo!

12:00.220 --> 12:02.150
Damn it, that girl!

12:02.480 --> 12:05.500
I guess we're doing this!

12:08.900 --> 12:11.000
Don't like the look of that sky.

12:11.970 --> 12:13.990
Makes old scars ache...

12:14.500 --> 12:17.500
Release me!

12:17.500 --> 12:20.650
Unbelievable! You're being unbelievable!

12:20.650 --> 12:22.510
This is too much to attempt alone!

12:22.510 --> 12:25.710
Wait, is this where you won't give up 
because you think you'll get yelled at?!

12:25.710 --> 12:27.980
We won't get mad! Just, please, come home!

12:27.980 --> 12:29.720
What has gotten into you?!

12:29.720 --> 12:33.140
Aren't we friends?! Tell us what's going on!

12:33.140 --> 12:36.160
<i>Even so... I...</i>

12:38.100 --> 12:40.940
Darkness!

12:48.970 --> 12:50.260
What in the world...

12:50.750 --> 12:53.240
Lalatina!

12:53.240 --> 12:55.460
Don't call me that!

12:55.930 --> 12:57.190
What is all this fuss?!

12:57.190 --> 13:00.170
If this is some new type of harassment, 
don't expect me to put up with it!

13:00.170 --> 13:04.930
N-No! I was just telling everyone 
how you kept facing the hydra,

13:04.930 --> 13:07.520
and asked if they wanted to help!

13:08.060 --> 13:11.490
Kazuma has been keeping
the booze flowing lately.

13:11.490 --> 13:14.990
Won't hurt to pay the lad back a little.

13:14.990 --> 13:18.450
And we can help take care of your 
issue while we're at it, Lalatina.

13:19.790 --> 13:21.680
There. Take a good look.

13:22.450 --> 13:26.260
All these adventurers have rallied for you.

13:26.260 --> 13:28.070
I know you've got muscles for brains,

13:28.600 --> 13:31.220
but try not to make 
everybody worry, all right?

13:31.940 --> 13:33.100
Everyone...

13:33.580 --> 13:36.740
Get a load of that! 
Lalatina's all embarrassed!

13:41.340 --> 13:42.920
Blessing!

13:42.920 --> 13:44.130
Blessing!

13:44.130 --> 13:45.880
Blessing!

13:47.190 --> 13:49.420
If you're in the thief class, 
get ready with Bind!

13:47.720 --> 13:49.420
There!

13:49.420 --> 13:52.260
Archers, set up your roped 
arrows and be on standby!

13:52.260 --> 13:55.030
We're taking on a hydra here! 
Everybody stay frosty!

13:55.030 --> 13:56.010
Right!

13:56.330 --> 13:58.780
Wizards, don't worry about a second shot!

13:59.220 --> 14:02.870
Give us all your magic power 
and get ready for a big one!

14:02.870 --> 14:04.340
Leave it to me!

14:04.340 --> 14:08.940
This time, my Explosion magic will 
reduce the hydra to cinders!

14:09.280 --> 14:11.030
And Darkness!

14:11.510 --> 14:14.160
Your Decoy skill is key to this whole plan!

14:14.160 --> 14:16.610
Don't go down too fast, now!

14:16.610 --> 14:17.360
Aye!

14:18.130 --> 14:19.420
Okay...

14:19.820 --> 14:21.660
Let's do this!

14:24.670 --> 14:27.670
Blessing! Blessing! Blessing! 
Blessing! Blessing! Blessing!

14:27.670 --> 14:28.930
Darkness!

14:29.200 --> 14:30.260
Consider it done!

14:31.720 --> 14:32.940
Decoy!

14:34.690 --> 14:36.080
You're dead meat!

14:48.540 --> 14:51.200
Good! Thief skill squad!

14:51.450 --> 14:52.750
Bind!

14:56.960 --> 14:59.200
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

15:10.240 --> 15:12.590
Wind speed's good. Line of sight's good.

15:12.880 --> 15:14.590
Little higher, little higher, little higher...

15:14.590 --> 15:16.340
Good, good, good...

15:16.340 --> 15:19.110
All good! Stop!

15:19.110 --> 15:20.480
Fire!

15:28.080 --> 15:29.730
We got him!

15:29.730 --> 15:31.230
Pull! Pull!

15:31.560 --> 15:34.000
Pull that thing! Give it all you've got!

15:34.000 --> 15:37.240
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

15:40.430 --> 15:42.260
You sure about this, Kazuma?!

15:42.260 --> 15:44.490
Yeah! Send me right at him!

15:55.420 --> 15:58.970
If this thing won't go down until its magic 
power is gone, then I'll take it all!

15:58.970 --> 16:01.470
Drain Touch!

16:07.520 --> 16:09.700
It's working!

16:09.700 --> 16:12.480
We can do this!

16:17.880 --> 16:20.030
It's working! We've got him!

16:22.120 --> 16:23.180
Kazuma!

16:29.830 --> 16:30.880
Everyone!

16:38.480 --> 16:43.090
Very impressive, Dustiness-san. You really 
have got strength and endurance to spare.

16:43.090 --> 16:44.640
Now is not the time!

16:45.650 --> 16:48.160
This is too much. I can't hold out for long.

16:48.160 --> 16:50.890
Hey, dumbass! Hang in there! You have to!

16:51.210 --> 16:53.160
Drain Touch!

16:53.990 --> 17:05.150
Drain Touch! Drain Touch!

16:55.120 --> 16:59.160
<i>Darkness has been taking a beating daily 
to chip away at this thing's magic power.</i>

16:59.490 --> 17:01.520
<i>I'm not gonna let that go to waste!</i>

17:04.050 --> 17:05.170
I can't keep this up...

17:05.170 --> 17:09.240
Damn it, you're finally 
being useful for once!

17:09.240 --> 17:10.530
And you're already folding?!

17:12.030 --> 17:16.020
Is someone this soft really capable 
of winning that endurance contest?!

17:16.020 --> 17:17.770
You gutless wimp!

17:17.770 --> 17:22.060
Being crushed by a hydra while taking 
verbal abuse from a scumbag...

17:22.420 --> 17:23.990
This is absolutely...

17:24.700 --> 17:26.370
delightful!

17:26.770 --> 17:29.510
Put your backs into it! 
Darkness can't take much more!

17:29.510 --> 17:32.520
Don't screw with Axel's 
adventurers, scaleface!

17:32.520 --> 17:33.420
The others...

17:34.680 --> 17:35.900
Kazuma.

17:35.900 --> 17:38.780
Don't worry. When we die, 
we'll go together...

17:38.780 --> 17:40.510
I am very worried!

17:40.510 --> 17:44.650
Quit giving up! There's no way you'd die 
from a hydra flopping on top of you!

17:44.650 --> 17:47.150
I'm the only one who's gonna 
get smooshed to death!

17:49.740 --> 17:53.300
If I give up, Kazuma dies?

17:54.380 --> 17:57.170
Wha... What is this?

18:01.340 --> 18:06.290
You're ordering me around like a master...

18:06.290 --> 18:11.690
When your very life is in my hands... 
The contradiction of it!

18:12.430 --> 18:16.100
Which one of us is truly the 
master in this situation?!

18:16.100 --> 18:19.360
I've never felt this before! 
What novel stimulation, Kazuma!

18:26.440 --> 18:28.940
I think the hydra's getting weaker!

18:29.720 --> 18:32.240
I'm gonna collect that big-time bounty!

18:32.240 --> 18:34.970
Reward goes to whoever 
lands the finishing blow!

18:34.970 --> 18:37.480
What the hell are you saying 
at a time like this?!

18:37.480 --> 18:39.220
Nobody's getting a cut of my loo—

18:39.510 --> 18:43.470
Dust!

18:43.770 --> 18:47.040
Light of Saber!

18:49.220 --> 18:50.740
Look!

18:51.270 --> 18:53.230
Its head isn't regenerating!

18:53.500 --> 18:56.110
Wizards!

18:56.530 --> 19:00.260
A looming tide of sorrows... 
An overflowing swell of screams...

18:59.370 --> 19:01.360
Incoming Explosion magic!

19:00.260 --> 19:04.940
Coiling into one another, forming the 
howling gyre that marks our victory!

19:01.360 --> 19:03.020
Everybody get clear!

19:04.940 --> 19:08.620
Let the signal of oblivion now descend!

19:09.240 --> 19:13.410
This is my offering to the deceased. 
May he rest in peace...

19:14.960 --> 19:16.380
Vengeance for Kazuma!

19:16.380 --> 19:18.380
Hey! I'm still alive!

19:18.830 --> 19:21.130
Explosion!

19:31.640 --> 19:32.890
Yeah!

19:34.890 --> 19:38.130
Pretty crazy what you can pull 
off when you get desperate, huh?

19:38.130 --> 19:40.400
Kazuma, you guys can take a 
bigger cut of the reward!

19:40.800 --> 19:44.500
Might as well take the entire cut of the 
idiot who tried to cheat everyone else, too.

19:45.060 --> 19:48.170
Maybe we shouldn't have resurrected you.

19:47.050 --> 19:49.820
How does it feel to have 
finally killed that hydra?

19:50.130 --> 19:52.000
You gonna sleep better now?

19:52.570 --> 19:55.710
I will. I'm feeling better 
about a few things now.

19:55.710 --> 19:59.840
So much that my troubles 
seem foolish in hindsight.

20:01.360 --> 20:05.020
Not because of the hydra being gone, though.

20:05.370 --> 20:08.950
I'm just reminded of how much

20:08.140 --> 20:10.130
How about a "Thank you, Aqua-sama"?!

20:08.950 --> 20:11.330
I love the people of this town.

20:10.130 --> 20:11.330
No fair!

20:11.330 --> 20:12.860
I've no more doubts about that.

20:13.590 --> 20:15.980
You spout some really 
embarrassing stuff sometimes...

20:18.160 --> 20:21.050
I'm truly blessed.

20:23.480 --> 20:26.210
Gimme more deference!

20:26.210 --> 20:30.800
I expect a lot more thanks 
for that resurrection!

20:30.800 --> 20:34.540
Damn it, Kazuma! Your priest is 
being a huge pain in the ass!

20:38.000 --> 20:40.110
We're home!

20:38.520 --> 20:40.630
Welcome back!

20:41.000 --> 20:44.390
Darkness! You come back early?

20:44.960 --> 20:47.530
Oh? I don't see her anywhere.

20:47.530 --> 20:48.890
Is she in her room?

20:48.890 --> 20:51.680
Time for more drinks in the comfort of home!

20:51.680 --> 20:54.990
Get Darkness down here right now!

20:54.100 --> 20:55.390
Kazuma...

20:57.780 --> 20:58.650
What's that?

20:59.270 --> 21:00.640
Whatcha got there?

21:01.210 --> 21:04.220
"Forgive me for suddenly..."

21:04.220 --> 21:05.400
Whoa, what the—

21:06.020 --> 21:09.910
<i>Forgive me for suddenly 
springing this on you.</i>

21:10.280 --> 21:12.020
<i>The situation has become rather complex.</i>

21:12.720 --> 21:16.280
<i>I realize this is selfish, 
but I need to leave the party.</i>

21:16.680 --> 21:20.930
<i>I ask that you find a new front line 
fighter for the group.</i>

21:21.790 --> 21:23.420
<i>I'm very grateful to the three of you.</i>

21:24.090 --> 21:27.680
<i>So much that I could never fully express it.</i>

21:28.310 --> 21:31.550
<i>Aqua, Megumin, Kazuma...</i>

21:32.280 --> 21:38.850
<i>Our adventures have been the most 
enjoyable moments of my entire life.</i>

21:39.870 --> 21:45.700
<i>I don't think I will ever forget 
the days we spent together.</i>

21:46.820 --> 21:48.650
<i>Thank you for everything.</i>

21:49.860 --> 21:52.120
<i>from Lalatina Dustiness Ford,</i>

21:53.010 --> 21:56.520
<i>to my beloved companions, 
with deep gratitude.</i>

23:29.970 --> 23:39.970
End of the line starts here!
 Teehee, you can look forward to what we've got!
 Probably doesn't make sense to open a letter like this.
 It's actually my business's slogan.
 Business has been picking up,
and we're actually about to open up a third location!
 It's been a long road, but I think
I'm ready to dedicate myself to this endeavor!
Now, how about some jellied slime as a snack?
 Well, Devil King...
Teehee, you can look forward to what we've got!


23:29.970 --> 23:39.970
<b>Episode 9: A Talking-To for This Runaway!</b>

23:30.960 --> 23:33.540
End of the line starts here!

23:33.900 --> 23:36.100
Teehee, you can look forward 
to what we've got!

23:36.100 --> 23:38.040
Probably doesn't make sense 
to open a letter like this.

23:38.040 --> 23:40.770
It's actually my business's sloga—
