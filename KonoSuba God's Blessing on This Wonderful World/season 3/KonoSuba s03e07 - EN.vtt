00:00.850 --> 00:02.840
Adventurer Satou Kazuma-san.

00:03.310 --> 00:09.480
Here is your grand bounty for taking 
down the Devil King's General Sylvia...

00:10.040 --> 00:11.970
Three hundred million eris!

00:12.990 --> 00:15.490
You're our guild's ace at this point!

00:15.490 --> 00:17.840
He was a big deal in the capital, too!

00:17.640 --> 00:19.770
Thank you, thank you!

00:17.840 --> 00:20.550
He used to have trouble beating a toad!

00:20.550 --> 00:24.750
Nah, I knew that Kazuma 
had it in him all along!

00:24.750 --> 00:27.770
All of that while in the 
weakest class! Damn!

00:27.770 --> 00:31.620
Come on, folks, flattery isn't 
gonna get you anything.

00:32.270 --> 00:33.740
Except maybe...

00:34.440 --> 00:38.760
A round of the best bubbly this joint has!

00:41.760 --> 00:44.120
Kazuma-san, marry me!

00:43.320 --> 00:44.690
You're on!

00:44.120 --> 00:46.030
Take care of me!

00:45.280 --> 00:46.520
Gladly!

00:56.910 --> 01:05.340
<b>KONOSUBA!
God's Blessing on this Wonderful World! 3</b>

02:16.150 --> 02:32.750
<b>One Week Later</b>

02:18.230 --> 02:21.040
Who's responsible for this meal?!

02:21.040 --> 02:23.430
Tell the chef that Satou Kazuma,

02:23.430 --> 02:28.620
the famous collector of multiple 
bounties, is calling for him!

02:28.620 --> 02:32.750
The beautiful arch priest 
Aqua is calling for him, too!

02:32.750 --> 02:39.630
<b>Episode 7:  Rest for This Up-And-Coming Adventurer!</b>

02:35.330 --> 02:39.630
I-Is there a problem, sir?

02:40.390 --> 02:44.700
Oh, no, I merely wanted to offer 
my compliments for the cuisine.

02:44.700 --> 02:46.310
The impression you've made on my tongue,

02:46.310 --> 02:49.640
which has dined upon castle 
finery, is quite remarkable.

02:48.760 --> 02:51.620
Th-Thank you very much.

02:54.770 --> 02:58.530
You used wine as the secret 
ingredient in this stew, didn't you?

03:01.730 --> 03:05.900
A red wine, from the tartness. The vintage...

03:06.200 --> 03:10.040
I'd say a 30-year-old Romanée-Continue.

03:11.660 --> 03:12.940
Am I right?

03:12.940 --> 03:14.780
We actually use bargain-priced bottles.

03:22.460 --> 03:23.760
I see.

03:24.090 --> 03:28.500
Well, it's impressive you managed to get 
this kind of flavor from the cheap stuff.

03:28.500 --> 03:31.930
Thank you very much for the praise.

03:32.490 --> 03:34.530
I enjoyed the stew,

03:34.830 --> 03:37.560
but what really had my tongue 
in ecstasy was this fish.

03:37.990 --> 03:40.650
If I had to describe the flavor...

03:44.210 --> 03:48.040
It's like sneaking into the 
room of the girl you love,

03:48.040 --> 03:51.330
and upon excitedly opening her 
closet, out pops a mimic!

03:51.330 --> 03:55.050
It had that kind of explosive, 
unpredictable impact.

03:56.100 --> 03:58.270
Do you understand what I mean, chef?

03:58.270 --> 03:59.560
No, sir, I sure don't.

04:06.730 --> 04:07.950
I see.

04:08.490 --> 04:10.400
Well, it's super good!

04:10.400 --> 04:13.960
The adventurer, Satou Kazuma, 
gives this establishment three stars.

04:13.960 --> 04:16.490
That's three from me, too.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.180
Thank you both so much.

04:18.180 --> 04:22.130
I'll endeavor to earn four stars 
the next time you eat here.

04:22.130 --> 04:23.690
How bold of you!

04:23.980 --> 04:26.160
And here is your reward for a job well done.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.870
You can keep the change for your tip.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.210
Thanks for the meal.

04:31.210 --> 04:36.450
That comes out to exact change, 
but we'd be happy to have you again.

04:38.720 --> 04:41.180
That chef was a good sport! I like him.

04:41.180 --> 04:45.450
Maybe I'll order that place's 
best bubbly tomorrow.

04:45.450 --> 04:46.800
Now, now.

04:46.800 --> 04:50.740
We have reservations at the place with the 
phantom menu tomorrow, remember?

04:50.740 --> 04:52.100
Oopsie!

04:57.570 --> 04:58.610
We're h—

04:58.610 --> 04:59.570
...ome?!

04:59.840 --> 05:03.110
There you go. That's what you wanted, isn't it?

05:03.110 --> 05:05.940
You're such a perverted Crusader.

05:05.940 --> 05:08.710
I will not submit, no matter what you do!

05:12.610 --> 05:14.470
Don't close the door! You two!

05:14.470 --> 05:16.760
It's not what you think! 
Don't get the wrong idea!

05:16.760 --> 05:18.720
No, no, it's cool!

05:18.720 --> 05:21.450
Aqua and I are gonna go grab another meal!

05:21.450 --> 05:24.570
Hell, you can have the house to 
yourselves tonight if you want!

05:24.570 --> 05:28.230
The Axis Order recognizes all 
manner of romantic relations.

05:28.230 --> 05:30.150
Do you two need blessing magic, or...

05:30.150 --> 05:32.800
You don't understand at all!

05:32.800 --> 05:34.300
KONOSUBA!

05:38.310 --> 05:41.740
I was helping her prepare for 
the endurance competition.

05:42.070 --> 05:43.540
Endurance competition?

05:44.700 --> 05:46.800
Darkness is apparently the reigning champion

05:46.800 --> 05:49.290
of the annual endurance competition 
that's held every summer.

05:49.290 --> 05:51.920
Kn-Knock it off!

05:51.230 --> 05:53.920
You should practice at Darkness's place.

05:53.920 --> 05:56.080
It's really hot in here now.

05:56.080 --> 05:59.670
My father hasn't been well lately...

05:59.670 --> 06:03.170
If he found out what his single 
daughter has been up to...

06:03.170 --> 06:05.900
The worry could affect him adversely...

06:05.900 --> 06:08.760
That sounds like you already 
tried it at his place.

06:09.920 --> 06:12.170
Since I've leveled up compared to last year,

06:12.170 --> 06:14.640
my resistance to heat seems 
to have increased, too.

06:14.640 --> 06:17.170
Sorry, Kazuma, but could you...

06:17.820 --> 06:18.900
Kazuma?

06:18.900 --> 06:22.580
Now what does this remind me of?

06:23.100 --> 06:24.150
What're you—

06:25.920 --> 06:27.910
O-Oh, that...

06:27.910 --> 06:33.410
Well, well, if it isn't Darkness-san, who had 
so much fun making a fool of me at the capital.

06:34.620 --> 06:38.000
And just look at the state you're in!

06:38.530 --> 06:41.420
J-Just kill me!

06:41.790 --> 06:44.410
KONOSUBA!

06:47.450 --> 06:51.280
Kazuma took advantage of 
my overheated body...

06:51.280 --> 06:52.820
Whoa, watch your phrasing.

06:52.820 --> 06:54.560
All I did was tickle you 
until you passed out!

06:54.560 --> 06:59.930
My goodness, what happened to the 
proud Darkness we saw in the capital?

06:59.930 --> 07:01.360
What <i>is</i> that?

07:01.360 --> 07:04.490
Oh, curious already?

07:04.490 --> 07:08.310
Okay, I can enlighten you! Get a load of this!

07:08.600 --> 07:11.200
This is... a dragon egg.

07:11.200 --> 07:12.690
A dragon?!

07:13.160 --> 07:16.110
The other day, when I was home alone...

07:17.150 --> 07:19.970
It's an honor to meet you!

07:19.970 --> 07:21.830
And you are...

07:21.830 --> 07:24.690
I'm the man who's been 
seeking out adventurers

07:24.690 --> 07:28.690
capable of tangling with the Devil 
King's forces, such as yourselves!

07:28.690 --> 07:32.430
And I'm amazed to find out 
you're so beautiful, as well!

07:32.430 --> 07:37.590
Well, it's true that you won't 
find many who can compare to me.

07:39.150 --> 07:42.920
To you, who faces down the forces of evil 
with no thought for her own safety,

07:42.920 --> 07:45.160
I'd like to offer this.

07:45.810 --> 07:46.950
What is it?

07:46.950 --> 07:49.790
What I have here is a dragon's egg!

07:49.790 --> 07:50.980
A dragon's?!

07:50.980 --> 07:54.690
Indeed! Not something that can be 
acquired purely through wealth,

07:54.690 --> 07:57.890
but something I would like 
to deliver into your hands

07:57.890 --> 08:00.460
for your upcoming conflict 
with the Devil King.

08:00.460 --> 08:05.380
Aren't dragon eggs the kind of thing that 
usually go for hundreds of millions?

08:05.380 --> 08:07.890
Oh, you misunderstand! You see..

08:07.890 --> 08:12.710
It's my intention to leave it in 
your incredibly capable hands!

08:12.710 --> 08:14.350
That said...

08:14.350 --> 08:15.380
That said?

08:15.380 --> 08:17.350
No one here, no one there.

08:17.350 --> 08:20.070
There are... considerations.

08:21.700 --> 08:24.390
You didn't buy it, did you?

08:24.390 --> 08:25.980
Sure did!

08:25.980 --> 08:29.370
He said I could have it for 
whatever cash I had on me.

08:29.370 --> 08:31.640
What a deal!

08:33.150 --> 08:35.150
I've given him a name, too.

08:35.150 --> 08:37.240
Zeltman Kingsford.

08:37.700 --> 08:43.510
And since I'm raising him, he's bound to 
become emperor of all dragons someday.

08:43.510 --> 08:45.790
Call him Emperor Zel.

08:48.230 --> 08:49.640
You idiot!

08:52.550 --> 08:53.600
Good morning!

08:53.600 --> 08:55.100
Hey, good morning.

08:54.090 --> 08:55.560
This is ridiculous.

08:55.560 --> 08:59.790
And I'm worried about Emperor Zel. 
Let's get this over with so I can get home.

08:59.790 --> 09:01.040
You mean your chicken?

09:01.040 --> 09:04.430
He's not a chicken! He's a dragon!

09:02.240 --> 09:04.870
Nah, he's a chicken.

09:04.870 --> 09:08.950
And he has a lovely name, 
Emperor Zel, which I gave him!

09:08.950 --> 09:10.440
Yeah, yeah.

09:10.440 --> 09:13.190
But we've got important stuff 
to take care of today.

09:14.950 --> 09:17.550
Open up! Open up!

09:17.550 --> 09:20.770
Your most important 
business partner is here!

09:20.770 --> 09:23.130
Now open this door right now!

09:23.130 --> 09:25.210
Do you realize what time it is?!

09:25.470 --> 09:28.410
This place is always busy in the afternoon.

09:28.410 --> 09:31.000
We're doing you a favor by coming over first 
thing in the morning. You're welcome.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.030
Consider the nuisance you're being to 
the neighbors, you absolute menace!

09:35.830 --> 09:38.520
This is about the boy's reward, I take it?

09:38.520 --> 09:40.220
Come inside and give me a moment.

09:40.430 --> 09:42.220
<b>KONOSUBA</b>

09:40.430 --> 09:42.220
KONOSUBA!

09:42.710 --> 09:44.200
Your payment, as promised.

09:46.970 --> 09:48.210
You should be grateful!

09:48.210 --> 09:50.010
Say, "Thank you very much

09:50.010 --> 09:54.090
for taking the time to meet 
with a puny demon like me!"

09:54.090 --> 09:55.250
Cease your prattle!

09:55.250 --> 09:58.750
Should I curse you to make 
your rear end produce aloe?!

09:58.750 --> 10:00.130
This establishment's overworked owner

10:00.130 --> 10:02.480
is resting in the back room 
after a string of all-nighters!

10:02.480 --> 10:04.330
Try to be quiet.

10:04.710 --> 10:06.460
Has business really been that good?

10:06.460 --> 10:10.430
Indeed. There's been no shortage 
of laughter to be had.

10:10.430 --> 10:12.180
I've had an epiphany.

10:12.180 --> 10:13.040
About what?

10:13.040 --> 10:18.470
How to prevent our troublesome little 
entrepeneur from incurring further debt.

10:18.800 --> 10:21.720
Thank you for your patronage!

10:21.720 --> 10:23.720
What I realized was that it's when

10:22.260 --> 10:23.730
Thank you!

10:23.720 --> 10:27.490
she has free time on her hands that she 
inevitably starts causing problems,

10:27.490 --> 10:31.040
so I've endeavored to ensure that she 
has been occupied 24 hours a day,

10:28.400 --> 10:29.710
Thank you!

10:31.040 --> 10:33.720
without even a moment for a 
meal. It's gone swimmingly!

10:34.150 --> 10:38.290
Two weeks had passed without any 
trouble, but then she began to suddenly

10:36.590 --> 10:42.660
Thank. You. Very. Much. 
Thank. You. Very. Much.

10:38.290 --> 10:42.090
crying or laughing, 
among other such outbursts,

10:42.660 --> 10:45.750
which is hardly a condition 
fit for customer service.

10:43.080 --> 10:51.040
Thank... you... very... much...

10:45.750 --> 10:47.350
Hence, she is resting.

10:48.640 --> 10:51.190
Come on over! Come on over to this side!

10:51.540 --> 10:55.640
I know liches are immortal, 
but that's just brutal.

10:56.170 --> 10:57.840
Incidentally...

10:58.560 --> 11:00.710
You, the woman who was tormented 
by her flushed body,

11:00.710 --> 11:02.230
who spent her nights—

11:03.070 --> 11:03.830
Whoa, what did she do?!

11:03.830 --> 11:05.790
Finish your sentence! Now I've gotta know!

11:05.790 --> 11:07.820
Shut up! Stop talking, Kazuma!

11:08.350 --> 11:12.060
Ah, such intense swells of negative, 
shameful emotions. Delectable.

11:12.060 --> 11:16.450
Armor girl. The shadow of 
destruction is around you.

11:19.800 --> 11:23.690
The presence of that irritatingly 
bright lumi-nuisance of a woman

11:23.690 --> 11:27.660
is making the future hard to see, but I 
owe you lot for this turn of good business.

11:27.660 --> 11:30.130
Allow me to give you a reading.

11:31.860 --> 11:35.390
Wait, "lumi-nuisance"? 
Were you referring to me?

11:35.390 --> 11:38.170
Who else could I be referring to, 
you bright-yet-dim bulb?

11:38.680 --> 11:41.260
You and your stupid-looking mask!

11:40.420 --> 11:41.860
Cease this!

11:41.860 --> 11:43.530
Keep your holy mitts off the mask!

11:42.430 --> 11:44.230
The shadow of destruction?

11:43.530 --> 11:45.600
Always trying to act so cool...

11:45.210 --> 11:49.430
Hey, forget about that! What were you 
about to call Darkness?! I need details!

11:52.670 --> 11:54.970
<i>I think you smashed a molar...</i>

11:54.970 --> 11:59.310
There, there, you're gonna be okay...

11:55.180 --> 11:58.170
Now, I'm going to ask you some questions.

11:58.780 --> 12:03.030
They may make you uncomfortable, 
but do answer honestly.

12:06.370 --> 12:07.620
Now, then...

12:07.900 --> 12:09.440
I ask you.

12:09.960 --> 12:15.740
Why is it that you, a Crusader, have been 
trying to lighten your armor as of late?

12:16.180 --> 12:22.750
Because I'm so clumsy, I thought that it 
might help make my attacks more accurate.

12:24.080 --> 12:26.650
You were actually trying to come 
up with a solution, Darkness!

12:26.970 --> 12:29.520
I told you to answer honestly.

12:32.180 --> 12:36.760
I-It's just... lately my abs have 
become even more well-defined...

12:37.810 --> 12:39.020
so I wanted...

12:39.820 --> 12:41.020
to make...

12:42.020 --> 12:43.200
my armor lighter...

12:44.020 --> 12:45.650
<i>She's shredded now?!</i>

12:45.650 --> 12:48.530
Very good. Now, I ask you.

12:49.080 --> 12:51.980
Could you explain why you 
took the wizard's dress,

12:51.980 --> 12:55.070
which had been left in the laundry 
basket outside the baths,

12:55.890 --> 13:04.060
and sneakily held it up to your 
body, muttering, "No, no way"?

13:00.010 --> 13:02.120
No. No way.

13:04.060 --> 13:08.700
Not only that, but despite your claims, 
you observed yourself in the mirror,

13:08.700 --> 13:12.810
tilting your head and smiling. Why is this?

13:13.970 --> 13:18.810
C-Cute clothes don't suit me! 
And even buying them is embarrassing!

13:18.810 --> 13:22.760
But... I caught a glimpse of it, and...

13:23.570 --> 13:26.580
I thought... I could see what it'd look like...

13:28.980 --> 13:33.330
I-I'm sorry that a brutish, 
musclebound woman like me

13:33.330 --> 13:38.530
held up such cute clothing to her 
body on an impulse! I'm so sorry!

13:38.530 --> 13:39.950
Forgive me!

13:38.530 --> 13:42.850
I don't think you'd look bad in 
a one-piece at all, Darkness!

13:42.850 --> 13:44.900
You looked great in dresses before.

13:44.900 --> 13:48.350
Where's the problem in you trying 
on cute clothes in private?

13:48.600 --> 13:49.440
Come on!

13:54.960 --> 13:56.360
Now, in conclusion...

13:56.360 --> 14:00.240
Why, despite realizing that boy is 
watching you with lecherous eyes,

14:00.240 --> 14:03.090
do you choose clothes that 
accentuate your body's lines—

14:03.090 --> 14:07.150
D-Do I really need to answer these 
for my fortune to be read?!

14:08.180 --> 14:12.640
When did I say the questions 
had anything to do with that?

14:13.770 --> 14:16.950
You need only touch the crystal 
ball for me to read your fortune.

14:16.950 --> 14:18.400
The questions were mere conversa—

14:18.400 --> 14:20.250
I'll kill you!

14:20.250 --> 14:22.660
D-Do not touch the mask!

14:23.720 --> 14:24.850
I was right.

14:25.270 --> 14:27.460
The shadow of destruction is around you.

14:27.860 --> 14:32.650
Your family home, and your father, 
are going to encounter disaster.

14:34.550 --> 14:39.350
Given your dull mind, you are likely to 
do something rash and self-destructive

14:39.350 --> 14:41.710
in an effort to resolve this.

14:42.210 --> 14:44.650
But your sacrifice will be in vain.

14:45.030 --> 14:49.030
Yes, it's clear to me that nothing 
you do can resolve this.

14:50.540 --> 14:53.540
It may be most wise to abandon 
everything and flee.

14:53.540 --> 14:55.930
Perhaps you could take this 
shrinking violet of a man,

14:55.930 --> 14:59.710
who doesn't make a move despite thinking, 
"I bet she'd say yes if I went for it,"

14:59.710 --> 15:01.460
and elope to the ends of 
the world to start over.

15:01.460 --> 15:04.590
Okay, hold it! Seriously, stop!

15:04.590 --> 15:06.220
It feels like every time you open your mouth,

15:06.220 --> 15:09.800
you're sabotaging my relationships 
with my friends!

15:10.510 --> 15:11.560
Vanir.

15:12.550 --> 15:14.630
Thank you for the fortune.

15:15.440 --> 15:18.680
If nothing else, I'll keep it in mind.

15:19.890 --> 15:25.200
Kazuma, with all that money, we won't 
be accepting quests for a while, right?

15:25.530 --> 15:28.050
I'm not too worried about the fortune,

15:28.050 --> 15:30.700
but it has been a while since I've 
seen my father. I'll go visit him.

15:30.700 --> 15:32.190
S-Sure...

15:36.520 --> 15:37.460
Boy.

15:41.650 --> 15:43.960
<i>One more piece of prophecy.</i>

15:45.280 --> 15:49.040
<i>You should not rest idle upon your payment.</i>

15:49.040 --> 15:52.760
<i>It'd be wise to continue devising 
new, marketable merchandise.</i>

15:52.760 --> 15:58.360
<i>I told the girl that there's nothing 
she can do about her fate...</i>

15:58.940 --> 16:04.700
<i>But, effort dependent, 
that may not prove true for you.</i>

16:07.220 --> 16:09.230
Gotcha!

16:12.190 --> 16:13.580
So much for that.

16:26.220 --> 16:29.960
You don't shed even though it's summer, huh?

16:32.210 --> 16:33.690
Kazuma!

16:33.690 --> 16:35.590
What the hell?! Don't startle me like that!

16:35.860 --> 16:38.090
Let's collect the bounty 
placed on this monster!

16:38.550 --> 16:41.000
You do realize you're an 
unmarried noble lady, right?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.800
Isn't staying out all night kinda risque?

16:42.800 --> 16:45.180
Idiot! That's not what I did!

16:45.180 --> 16:46.060
More importantly...

16:46.440 --> 16:48.670
A Kowloon Hydra?

16:48.670 --> 16:50.820
The bounty on it is massive!

16:51.390 --> 16:56.570
It had been sleeping at the bottom of a 
lake, and has only recently awakened.

16:56.570 --> 16:58.780
And you wanna hunt this thing?

16:58.780 --> 17:01.800
Maybe finish waking up before 
suggesting stuff like that.

17:01.800 --> 17:04.330
You don't care about defending Axel?!

17:08.040 --> 17:12.680
Satou Kazuma, hero who has slain 
the generals of the Devil King.

17:12.680 --> 17:15.720
Come! This is your call to action!

17:18.690 --> 17:23.040
You think you can just call me a hero 
and I'm gonna jump into action?

17:23.040 --> 17:24.880
We've got plenty of money!

17:24.880 --> 17:29.380
Is that it? Can't you think of 
a better way to motivate me?!

17:30.600 --> 17:35.600
We've known each other a long time! 
You probably have an idea, right?!

17:37.180 --> 17:41.650
F-Fine. Upon completion of the quest...

17:41.650 --> 17:43.430
As a reward...

17:43.430 --> 17:44.390
I'll...

17:44.390 --> 17:45.630
What is it?

17:45.630 --> 17:47.750
What are you gonna do for me?

17:48.090 --> 17:50.620
A-A kiss on the cheek...

17:53.190 --> 17:54.150
Hell no.

17:55.890 --> 17:58.790
You think I'm gonna risk my life, 
at this point, for a little kiss?

17:58.790 --> 18:00.880
L-Little?!

18:01.650 --> 18:03.400
Check it out, Chomusuke.

18:03.400 --> 18:10.070
I think this lady believes her kisses 
are worth risking your life for!

18:10.070 --> 18:13.010
Isn't that the most self-absorbed 
thing you've ever heard?

18:14.590 --> 18:18.280
Y-You worm! I was trying to be nice!

18:18.280 --> 18:21.110
Whoa, knock it off! No violence!

18:38.550 --> 18:42.380
Will you... really not do it?

18:51.200 --> 18:55.450
You have gotten better... 
at crocodile tears!

18:56.060 --> 19:00.690
No! I don't wanna fight a hydra!

19:00.690 --> 19:03.750
Why's Darkness after the bounty anyway?!

19:03.750 --> 19:06.870
Did her family really lose all their money?!

19:08.010 --> 19:10.140
Hydras happen to be a class of dragon!

19:10.140 --> 19:13.110
Once it's gone, I can proudly 
claim the title of Dragon Slayer!

19:13.110 --> 19:15.960
At long last, the epithet I've 
long desired shall be mine!

19:15.960 --> 19:18.470
When Emperor Zel hatches, 
we'll have a dragon in the house!

19:18.470 --> 19:21.070
Why do you want such a scary title?!

19:21.070 --> 19:25.470
Besides, I don't like leaving him at Wiz's store!

19:25.470 --> 19:28.830
Why is this happening? Why is this happening?!

19:26.090 --> 19:27.810
What do you want?

19:27.810 --> 19:31.350
We don't know anyone else willing to do 
something as stupid as help hatch an egg.

19:28.830 --> 19:31.360
Why, why, why?!

19:31.350 --> 19:36.600
I'm worried about the bad influence of 
letting a lich and a demon egg-sit him!

19:36.940 --> 19:42.370
Listen. When dragons are eggs, 
the longer their parent cares for them,

19:42.370 --> 19:46.490
the more magic power and 
parental traits they will develop!

19:46.970 --> 19:50.000
I wanted him to be a sacred white dragon.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.730
What if all that darkness they've got turns 
him into a black dragon or something?

19:50.000 --> 19:54.990
Thank. You. Very. Much.

19:56.840 --> 19:59.630
Then we had better beat this 
hydra fast and head home.

20:00.120 --> 20:02.060
Fine, then!

20:02.060 --> 20:03.940
I'm gonna get out there!

20:03.940 --> 20:07.510
But if Megumin's magic doesn't work, 
I'm gonna run right home!

20:07.510 --> 20:10.510
Okay, let's get this show on the road!

20:15.030 --> 20:20.030
Is she actually purifying the lake? 
It looks like she's just swimming around.

20:21.160 --> 20:24.540
Monsters apparently don't like clean water.

20:25.290 --> 20:28.460
If Aqua purifies the lake, 
it should lure the hydra out,

20:28.460 --> 20:30.060
and you can make with the Explosion magic.

20:30.060 --> 20:31.410
H-Hey...

20:31.650 --> 20:34.320
I think Aqua is napping 
on the surface of the lake

20:34.320 --> 20:36.670
where the dangerous wanted 
monster is lurking!

20:38.670 --> 20:41.930
Maybe we should've tied something to her 
to make sure she doesn't float away?

20:44.190 --> 20:45.310
Incoming!

20:45.310 --> 20:47.610
I can sense an incredible 
magic power rising!

20:47.610 --> 20:52.320
Aqua! Wake up already! Come on!

20:52.320 --> 20:55.030
Aqua! Look down! Down below!

20:52.920 --> 20:55.630
Aqua! Aqua!

20:52.920 --> 20:55.940
Aqua! Wake up!

20:55.030 --> 20:57.350
Get out the water, fast!

20:55.630 --> 20:58.060
What's all the racket?

20:57.350 --> 20:58.720
Move!

20:58.060 --> 21:01.210
Hey, the water is looking pretty clean now.

21:01.510 --> 21:04.390
I guess I can get out of the...

21:05.190 --> 21:07.660
Kazuma-san! Kazuma-san!

21:07.660 --> 21:11.210
Something really huge is coming right at me!

21:18.140 --> 21:20.710
No! I wanna go home!

21:20.710 --> 21:24.850
I wanna go home right now!

21:25.330 --> 21:27.530
Aqua!

21:27.530 --> 21:28.430
This isn't good!

21:28.430 --> 21:30.960
I can't use Explosion magic 
if she's still there!

21:42.230 --> 21:46.850
Kazuma-san! Kazuma-san!

21:46.850 --> 21:52.270
I wanna go home!

21:54.420 --> 21:58.180
<i>This is really bad!</i>

21:54.840 --> 22:00.000
Wanna go home, wanna go home, wanna go home!

23:30.010 --> 23:40.010
Verdia here!
 You mentioned Satou Kazuma?
 I hear about his antics every now and then.
Surprised to find out he's still alive.
 Makes me wonder how many times he's been resurrected.
Seems unfair! Granted, if a priest used Resurrection on me,
it'd just do a bunch of damage! It's also crazy to hear about
how that weirdly sturdy Crusader woman is still in one piece.
 What kind of party consists entirely of crazy people like that?
 Are they even worse than the Devil King's Army?
Oops, pardon me. Obviously, the craziest ones of all
are those of us in your army! Well, Devil King,
do look after yourself. Striiiiiiike!
