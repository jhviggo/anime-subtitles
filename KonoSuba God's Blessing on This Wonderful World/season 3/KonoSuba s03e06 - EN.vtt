00:01.090 --> 00:02.830
<i>Some Divine Treasure this was.</i>

00:04.690 --> 00:07.780
<i>Who'd have thought it'd wear off so soon?</i>

00:11.240 --> 00:15.980
Eris-sama! I'm not into 
this kind of teasing!

00:15.990 --> 00:20.470
<b>Episode 6: A Farewell to This Lavish Lifestyle!</b>

00:16.620 --> 00:17.940
Hey, Kazuma.

00:17.630 --> 00:18.900
Yes, I'm Kazuma.

00:17.940 --> 00:19.500
You love calling me an idiot,

00:19.500 --> 00:21.860
but now I can be sure of something...

00:22.180 --> 00:25.380
You're, like, an idiot of the 
highest caliber, aren't you?

00:25.380 --> 00:26.900
It's not like that!

00:26.900 --> 00:29.620
Walking around the castle, everyone 
was waiting on me hand and foot,

00:29.620 --> 00:33.700
so I started thinking I could 
get away with anything!

00:33.700 --> 00:36.880
So you're stupid?! You really 
oughta think about what you did!

00:36.880 --> 00:39.610
<i>Even Iris was furious with me!</i>

00:39.610 --> 00:42.800
<i>I dunno if big brother can go on living!</i>

00:42.800 --> 00:45.020
Oh, look, it's the big talker.

00:45.020 --> 00:47.380
What could have possessed Lady Dustiness

00:47.380 --> 00:49.330
to associate with someone like that?

00:49.330 --> 00:50.940
Absolutely!

00:50.940 --> 00:53.410
Princess Iris has already 
retired for the night.

00:53.680 --> 00:55.520
Y-Yeah?

00:55.520 --> 01:00.030
This is goodbye. 
You're free to enjoy the party.

01:00.510 --> 01:03.400
Assuming you have the nerve to do so.

01:05.560 --> 01:06.650
KONOSUBA.

01:06.650 --> 01:08.930
Damn it all!

01:08.930 --> 01:10.470
What is that chick's problem?!

01:10.470 --> 01:12.540
Even at the very end, 
she has to get some digs in!

01:12.540 --> 01:13.880
I mean, sure, it's my fault!

01:13.880 --> 01:16.460
I'm even willing to admit that, but still!

01:16.460 --> 01:20.810
I just wanted to stay in the castle longer!

01:27.690 --> 01:30.440
You can keep asking, 
but my answer isn't gonna change.

01:30.780 --> 01:33.330
Now, now, don't be like that.

01:34.240 --> 01:38.640
I may as well tell you. The Divine Treasure 
that swaps bodies is in the castle.

01:39.020 --> 01:41.710
But I don't see what's so dangerous about it.

01:42.740 --> 01:47.330
The thing is, once the bodies 
that's been swapped gets killed,

01:47.330 --> 01:49.230
the change becomes permanent.

01:49.230 --> 01:50.480
What?!

01:50.480 --> 01:55.780
It has the potential to 
allow someone to live forever.

01:55.780 --> 01:57.990
Once your body ages,

01:57.990 --> 02:00.470
you find a young, healthy 
person to switch with,

02:00.470 --> 02:03.020
and kill them once you're in their body.

02:03.020 --> 02:06.280
That's pretty messed up! 
Maybe we should tell someone—

02:06.280 --> 02:08.140
I wouldn't.

02:08.140 --> 02:10.480
If people find out about 
the Divine Treasure's power,

02:10.480 --> 02:12.500
what do you think will happen?

02:14.290 --> 02:15.570
I guarantee it.

02:16.100 --> 02:19.860
Nobles from all over the 
country would come after it.

02:20.410 --> 02:23.290
Eternal life, huh?

02:25.080 --> 02:30.240
I'm sharing this with you because 
I'm confident you wouldn't misuse it.

02:30.240 --> 02:34.240
<i>Huh? Does she seriously trust me that much?</i>

02:34.240 --> 02:38.630
So, you're playmates with 
the princess, right?

02:39.800 --> 02:43.380
You wanna go play with her right now?

02:44.320 --> 02:45.370
Huh?

02:49.460 --> 02:50.640
Looking good.

02:51.060 --> 02:54.260
With the celebratory party, 
security seems light.

02:54.710 --> 02:56.010
True.

02:56.010 --> 02:58.390
Hey. What are you wearing?

02:58.760 --> 03:01.540
You think you're the only one 
who gets to hide their identity?

03:01.930 --> 03:06.030
A sketchy employee from a magic 
item shop gave this mask to me.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.530
It's supposed to be one 
of their hottest items.

03:08.530 --> 03:09.960
Oh?

03:09.960 --> 03:14.000
Well, minion, are you ready to go?

03:14.000 --> 03:17.380
Ready when you are, Big Lady.

03:18.970 --> 03:21.380
Could you not call me that?

03:21.660 --> 03:24.610
Then maybe you shouldn't call me "minion."

03:25.150 --> 03:29.360
I'm the one who made a name for 
herself as a noble thief in the capital.

03:30.610 --> 03:34.100
Why don't we settle it 
over rock-paper-scissors?

03:34.100 --> 03:36.480
All right, let's go!

03:36.850 --> 03:38.090
Bring it!

03:38.090 --> 03:39.730
Rock, paper—

03:40.930 --> 03:44.240
Well, assistant, is that 
where we find the princess?

03:44.240 --> 03:45.990
Sure is, boss.

03:46.380 --> 03:49.490
<i>That's the first time I've ever 
lost at rock-paper-scissors...</i>

03:49.490 --> 03:52.740
Even I can't manage 
something that high up.

03:53.170 --> 03:55.470
S-ni-pe!

04:02.310 --> 04:04.880
You're handy to have around, assistant.

04:13.480 --> 04:15.390
Smooth sailing so far.

04:18.850 --> 04:22.220
Boss, my Enemy Detection's 
picking something... up.

04:28.270 --> 04:29.970
Uh, hey, assistant?

04:29.970 --> 04:33.470
You have the Lurk skill. Do we really 
need to stick so close together?

04:33.470 --> 04:35.560
Carelessness costs, boss!

04:35.560 --> 04:38.640
We need to take up as little space 
as possible! Come on! Closer!

04:38.640 --> 04:39.680
Hey, too close!

04:39.680 --> 04:44.380
This is to uphold the world's peace! 
Hang in there! Please, endure!

04:44.380 --> 04:47.850
Hey, you keep this up and you'll 
incur Eris's divine wrath!

04:47.850 --> 04:50.230
Intruders! They're in the castle!

04:50.230 --> 04:52.230
Get out here, men!

04:57.520 --> 04:59.990
See what happens when you yell, boss?!

04:59.990 --> 05:02.330
We're gonna need to have a long talk later!

05:02.330 --> 05:04.940
Now is not the time to be fighting!

05:04.940 --> 05:06.560
I don't wanna hear that from you!

05:06.560 --> 05:09.550
Stop them! 
Princess Iris is on the top floor!

05:11.860 --> 05:13.320
Create Water!

05:14.310 --> 05:15.520
Freeze.

05:21.050 --> 05:22.720
S-Stop!

05:22.190 --> 05:24.320
You really are handy to 
have around, assistant!

05:24.320 --> 05:27.130
Maybe compliment less and 
help out more, boss!

05:27.130 --> 05:28.310
Okay...

05:28.310 --> 05:30.880
Let me show you what your boss can do!

05:32.180 --> 05:34.080
Wire Trap!

05:37.290 --> 05:39.310
You could've used that sooner.

05:39.310 --> 05:41.680
Okay, that should buy us some time.

05:41.680 --> 05:44.140
To think you'd cut off your own escape route.

05:46.540 --> 05:49.870
You wretches have nowhere to run now!

05:50.480 --> 05:52.290
This is bad.

05:53.150 --> 05:56.080
There. That's how we'll get out.

05:56.080 --> 05:57.530
Wait, hang on.

05:58.560 --> 06:01.200
I'd really rather take care of this today!

06:01.200 --> 06:03.920
Since I'm gonna be kicked out 
of the capital tomorrow!

06:03.920 --> 06:07.800
Wait, were you always such a hard worker?

06:09.290 --> 06:13.050
<i>She's right. Since when have 
I been so hot-blooded?</i>

06:13.380 --> 06:16.780
<i>Calm down. I'm a more 
cool-headed guy than that.</i>

06:16.780 --> 06:20.640
<i>Yeah, once I get back to Axel, 
I can enjoy life in leisure...</i>

06:20.640 --> 06:25.810
Given the state of things, it's not really 
the best time to immerse myself in studies.

06:25.810 --> 06:30.090
I was hoping you would play 
this game with me today.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.690
I've never met anyone like you.

06:33.040 --> 06:36.290
Everyone normally dotes on me, 
but you never back down.

06:36.290 --> 06:38.470
You're so rude, and so honest.

06:38.470 --> 06:42.540
Hey. I wasn't asking for a list of complaints.

06:42.540 --> 06:46.340
Right. I was telling you 
what I like about you.

06:52.390 --> 06:54.360
Boss, I...

06:55.610 --> 06:58.180
think I'm gonna have to get serious.

06:58.180 --> 06:59.180
Assistant?!

06:59.180 --> 07:00.840
Enough of your chatter!

07:03.900 --> 07:04.980
What?

07:08.400 --> 07:10.570
Assistant, what skill is that?!

07:19.190 --> 07:21.940
It must remain a secret, for reasons.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.410
Top condition! Top condition!

07:24.410 --> 07:27.060
I'm not sure why, 
but I am in top condition!

07:29.520 --> 07:32.410
Increased magic power! 
Improved circulation! A clear complexion!

07:32.410 --> 07:35.900
Tonight I will display my true power!

07:38.760 --> 07:41.310
Make way for the Silver-Haired Thief Brigade!

07:42.380 --> 07:45.310
Spare yourselves some pain...

07:45.970 --> 07:47.720
and clear a path.

07:51.980 --> 07:53.860
He's formidable!

07:54.580 --> 07:56.460
Even though his mask is weird!

08:00.210 --> 08:01.360
Lightning!

08:01.360 --> 08:02.840
Skill Bind!

08:04.000 --> 08:05.080
What?!

08:05.410 --> 08:07.870
I don't like "Silver-Haired Thief Brigade"!

08:07.870 --> 08:11.640
You can be the boss, so let's go 
with "Masked Thief Brigade"!

08:11.640 --> 08:13.470
I say no.

08:13.470 --> 08:16.500
I'd rather not be treated 
like a criminal mastermind.

08:16.500 --> 08:18.860
I don't want to, either!

08:25.500 --> 08:29.370
Claire-san, you appear to 
be facing a fierce foe.

08:35.060 --> 08:41.370
Allow a Swordmaster to 
apprehend this masked man!

08:45.990 --> 08:50.540
Claire-san, I leave the 
silver-haired boy to you.

08:53.360 --> 08:54.890
Hey, assistant...

08:55.920 --> 08:58.370
Am I really that boyish?

08:58.370 --> 09:00.870
Perhaps your slender figure is the reason?

09:02.010 --> 09:06.030
Get a grip! We've hit a critical juncture!

09:06.030 --> 09:08.030
Once I steal his Cursed Sword...

09:08.030 --> 09:10.640
That looks like you're going to use Steal.

09:10.640 --> 09:11.900
Unfortunately for you,

09:12.270 --> 09:14.450
ever since losing to someone who uses it,

09:14.450 --> 09:16.260
I've prepared counter-measures 
for that skill!

09:15.500 --> 09:17.530
Steal!

09:18.300 --> 09:19.400
It's no use!

09:20.910 --> 09:21.580
Wha?!

09:21.580 --> 09:23.860
...was a feint, as I use Freeze.

09:23.860 --> 09:25.900
And an additional... Freeze.

09:35.390 --> 09:38.250
Create Water!

09:39.930 --> 09:41.150
Sir Mitsurugi?!

09:42.940 --> 09:45.810
What fool would take a Swordmaster head-on?!

09:45.810 --> 09:47.690
Your overconfidence is your downfall!

09:50.480 --> 09:52.720
Ah, so these are negative emotions...

09:52.720 --> 09:55.640
Savory. Quite savory indeed.

09:55.160 --> 09:56.480
Damn you!

09:56.480 --> 09:57.530
Away!

09:59.910 --> 10:02.790
I would advise looking after 
that man immediately!

10:02.070 --> 10:03.670
Sir Mitsurugi!

10:03.670 --> 10:06.080
Rain! He'll need healing magic, quickly!

10:06.080 --> 10:07.280
C-Coming!

10:07.280 --> 10:08.660
Quickly, boss!

10:08.660 --> 10:11.690
You're not escaping! Not when 
Princess Iris is ahead!

10:11.690 --> 10:13.420
Stop them, all of you!

10:18.920 --> 10:21.470
It seems we're nearly to Iris's room!

10:21.470 --> 10:22.920
Copy that, assistant!

10:22.920 --> 10:25.430
Top condition! Top condition!

10:25.430 --> 10:27.670
I am in top condition!

10:29.290 --> 10:31.570
You've gone far enough, intruder.

10:31.570 --> 10:33.940
To defend the people, the kingdom,

10:33.940 --> 10:37.030
and its royalty is my—

10:39.940 --> 10:42.040
Wh-What now, assistant?!

10:42.040 --> 10:43.790
Hey, don't close the door!

10:43.790 --> 10:46.180
What are you two trying to—

10:50.060 --> 10:51.200
Intruders,

10:51.850 --> 10:54.500
I am impressed that you made it this far.

10:54.920 --> 10:57.180
But the Hero's blood runs in my veins,

10:57.180 --> 11:00.710
and like all of my family, I have 
worked to maintain that strength.

11:01.230 --> 11:04.160
I swear upon this ring that has 
been passed down via royal line—

11:04.160 --> 11:07.990
One side, please! 
A few intruders will prove no...

11:09.840 --> 11:11.970
S-So cool!

11:11.970 --> 11:13.800
What should we do, Darkness?!

11:13.800 --> 11:16.020
These noble thieves have incredible style!

11:16.020 --> 11:20.300
This one has such a cool mask, 
and a black costume!

11:20.300 --> 11:21.180
What are you called?!

11:21.180 --> 11:24.120
Have you selected a name for your gang yet?!

11:24.120 --> 11:25.500
Bind...

11:26.760 --> 11:28.340
Oh! So cool!

11:28.700 --> 11:30.370
Oh, this is good!

11:30.370 --> 11:33.430
Sacred Break Spell!

11:39.830 --> 11:44.730
Sorry to break it to you, but your 
luck ran out when you ran into me.

11:45.290 --> 11:49.710
I dunno what you're after, 
but if I catch you two,

11:49.710 --> 11:54.020
I bet that'll earn me 
some more fancy bubbly!

11:54.020 --> 11:56.620
Now, be good thieves and surrender!

11:56.620 --> 11:59.100
<i>This little...</i>

11:59.360 --> 12:00.900
Darkness, now!

12:00.900 --> 12:05.150
Since Megumin has lost it for some 
reason, you're our only hope!

12:05.150 --> 12:06.110
Right!

12:06.700 --> 12:09.690
Boss, when we make our escape, use Steal!

12:09.690 --> 12:11.520
On the Divine Treasure, right?

12:11.520 --> 12:13.320
But won't your Steal...

12:13.320 --> 12:15.390
Are you suggesting it 
only works on underwear?

12:15.380 --> 12:15.830
Yes.

12:16.340 --> 12:17.700
Princess Iris!

12:17.700 --> 12:20.340
You coward! Of all the dirty tricks!

12:20.690 --> 12:22.850
Lady Dustiness, we'll pincer them!

12:23.630 --> 12:27.220
A-And now, face my full...

12:27.220 --> 12:28.020
Boss!

12:27.850 --> 12:29.340
My full...

12:28.020 --> 12:28.840
Right!

12:29.340 --> 12:32.240
p-p-powered swing!

12:33.550 --> 12:35.860
That's our knucklehead Crusader!

12:38.030 --> 12:39.620
Princess Iris!

12:39.620 --> 12:41.160
Now!

12:41.160 --> 12:44.910
Steal!

12:48.600 --> 12:52.120
All right! Assistant, 
we'll jump down from here!

12:52.480 --> 12:53.840
The necklace!

12:53.840 --> 12:59.130
I dunno what you took, but I'm not 
letting you get away with it!

12:59.130 --> 13:01.860
That idiot! She just keeps making problems!

13:03.450 --> 13:07.900
Damn it all!

13:12.300 --> 13:14.550
S-So cool!

13:20.820 --> 13:24.570
Calm down! Just calm down!

13:24.570 --> 13:27.440
My head! You're gonna break my head!

13:27.440 --> 13:30.290
I was just coerced!

13:30.290 --> 13:32.200
It was all Chris's idea!

13:32.610 --> 13:35.330
What is your problem?! Ow, ow, ow, ow!

13:35.330 --> 13:40.060
And you say you did this to recover 
a dangerous Divine Treasure?

13:40.060 --> 13:42.580
Then why didn't you tell 
me from the beginning?

13:42.890 --> 13:46.410
M-My assistant was worried 
a connection between you

13:46.410 --> 13:49.070
and the noble thief would 
put you in a bad position!

13:50.340 --> 13:52.380
Hey, don't tell her!

13:55.020 --> 13:59.600
Honestly... Is there anything 
else you're hiding?

14:01.610 --> 14:03.680
There is, isn't there?

14:06.110 --> 14:08.100
Th-That's...

14:08.570 --> 14:12.130
I thought doing it together 
would improve the success rate.

14:12.130 --> 14:15.380
Why does your Steal only work on 
things that shouldn't be stolen?!

14:15.380 --> 14:17.400
At least it wasn't panties this time!

14:17.400 --> 14:19.380
That's not the point!

14:22.700 --> 14:24.010
Listen to me, Kazuma.

14:24.360 --> 14:27.180
Do not lose this ring, understand?

14:27.180 --> 14:30.080
And you need to take it 
with you to the grave,

14:30.080 --> 14:31.510
without anyone ever finding out.

14:31.510 --> 14:33.050
Whoa, knock it off!

14:33.050 --> 14:36.870
If it's that important, I'll just say 
I found it somewhere and give it back!

14:36.870 --> 14:37.820
Idiot!

14:38.150 --> 14:41.810
This ring is only meant to be removed 
when the princess has been betrothed,

14:41.810 --> 14:43.780
and then given to that person!

14:45.270 --> 14:49.980
With it being stolen, the idea of 
some random adventurer finding it...

14:50.620 --> 14:55.430
Even if you returned it out of good will, 
you'd be killed to keep the secret.

14:55.430 --> 14:56.920
Okay, that's really scary!

14:56.920 --> 15:01.430
Princess Iris held on to that ring 
at all times, and cherished it.

15:01.430 --> 15:04.360
You need to make sure you take 
care of it at all times,

15:04.360 --> 15:06.300
and never let anyone find out you have it.

15:16.440 --> 15:19.820
We had no idea the necklace 
had such a dangerous power...

15:20.190 --> 15:23.060
You have our thanks for 
informing us, Lady Dustiness.

15:23.430 --> 15:24.260
Of course.

15:25.250 --> 15:26.940
Meanwhile, you...

15:26.940 --> 15:30.920
were absolutely useless again 
on the night in question.

15:32.240 --> 15:33.830
Could it be...

15:33.830 --> 15:37.570
that the thieves did this to protect me?

15:37.940 --> 15:43.590
If true, that would mean they truly 
are as noble as has been rumored.

15:43.590 --> 15:44.900
Hard to believe...

15:44.900 --> 15:50.960
But if it is true, I have to admit 
that they are quite impressive.

15:51.270 --> 15:53.000
<i>What's all this?</i>

15:53.590 --> 15:55.480
You mean the man in the mask?

15:55.480 --> 15:57.460
He was so impressive!

15:57.460 --> 16:01.550
That mask, that black costume... 
It all speaks directly to my values!

16:01.550 --> 16:04.480
Next time he appears, 
I'll need to ask for an autograph!

16:04.920 --> 16:09.690
<i>Oh, wow, what am I gonna do? I seriously 
wanna tell them it was me now...</i>

16:09.990 --> 16:12.120
What's with you, Kazuma?

16:12.120 --> 16:14.690
What're you grinning about? It's creepy.

16:14.690 --> 16:17.960
Seriously, what are you so happy about?

16:20.370 --> 16:21.720
True...

16:22.640 --> 16:24.570
That noble thief...

16:25.010 --> 16:26.960
He really was impressive.

16:27.310 --> 16:32.460
<i>Wait, is this the thing where she 
actually realizes who it was?</i>

16:33.500 --> 16:39.720
I'm sure they did what they 
did out of concern for me.

16:40.020 --> 16:43.730
When it comes to that noble thief...

16:45.570 --> 16:48.490
I think I may be a fan myself.

16:48.740 --> 16:51.820
<i>'Kay, let's tell them who I am.</i>

16:51.820 --> 16:53.370
Wh-Wh-Wh-What's the matter, Kazuma?!

16:53.070 --> 16:56.450
What the hell?! Let go!

16:53.370 --> 16:54.840
Why'd you stand up so suddenly?!

16:54.840 --> 16:56.450
Do you need to pee? Is that it?

16:56.450 --> 16:57.970
Why, you wanna watch?!

16:56.450 --> 16:57.970
You're so helpless!

16:57.970 --> 17:01.740
If you'll excuse me, 
I can remove this fool at once!

16:58.750 --> 17:00.750
Fine, then! I'll pee right here!

17:01.970 --> 17:03.910
Hey, let go of me!

17:03.910 --> 17:06.090
Or I'll Drain Touch you—

17:05.420 --> 17:06.710
I must wonder...

17:07.740 --> 17:10.460
Where are they, and what are they doing?

17:10.740 --> 17:11.760
That...

17:13.080 --> 17:15.350
silver-haired lead thief.

17:21.720 --> 17:23.220
Yeah, KONOSUBA.

17:21.720 --> 17:23.220
<b>KONOSUBA</b>

17:24.350 --> 17:26.350
I'm sad to see you go, but...

17:30.320 --> 17:34.320
Elder Brother, I have one request.

17:35.990 --> 17:39.120
There's something I must say first.

17:42.420 --> 17:46.700
My comrade has slain many 
of the Devil King's generals.

17:46.700 --> 17:50.790
He may even defeat the Devil King, in time.

17:50.790 --> 17:54.010
It is a very difficult 
and arduous mission.

17:54.810 --> 17:58.120
As he faces down such a grave task,

17:58.120 --> 18:01.020
could you offer him words of encouragement?

18:01.020 --> 18:03.900
<i>What the hell did she just say?!</i>

18:04.490 --> 18:06.420
Defeat the Devil King?

18:07.000 --> 18:11.770
Really?! Elder Brother, are you 
really planning to do that?

18:11.770 --> 18:15.140
<i>I obviously could never...</i>

18:20.100 --> 18:22.850
W-Well, y'know, if I get 
the chance, I might...

18:22.850 --> 18:27.350
consider slaying the Devil King, I guess.

18:29.540 --> 18:32.010
I'm sure you can do it, Elder Brother!

18:32.010 --> 18:34.550
Good luck in defeating him!

18:35.380 --> 18:39.560
Could you stop this incessant 
"Elder Brother" chatter?!

18:39.560 --> 18:42.520
You have an actual older 
brother, don't you?

18:42.520 --> 18:45.070
If you want to fawn over 
someone, do it with him!

18:45.070 --> 18:48.030
Besides, I will eradicate the 
Devil King in good time,

18:48.030 --> 18:49.820
leaving nothing for Kazuma to do!

18:49.820 --> 18:52.150
E-Elder Brother is my Elder Brother!

18:52.150 --> 18:55.560
And what's wrong with me calling him that?!

18:55.560 --> 18:59.580
Besides, there'd be no point 
if you were the one to do it!

18:59.580 --> 19:02.720
I want him to defeat the Devil King!

19:02.720 --> 19:05.580
I ask you to stop and you start 
spamming the Elder Brother button?!

19:05.580 --> 19:07.730
Are you trying to pick a fight!

19:07.730 --> 19:09.180
D-Do you want one?!

19:09.180 --> 19:11.480
R-Royals are strong, you know!

19:11.480 --> 19:12.910
How dare you?!

19:11.480 --> 19:12.910
Enough, Megumin! Stop!

19:12.910 --> 19:16.330
Perhaps I should overthrow the 
monarchy with my Explosion magic!

19:12.910 --> 19:16.330
You two were getting along so well yesterday!

19:16.330 --> 19:17.150
You asked for it!

19:16.690 --> 19:19.330
Princess Iris, please, restrain yourself!

19:17.150 --> 19:19.330
I'll just have to teach you!

19:19.340 --> 19:21.640
My Exterion is strong, too, y'know!

19:19.860 --> 19:22.560
You've never been in a fight before!

19:24.330 --> 19:27.660
So... what was it you wanted to ask?

19:27.660 --> 19:29.250
Anything you want.

19:31.340 --> 19:34.780
Right... I wanted to ask you...

19:43.150 --> 19:45.860
We still haven't settled our game.

19:46.260 --> 19:49.820
I'd love for you to come and play me again.

19:59.380 --> 19:59.940
KO!

19:59.940 --> 20:00.480
NO!

20:00.480 --> 20:00.990
SU!

20:00.990 --> 20:01.380
BA!

20:05.370 --> 20:07.220
Would you quiet down?

20:07.220 --> 20:10.260
You're being a disturbance. If you want 
to shout, do it outside of town.

20:10.260 --> 20:12.810
Screw you! Just when things 
were going so well!

20:12.620 --> 20:16.240
Next time... if I could 
get your autograph...

20:12.810 --> 20:16.240
When you said all that crap 
about fighting the Devil King,

20:16.240 --> 20:18.660
I bet Iris had to change her wish!

20:18.660 --> 20:20.400
She was gonna say she 
wanted me to stay with her,

20:20.400 --> 20:21.970
or that she wanted to go out with me,

20:21.970 --> 20:23.900
or that she wanted to sleep in my bed!

20:23.900 --> 20:26.180
You're being ridiculous.

20:26.180 --> 20:28.950
Do you actually believe you're capable

20:28.950 --> 20:32.180
of convincing someone to 
fall for you in only a week?

20:32.180 --> 20:34.150
Face reality.

20:34.150 --> 20:36.790
Don't drag me back there!

20:36.790 --> 20:39.420
I don't wanna be fact-checked!

20:41.450 --> 20:45.920
Just... let me dream a little more.

20:46.420 --> 20:49.440
I can't believe the thieves 
took your precious ring...

20:49.900 --> 20:52.260
We will accept any punishment you see fit.

20:52.830 --> 20:55.950
You two did everything you could.

20:55.950 --> 20:58.270
Please, don't be so upset.

20:58.810 --> 21:00.600
We are grateful for your mercy.

21:06.740 --> 21:09.580
<i>That ring has a certain 
rule associated with it.</i>

21:10.020 --> 21:13.030
<i>Whoever slays the Devil King, as a reward,</i>

21:13.520 --> 21:17.760
<i>will gain the right to take 
the princess as their bride.</i>

21:19.080 --> 21:20.600
<i>Big Brother...</i>

21:22.430 --> 21:26.090
<i>I hope he takes good care of the ring.</i>

22:59.600 --> 23:01.010
My Divine Treasure...

23:01.350 --> 23:04.930
Not only did the thief 
steal my Divine Treasure,

23:04.930 --> 23:06.640
but they've sealed it away, too?!

23:07.020 --> 23:08.900
Find it!

23:09.270 --> 23:11.440
I can't...

23:11.440 --> 23:16.150
If the Divine Treasure's been sealed, 
there's nothing I can do...

23:16.620 --> 23:19.410
You useless wretch!

23:19.410 --> 23:24.120
When are you going to 
actually grant my wish?!

23:30.050 --> 23:40.050
It's your devoted Sylvia!
 And I am really starting to get into this vacation. It's so liberating! And satisfying!
 It seems a competent career woman needs time to recuperate, too.
 The fact that I died without realizing that... I've been such a fool.
 That's the kind of stodgy gal the old Sylvia was.
 But now I've got my nails done! And it feels so good! ♥
 I've never really noticed my hands outside of battle...
 But now, I'm working on myself!

<b>Episode 7: Rest for This Up-And-Coming Adventurer!</b>

23:30.730 --> 23:32.560
It's your devoted Sylvia!

23:32.560 --> 23:35.350
And I am really starting 
to get into this vacation.

It seems a competent—
