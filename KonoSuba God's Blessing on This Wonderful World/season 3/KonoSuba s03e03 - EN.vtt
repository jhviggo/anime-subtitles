WEBVTT

00:02.430 --> 00:05.950
Princess Iris, the arrangements are finished.

00:06.590 --> 00:09.530
Sir Kazuma is now an official guest of the—

00:09.530 --> 00:14.120
So, Darkness was standing there completely 
naked apart from a towel, and embarrassingly—

00:14.120 --> 00:15.640
E-Embarrassingly what?!

00:15.640 --> 00:16.190
Well...

00:16.190 --> 00:18.860
What was she doing embarrassingly?!

00:18.860 --> 00:22.280
You wretch! What are you filling 
Princess Iris's head with?!

00:22.280 --> 00:23.980
Are you trying to get cut down?!

00:23.980 --> 00:26.190
She said she wanted to hear the story!

00:26.190 --> 00:28.070
You do not refer to her without her title!

00:28.070 --> 00:29.500
For you, she is "the princess"!

00:30.170 --> 00:31.750
This chick is a pain in the ass!

00:31.750 --> 00:35.770
I've told Kazuma-sama that it's all right 
for him to call me by my name.

00:35.770 --> 00:37.820
P-Princess Iris...

00:39.220 --> 00:43.190
M-More importantly, what did Lalatina 
do as she was clinging to her towel?!

00:43.190 --> 00:44.280
You must not!

00:44.280 --> 00:46.520
This is one of those stories 
that isn't fit for hearing!

00:47.960 --> 00:53.260
Sir Kazuma... I ask you not to fill Princess 
Iris's head with these kinds of stories.

00:54.120 --> 00:55.600
I'm sorry.

00:56.330 --> 00:58.570
<i>She actually listens to 
people here at the castle.</i>

01:00.180 --> 01:02.410
If you insist. In that case...

01:02.910 --> 01:05.710
I'll tell you about the time 
I beat Darkness in a bet

01:05.710 --> 01:07.620
where the loser would go 
through some crazy stuff.

01:07.620 --> 01:10.790
B-B-B-By all means! I must hear about it!

01:09.890 --> 01:11.660
No you mustn't, Princess Iris!

01:11.660 --> 01:13.220
Nothing he says needs to be listened to!

01:13.220 --> 01:15.970
He's no good at all!

01:26.850 --> 01:35.280
<b>KONOSUBA!
God's Blessing on this Wonderful World! 3</b>

02:46.020 --> 02:51.020
<b>Episode 3: A Re-education for This Bright Little Girl!</b>

02:46.980 --> 02:51.870
So, next I'll teach you what to do 
when a Giant Toad swallows you.

02:51.870 --> 02:54.080
First thing you'll wanna look out for is...

02:52.340 --> 02:54.780
<i>To sum up the current situation...</i>

02:56.060 --> 02:58.530
W-Welcome, Kazuma-sama.

02:59.140 --> 03:02.630
You are welcome to make yourself at home.

03:04.550 --> 03:06.910
This will be your room.

03:10.340 --> 03:13.410
Uh, hey, miss... a word?

03:15.160 --> 03:16.530
My name is Rain.

03:16.530 --> 03:19.680
Rain-san... This is kidnapping, isn't it?

03:19.680 --> 03:23.230
You've been welcomed as a guest, so no.

03:23.230 --> 03:24.800
No, come on, it totally is!

03:26.480 --> 03:28.510
It's strange seeing Princess Iris,

03:28.510 --> 03:31.060
who's usually so obedient, 
do something like this.

03:31.340 --> 03:37.500
I ask that you humor her for a bit, 
as she so rarely makes selfish demands.

03:37.910 --> 03:40.320
I get it, but still...

03:49.850 --> 03:51.330
"I'm sorry."

03:51.330 --> 03:54.960
"I was just so jealous of how 
much fun Lalatina seems to have."

03:55.320 --> 04:00.840
"I only ask that, for a few short days, 
you keep me company, as well."

04:01.200 --> 04:02.460
So she says.

04:03.060 --> 04:06.250
<i>Aw, ain't that cute?</i>

04:08.180 --> 04:09.450
Understood.

04:09.930 --> 04:14.770
Rain-san, could you let my friends know 
I'll be sticking around for a while?

04:19.970 --> 04:22.810
A culture festival?! 
That sounds like so much fun!

04:23.100 --> 04:26.350
Running a shop with other people my age!

04:26.900 --> 04:32.710
Oh, but it might be hard to 
secure wages for everyone...

04:29.820 --> 04:32.710
<i>I had no idea she'd enjoy 
hearing about school so much.</i>

04:33.530 --> 04:39.060
<i>I was bored out of my mind in those days, 
but the princess here is genuinely jealous.</i>

04:39.870 --> 04:42.710
If it sounds that good, 
why not open a school?

04:46.280 --> 04:49.380
<i>Devil King Army alert. 
Devil King Army alert.</i>

04:49.380 --> 04:51.290
<i>The knights are to mobilize at once.</i>

04:51.290 --> 04:55.220
<i>Any high-level adventurers 
are requested to assist.</i>

04:51.750 --> 04:53.220
They've come again?!

04:57.400 --> 05:02.670
Given the state of things, it's not really 
the best time to immerse myself in studies.

05:07.350 --> 05:12.650
<i>Come to think of it, this world has that 
Devil King guy's mess to deal with.</i>

05:15.100 --> 05:17.580
<i>The stealth raid by the Devil 
King's army has been suppressed.</i>

05:17.580 --> 05:23.810
<i>Any adventurers who contributed should speak 
to the guild receptionist for your reward.</i>

05:23.810 --> 05:26.140
<i>Sneak attacks on the royal capital?</i>

05:26.710 --> 05:28.900
<i>What the hell is going on with this country?</i>

05:29.210 --> 05:33.430
<i>The Japanese expat cheaters around 
here need to carry their weight more!</i>

05:33.960 --> 05:35.400
Thank you so much

05:36.870 --> 05:39.180
for all the amazing stories 
you shared today.

05:39.180 --> 05:43.150
You can speak to Rain about being 
teleported back to Axel tomorrow.

05:44.040 --> 05:46.910
Even the castle isn't completely safe.

05:48.500 --> 05:49.660
<i>True.</i>

05:50.550 --> 05:54.430
<i>It's not like I can defend this 
place even if I do stick around.</i>

05:55.530 --> 05:57.160
<i>And while it's been a mixed bag,</i>

05:57.750 --> 06:01.980
<i>I'm sure those goofs in Axel 
are probably worried about me.</i>

05:58.180 --> 05:59.410
Kazuma.

05:59.410 --> 06:00.640
Kazuma!

06:00.640 --> 06:02.000
Kazuma...

06:04.210 --> 06:07.170
<i>I hate to leave, but I guess I'd better.</i>

06:08.600 --> 06:12.460
Would you tell me more about 
your adventurers another time?

06:12.900 --> 06:16.560
Of course. I'll come see you again, Iris.

06:18.710 --> 06:22.260
Something about you reminds 
me of my older brother.

06:22.710 --> 06:27.350
I don't get to speak to 
him like this anymore...

06:27.950 --> 06:30.840
So, while I'd like for you to stay longer,

06:30.840 --> 06:32.980
I shouldn't keep being so selfish.

06:32.980 --> 06:34.330
What did you say?

06:35.260 --> 06:40.230
Uh... well, I'd like you to stay longer...

06:40.230 --> 06:42.080
No. Not that.

06:42.360 --> 06:45.190
I remind you of what, exactly?

06:45.590 --> 06:49.140
Um... how it used to be 
with my older brother—

06:49.140 --> 06:51.120
Once again from the top, please.

06:52.070 --> 06:54.150
Y-You're like my older brother.

06:54.150 --> 06:57.280
Again, please. More casually, if you can.

07:03.570 --> 07:05.350
Like my big brother?

07:06.890 --> 07:09.800
<i>I decided to stay at the castle!</i>

07:30.470 --> 07:33.220
You rang, Kazuma-sama?

07:33.560 --> 07:36.400
My morning coffee, please, Sebastian.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.990
My name is Heidel, sir.

07:37.990 --> 07:39.480
If you could, Heidel.

07:39.780 --> 07:42.410
Um... I was going to make your bed.

07:42.410 --> 07:45.370
Don't worry about me, Mary.

07:45.370 --> 07:47.490
R-Right...

07:54.620 --> 07:59.530
G-Good morning... Big Brother.

07:59.990 --> 08:03.700
<i>I love it! Being called 
"Big Brother" is so great!</i>

08:09.610 --> 08:11.930
Good morning, Iris.

08:13.260 --> 08:15.850
Please put some pants on!

08:15.890 --> 08:17.350
<b>KONOSUBA</b>

08:18.740 --> 08:21.200
Iris, no! It's not what you think!

08:21.200 --> 08:23.660
Your big brother isn't some kind of pervert!

08:23.660 --> 08:27.500
I understand! Please, just finish putting 
on your pants, Elder Brother!

08:27.500 --> 08:29.430
Please, keep using "Big Brother"!

08:29.430 --> 08:31.760
It feels like you're pulling 
away, and it's killing me!

08:32.540 --> 08:35.860
Iris! Iris!

08:36.350 --> 08:40.120
<i>Iris stopped calling me "Big Brother."</i>

08:43.000 --> 08:44.990
<i>As for what I got up to after that...</i>

08:45.500 --> 08:47.510
<i>We'd play hide-and-seek,</i>

08:47.970 --> 08:49.950
<i>games of tag...</i>

08:50.510 --> 08:54.720
<i>And I'd occasionally disrupt her lessons.</i>

08:55.440 --> 08:59.290
<i>Basically, I spent my days as her playmate.</i>

09:01.440 --> 09:05.340
I was hoping you would play 
this game with me today.

09:08.380 --> 09:12.200
<i>Every now and then, she seems a little 
embarrassed to ask for something...</i>

09:12.200 --> 09:17.060
<i>I guess Rain was telling the truth about 
her usually being kind of restrained.</i>

09:17.680 --> 09:19.000
<i>I get the feeling</i>

09:19.380 --> 09:25.170
<i>Iris realizes how much the people 
around her are at the mercy of her desires.</i>

09:27.370 --> 09:31.260
I'm not letting you win, and if we're 
playing, we're playing for keeps!

09:31.260 --> 09:33.120
You still wanna do it?

09:33.960 --> 09:35.670
Y-Yes!

09:36.070 --> 09:38.530
I want to play seriously, too!

09:38.530 --> 09:40.990
All right, just don't cry if you lose!

09:43.340 --> 09:45.760
And if we're doing this seriously, 
then etiquette comes first!

09:46.330 --> 09:48.020
Let's have a good game.

09:48.730 --> 09:50.470
Let's have a good game.

09:53.260 --> 09:56.690
Um... maybe we should call it a day?

09:57.190 --> 09:58.980
You wanna just win and run, is that it?!

09:58.980 --> 10:00.770
I thought we were playing for real?!

10:00.770 --> 10:02.830
And don't hold back 'cause 
you wanna stop playing!

10:02.830 --> 10:05.590
I can tell if you lose on purpose, got it?!

10:05.590 --> 10:07.790
I realize this was my 
idea in the first place,

10:07.790 --> 10:10.710
but you are being a colossal 
pain, Elder Brother!

10:13.450 --> 10:15.710
I win, baby!

10:15.710 --> 10:18.390
You are so childish, Elder Brother.

10:18.390 --> 10:21.530
Oh, you're talking big 
after you just lost, huh?

10:21.530 --> 10:24.720
Still, I guess you managed 
to earn this bamboo copter.

10:24.720 --> 10:26.980
Oh, thank you!

10:31.820 --> 10:34.650
Let's head out and play with that next time.

10:37.640 --> 10:40.060
You should really get outside 
the castle more often.

10:40.060 --> 10:44.620
You never know when you'll run into 
a friendly neighborhood demon,

10:44.620 --> 10:48.420
or a lich that survives off of bread crusts.

10:48.780 --> 10:52.140
P-Please don't make fun of me 
just because I'm sheltered!

10:52.140 --> 10:55.380
There's no way that devils 
or liches like that exist!

10:55.700 --> 10:57.000
Besides...

10:58.470 --> 11:04.720
If I were to leave the castle, 
it'd require an escort of royal guards.

11:13.300 --> 11:14.620
KO! NOSUBA...

11:30.920 --> 11:33.470
You rang, Kazuma-sama?

11:33.940 --> 11:36.660
My morning coffee, please, Sebastian.

11:36.660 --> 11:38.330
My name is Heidel.

11:38.330 --> 11:39.710
If you could, Heidel.

11:44.860 --> 11:46.830
<i>It's already been a week.</i>

11:47.300 --> 11:51.970
<i>Now, Mary the maid should be coming 
in to change these sheets soon...</i>

11:51.970 --> 11:55.680
<i>However shall I make her job more 
difficult, the way any noble would?</i>

11:57.320 --> 11:58.470
<i>Here she comes.</i>

12:02.490 --> 12:05.120
Good morning, Mary!

12:05.120 --> 12:09.910
But don't expect to be able to 
swap these sheets out too easily.

12:09.910 --> 12:15.400
Now, if you want to make quick work 
of this task, you must say...

12:15.400 --> 12:20.500
"Master, please allow me to collect..."

12:26.250 --> 12:28.570
Collect what, exactly?

12:28.970 --> 12:30.760
Go ahead and finish your thought, Kazuma.

12:30.760 --> 12:34.180
Go on. We're all ears.

12:34.180 --> 12:35.910
Finish what you were saying.

12:36.270 --> 12:43.520
M-Master, please allow me to collect the 
sheets with your scent on them so...

12:43.520 --> 12:46.020
The sheets with your scent 
on them so... what?

12:46.020 --> 12:48.790
Not going to finish? I thought you were 
an old hand at sexually harassing people.

12:48.790 --> 12:51.150
Stop acting embarrassed and say it.

12:51.550 --> 12:54.720
P-Please don't make—Wait, 
why are you even here?!

12:54.720 --> 12:57.160
To drag you home! Why else?!

12:57.160 --> 13:00.130
Megumin's been so worried 
she could barely sleep!

13:00.130 --> 13:01.630
Th-That was a coincidence!

13:01.630 --> 13:03.690
Please don't cause any 
weird misunderstandings!

13:03.690 --> 13:06.450
I've been promoted to Iris's playmate!

13:06.450 --> 13:08.660
I've got stability and safety now! Buzz off!

13:08.660 --> 13:11.940
You imbecile! That is not an 
official duty in this country!

13:11.940 --> 13:14.430
This is in no way fair, Kazuma!

13:14.830 --> 13:18.000
We all beat the Devil King's 
generals together!

13:18.000 --> 13:21.430
I get to live in a castle, too, or it's unfair!

13:21.430 --> 13:24.830
Stop talking, Aqua! 
You're confusing the issue!

13:25.400 --> 13:27.110
E-Excuse me...

13:27.110 --> 13:28.410
Princess Iris.

13:28.900 --> 13:30.370
I'm sorry.

13:31.030 --> 13:33.420
I overheard what you were saying.

13:36.030 --> 13:38.630
As pitiful as he may be,

13:38.630 --> 13:42.550
he's become an adventurer 
of some note in Axel.

13:42.940 --> 13:45.790
There are those in that town who 
consider themselves his friends,

13:45.790 --> 13:47.500
who worry about about him.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.430
Including us.

13:51.370 --> 13:55.390
I ask that you give him his leave.

13:56.060 --> 13:58.180
<i>Tell her no, Iris!</i>

13:58.180 --> 14:02.240
<i>"Big Brother is gonna stay in the 
castle so we can play together!"</i>

14:02.240 --> 14:05.690
You're right. I apologize 
for being so selfish.

14:06.310 --> 14:09.210
<i>You can do this! Tell 'em off, Iris!</i>

14:06.940 --> 14:09.210
Come on! Come on, Iris!

14:09.210 --> 14:11.460
You're the best around, Iris!

14:09.210 --> 14:11.840
<i>You have supreme authority in this castle!</i>

14:11.460 --> 14:14.730
Show 'em who's boss!

14:11.840 --> 14:16.330
<i>You tell them that! Go on! Do it!</i>

14:14.730 --> 14:16.330
Say, Lalatina...

14:17.450 --> 14:22.080
Is it okay if I hold a going-away 
banquet for him tonight?

14:28.590 --> 14:29.840
KONOSUBA!

14:31.360 --> 14:32.860
Hey, hey, Kazuma!

14:32.860 --> 14:34.910
This is amazingly good!

14:34.910 --> 14:37.690
All-natural wild melon topped with ham!

14:37.690 --> 14:39.870
And it's still really fresh!

14:39.870 --> 14:41.600
This is great, too!

14:41.600 --> 14:45.360
It's sushi rice with flan on top, 
topped with wasabi and soy sauce!

14:45.810 --> 14:48.050
Yeah, sure. Good for you guys.

14:47.710 --> 14:49.460
It's so squishy in my mouth!

14:48.050 --> 14:51.120
Oh, so beautiful yet again!

14:51.490 --> 14:53.090
A flower that only blooms

14:53.090 --> 14:56.620
by moonlight once a century pales 
in comparison to your beauty!

14:56.620 --> 14:57.920
Indeed!

14:57.920 --> 14:59.530
You flatter me.

14:59.530 --> 15:03.280
Incidentally, Lady Dustiness, 
have you found a fiancé yet?

15:03.280 --> 15:05.750
If you have not...

15:05.750 --> 15:06.890
What are you talking about?!

15:06.890 --> 15:09.080
I've been seeking her hand for a long time,

15:09.080 --> 15:11.630
so clearly I should receive 
preferential treatment!

15:11.630 --> 15:13.550
<i>She's a real hit.</i>

15:13.550 --> 15:15.380
This is preposterous.

15:15.380 --> 15:19.140
Lady Dustiness already has 
an appropriate partner...

15:19.140 --> 15:21.120
Lord Alderp!

15:22.390 --> 15:24.820
What are you even doing here, Pops?!

15:24.820 --> 15:25.640
Be silent!

15:25.640 --> 15:30.250
Because you sent the Destroyer's 
core to my mansion...

15:30.250 --> 15:33.400
The repairs are still not 
finished, I'll have you know!

15:33.690 --> 15:37.090
I must know, who were you talking about 
regarding the match for Lady Dustiness?

15:37.090 --> 15:39.570
You're still chasing after 
Darkness's tail, old man?

15:39.570 --> 15:41.410
That's "Alderp-sama" to you!

15:42.460 --> 15:47.440
And there is only one man fit 
to be wed with Lady Dustiness.

15:47.440 --> 15:51.570
He is currently battling the Devil King's 
forces while wielding a sacred sword...

15:51.570 --> 15:53.420
The first prince, Jatice!

15:54.780 --> 15:57.450
The kingdom's champion, Prince Jatice,

15:57.450 --> 16:01.170
and Lady Dustiness, who has slain 
the Devil King's generals of late...

16:01.170 --> 16:03.430
What better pairing could there be?

16:03.430 --> 16:05.440
T-True enough.

16:05.780 --> 16:09.730
Who could possibly be better suited 
than First Prince Jatice?

16:12.350 --> 16:13.790
He's got a point.

16:16.180 --> 16:19.400
Hey! What about our torrid affair?!

16:19.400 --> 16:22.530
What the heck, Lalatina?! 
You're just ditching me?!

16:23.340 --> 16:25.360
Wh-What in the world are you yelling about?!

16:25.360 --> 16:27.490
Were those intimate times 
together just a joke to you?!

16:27.490 --> 16:29.390
You were calling me "Master" just the other—

16:31.850 --> 16:35.460
I must warn you, too much of this 
teasing might cost you quite dearly!

16:35.460 --> 16:38.320
You sure about that, Lalatina?

16:38.320 --> 16:41.470
Showing off your brute strength 
might scare all the boys off—

16:44.970 --> 16:48.490
Oh, my! You are such a convincing actor!

16:45.480 --> 16:48.480

16:51.520 --> 16:54.290

16:54.290 --> 16:55.640
<i>I just...</i>

16:55.640 --> 16:59.720

I saw how uncomfortable Darkness looked.</i>

17:01.000 --> 17:04.190
<i>And isn't this supposed to 
be my going-away party?!</i>

17:04.190 --> 17:06.990
<i>Everyone's having a great time 
without the star, I see!</i>

17:06.990 --> 17:10.600
<i>Because he's right here! 
The star! That's me!</i>

17:13.040 --> 17:16.260
What are you doing out here?

17:16.510 --> 17:19.130
Iris! You're such a good girl!

17:19.130 --> 17:21.560
Being alone at parties like this 
is an absolute ego killer!

17:21.560 --> 17:24.040
I could not have asked 
for a better little sis!

17:24.040 --> 17:25.740
C-Come on...

17:27.240 --> 17:30.590
And next, I will take this glass...

17:30.590 --> 17:34.270
and produce a giant toad 
from out of nowhere!

17:31.680 --> 17:34.270
She's doing her performer thing again.

17:36.240 --> 17:38.330
Behold, my giant—

17:42.170 --> 17:45.650
The castle is going to be 
so quiet after tomorrow.

17:46.450 --> 17:51.930
No one will be making Claire upset 
or causing trouble for Rain anymore...

17:51.930 --> 17:53.820
Sounds like a good thing!

17:54.560 --> 17:57.320
I honestly don't get what you see in me.

17:57.930 --> 18:00.670
I've never met anyone like you.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.400
Everyone normally dotes on me, 
but you never back down.

18:04.400 --> 18:06.440
You're so rude, and so honest.

18:07.210 --> 18:10.100
You would teach me, a royal, 
the strangest things,

18:10.100 --> 18:13.140
and act so immature, 
desperate to win against me.

18:13.140 --> 18:17.320
Hey. I wasn't asking for a list of complaints.

18:17.320 --> 18:20.370
I was asking what you do like about me.

18:20.370 --> 18:24.080
Right. And that's exactly 
what I was telling you.

18:26.130 --> 18:28.240
<i>She's so freaking adorable!</i>

18:29.350 --> 18:34.110
I don't think I'll ever forget 
the time we've spent together.

18:35.010 --> 18:37.370
I envy Lalatina.

18:38.700 --> 18:42.960
I'm sure... she must enjoy every day.

18:44.930 --> 18:49.270
<i>Starting tomorrow, she's going to repress 
herself and act like a princess again,</i>

18:49.270 --> 18:52.850
<i>pretending to be a good girl 
with no selfish desires.</i>

18:53.970 --> 18:57.670
<i>Is there really no way I can 
stay here at the castle?</i>

18:58.190 --> 19:00.980
Maybe if I could be an adventurer...

19:01.290 --> 19:02.730
Did you know?

19:02.730 --> 19:07.000
The royal family has historically had great 
potential in magic and other talents.

19:07.000 --> 19:10.370
I might not be able to be 
a Crusader like Lalatina,

19:10.800 --> 19:13.520
but maybe I could be a magic user or priest?

19:14.340 --> 19:18.020
I'm sure I'd be the kind of amazing adventurer 
that could even surprise you, Elder Brother!

19:18.380 --> 19:20.050
Or maybe...

19:20.050 --> 19:25.260
I could become a thief, like the one 
everyone's talking about lately!

19:25.260 --> 19:30.150
But Claire would probably be mad at 
me, even if I was a noble thief...

19:30.150 --> 19:32.300
What did you just say?

19:32.300 --> 19:34.160
About the noble thief?

19:35.090 --> 19:40.090
There's a thief who only targets 
nobles with nefarious reputations.

19:40.090 --> 19:41.670
And after every robbery,

19:41.670 --> 19:46.170
they make a large donation to an 
orphanage run by the Eris Church.

19:50.120 --> 19:52.080
E-Elder Brother?

19:52.080 --> 19:55.960
Jackpot!

20:02.200 --> 20:03.940
Oh, good timing, Claire.

20:03.940 --> 20:05.720
Wh-What is it?

20:05.720 --> 20:09.730
I heard there's some kind of noble thief 
hassling the nobles around the capital?

20:09.730 --> 20:11.530
Th-That is true.

20:11.530 --> 20:14.980
Nobles with bad reputations 
do seem to be under fire.

20:14.980 --> 20:19.240
Well, I'm gonna nab this 
so-called noble thief!

20:19.240 --> 20:20.140
Huh?

20:20.610 --> 20:24.590
The thief no one has secured 
any leads on whatsoever?

20:24.590 --> 20:27.140
Just who is that seedy-looking fellow?

20:27.140 --> 20:30.470
He's not very remarkable. Some associate 
of Lady Dustiness, I think...

20:28.250 --> 20:31.240
<i>Uh, noble folks? I can hear you.</i>

20:31.240 --> 20:35.450
I don't care how good his intentions are! 
Theft is still theft! I can't just ignore that!

20:35.450 --> 20:38.330
Justice has never been near the top of your 
priorities before. What brought this on?

20:38.330 --> 20:41.000

20:41.000 --> 20:43.450
You are unbelievable!

20:43.450 --> 20:45.010
Magnificent!

20:45.010 --> 20:48.000
Just as I would expect of 
Lady Dustiness's comrade!

20:48.000 --> 20:53.090
Not that I've personally done anything to 
earn the noble thief's ire, mind you...

20:53.090 --> 20:56.060
Likewise! I've done nothing 
wrong, I assure you!

20:56.060 --> 20:59.210
No, not a single thing that 
would paint a target on me...

20:58.140 --> 21:00.620
<i>These guys couldn't be more obvious.</i>

21:02.640 --> 21:04.440
<i>Oh, I see, I see!</i>

21:04.440 --> 21:08.060
<i>You can't wait to see your beloved 
elder brother in action, huh?!</i>

21:08.060 --> 21:10.350
<i>Leave it to me!</i>

21:10.350 --> 21:13.590
<i>I'll laze around the castle a bit more, 
and eventually catch this guy!</i>

21:13.590 --> 21:16.850
We're counting on you, unremarkable lad!

21:16.290 --> 21:18.580
I always knew he had it in him!

21:18.580 --> 21:22.430
Hurry and catch this rogue 
so we can all rest easy!

21:22.810 --> 21:26.430
Wait, what's up? We get to keep 
eating tasty food here tomorrow?

21:26.430 --> 21:31.050
Very well, then! It seems I'll need to 
save plenty of room for tomorrow's meal!

21:31.480 --> 21:34.280
What are you two saying?!

21:34.280 --> 21:35.720
Very well, then.

21:36.070 --> 21:39.990
Sir Kazuma will be stationed at 
the residences of likely targets

21:39.990 --> 21:42.120
in an effort to catch the thief.

21:43.840 --> 21:47.240
I ask you all to fully cooperate 
with him in his search!

21:56.890 --> 22:00.010
Damn it! This is not what I wanted!

Oh, Devil King, it's been a while. This is your loyal servant writing,
the Growth Chimera, Sylvia. The climate here is wonderful.
 It's almost like being on a long vacation.
 Thinking back, I worked non-stop without taking any breaks.
 Maybe I was desperate to live up to people's expectations... no.
 I think I didn't want to be outdone by the men around me.
 I may have been too headstrong for my own good.
 From a house aside the bubbling waters of the River Styx, with love...
touching you on purpose.
