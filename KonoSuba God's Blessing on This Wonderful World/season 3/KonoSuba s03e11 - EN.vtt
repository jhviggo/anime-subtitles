WEBVTT

00:01.490 --> 00:03.720
This is a wedding between nobles...

00:04.030 --> 00:05.920
You'll be executed!

00:06.510 --> 00:09.520
Of all the foolish... 
How could you be so stupid?!

00:09.520 --> 00:11.610
I don't wanna be called stupid 
by the biggest dumbass around!

00:12.570 --> 00:15.740
Where do you get off shouldering my debt?!

00:15.740 --> 00:17.690
You wanna be my wife or something?!

00:18.030 --> 00:20.950
I already told you, if you like me, 
just admit it already!

00:21.530 --> 00:23.530
I never once said that!

00:23.530 --> 00:26.510
You... total imbecile!

00:27.000 --> 00:29.500
<b>Episode 11: God's Blessings for These Unchanging Days!</b>

00:27.540 --> 00:29.760
You peasant...

00:29.760 --> 00:34.010
Do you realize that Lalatina 
owes me a sum of two billion?!

00:34.010 --> 00:37.520
If you want her, then that's 
how much you'll need to pay.

00:37.520 --> 00:40.880
As if that's even possible!

00:40.880 --> 00:43.020
You said it, so now you can't unsay it!

00:43.570 --> 00:45.020
What are you on about?

00:46.280 --> 00:48.720
Here's the two billion Darkness 
borrowed from you...

00:49.150 --> 00:52.870
And now she's coming with me!

01:01.790 --> 01:03.740
Th-That's two billion?!

01:04.620 --> 01:06.510
M-My money!

01:06.510 --> 01:09.040
Hey! That all belongs to me!

01:09.040 --> 01:12.050
Stop that! All of you!

01:12.050 --> 01:14.100
It's mine, damn you!

01:12.440 --> 01:15.380
What is this? Where did all 
that money come from?!

01:16.130 --> 01:17.260
I sold out.

01:18.390 --> 01:22.260
Every single idea I had, 
and the associated rights.

01:22.520 --> 01:26.460
Add to that every bit of 
money we've earned questing,

01:26.460 --> 01:28.770
and it came out to exactly two billion eris.

01:28.770 --> 01:30.370
That's...

01:30.870 --> 01:33.900
How could you? You're so...

01:33.900 --> 01:36.540
You don't get to say no anymore, got it?!

01:37.910 --> 01:41.120
And you can be damn sure I'm gonna 
get my money's worth out of you!

01:41.430 --> 01:45.740
You'll be earning back every last coin with 
your body, so you'd better brace yourself!

01:45.740 --> 01:48.570
You understand me, you degenerate Crusader?!

01:48.570 --> 01:51.330
If you do, then sound off!

01:54.040 --> 01:56.000
Y-Yesh!

02:00.170 --> 02:04.400
<i>I think I may have landed a 
critical hit against her masochism.</i>

02:04.400 --> 02:07.760
<i>She has the worst timing with this stuff...</i>

02:07.760 --> 02:10.780
Get your hands off my money!

02:13.610 --> 02:16.170
I didn't expect you to demand 
that I pay with my body...

02:16.170 --> 02:18.370
And now a bridal carry?

02:18.370 --> 02:20.560
Whoa, watch it with the drool!

02:20.560 --> 02:22.230
That's Kazuma the dirtbag for you.

02:22.230 --> 02:22.730
Dirtbag?!

02:22.730 --> 02:25.510
All he did was return the money that 
was used to pay off his own debt,

02:25.510 --> 02:27.990
yet somehow he frames it like 
he's bought Darkness...

02:27.990 --> 02:31.490
I meant that she'd earn it 
back as an adventurer!

02:34.350 --> 02:35.840
K-Kazuma-san?!

02:35.840 --> 02:38.210
Could you please run with your own legs now?!

02:38.570 --> 02:41.790
All that muscle is pretty heavy, damn it!

02:41.790 --> 02:43.720
Don't call me heavy!

02:46.120 --> 02:48.380
I officially don't care anymore!

02:49.220 --> 02:52.080
Lapdogs of the lord! Step aside!

02:52.080 --> 02:54.010
And if you refuse...

02:54.010 --> 02:55.890
You're dead meat!

02:55.890 --> 02:59.040
Whoa! What are you gonna 
accomplish by rushing them?!

02:59.040 --> 03:01.450
Aqua! I need buffs! Support magic, please!

03:01.450 --> 03:03.380
I've got you covered!

03:03.380 --> 03:06.150
Could I interest you in some 
versatile entertainment?

03:06.150 --> 03:07.660
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

03:09.970 --> 03:11.430
You men!

03:11.430 --> 03:15.610
Never mind her, get over here! 
Help me gather my money!

03:15.610 --> 03:18.360
Yes, sir!

03:20.330 --> 03:21.420
Nice.

03:21.870 --> 03:24.010
Lord Aldarp!

03:24.010 --> 03:25.980
What are you people doing?!

03:25.980 --> 03:28.970
Go and catch Lalatina, right now!

03:30.430 --> 03:32.730
All right! We're almost clear!

03:40.120 --> 03:43.040
Me... no let escape.

03:43.330 --> 03:44.880
He's huge!

03:47.540 --> 03:50.300
Hey! We're looking kinda trapped here!

03:50.300 --> 03:53.360
What now?! What do we do now?!

03:53.360 --> 03:57.380
Light of Saber!

04:05.240 --> 04:08.460
Megumin, I did it! I actually did it!

04:08.460 --> 04:14.030
I-I'm even willing to break the law, 
if my best friend asks!

04:14.030 --> 04:15.180
Yes, you are.

04:15.180 --> 04:17.600
As expected of my best friend.

04:18.300 --> 04:21.090
The wicked wizard has arrived.

04:21.610 --> 04:23.310
And as my instinct bids me...

04:23.690 --> 04:26.310
I've come to kidnap the bride!

04:28.440 --> 04:32.090
<i>She's ready to set off Explosion 
magic in the middle of town!</i>

04:32.450 --> 04:35.070
It's the crazy one!

04:35.070 --> 04:38.210
That light... Is it her Explosion magic?!

04:38.480 --> 04:43.100
Huh? Hey, Megumin, I think Kazuma already...

04:47.710 --> 04:49.750
This is obviously a bluff!

04:49.750 --> 04:52.230
She knows what'll happen 
if she uses that here!

04:52.500 --> 04:54.480
Restrain them all at once!

04:54.760 --> 04:57.910
Really? You think I would flinch?

04:57.910 --> 05:00.900
That I would flinch at the thought 
of using Explosion magic?

05:00.900 --> 05:02.740
Very well. Very well, then!

05:02.740 --> 05:05.490
Consider that challenge accepted!

05:06.980 --> 05:08.170
Don't do it!

05:08.170 --> 05:09.810
We're staying back! Just don't do it!

05:09.810 --> 05:12.500
Lord Aldarp! Stop provoking her, please!

05:12.880 --> 05:15.360
Just had to steal the spotlight, didn't you?

05:15.360 --> 05:18.080
I didn't expect you to get here first.

05:18.080 --> 05:20.740
Megumin... And even Yunyun...

05:21.350 --> 05:25.510
When we get home... I'll have to thank you.

05:27.120 --> 05:31.400
Well... we're friends, aren't we?

05:32.480 --> 05:37.520
I-I couldn't lose such a talented 
Crusader without a fight.

05:40.140 --> 05:42.530
All of you there! In the peanut gallery!

05:42.820 --> 05:46.650
I'm talking about those of you 
who are obviously adventurers!

05:46.650 --> 05:49.590
I need you to collect my bride!

05:49.590 --> 05:53.280
I'll reward you! How much do you want?

05:53.280 --> 05:55.350
Are you listening to me?!

05:55.350 --> 05:58.930
You won't have to live 
hand-to-mouth anymore!

06:06.470 --> 06:08.790
Hey! Let's play soccer!

06:10.300 --> 06:12.120
Oh, yeah!

06:12.120 --> 06:16.300
Hey! Pass it here! Get that ball moving!

06:16.300 --> 06:18.870
Going right for the corner, huh?

06:18.870 --> 06:22.610
Over here! Come on!

06:26.670 --> 06:30.080
They're all here to help get you out of this.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.420
Maybe it's time for you to flex your brain 
muscles and think about what you did.

06:38.410 --> 06:40.750
<i>What a nice story...</i>

06:40.750 --> 06:43.700
Lord Aldarp!

06:44.550 --> 06:46.210
You're finally here!

06:46.210 --> 06:48.730
Aw, crap! We gotta go—

06:48.730 --> 06:50.640
Ka... Kazuma!

06:52.590 --> 06:56.600
I... can't hold on much longer!

06:56.960 --> 06:59.480
Can I shoot this thing off now?!

06:59.480 --> 07:03.420
Can I please let it go?!

07:05.100 --> 07:07.830
Y-You can't! Not here!

07:07.830 --> 07:08.780
Well, I can't hold it!

07:08.780 --> 07:12.380
Yes, you can! I know you have it in you!

07:12.380 --> 07:14.730
Just... hang in there! 
Don't tense up too much!

07:14.730 --> 07:17.480
Whatever you do, do not give up!

07:17.480 --> 07:18.580
I can't!

07:18.580 --> 07:19.820
Don't!

07:18.580 --> 07:22.070
Everyone, get away from me!

07:22.070 --> 07:26.370
Run for it!

07:26.780 --> 07:30.320
Explosion!

08:01.150 --> 08:05.410
Now's... our... chance...

08:07.760 --> 08:12.410
Wow. Hiding behind the 
person you came to save...

08:12.710 --> 08:14.670
Yeah. It's awful.

08:15.050 --> 08:17.050
K-Kazuma-san, that's terrible!

08:15.900 --> 08:17.050
I'm Kazuma...

08:19.750 --> 08:21.310
They're getting away!

08:21.720 --> 08:24.040
She can't use Explosion magic again!

08:24.040 --> 08:25.810
Restrain them!

08:25.810 --> 08:29.220
Kazuma-san! Kazuma-san!

08:29.640 --> 08:31.210
Aqua?!

08:31.210 --> 08:33.820
The pain!

08:33.820 --> 08:36.560
Augh! He knocked me right over!

08:36.560 --> 08:39.960
The bone... My bone!

08:39.960 --> 08:43.400
Dust! You gotta save me!

08:44.210 --> 08:46.100
Whoa! Keith!

08:46.750 --> 08:48.660
Oh, damn...

08:48.660 --> 08:51.330
His arm... This is a comminuted fracture.

08:51.770 --> 08:53.340
We're not humoring this farce!

08:55.360 --> 08:57.220
Hey! Let go!

08:57.220 --> 08:59.280
How can you do that if it's broken, anyway?!

08:59.280 --> 09:01.340
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

09:02.070 --> 09:08.230
You think you can put my pal in a wheelchair 
without so much as an apology?

09:08.230 --> 09:10.970
Must think you're hot stuff, huh?!

09:10.970 --> 09:14.730
I thought it was a broken arm! 
Where did a wheelchair enter the equation?!

09:15.170 --> 09:16.480
I've had about enough of—

09:16.480 --> 09:21.000
Ow! This bastard's getting violent!

09:21.000 --> 09:23.940
Hey! The authorities are running amok!

09:23.940 --> 09:26.240
They can't screw with adventurers!

09:27.780 --> 09:30.160
Who do you think you are?!

09:33.790 --> 09:36.800
After what a noble put me 
through the other day...

09:36.800 --> 09:40.440
I've got plenty of frustration 
to take out on you clowns!

09:40.440 --> 09:42.990
<i>I guess I owe them another round of drinks.</i>

09:43.820 --> 09:45.890
My bride!

09:45.890 --> 09:49.600
Don't go! Don't go, Lalatina!

09:52.300 --> 09:53.530
It's you...

09:55.430 --> 09:56.690
I'm coming in.

10:11.420 --> 10:13.830
You look lovely...

10:14.070 --> 10:16.880
And so much like your mother.

10:17.460 --> 10:22.210
I'm so sorry. This wedding was my idea...

10:22.690 --> 10:25.880
And now it's fallen apart in 
the worst way imaginable.

10:26.740 --> 10:28.470
Has it, now?

10:32.930 --> 10:34.730
Kazuma...

10:35.300 --> 10:38.290
I think I'm going to get some fresh air.

10:42.910 --> 10:46.330
Thank you so much, lad. I'm grateful.

10:47.080 --> 10:50.490
All I did was repay your 
daughter what I owed her.

10:51.730 --> 10:56.620
Kazuma, I'd like you to take my daughter.

10:56.620 --> 10:57.840
Please.

10:59.090 --> 11:01.710
No thanks. I don't see why 
I should be penalized.

11:03.160 --> 11:06.300
Y-You are unbelievable! How could you?!

11:09.370 --> 11:14.030
<i>This guy's one of the kingdom's pillars. 
He can see right through me.</i>

11:15.010 --> 11:18.750
I understand. I'll take good care of her.

11:23.240 --> 11:28.580
Lalatina, do you enjoy your life now?

11:29.080 --> 11:29.840
I do.

11:30.360 --> 11:34.450
Enough that I'm willing to cast everything 
else aside for the sake my friends.

11:35.670 --> 11:37.400
I see...

11:50.230 --> 11:52.890
I love you, Father.

11:53.570 --> 11:57.670
Thank you so much for raising me.

11:59.300 --> 12:05.390
When you feel better... maybe we 
can talk until I fall asleep...

12:06.150 --> 12:08.830
About Mother, like we used to...

12:10.820 --> 12:14.770
It feels like you're a child again.

12:15.280 --> 12:20.510
Please... stay with me for a moment.

12:21.170 --> 12:22.770
Father!

12:23.700 --> 12:27.250
<i>He doesn't have long left...</i>

12:28.020 --> 12:31.390
Sacred Break Spell!

12:33.640 --> 12:39.160
Father?!

12:40.650 --> 12:42.170
He was cursed!

12:42.170 --> 12:45.050
Mister, you had one nasty curse on you!

12:45.050 --> 12:47.740
And I used my power to clean it up real nice!

12:56.250 --> 12:58.320
Everything should be okay now!

12:58.320 --> 12:59.870
Isn't this great, Darkness?

13:00.240 --> 13:03.630
Now you can tell her about her 
mom all she wants, Mister!

13:06.330 --> 13:08.870
What a nice story.

13:10.340 --> 13:12.510
You worthless waste of a demon!

13:12.510 --> 13:17.240
Is that all you're capable of "adjusting"?!

13:19.870 --> 13:25.550
The curse on Sir Dustiness 
seems to have been broken...

13:25.550 --> 13:27.150
It's broken?!

13:27.150 --> 13:30.890
That's bad! At this rate...

13:31.290 --> 13:36.920
Maxwell! You need to warp this 
story to suit my needs again!

13:36.920 --> 13:39.170
I can't, Aldarp.

13:39.170 --> 13:42.790
You can't? You lowlife infernal...

13:42.790 --> 13:46.290
I used this Divine Treasure to summon 
you, or have you forgotten?!

13:46.290 --> 13:49.290
Do it! You don't get to refuse!

13:49.580 --> 13:54.310
But I can't. The powerful light that 
broke the curse is interfering...

13:54.310 --> 13:55.930
So it can't be done.

13:55.930 --> 13:58.060
You useless wretch!

13:58.060 --> 14:00.790
Enough of this! Enough of you!

14:00.790 --> 14:05.570
This is your final order! 
Bring Lalatina to me right now!

14:05.570 --> 14:08.080
Once you do, I'll pay your price!

14:08.690 --> 14:10.470
Payment?

14:10.830 --> 14:14.520
Yes! Now bring Lalatina to...

14:13.690 --> 14:14.730
Your Lordship?

14:15.190 --> 14:17.200
I've come to apologize 
for what happened today.

14:18.670 --> 14:23.570
W-Well done, Maxwell! 
You've earned your payment!

14:23.570 --> 14:25.480
And you're released from our contract!

14:25.480 --> 14:29.240
Oh, Lalatina! Lalatina!

14:26.390 --> 14:28.470
The contract...

14:33.970 --> 14:39.210
Your Lordship. Please, I ask for my 
friend's safety in exchange for—

14:38.590 --> 14:40.490
You belong to me.

14:40.490 --> 14:45.630
You are mine now!

14:49.260 --> 14:51.540
Did you think it was Lalatina?

14:51.540 --> 14:53.990
Too bad! It was none other than I!

14:55.010 --> 14:59.170
Oh, now that is a massive 
swell of negative emotion!

14:59.170 --> 15:01.190
How very, very flavorful.

15:01.490 --> 15:06.000
This feeling of dread... 
You're just like Max!

15:06.410 --> 15:08.900
Have we met before?

15:08.900 --> 15:12.520
I've made this introduction 
thousands of times before,

15:12.520 --> 15:15.360
but once again: it's a pleasure to meet you,

15:15.360 --> 15:18.580
Maxwell, the warper of truth.

15:18.580 --> 15:22.520
I am Vanir, the all-seeing demon.

15:22.520 --> 15:23.770
Vanir?

15:24.330 --> 15:28.760
Vanir! I don't know what it is, 
but that sounds so familiar...

15:29.360 --> 15:33.210
It's time you return home to Hell, 
Maxwell the Adjuster.

15:33.210 --> 15:35.160
But he's my servant!

15:36.020 --> 15:37.320
A servant?

15:37.730 --> 15:41.620
You would call one of my peers, 
a fellow duke of Hell, Maxwell...

15:41.620 --> 15:43.660
your servant?

15:44.020 --> 15:46.180
A... duke?

15:46.180 --> 15:48.700
You were simply lucky.

15:49.220 --> 15:53.790
Had you summoned any other demon, 
you would've been torn limb from limb.

15:53.790 --> 15:55.920
Vanir! Vanir!

15:57.080 --> 15:59.930
But you rose to your station 
in life thanks to him.

16:00.550 --> 16:02.230
You should be grateful.

16:03.900 --> 16:06.870
And you will, as promised, pay the price.

16:06.870 --> 16:08.930
The contract is also over.

16:10.740 --> 16:16.190
You see, the real issue was 
your contract with Maxwell.

16:17.950 --> 16:22.160
I must say, you've forced me to 
play a rather roundabout hand.

16:22.160 --> 16:23.330
Wait...

16:23.330 --> 16:25.830
It's exactly as you're imagining!

16:25.830 --> 16:29.960
I used the truth behind the debt 
as pretense to inform the boy

16:29.960 --> 16:32.460
about you and your scheming!

16:34.090 --> 16:37.490
Oh, very good! Your dark 
emotions are magnificent!

16:37.490 --> 16:40.270
So incredibly, sublimely flavorful!

16:40.750 --> 16:43.600
What—What are you yapping about?!

16:47.700 --> 16:50.990
Now, then, I believe we're done here.

16:51.320 --> 16:53.160
I will return my comrade to Hell,

16:53.160 --> 16:56.020
and then return to work 
diligently under the auspices

16:56.020 --> 16:57.860
of that dimwitted lady entrepreneur.

16:59.870 --> 17:05.600
Vanir, Vanir! I need to take my payment 
from Aldarp before I go home...

17:06.100 --> 17:10.340
Fine, fine, I'll pay your price, so get out of my—

17:14.130 --> 17:17.560
Ow! It hurts!

17:15.980 --> 17:19.220
Adarp... Aldarp!

17:19.220 --> 17:21.640
Your screams are so good, Aldarp!

17:22.040 --> 17:27.220
The price asked of you is the negative 
emotions that suit Maxwell's tastes.

17:28.920 --> 17:32.530
And I seriously doubt your remaining lifespan 
will be enough to help you survive that.

17:33.170 --> 17:34.540
In that case—

17:33.650 --> 17:36.620
You'd have someone else from your 
family pay instead, perhaps?

17:36.620 --> 17:41.070
Unfortunately, the responsibility of 
payment falls on the contractor alone.

17:43.800 --> 17:50.300
And as robust a feast as this will be, 
despair has never quite suited my palette.

17:50.300 --> 17:54.790
But it's a flavor that 
Maxwell is quite fond of...

17:58.290 --> 18:00.190
The lord's gone missing?!

18:00.520 --> 18:03.400
His long list of wrongdoings 
has suddenly come to light.

18:03.400 --> 18:06.640
He was apparently the one who sent 
the body-swapping Divine Treasure

18:06.640 --> 18:08.260
to Princess Iris, as well.

18:08.260 --> 18:12.360
The rumors say he ran because he could 
no longer keep the truth covered up.

18:12.360 --> 18:13.780
For real?

18:14.800 --> 18:17.020
There's no need to leave town anymore.

18:19.020 --> 18:21.460
See? It turned out fine.

18:21.460 --> 18:23.030
Good grief...

18:23.340 --> 18:26.440
I'm exhausted from spending 
all night packing.

18:26.440 --> 18:30.740
I suggest sleeping until evening 
and then dinner at the guild.

18:31.610 --> 18:32.910
What's up?

18:32.910 --> 18:34.330
Darkness?

18:34.330 --> 18:36.790
Oh, Megumin, you didn't see it happen!

18:36.790 --> 18:40.600
Kazuma actually bought Darkness!

18:40.600 --> 18:42.900
She's probably too scared to come inside.

18:42.900 --> 18:45.320
Whoa! Phrasing!

18:45.320 --> 18:46.410
It's not that, Megumin!

18:46.410 --> 18:48.900
I mean, technically it's true, 
but not the intent!

18:48.900 --> 18:51.520
I am so sorry for how selfish I've been.

18:53.590 --> 18:55.870
It was genuinely foolish.

18:59.580 --> 19:01.450
I don't mind!

19:01.450 --> 19:05.670
Kazuma may have ended up footing quite 
a bill, but all's well that ends well!

19:05.670 --> 19:06.840
Yeah, she's right!

19:06.840 --> 19:10.300
Plus, we managed to catch the curse 
that was making your father sick!

19:13.890 --> 19:18.230
The money will probably be recovered 
from the seized assets of the lord.

19:18.630 --> 19:19.600
But...

19:21.380 --> 19:23.990
The intellectual rights 
that you sold, Kazuma...

19:24.870 --> 19:26.650
You won't be able to get those back.

19:27.580 --> 19:29.060
<i>Is that the issue?</i>

19:29.360 --> 19:30.710
Don't worry about it.

19:31.190 --> 19:33.840
I've learned some cooking skills. 
Maybe I'll open up a cart and...

19:34.270 --> 19:36.430
Wait. Did you say I'm getting my money back?

19:36.430 --> 19:39.940
Yeah. The two billion you paid out,

19:39.940 --> 19:41.630
in addition to compensation for damages.

19:43.100 --> 19:45.050
Two freaking billion?!

19:46.700 --> 19:49.320
Y'know, Kazuma-san, I always thought 
there was something special about you!

19:49.320 --> 19:51.710
Yeah! You've got that certain <i>je ne sais quoi</i>!

19:51.710 --> 19:55.670
So, I was hoping to get 
Emperor Zel a fancy creche...

19:55.670 --> 19:56.720
I know what you mean!

19:56.720 --> 19:58.400
He is quite something, all right!

19:58.400 --> 20:01.050
By the way, I was hoping to get a new robe...

20:01.050 --> 20:03.080
You dirty pair of gold diggers!

20:03.080 --> 20:07.200
Y'know what?! I'm gonna stay 
at an inn for about a week!

20:08.110 --> 20:10.850
What now? We already said it was fine.

20:12.280 --> 20:16.940
It's just... About the letter I wrote...

20:17.690 --> 20:19.110
<i>Oh, I get it.</i>

20:19.480 --> 20:21.990
<i>She thinks of it as having left the party.</i>

20:23.440 --> 20:25.650
Come on, is that all—

20:24.900 --> 20:27.500
Don't be silly!

20:27.500 --> 20:30.700
As our Crusader, you're a 
vital part of this lineup!

20:30.700 --> 20:32.660
We're not letting you go!

20:32.660 --> 20:35.630
She's right! What're you even talking 
about after all this time?

20:35.630 --> 20:37.290
Are you stupid or something?

20:37.290 --> 20:40.540
Where else could you 
possibly belong, Darkness?

20:40.540 --> 20:43.610
Come on, I was gonna say all that!

20:43.610 --> 20:45.310
W-Well...

20:47.580 --> 20:51.550
I am... a Crusader whose only 
worth is in her durability,

20:51.550 --> 20:55.460
and can't connect with a 
sword to save her life.

20:56.660 --> 20:59.680
But... if you're willing...

21:02.650 --> 21:06.820
would you please... let me join you again?

21:10.440 --> 21:12.010
Of course we will.

21:15.090 --> 21:16.230
Welcome home.

21:24.410 --> 21:25.810
I'm home!

21:33.090 --> 21:35.660
<i>This started with living with a princess,</i>

21:35.660 --> 21:39.980
<i>then turned into an existential crisis 
for the party... It's been a busy stretch,</i>

21:39.980 --> 21:41.970
<i>but before I knew it, 
every day was fun again.</i>

21:43.640 --> 21:46.850
<i>I've got good friends. 
And some good acquaintances, too.</i>

21:50.280 --> 21:55.640
<i>I'm gonna live in this town, and when 
I get the craving for excitement,</i>

21:55.640 --> 21:58.260
<i>I'll set out for an adventure with this party.</i>

22:00.240 --> 22:02.990
<i>Here in this wonderful world!</i>

22:05.060 --> 22:06.500
You almost what?!

22:06.800 --> 22:09.550
Seriously, Kazuma, 
are you stupid or something?!

22:09.550 --> 22:12.810
I thought the idea was 
to bring Darkness home!

22:12.810 --> 22:15.640
I-I mean, he may have been in my bed, 
but he only touched my stomach...

22:15.640 --> 22:17.880
In bed?!

22:17.010 --> 22:21.020
Hang on! I mean, that's accurate! 
It's accurate, but...

22:21.020 --> 22:22.910
Darkness was the one who put my hand there!

22:22.910 --> 22:24.750
She what?!

22:24.750 --> 22:28.160
I-It's not like that! I just thought, 
if I was going to marry the lord anyway...

22:28.710 --> 22:30.250
She admitted it!

22:30.250 --> 22:33.170
Darkness just admitted that 
she made the first move!

22:33.580 --> 22:35.880
I'm gonna give you two some space,

22:35.880 --> 22:38.420
maybe take Emperor Zel's egg 
out for some sunbathing.

22:38.420 --> 22:41.700
I had no idea you were so wanton, Darkness!

22:41.700 --> 22:43.620
I feel ridiculous for worrying now!

22:43.620 --> 22:46.480
Just... Just wait a second!

22:46.480 --> 22:49.400
Hey, Kazuma! Help me explain this!

22:49.720 --> 22:51.310
<i>If I have to...</i>

22:51.660 --> 22:55.570
Say, Aqua. How does marriage 
work in this country, anyway?

22:55.570 --> 22:57.470
Where'd that come from?

22:57.980 --> 23:03.340
Well, first you have to turn a notice of 
marriage in on the morning of the ceremony.

23:03.340 --> 23:08.250
And then the ceremony is 
in the afternoon, so...

23:08.250 --> 23:09.980
What brought this on?

23:09.980 --> 23:14.570
I-It's not that uncommon these days...

23:15.580 --> 23:17.700
<i>She's a noble lady who's 
a perverted masochist.</i>

23:17.700 --> 23:19.840
<i>And a virgin who's a got an ex-husband.</i>

23:20.410 --> 23:22.840
If he ran off in the night, then...

23:22.840 --> 23:25.950
I think that means you'd be 
considered abandoned, Darkness.

23:29.590 --> 23:32.270
Hey, who cares what some paperwork says?

23:33.610 --> 23:34.980
Divorcedness.

23:36.720 --> 23:40.050
Don't call me Divorcedness!
