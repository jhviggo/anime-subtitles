WEBVTT

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.240
A world in which the Titans
attack and devour humans.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.080
The humans, who became the hunted...

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.050
built big walls and lived behind them in
exchange for their freedom to prevent invasion.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:40.600
However, the fragile peace was destroyed with the appearance of the Colossal Titan.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.070
They're coming inside!

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.990
The Titans are coming!

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.910
Eren, Mikasa! You two need to live on!

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.080
Stop!

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.220
Eren Jaeger, whose mother
had been killed by a Titan

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.430
became a trainee to polish his knowledge and
skills necessary to exterminate the Titans.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.480
He and his fellow 104th Training Corps,
who spent three years together training,

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.860
would need to be determined
to fight against the Titans.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.990
We already have the answer.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.870
Humanity can't defeat the Titans.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.290
And...?

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.130
You want us to waste the knowledge we have derived through thousands of deaths

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.920
and become food for the Titans?

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.210
No way in Hell!

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.720
I'm going to join the Survey Corps and exterminate the Titans!

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.600
It'll be fine.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.890
Once we recapture the land, we'll be
able to raise more cows and sheep.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.480
<i>Humanity is finally regaining its dignity.</i>

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.570
<i>We can win.</i>

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.240
<i>Mankind's retaliation...</i>

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.450
<i>begins now!</i>

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.050
A deadly battle took place in the Trost District against the Titans who appeared again.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.050
Fire!

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:42.390
Humanity broke its chains of fear and faced forward with their knowledge.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:54.610
But, a new discovery brought back fear to mankind.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.320
Well, Recruit Jaeger?

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.990
Can you seal that gate?

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.160
That...

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.500
well...

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.790
I don't know.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.510
I'm just as clueless as
the rest of us present here.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.340
Oh, that's true, I apologize.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.180
That was the wrong question.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.680
Will you do it or notâ€”which is it?

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.690
Will Eren Jaeger, who had obtained the power to turn into a Titan,

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.780
be the savior of mankind...

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.160
or a demon that leads mankind to destruction?

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.910
Go, Eren!

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.010
Hey, answer already, scum.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.010
What is it you want to do?

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.480
I want to join the Survey Corps

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.020
and slaughter some Titans!

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.320
Oh? Not bad.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.200
That hurt, Annie.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.540
Can't you go a little easier on others?!

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:18.420
It's because you come at me with full
power that I have to act accordingly.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:26.430
If you consider yourself a man, shouldn't
you go easier on this fragile body of mine?

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.050
Huh?!

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.970
Your jokes aren't funny, you know.

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.430
If you're weaker than me, then why am I
on the ground and you're still standing?

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.480
It isn't like I threw you with force.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.650
The weak have to use
self-protection techniques

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.990
to protect themselves against those who are stronger than them, you see.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.500
It won't hurt you to know these kind of moves, too.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.040
I understand, but let's take a break first, alright?

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.960
Here I go!

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.100
Annie... I give up.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.600
I give up...

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.810
Give up?

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.390
Don't give up.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.610
Learn how to use your strength...

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.980
...and how to talk to girls.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.030
Ok, I'll learn how. Let me go already!

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.240
Really? You want to learn more?

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.750
Why the hell did you come flying, Reiner?

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.710
Hey, Annie...

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.340
Can you teach those moves...

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.640
...to me too?

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:05.070
I don't know about that.
These moves are only for humans.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.030
I don't think someone like you needs them at all.

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:14.780
But, I'm curious whether these moves will work on a monster.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.200
I...Is this for real? At last...

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.250
Hey, hey!

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:21.830
Are they gonna fight?

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:22.960
It's the most anticipated duel!

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:23.290
W...Which one do you think?
It's the most anticipated duel!

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:23.830
W...Which one do you think?

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:24.130
Do you think it will be Annie?
W...Which one do you think?

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:25.210
Do you think it will be Annie?

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:26.550
Huh? Are you stupid?

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.800
I bet my whole dinner on Mikasa.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.680
Which one do you think will win, Eren?

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.050
I...

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:42.810
Which one...

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.800
<i>Why am I remembering that all of a sudden?</i>

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.760
<i>I wonder what the others are doing right now.</i>

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.690
<i>Anyway...</i>

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.650
<i>...where am I?</i>

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:29.190
<i>How many days have passed?!</i>

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:33.030
<i>How long is this confinement going to last?</i>

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:36.990
<i>Please bear with this for a little longer.</i>

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.370
<i>We'll try to sort things out somehow.</i>

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.120
<i>Commander Erwin said that but...</i>

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:44.870
<i>Don't tell me...</i>

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.790
<i>Am I stuck here for good?</i>

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.140
So you're Eren, huh?

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.770
You okay? Feeling well?

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:05.770
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:08.860
You're free to come out of there now.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.610
That's assuming you wear these though.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:18.990
I am Hange Zoe, a Squad Leader
in the Survey Corps.

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:20.950
The same goes for him.

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:22.500
His name is Mike Zacharias.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.750
Um...

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.290
Oh...

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:29.880
He has a habit of smelling people
he's met for the first time...

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.590
and snorting afterward.

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:35.220
But I'm sure it's nothing more than just that.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.220
Oh man, sorry for wasting all our time
only talking about insignificant things.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.100
We're here already.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.020
Well, no worries.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:46.770
In fact, going in clueless is better.

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:48.730
Wait!

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.820
It's selfish of us, but we...

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.110
can only put our faith in you.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:56.570
Best of luck.

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:06.660
<i>A courthouse?</i>

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:10.880
<i>I was under a courthouse?</i>

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.090
Get a move on!

00:10:20.890 --> 00:10:22.970
<i>Why are these people here?</i>

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:26.680
<i>What's going to be decided anyway?</i>

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:30.350
<i>You guys...</i>

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.570
Now then, let us begin.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.150
Eren Jaeger, correct?

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:44.290
You are a soldier who has
offered his life for mankind.

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:45.700
Is that accurate?

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:46.830
Yes.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:49.210
This is an unprecedented case.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:53.630
The trial will be a special court-martial
in which common law does not apply.

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:58.170
Let us begin with the Military Police
Brigade's opening statement.

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:03.970
Your honor, after conducting a thorough examination of Eren's body,

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:06.850
we dispose of him in a prompt manner.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:13.730
It cannot be denied that his Titan power
allowed us to repel the latest attack.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:18.900
However, his existence is also a source
of discord that can incite rebellion.

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:23.950
Therefore, after having him impart all the information he can provide,

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:26.790
we'll have him die as a hero of mankind.

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:34.420
Now then, let us hear the
Survey Corps' opening statement.

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:35.460
Your honor,

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:40.170
We of the Survey Corps will accept
Eren as an official member

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:43.470
and use his Titan power to recapture Wall Maria.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.220
That is all.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:49.480
Hm?

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.980
Is that it?

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.230
Yes.

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:56.020
If we utilize his power,
we can recapture Wall Maria.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.230
I believe it's clear what needs to be prioritized.

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:00.570
Wait a second!

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:03.910
Wouldn't it be best to seal
all the gates for good now?

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:07.330
The only parts of the wall the Colossus
Titan can destroy are the gates!

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.370
Enough already, you boor!

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:14.830
You want mere humans to tamper
with Wall Rose, a gift from God?!

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:16.920
That's enough out of you, priest!

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:17.800
What?!

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:21.920
Order in the court.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:26.180
You may argue about differences
in principles elsewhere.

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.390
Jaeger, allow me to confirm:

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:33.190
Can you continue to contribute to mankind as you have thus far

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.940
and utilize your Titan power to that same end?

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.150
Yes! I can!

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:39.270
Really?

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:43.780
But in the report for the
Battle of Trost District, it said:

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:49.990
"After transforming into a Titan,
he swung his fist at Mikasa Ackerman."

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.710
What, you wanted me to lie in a report?

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:56.670
Is Mikasa Ackerman here?

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:58.290
Yes, that's me.

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:00.210
You, huh?

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:04.090
Is it true that Jaeger attacked
you in his Titan form?

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.100
Yes, it is.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.810
As I thought, a Titan will
always be a Titan, after all.

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:20.570
<i>I tried to kill Mikasa?!</i>

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:22.480
<i>Me?</i>

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:29.660
Mikasa Ackerman lost her parents at a young
age and was taken in by the Jaeger family.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.450
Furthermore, through our investigations,

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:35.710
we have uncovered some shocking events
that took place during that time.

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:40.920
At the age of nine, Eren Jaegar and Mikasa Ackerman

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.920
stabbed to death three men wanted for robbery and kidnapping.

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:48.640
Though this falls under legitimate self-defense,

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:52.600
I feel their basic human nature needs to be questioned.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.850
That's right!

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:57.390
He must be a Titan that's been hiding
amongst us in the form of a child!

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:58.650
Her too.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.520
I wouldn't be surprised if she wasn't human!

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.360
Yeah!

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.280
We should dissect her just in case.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.690
Wait, please!

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:09.530
I might be a monster, but that
has nothing to do with her!

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:10.740
Nothing at all!

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.080
As if we could trust you!

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:12.740
It's the truth!

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:14.450
He's covering for her because it's true!

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:15.370
No!

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:22.000
I mean... you're wrong.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:29.510
So far, all of you've been doing is blurting out
convenient speculations that suits you.

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:32.390
Wh-What did you say?!

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:33.810
To begin with,

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:34.770
<i>I should stop.</i>

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:36.850
you've never even <i>seen</i> a Titan before,

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:38.890
so what are you so afraid of?

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:41.900
<i>I should't say any more.</i>

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:44.480
<i>No, I'll keep at it.</i>

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.490
<i>I'll make my stand here!</i>

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:50.910
How can we afford to not
let those with power fight?

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:56.200
If you're scared of fighting to survive,
then lend me your strength!

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.120
You... damn cowards.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.250
What?!

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:04.130
Just shut up and bet everything on me!

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:10.800
Take aim!

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:11.510
Y-Yes!

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:17.770
<i>Huh?</i>

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.070
Wait, Mikasa!

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.790
This is just my pet theory,

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:41.920
but I think pain and
discipline go hand-in-hand.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.380
What you need now

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:47.670
isn't a lecture, but training.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:50.670
You're in a good position for me to kick too.

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.190
Wait, Levi...

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:04.730
What?

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.820
That's dangerous.

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:11.320
What'll you do if he gets
angry and transforms?

00:16:13.820 --> 00:16:15.780
What're you saying?

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:19.160
You guys are gonna dissect him, right?

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.960
Supreme Commander, I have a proposal.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.540
Yes?

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:31.050
Eren's Titan power has
many uncertain points to it,

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:32.970
which poses a constant threat.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:37.640
So I propose he be entrusted
to Lance Corporal Levi

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.890
and taken out on an expedition.

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:42.180
You'll bring Eren outside?

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:43.230
Yes.

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.850
I'd like Eren's control over his Titan power,

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:50.150
and his worth to mankind

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:52.860
to be judged based on the
results of that expedition.

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:56.410
Handling Eren Jaeger...

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:58.620
Can you do it, Levi?

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:02.250
I'm certain I could kill him.

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:06.040
The problem is that there'll be no alternative.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.630
I've made my decision.

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:21.720
<b>A Few Days Later
A Few Days Later</b>

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:31.110
The former Survey Corps HQ.

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:34.610
As an old castle that was renovated to be our base,

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:37.360
it definitely looks extravagant.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:42.120
But since it's this far away
from the walls and the river,

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:45.330
it really wasn't something we needed.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:51.840
I never imagined we'd be keeping
you in that old decoration.

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:57.380
Don't get ahead of yourself, recruit.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:58.260
Excuse me?

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.010
You may be a Titan or whatever,

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:04.980
but a pissy brat like you being under
Lance Corporal Levi's watchâ€”

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.900
This is what you get for
yapping away on horseback.

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.740
First impressions are crucial.

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.820
That recruit was scared stiff.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:21.910
Say, that's not how you usually talk, is it?

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:27.210
If... If that's your idea of
imitating Lance Corporal Levi,

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:29.040
could you seriously stop it?

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.420
Then again, it's not like
it was similar in any way.

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:36.050
Are you trying to keep me down, Petra?

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:40.260
You haven't gone through the
proper steps to act as my wife.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.180
If only you had bit your tongue off and died...

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:46.600
<i>These people are the Survey
Corps' Special-Ops Squad,</i>

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.100
<i>a.k.a. The Levi Squad.</i>

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:54.360
<i>They're all elites that were
hand-picked by Lance Corporal Levi.</i>

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.440
<i>And so...</i>

00:18:55.820 --> 00:19:00.070
<i>if I go berserk, they'll be the ones to kill me.</i>

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:03.780
There are weeds everywhere.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.950
This place is a mess.

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:08.410
It's been a while, after all.

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:10.500
The inside's probably covered in dust.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.670
Now <i>that's</i> a problem we can't overlook.

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.380
We'll get to work immediately.

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:28.020
The upper floor is clean now.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.270
Which of the rooms should I stay in?

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:35.730
You're to stay in the basement.

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:38.490
The basement again?

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:40.110
Obviously.

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:42.820
You've yet to gain full control over yourself.

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:45.530
If you accidentally transform into a Titan,

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:47.790
we can restrain you as long
as you're underground.

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:53.210
That was one of the conditions given
to us in exchange for your custody.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:54.960
It's a rule to be followed.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.090
I'll take a look upstairs.

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:01.340
Eren, you finish up here.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:02.300
Understood.

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:09.060
An expedition to establish a base
for a supply chain in thirty days, huh?

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:12.810
And you want us to bring the
newly graduated recruits along.

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:15.440
That's assuming any of them enlist.

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:20.900
Regardless, I'd have to say this seems too rushed.

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:24.610
Eren's current position is only temporary.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:30.580
We need to prove to Central that he's
beneficial to mankind as soon as possible.

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:35.330
Otherwise, the Military Police
Brigade might interfere againâ€”

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:38.500
You can't be honest, even with me, Erwin?

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:47.010
You're as sharp as ever, Mike.

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:50.930
I'm still not at your level though.

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:53.980
I'll tell you when the time is right.

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:02.030
Ready to start, Eren?

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.450
Once we're ready, we'll fire a smoke signal.

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.120
What you do after that is up to you.

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:11.200
Understood!

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:17.830
This dry well will be able to restrain
a Titan even if it's out of control.

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:19.000
Probably.

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:23.590
We've been studying captured
Titans like Sawney and Bean,

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:27.930
but today, Eren is here to help!

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:33.890
How exciting...

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:37.520
That's the signal.

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:40.770
<i>Controlling a Titan...</i>

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:42.690
<i>I haven't done that since sealing the wall.</i>

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:46.030
<i>If I go berserk again,</i>

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:49.660
<i>I might be killed by the Levi Squad, huh?</i>

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.380
I wonder if he didn't see the signal.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:02.880
No.

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.930
We weren't even particularly
certain of this in the first place.

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.390
Hey, Eren!

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:12.930
The experiment's on hold.

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:16.640
Is something wrong?

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:23.070
Hange...

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:27.030
I can't turn into a Titan.

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:33.120
The wounds you got from
biting yourself aren't healing?

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:36.620
Yes.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.710
If you can't turn into a Titan,

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:43.210
sealing Wall Maria and all
is nothing but a dream.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:46.300
This is an order.

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.800
Do something about it.

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:50.930
Sir.

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:54.850
Don't be so depressed, Eren.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.640
But...

00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:00.600
Well, this just means you're
more human than we thought.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:05.030
I prefer this to hurrying
matters and losing lives.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.530
This wasn't meaningless.

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:13.830
You all right?

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:14.660
Yes.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:24.840
Whoa...

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:25.880
What happened?!

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:35.430
Why now?!

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:37.350
Calm down.

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:38.640
Lance Corporal Levi!

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.020
This is...

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:43.810
I'm telling you to calm down.

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:45.440
All of you.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:47.070
Eren...

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:48.230
What's the meaning of this?!

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:49.570
Sir?

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:51.280
Why'd you transform without permission?

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:52.160
Eld, hold on.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:56.030
Prove to us that you're not
ourâ€”no, mankind's enemy.

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:58.160
It's your responsibility to do so!

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.620
Don't you so much as dare twitch that arm!

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:02.750
The moment you do, your head will roll!

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:04.500
Oluo! I'm telling you to calm down.

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:05.380
Lance Corporal!

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:06.880
Please step away from Eren!

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:07.670
You're too close!

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:10.550
No, <i>you're</i> the ones who should step away.

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:11.130
Stand down.

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:11.930
Why?!

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:12.970
My instincts tell me so.

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:13.800
Well, Eren?!

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.970
Say something!

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:15.600
I'mâ€”

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:16.640
Don't make any funny moves!

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.930
Prove it already!

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:18.350
Eren!

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:19.270
I'm not sure what'sâ€”

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:19.810
Answer me!

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:21.980
You think we can't kill you?!

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:24.020
I'm serious! Hurry up!

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:24.980
You hear me?!

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:26.190
Look, I'll do it!

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:26.560
To mankind, you'reâ€”

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:29.280
Please shut up for a minute!

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:31.690
Eren!

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.950
Can I touch that arm?!

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:37.870
Hey, is it okay?

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:38.910
It's okay, right?

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:40.290
I'm just gonna touch it!

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:41.450
Hange!

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:42.960
Wait a second!

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:46.000
H...

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.460
Hot!

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:50.340
It's damn hot when there's no skin!

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:52.260
It's super hot!

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:53.260
Squad Leader!

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:55.550
You're being too reckless!

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:58.390
Say, isn't it hot for you, Eren?

00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:01.180
How exactly are you connected to that arm?

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:03.060
I really want to see!

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:04.100
<i>That's right.</i>

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.100
<i>I have to pull my arm out quickly.</i>

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.900
H-Hey, Eren! No funny business!

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:16.450
Huh?!

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:18.830
Wait, Eren, that's too soon!

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:21.040
There's so much more I...

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:34.550
Lance Corporal...

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:37.800
How do you feel?

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:47.730
Not... too good.

00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:00.780
Sorry for the delay.

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.580
They finally let me go.

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:06.160
Explaining to the higher-ups took some time.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.330
Well, anyway,

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:09.790
take a look at this.

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:13.210
A teaspoon?

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:14.590
Yes.

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:18.470
Eren's Titan arm was holding onto this.

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:23.850
And for some reason, there's no
deformation from heat or pressure.

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:26.270
Does anything come to mind?

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:32.270
I believe I was trying to pick
that up when I transformed.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.190
I see.

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:40.070
Then that could explain why you weren't
able to turn into a Titan before.

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:43.120
"Kill the Titans."

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.700
"Defend against the cannon."

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.500
"Lift the boulder."

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:51.880
In every instance, you had a clear
goal before you transformed.

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:57.510
It's likely that self-injury
isn't the trigger on its own;

00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:01.390
you need some sort of objective as well.

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:02.430
But still...

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:05.810
Turning into a Titan to pick up a spoon...

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.390
What the hell's up with that?

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:13.400
So basically, you didn't act
against orders on purpose, right?

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.940
Yes.

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.170
Wait, what are you doing?!

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:33.670
That hurts...

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:36.130
This is tough.

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:39.630
Eren, I'm surprised you
can bite yourself like that.

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:42.430
It was the wrong call on our part.

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:45.180
This is our modest way of apologizing.

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:47.680
Not that it really makes a difference though.

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.020
Our job is to keep you in check, after all.

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:54.190
We made no mistakes about that!

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:56.480
Don't get too cocky, brat!

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:58.400
I'm sorry, Eren.

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:00.740
We were too on edge.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:03.870
You must be upset by our indiscretion.

00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:07.160
But, despite that...

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.410
As we rely on you,

00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:11.710
we also want you to rely on us.

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:18.050
So...

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.470
believe... in us.

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:31.390
Is Squad Leader Hange here?!

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:33.980
The experiment subjects...

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:36.650
Both of the Titans were killed!

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:49.080
Sawney! Bean!

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:51.160
Tell me...

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:53.370
Tell me this isn't true!

00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:57.210
Our valuable experiment subjects...

00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:58.880
Was it a soldier?

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.050
Yes.

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:01.550
The culprit's still on the loose.

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:05.050
Apparently, it all happened before sunrise.

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:09.220
When a guard noticed, they got away with
their three-dimensional maneuver device.

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:11.430
Sawney!

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:13.180
What's going on...?

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:14.850
Let's go.

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:16.810
The Military Police Brigade will take over here.

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:18.310
R-Right.

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:23.700
What can you see?

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:27.950
Who do you think the enemy is?

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:35.790
Sorry, forget I asked.

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.940
When's the last time the shaft was replaced?

00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:00.610
Six days ago, after the cleaning operation.

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:03.280
She checks out.

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.400
Okay, next!

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.110
You there.

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:08.450
I'm Krista Lenz of the 42nd Squad.

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:10.740
We'll inspect your gear.

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:14.000
So you can be punished for killing a Titan too?

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:17.540
As strange as it sounds,
those were valuable specimens.

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:21.840
Even so, why are they searching
for the culprit amongst us recruits?

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:26.550
Yeah, everyone's exhausted from
cleaning up the battlefield until today.

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:31.260
The culprit must've really hated the Titans.

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:32.140
Yeah.

00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:36.270
But in this case, they pretty
much helped the Titans out.

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:39.730
Their lust for revenge may have been sated,

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:42.400
but mankind will suffer for it.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:46.070
I'm an idiot, so I think I get it.

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:51.070
Before I saw a Titan, I seriously planned
to enlist in the Survey Corps.

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:54.660
But now, I'm not sure.

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:57.830
Today's the day we have to decide too.

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:03.500
<i>Is Jean seriously...</i>

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.420
Are you really going to join the Survey Corps?

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:08.220
Yeah.

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:11.470
Because of what happened to Marco...

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:14.600
But... aren't you scared?

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:18.020
What? Of course I'm scared
of joining the Survey Corps.

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:20.810
I'm different from that reckless idiot.

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:21.940
Eren, huh?

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:26.110
He's already in the Survey Corps, isn't he?

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:31.450
You know, I'm not putting my life on
the line because I was persuaded to.

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:36.870
At the very least, this isn't a decision
someone else can make for me.

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:40.670
Damn.

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:42.540
Hey, Annie.

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:44.170
What did you think?

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:47.130
Jean of all people said he'd
enlist in the Survey Corps.

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:48.170
Nothing really.

00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:50.970
You're set on the Military Police Brigade, right?

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:53.680
I should go there too, shouldn't I?

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:58.560
Say, if someone told you to die, would you?

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:00.270
What do you mean?

00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:01.770
Of course not.

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:05.110
Then, why not decide for yourself?

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:08.690
Armin, how about you?

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:16.950
I think that if there's a legitimate reason,
there might be no other choice but to die.

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:18.910
I wouldn't like it though.

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:19.830
I see.

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:21.040
So you've decided.

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:23.710
Seriously?

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:25.080
Armin, you too?

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:30.130
You're weak, but you <i>do</i> have guts.

00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:32.630
Th-Thanks.

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:36.640
Annie, you're actually pretty nice, huh?

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:42.390
I mean, it seems like you don't
want us to join the Survey Corps.

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:47.400
Is there a reason why you want to join
the Military Police Brigade though?

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.570
Not really.

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:51.690
I just want...

00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:54.780
to save myself.

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:23.390
Everyone!

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:24.560
Oluo,

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:26.770
may I go speak with my friends for a bit?

00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:28.810
Jeez, just go already.

00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:31.150
Hey, Mikasa, Armin!

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:33.070
Eren!

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.700
It feels like it's been forever!

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:39.200
Eren, did they do anything terrible to you?

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.580
Like inspecting every bit of your body

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:44.160
or causing you mental anguish?

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.790
No, nothing like that.

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:48.880
That shorty went way too far.

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.880
I'll pay him back in kind someday.

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:53.590
You're not talking about
Lance Corporal Levi, are you?

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:55.630
Hey, Eren.

00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:57.090
It's been a while!

00:33:57.090 --> 00:34:00.470
Oh wow, you're all here?

00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:02.220
But...

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:05.020
Are you guys here because...

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:07.230
Don't tell me, you enlisted?

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:09.650
Why else would we be here?

00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:14.990
Then, the only ones who picked the Military
Police Brigade are Jean, Annie, and Marco?

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:19.240
You're kidding me...

00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:20.950
You too?!

00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:22.740
Marco's dead.

00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:26.500
What... did you just say?

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:30.000
Did you say Marco's dead?

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.130
It seems like not everyone
dies a dramatic death.

00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:38.630
We don't even know how he went down.

00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:43.680
He died alone, without
anyone seeing or knowing.

00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:45.980
Marco...

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:49.190
Hey, Eren.

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:53.650
I heard that, as a Titan, you tried to kill Mikasa.

00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:55.480
Mind explaining yourself?

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:56.940
That's wrong.

00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:58.360
Eren was trying to kill a flyâ€”

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.110
I didn't ask you.

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:04.290
I think it's true.

00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:07.290
In my Titan form, I tried to kill Mikasa.

00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:10.460
So you don't really remember it, huh?

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:14.250
In other words, you weren't aware
you had that power until now,

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:17.920
and you lack the means to control it.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:20.010
Yeah, that's right.

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:25.510
Hear that, guys?

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:27.560
That's the situation we're in.

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:32.310
We'll probably die without Eren
ever knowing, just like Marco did.

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:36.570
Jean, why are you driving
Eren into a corner like this?

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:39.200
You know, Mikasa...

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:44.780
Not everyone can blindly die for Eren
like you, without anything in return.

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:49.120
We expect something out of Eren.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.370
Let us know what to expect.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.710
And whether it's worth our lives.

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:03.260
So, Eren!

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:07.890
We're seriously counting on you, okay?

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.730
Yeah...

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.850
Hey, recruits, gather up!

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:16.650
Your uniforms are here!

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:51.100
Commander, we're departing soon.

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:55.600
We've lured away all nearby Titans!

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:58.020
Thirty seconds until the gate is open!

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:03.570
In mere moments, mankind
will advance once again.

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:07.160
Show us what you're made of!

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:10.620
Open the gate!

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:29.310
Forward!

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:37.400
We now begin the 57th expedition!

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.480
Advance!

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:55.120
A 10-meter-class approaching
from ahead, on the left!

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:58.710
While I'm quite interested in
the contents of its stomach,

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:01.250
I'll leave this to the support squad!

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:05.420
Damn.

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:06.930
Too shallow.

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.010
Defend the ranks!

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:14.980
Don't falter!

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:17.730
Leave it to the support squad and advance!

00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:23.480
Forward! Forward!

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:30.740
Oluo, can they...

00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:33.080
Can my comrades beat the Titans?

00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:34.410
Huh?

00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:37.670
What the hell have you been
doing this past month?

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:40.880
Listen, you damn brat.

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:42.590
During an expedition,

00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:45.260
the point is to <i>avoid</i> the Titans if possiâ€”

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:56.100
Assume the long-distance scouting formation!

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:00.020
Later, Armin.

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.980
Don't wet yourself even if you run into a Titan!

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:04.530
Right.

00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:05.690
Same to you.

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:15.240
The vanguard will form a semicircle.

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:16.950
Although we're spread out,

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:18.750
stay within eyesight of someone on all sides,

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:21.040
in fixed distances from one another.

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:25.670
Extend survey and relay range as far as possible.

00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:52.450
<i>We'll be fine.</i>

00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:53.620
<i>Calm down.</i>

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.540
Red... Red smoke signal...

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:52.130
Blouse! This way!

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:55.220
Damn!

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:56.970
Looks like we missed one.

00:40:56.970 --> 00:40:58.390
Let's draw it toward us.

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:00.770
Blouse! Come this way!

00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:12.610
I'll handle it.

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:13.490
Withdraw!

00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:14.490
Sir!

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.090
Squad Leader...

00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:35.550
Get back in position!

00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:37.090
He's out of gas.

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:44.180
<i>Something's strange...</i>

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:46.650
<i>It's been a while since the red
smoke signal was fired,</i>

00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:48.810
<i>but we've yet to regroup.</i>

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:49.820
<i>Don't tell me...</i>

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.990
<i>A black smoke signal?</i>

00:41:55.530 --> 00:41:59.490
<i>Is one ignoring nearby people and heading
straight for the formation's center?</i>

00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:01.330
<i>There's no doubt about it.</i>

00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:02.870
<i>It's...</i>

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:06.080
<i>an Abnormal!</i>

00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:11.340
Damn, guess we have no other choice.

00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:13.210
Sys, you get its nape!

00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:15.220
I'll stop it in its tracks!

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:16.510
Roger!

00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:21.390
<i>Arlert should be over there.</i>

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:24.560
<i>I don't want to let a new
recruit run into one of these.</i>

00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:26.140
<i>We'll kill it here!</i>

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:35.900
Now, Sys!

00:42:42.910 --> 00:42:45.040
Squad Leader Ness did it!

00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:49.040
We got it, huh?

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:52.250
You came for me?

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:54.300
That's why you're my favorite.

00:42:55.210 --> 00:42:57.510
I love you, Shallot!

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.100
Again?

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:09.690
What's the right flank scout squad doing?

00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:11.610
If it ignored them and came this way,

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:13.730
then it must be an Abnormal too.

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:16.320
Here we go again.

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:18.740
Sys, let's do it once more.

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:19.780
Sir.

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:24.080
But really, to think we have
to do this twice in a row...

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:27.410
And it looks like it's a 14-meter-class at least.

00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:29.250
This one will be tough.

00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:38.970
What's that?

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:40.180
It's so fast!

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:42.140
Don't let it get to Arlert!

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:43.050
Sys!

00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:44.010
Sir!

00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:20.130
Wh-Who is she?!

00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:21.430
Why?!

00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:22.930
This is bad. What do I do?

00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:24.010
I'll die too.

00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:25.010
I'll be killed!

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.520
Go! Run away!

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:36.880
She's not going to kill me?

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.540
What just happened?

00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:41.590
She took off my hood...

00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:43.050
and looked...

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:46.220
at my face?

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:47.800
Armin!

00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:50.100
Reiner!

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.230
Hey, can you stand?

00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:57.690
Well, for starters, you're dead meat if
you don't have a horse outside the walls.

00:45:57.690 --> 00:45:58.690
Hurry!

00:45:58.690 --> 00:45:59.900
Right!

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:10.410
From the right flank?

00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:13.200
Does that mean we got hit
so bad we can't continue?

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:16.370
It seems we lost part of
the right flank scout squad.

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:18.170
Hordes of Titans came.

00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:20.750
That's the same direction she came from.

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:21.750
No way...

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:23.760
Was she leading the Titans here?

00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:25.630
An Abnormal?

00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:30.010
No, she's a human controlling a Titan's body.

00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:31.720
What?!

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:34.140
The moment her vitals were targeted,

00:46:34.810 --> 00:46:38.560
she flung Sys to the ground, crushing him.

00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:41.190
Regular Titans will only consume.

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:44.440
I get the feeling she's looking for someone.

00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:49.200
Assuming that's true,
she must be searching for...

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:50.410
Eren!

00:46:50.410 --> 00:46:51.990
Eren?

00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:53.740
But the Levi Squad, which Eren's in,

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:56.410
should've been in charge of the
right flank that she passed through.

00:46:56.410 --> 00:46:57.750
No.

00:46:57.750 --> 00:47:00.790
They should be in the safest spot of this formation.

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:05.590
So I guess they're somewhere in the center rear.

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:10.010
Armin, we don't have time to think right now.

00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:14.180
At this distance, we might still be able to draw her attention.

00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:18.020
We might be able to buy enough time for everyone else to retreat.

00:47:19.310 --> 00:47:20.480
Jean.

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:24.770
I... know what needs to be done now!

00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:27.940
Not to mention, this is the job we chose!

00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:28.950
Lend me a hand!

00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:15.870
Armin!

00:48:25.170 --> 00:48:27.050
<i>She covered her nape.</i>

00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:28.000
Jean!

00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:31.340
<i>Damn, I can't get away!</i>

00:48:32.090 --> 00:48:32.840
<i>I'm going to die!</i>

00:48:33.930 --> 00:48:34.890
Jean!

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:37.350
Avenge that reckless idiot!

00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:39.850
<i>Armin?</i>

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:42.810
<i>She stopped moving?</i>

00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:44.060
That's the one!

00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:45.650
That's the one that killed him!

00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:48.690
He really ended up dying on the right flank!

00:48:48.690 --> 00:48:50.690
Avenge that reckless idiot!

00:48:59.080 --> 00:48:59.830
<i>Reiner?</i>

00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:02.830
It crushed my best friend with one stomp!

00:49:02.830 --> 00:49:05.790
I saw his body stuck under its foot!

00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:11.170
<i>He's going straight for the nape?</i>

00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:12.300
<i>Wait, that might work!</i>

00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:21.350
H-Hey...

00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:35.240
H-Hey...

00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:38.240
Reiner, you...

00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:57.140
We bought enough time, right?!

00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:59.470
Let's get away from her already!

00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:03.730
If she doesn't eat people,
she shouldn't follow us!

00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:13.070
Look.

00:50:13.070 --> 00:50:17.490
The giant bitch got scared
and is running home now!

00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:20.620
<i>What... Why?</i>

00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:23.450
<i>That's toward the center rear.</i>

00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:25.040
<i>Could she be...</i>

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:26.870
<i>heading toward Eren?</i>

00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:47.350
<i>Damn it, why?</i>

00:50:47.350 --> 00:50:52.190
<i>Reiner's horse came back,
so why is mine still missing?</i>

00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:12.710
Armin.

00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:13.630
Hey, Armin!

00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:17.300
Looks like someone's coming.

00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:19.880
With two horses, at that.

00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:23.850
That's...

00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:27.980
Krista!

00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:30.650
Guys! You okay?!

00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:36.400
It's my horse!

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:37.240
Whoa, whoa!

00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:39.530
Calm down, Bufpart.

00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:42.990
It was extremely panicked when it ran to me.

00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:45.160
Did you fight a Titan?

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:47.330
Armin!

00:51:47.330 --> 00:51:48.870
That injury...

00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:49.960
Are you okay?

00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:51.420
Yeah, somehow.

00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:55.040
I'm glad our smoke signal got through to you.

00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:59.170
I happened to be nearby,
and Jean's horse was with me.

00:51:59.170 --> 00:52:03.890
Even horses seem fond of you,
so I think you have some special charisma.

00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:05.180
You saved us.

00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:07.180
But I'm so glad...

00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:13.980
I'm so glad you all managed to survive.

00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:19.490
<i>A deity...</i>

00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:20.700
<i>A goddess...</i>

00:52:21.570 --> 00:52:23.280
<i>I want to marry her.</i>

00:52:24.070 --> 00:52:26.700
Anyway, we need to hurry back to the formation.

00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:29.870
Oh, right. Withdrawal orders
should be relayed soon.

00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:37.170
A green smoke signal?!

00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:41.630
Looks like the operation's continuing
with just a change in direction.

00:52:42.090 --> 00:52:43.050
No way.

00:52:43.050 --> 00:52:44.800
Shouldn't we be withdrawing?

00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:47.680
What's going through
Commander Erwin's head?!

00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:50.770
Don't tell me the command squad
didn't see the smoke signals.

00:52:50.770 --> 00:52:54.480
Whatever the reason, it's obvious
what we should do next.

00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:56.980
Let's obey the order.

00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:06.370
Green smoke signal.

00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:08.950
Oluo, you fire it.

00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:10.040
Roger that.

00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:13.500
<i>It seems like everything's
going smoothly for now.</i>

00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:16.000
<i>However...</i>

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:18.500
<i>is that </i>really<i> the case?</i>

00:53:19.210 --> 00:53:20.380
Reporting in!

00:53:21.090 --> 00:53:22.380
It's an operation report!

00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:24.720
The right flank's scouts
have suffered heavy losses!

00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:27.140
Scouting ability is crippled!

00:53:27.140 --> 00:53:29.220
Please relay this report to the left!

00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:32.060
Hear that, Petra?

00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:32.930
Go!

00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:33.850
Sir!

00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:37.020
<i>The right flank?</i>

00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:39.820
<i>That's where Armin should be.</i>

00:53:41.690 --> 00:53:43.110
<i>A black smoke signal?</i>

00:53:43.490 --> 00:53:44.950
An Abnormal!

00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:47.620
Eren, you fire it.

00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:48.660
Sir!

00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:50.660
What a mess.

00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:54.500
We let them too far into the formation.

00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:59.420
<i>The Titans are right over there.</i>

00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:04.420
<i>Whoever it is fighting under that smoke signal...</i>

00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:09.890
The right flank is all but annihilated, you say?!

00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:11.600
And we're still not withdrawing?

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:12.430
Why?!

00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:13.640
I don't know!

00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:15.100
Commander's orders!

00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:17.100
At any rate, relay it to the left!

00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:27.410
What's going on?

00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:30.740
We've been heading east for a while now.

00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:33.910
The old town area should
be to the south though.

00:54:34.450 --> 00:54:37.790
At this rate, we'll run straight <i>there</i>.

00:54:37.790 --> 00:54:40.500
Yeah, it's in plain sight now.

00:54:41.090 --> 00:54:43.050
The forest of giant trees.

00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:52.140
Looks like Titans have passed through here.

00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:55.520
There's nothing growing on the road.

00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:58.230
The wagons should have no problem.

00:54:59.770 --> 00:55:01.360
Relay this to the rear.

00:55:01.730 --> 00:55:05.440
Only the center lineâ€”the wagon
escort squadâ€”will enter the forest.

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:06.070
Sir!

00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:16.870
Um, Squad Leader.

00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:20.380
It looks like the center line
is following the forest path.

00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:23.630
At this rate, we'll run into the forest.

00:55:25.090 --> 00:55:26.090
We're going around.

00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:28.090
S-Sir!

00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:33.600
All soldiers, halt!

00:55:34.970 --> 00:55:36.430
All right, recruits.

00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:38.100
Listen up!

00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:40.600
We'll now position ourselves to intercept.

00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:42.650
Draw your blades and wait in the treetops.

00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:46.650
If a Titan attempts to enter
the forest, stop it at all costs!

00:55:46.650 --> 00:55:48.070
Huh?

00:55:48.070 --> 00:55:49.990
But, Squad Leader, whyâ€”

00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:51.860
Shut up and obey!

00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:57.790
Are you serious?

00:55:57.790 --> 00:55:59.500
What the hell is going on?

00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:02.630
5-meter-class incoming!

00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:11.590
Lance Corporal.

00:56:11.590 --> 00:56:13.510
Lance Corporal Levi!

00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:14.800
What?

00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:16.060
"What", you say?

00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:18.100
This is a forest!

00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:20.940
If only the center line enters the forest like this,

00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:23.480
we won't know if a Titan is approaching!

00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:26.070
It seems like something's
coming from the right,

00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:29.940
but how will we avoid it
or protect the wagons?

00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:32.860
Quit whining about the obvious.

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.830
There's clearly no way
we can do either of those.

00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:52.970
A black smoke signal!

00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:54.680
It's right behind us!

00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:57.430
It's the thing that came from the right, huh?

00:56:57.970 --> 00:56:59.720
Everyone, draw your blades.

00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:06.480
It'll be over in an instant once it appears.

00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:31.880
Faster!

00:57:40.310 --> 00:57:41.020
It's fast!

00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:43.850
There's no way to avoid it in this forest!

00:57:43.850 --> 00:57:45.140
It's catching up!

00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:47.230
Lance Corporal, let's switch to
three-dimensional maneuvers!

00:57:47.810 --> 00:57:49.230
Lance Corporal!

00:57:51.150 --> 00:57:52.740
You're not getting away!

00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:54.950
Reinforcements from the rear!

00:58:10.210 --> 00:58:12.960
<i>I have to turn into a Titan and fight!</i>

00:58:14.590 --> 00:58:15.930
What are you doing, Eren?!

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:20.930
That should only be done when
your life is in grave danger.

00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:22.640
Didn't you promise us that?

00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:26.850
Eren!

00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:29.980
You're not in the wrong.

00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:33.940
Feel free to do it.

00:58:35.570 --> 00:58:37.490
I don't know the right answer.

00:58:37.490 --> 00:58:39.370
I never have.

00:58:39.370 --> 00:58:41.580
Even if I believed in myself

00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:45.200
and the decisions of the comrades
who've earned my trust,

00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:47.710
the result was always a complete mystery.

00:58:48.210 --> 00:58:49.580
That's why...

00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:54.880
you should just do your best to
make a decision you won't regret.

00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:12.980
Eren!

00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:16.440
Believe in us.

00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:30.750
Eren!

00:59:30.750 --> 00:59:31.380
Hurry up!

00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:32.920
Decide already!

00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:37.380
I'll keep going!

00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:46.350
Target is accelerating!

00:59:46.770 --> 00:59:47.930
Faster!

00:59:47.930 --> 00:59:49.770
We'll outrun it!

01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:04.910
Fire!

01:00:25.930 --> 01:00:28.390
After securing the horses up ahead,

01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:30.480
switch to three-dimensional maneuvers.

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:32.730
I'll act separately for a while.

01:00:32.730 --> 01:00:34.770
Eld will take charge of the squad.

01:00:40.650 --> 01:00:41.610
Could they be...

01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:46.030
capturing that Titan... alive?

01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:50.450
It sounds like something
is going on inside the forest.

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:52.000
It's just as I thought.

01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:55.000
I think the commander

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.510
was planning to capture that female Titan from the beginning, and baited her into this forest.

01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:06.470
To be precise, it's to capture the human inside it.

01:01:07.890 --> 01:01:10.020
Commander Erwin's goal...

01:01:10.890 --> 01:01:12.940
was that all along.

01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:15.020
That's what it was, right?

01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:18.320
But new recruits like me aside,

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:22.320
why did they not tell Survey
Corps veterans like all of you?

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:23.650
Shut it!

01:01:23.650 --> 01:01:27.700
Are you implying that we're not trusted by the Commander and the Lance Corporal?!

01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:29.950
No, it's just as Eren said.

01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:35.210
I think the Commander had a
reason for keeping this from us.

01:01:35.830 --> 01:01:37.380
A transforming human...

01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:42.760
Or perhaps, a spy who's working
with such a person is amongst us.

01:01:45.010 --> 01:01:49.560
But how many soldiers do you think died?

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:54.640
If we knew that there was a Titan spy in our ranks,

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:56.940
things should have gone differently.

01:01:58.270 --> 01:02:01.110
No, he wasn't mistaken.

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.440
The lives of a hundred comrades

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:06.320
or the lives of all those within the walls...

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:08.450
The Commander made his choice.

01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:12.580
He decided to cast off the
lives of a hundred comrades.

01:02:13.950 --> 01:02:18.250
Hey, won't you come out already?

01:02:18.250 --> 01:02:20.670
We don't have all day, you know.

01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:26.970
If I'm not mistaken, you killed
my subordinates in various ways,

01:02:27.590 --> 01:02:29.970
but did you take joy in any of it?

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:34.270
Oh, right.

01:02:34.270 --> 01:02:36.440
There's something I want to ask.

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:40.560
Is it all right if I sever your hands and feet?

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:43.860
They'll grow right back, won't they?

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:46.360
I'm talking about your real body.

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:50.870
It'll be a problem if you die, after all.

01:03:17.730 --> 01:03:18.890
Why you...

01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:20.770
That was quite the scare.

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:25.280
Erwin, it smells.

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:26.280
Direction?

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:27.490
Multiple, from every direction.

01:03:27.490 --> 01:03:28.860
All at once.

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:42.330
<i>They're targeting the female Titan?</i>

01:03:44.250 --> 01:03:47.090
Titans from every direction!

01:03:47.550 --> 01:03:49.510
All soldiers, engage the enemy!

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:52.430
Defend the female Titan!

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:04.060
It's no good!

01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:14.580
All soldiers, retreat!

01:04:16.490 --> 01:04:18.370
Assume the formation.

01:04:19.370 --> 01:04:21.580
Return to Karanese District!

01:04:39.890 --> 01:04:41.480
We've been had.

01:04:42.730 --> 01:04:44.980
Just look at you.

01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:46.650
Don't tell me youâ€”

01:04:46.650 --> 01:04:52.030
This shows the enemy was prepared
to abandon everything.

01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:58.410
To think they'd have themselves devoured
to avoid leaking information...

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:04.500
I'll call up my squad.

01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:06.210
Wait, Levi.

01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:09.420
Resupply your blades and gas.

01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:10.920
We're short on time.

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:12.590
What I have on hand should last.

01:05:12.590 --> 01:05:13.970
Why?

01:05:13.970 --> 01:05:15.510
It's an order.

01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:16.850
Obey.

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:19.970
Understood, Erwin.

01:05:20.850 --> 01:05:23.060
I'll trust your judgment.

01:05:34.570 --> 01:05:36.160
Looks like we're done here.

01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:37.990
Prepare to withdraw!

01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:42.120
Did we really get them?

01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:44.120
It's all thanks to you.

01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:46.000
I didn't do much.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.090
You believed in us, remember?

01:05:48.630 --> 01:05:52.800
It's because you stuck with us then
that we arrived at this result.

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:56.590
It's rather difficult to make
the right decision, you know.

01:06:06.310 --> 01:06:07.350
Oh.

01:06:07.350 --> 01:06:09.570
That must be from Lance Corporal Levi.

01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:11.440
We'll meet up with the Lance Corporal!

01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:26.330
Erwin.

01:06:26.330 --> 01:06:28.250
Why'd you have Levi resupply?

01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:30.210
We don't have time.

01:06:30.210 --> 01:06:32.170
The female Titan was devoured.

01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:35.090
But... did you see the person inside get eaten?

01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:36.800
I didn't.

01:06:38.090 --> 01:06:38.970
Don't tell me...

01:06:38.970 --> 01:06:39.970
Exactly.

01:06:39.970 --> 01:06:42.470
Just as you deduced before,

01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:46.520
if they're a type that can move to some
extent even after transforming...

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:48.690
Furthermore,

01:06:48.690 --> 01:06:51.860
assuming they had a three-dimensional
maneuver device equipped...

01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:54.190
Lance Corporal Levi?

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:57.110
No, that's not him!

01:06:57.110 --> 01:06:57.700
Who're you?!

01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:06.660
Wait, what happened?!

01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:08.750
Gunther!

01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:20.970
Eren, don't stop!

01:07:20.970 --> 01:07:22.100
Keep moving!

01:07:22.850 --> 01:07:24.520
Gunther is...

01:07:25.890 --> 01:07:26.810
Who is it?!

01:07:26.810 --> 01:07:27.940
Protect Eren!

01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:29.400
Is it the female Titan?

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:30.770
Or were there others?

01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:32.020
<i>The female Titan?</i>

01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:33.860
<i>No way... How?!</i>

01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:49.420
Bingo, huh?

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:50.750
Here it comes!

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:52.880
It's the female Titan!

01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:03.140
Damn, why you...

01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:04.510
I'll do it this time!

01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:05.600
I'll kill it!

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:06.390
Don't!

01:08:07.850 --> 01:08:10.600
The three of us will take
down the female Titan.

01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:13.610
You continue heading to HQ at full speed!

01:08:14.730 --> 01:08:16.020
What's with you?!

01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:17.990
You doubting our skills?!

01:08:18.490 --> 01:08:20.320
Is that so, Eren?

01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:23.530
Are we really that unreliable?

01:08:31.250 --> 01:08:33.580
I believe my squad will be victorious!

01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:36.380
Good luck!

01:08:59.150 --> 01:09:00.490
<i>We blinded it.</i>

01:09:00.490 --> 01:09:03.240
<i>It won't be able to see for at least a minute!</i>

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:04.490
<i>We'll finish it before that!</i>

01:09:04.490 --> 01:09:05.820
<i>To hell with capturing it!</i>

01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:06.620
<i>We'll kill it now!</i>

01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:07.910
<i>Die a dog's death here!</i>

01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:09.660
<i>Down with this damn Titan!</i>

01:09:20.670 --> 01:09:26.180
<i>We'll slice all of the muscles around your shoulders
so you won't be able to hold up your arms!</i>

01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:32.390
<i>Slice them apart...</i>

01:09:32.770 --> 01:09:33.600
<i>And those arms...</i>

01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:34.770
<i>Will drop!</i>

01:09:38.570 --> 01:09:39.860
They're down!

01:09:41.610 --> 01:09:43.030
Now the neck!

01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:45.740
Once the muscles supporting its neck are cut...

01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:47.240
we can get its nape!

01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:49.950
Your nape is miâ€”

01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:57.290
Eld!

01:10:04.090 --> 01:10:05.680
How?

01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:08.050
It can't possibly see already!

01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:10.350
Not even thirty seconds have...

01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:12.680
Just one eye?

01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:15.350
It prioritized one eye to heal faster?

01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:17.650
How is that possible...

01:10:18.810 --> 01:10:19.400
Petra!

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:20.860
Right yourself already!

01:10:22.150 --> 01:10:24.780
Petra, hurry up!

01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:35.710
Hey...

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:37.000
Die!

01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:44.630
Why?

01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:46.380
My blade won't go through.

01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:06.820
I'll...

01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:11.780
I'll...

01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:14.700
kill it!

01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:31.760
Eren?

01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:33.680
Mikasa!

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:35.100
<i>This voice...</i>

01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:36.430
<i>Don't tell me...</i>

01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:13.740
<i>Because I made the wrong decision...</i>

01:13:15.410 --> 01:13:19.910
<i>Because I wanted to believe in my comrades...</i>

01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:21.620
<i>everyone died!</i>

01:13:31.090 --> 01:13:36.140
<i>If only I had believed in myself
from the start and fought...</i>

01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:40.640
<i>If only I had killed her from the start!</i>

01:13:51.190 --> 01:13:53.240
<i>I'll rip you apart.</i>

01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:55.740
<i>I'll split you wide open...</i>

01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:58.160
<i>Tear you to bloody shreds...</i>

01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:01.120
<i>Mangle every last chunk...</i>

01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:03.460
<i>And devour it all!</i>

01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:02.240
Eren!

01:16:23.050 --> 01:16:25.100
Wait...

01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:26.640
Eren...

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:30.520
Don't go...

01:16:36.230 --> 01:16:39.950
Give Eren... back!

01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:51.370
Give him back!

01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:02.840
Why won't the blade go through?

01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:10.230
Wait!

01:17:10.730 --> 01:17:12.140
Wh-What're you...

01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:14.440
Fall back for now.

01:17:20.110 --> 01:17:21.610
Maintain this distance.

01:17:22.110 --> 01:17:24.610
We'll stick to a single objective.

01:17:24.610 --> 01:17:27.740
First, we'll give up on killing the female Titan.

01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:30.830
But they've killed so many of our comrades!

01:17:31.450 --> 01:17:34.870
As long as it can reinforce
its skin, we have no chance.

01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:36.330
Trust my judgment.

01:17:37.170 --> 01:17:40.590
We'll place our hopes on Eren being alive

01:17:40.590 --> 01:17:42.840
and rescue him before it gets out of the forest.

01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:44.970
I'll hack away at it.

01:17:44.970 --> 01:17:46.720
You draw its attention!

01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:41.440
<i>He's fast...</i>

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:44.030
<i>So fast that it doesn't have time to reinforce!</i>

01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:59.880
<i>I can get the nape.</i>

01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:01.130
<i>I can kill it!</i>

01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:03.840
Stop!

01:19:17.310 --> 01:19:18.520
Eren!

01:19:24.530 --> 01:19:25.150
Hey!

01:19:26.650 --> 01:19:27.950
We're pulling out!

01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:29.360
Eren...

01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:32.030
He should be fine.

01:19:32.030 --> 01:19:33.240
Alive, at least!

01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:34.620
Filthy though.

01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:36.870
Don't worry about it anymore.

01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:38.460
We're retreating.

01:20:12.570 --> 01:20:15.790
Aren't there fewer of them than in the morning?

01:20:15.790 --> 01:20:18.000
They've lost quite a few.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.250
Yet another disaster.

01:20:20.250 --> 01:20:24.040
They made a real racket when they left
in the morning, but they're back already.

01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:26.170
What'd they go for?

01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:31.430
Eren, you shouldn't get up yet.

01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:33.800
Cool!

01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:36.470
The Survey Corps is amazing!

01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:39.890
They get beaten so badly,
but they keep fighting!

01:20:43.610 --> 01:20:46.650
Commander Erwin! Answer us!

01:20:46.650 --> 01:20:50.570
Did this expedition achieve something
worthy of the sacrifices?!

01:20:50.570 --> 01:20:53.820
Are you convinced the dead have no regrets?!

01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:03.540
The expedition's expenses and
casualties were more than enough

01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:08.050
to utterly humiliate the
Survey Corps' power base.

01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:18.310
Those responsible, including Erwin,
were summoned to the capital,

01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:21.730
and Eren's new supervisor was chosen.

01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:36.370
Keep at it, Annie!

01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:41.500
Now that's my girl.

01:21:43.370 --> 01:21:44.580
What are you doing, Annie?!

01:21:44.580 --> 01:21:45.710
No breaks!

01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:04.020
Huh? You haven't heard?

01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:08.230
Seems like the Titan brat and his chief
superiors were summoned to the capital.

01:22:08.610 --> 01:22:10.530
They'll be coming through here today.

01:22:10.530 --> 01:22:11.650
That so?

01:22:11.650 --> 01:22:14.740
Well, I'm sure they'll end up
dissecting him this time.

01:22:20.910 --> 01:22:23.160
Looks like she's finally up.

01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:27.170
You know, you look so scary when
sleeping that I didn't dare wake you up.

01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:29.340
Sorry about that, Annie.

01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:31.420
You've been slacking off too much lately.

01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:33.010
What?

01:22:33.010 --> 01:22:35.300
Mad already, are we? Come on...

01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:37.090
Just let her be.

01:22:37.090 --> 01:22:39.930
Annie's from Trost District of all places.

01:22:39.930 --> 01:22:42.810
She's the only one with battle
experience in this branch.

01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:44.810
You can't expect her to recover so soon.

01:22:44.810 --> 01:22:47.060
I mean, she's fresh out of living hell.

01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:54.070
I told you to cut that stuff out.

01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:58.410
Today, you'll be assigned to do
something outside your usual duties.

01:22:58.410 --> 01:23:00.070
That's why I had you assemble here.

01:23:00.740 --> 01:23:04.580
It's about the group of Survey Corps members
that were summoned to the capital.

01:23:04.910 --> 01:23:08.580
They'll be passing through
the town's central street today.

01:23:09.250 --> 01:23:12.000
The Military Police Brigade HQ
is in charge of escorting them,

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.090
so we're only tasked with helping
on their leg through town.

01:23:16.170 --> 01:23:19.720
Move alongside the escort squad
and work to bolster their security.

01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:21.100
That is all.

01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:42.950
Annie.

01:23:55.380 --> 01:23:56.210
Hey.

01:23:56.840 --> 01:24:00.220
You're really part of the Military
Police Brigade now, huh?

01:24:00.930 --> 01:24:02.260
Armin...

01:24:04.510 --> 01:24:07.100
What's with the outfit?

01:24:07.390 --> 01:24:09.270
I'm a baggage carrier.

01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:14.020
I'm using this rain coat to hide my
three-dimensional maneuver device.

01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:15.150
See?

01:24:16.110 --> 01:24:17.650
What for?

01:24:18.490 --> 01:24:23.070
Annie, will you give us a hand
in helping Eren escape?

01:24:23.070 --> 01:24:25.160
Where to?

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:29.580
After rebelling against the monarchy,
where within the walls will you run to?

01:24:29.580 --> 01:24:32.170
We're only going to hide out temporarily.

01:24:32.170 --> 01:24:35.000
We don't plan to oppose them head-on.

01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:39.420
It'll be reported as an act of rebellion
by part of the Survey Corps,

01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:40.800
but that'll buy us time

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:45.300
during which we'll prepare what's needed to
overturn the commission of inquiry's decision.

01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:47.010
Without fail.

01:24:47.010 --> 01:24:50.100
Does something that convenient exist?

01:24:50.100 --> 01:24:51.060
Any leads?

01:24:53.650 --> 01:24:55.570
Sorry, I can't say.

01:24:58.530 --> 01:25:01.490
I hate to tell you this,
but it's out of the question.

01:25:01.820 --> 01:25:04.870
I won't say anything though, so do what you can.

01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:06.740
Annie!

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:08.490
Please!

01:25:08.490 --> 01:25:10.250
At this rate, Eren will be killed!

01:25:12.250 --> 01:25:16.090
Ignorant people, for their own self-preservation,

01:25:16.090 --> 01:25:20.510
are unwittingly attempting to set
humanity on a path to extermination!

01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:23.760
I know this isn't convincing.

01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:25.220
But even so...

01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:28.140
all we can do is take a huge gamble now!

01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:32.440
Say...

01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:35.270
Do I really seem like such
a good person to you?

01:25:36.110 --> 01:25:37.570
A good person?

01:25:37.570 --> 01:25:38.900
Well...

01:25:39.650 --> 01:25:43.280
I don't particularly like that term.

01:25:43.650 --> 01:25:45.360
I mean, that just...

01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:51.040
seems like something you'd call
someone who's of use to you.

01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:55.540
And I don't think there's anyone
who's of use to everyone.

01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:59.840
That said, if you don't agree to cooperate...

01:26:01.050 --> 01:26:04.550
you'd be a bad person in my eyes, right?

01:26:16.730 --> 01:26:17.690
Fine.

01:26:21.150 --> 01:26:22.610
I'm in.

01:26:30.910 --> 01:26:34.210
We got through more easily than I expected.

01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:36.540
That's the Military Police Brigade for you.

01:26:36.540 --> 01:26:38.670
It's clear they work hard day after day.

01:26:38.670 --> 01:26:40.210
Quit looking around.

01:26:40.750 --> 01:26:43.880
Now we'll just have to hope they
don't notice it's Jean in there.

01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:46.300
Can't expect that to work long.

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:50.050
The two of us look nothing alike, after all.

01:26:50.470 --> 01:26:51.850
Don't worry too much.

01:26:51.850 --> 01:26:55.810
Both of you have a villainous glint in
your eyes and similar, evil-looking faces.

01:26:56.100 --> 01:26:58.150
I don't have a horse face like him.

01:26:58.150 --> 01:27:03.690
Hey, if I had decided not to help you,
how were you planning to get over the wall?

01:27:04.190 --> 01:27:06.950
We planned to get past using
three-dimensional maneuver devices.

01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:08.700
That's so reckless.

01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:11.780
To begin with, running before
entering Stohess District

01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:14.700
would've saved you a lot of trouble, no?

01:27:15.250 --> 01:27:17.710
Why here and now?

01:27:17.710 --> 01:27:19.880
I predicted the complicated terrain in this city

01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:23.710
would make the switch more likely to succeed.

01:27:23.710 --> 01:27:26.920
And rather than being openly defiant,

01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:30.010
feigning obedience would decrease suspicion

01:27:30.010 --> 01:27:32.180
and buy us more time to escape.

01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:35.350
I see.

01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:36.810
That makes sense.

01:27:41.270 --> 01:27:42.570
There it is.

01:27:50.110 --> 01:27:51.280
Here?

01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:52.330
Yeah.

01:27:52.330 --> 01:27:54.040
We go through here.

01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:58.460
The ruins of an underground city that
was planned and abandoned still lie here.

01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:04.380
This path continues up
until near the outer gate.

01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:06.550
Really? That's amazing.

01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:09.800
Annie?

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:11.590
What're you doing?

01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:14.930
You're not about to tell us that you're
scared of dark, narrow spaces, are you?

01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:17.350
That's right.

01:28:17.350 --> 01:28:19.140
I'm scared.

01:28:19.140 --> 01:28:22.480
I'm sure a brave and reckless idiot like you

01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:26.230
wouldn't understand the
feelings of a frail girl like me.

01:28:29.860 --> 01:28:34.660
A girl who can flip a massive guy
around in mid-air isn't frail.

01:28:34.660 --> 01:28:36.740
Quit joking and let's get moving.

01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:38.620
No, I won't go.

01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:42.420
I'm scared of going that way.

01:28:42.420 --> 01:28:45.380
If we're not moving above
ground, you're on your own.

01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:57.350
What the hell are you saying?!

01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:58.770
Get over here already!

01:28:58.770 --> 01:29:00.020
Enough screwing around!

01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:01.480
Eren, keep it down.

01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:03.650
It's fine, isn't it, Mikasa?

01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:07.730
Since for a while now,

01:29:07.730 --> 01:29:11.740
there hasn't been anyone
around for some reason.

01:29:19.290 --> 01:29:20.830
Honestly.

01:29:20.830 --> 01:29:22.500
I'm hurt.

01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:27.630
Just when did you come to

01:29:27.630 --> 01:29:31.130
look at me with such eyes,

01:29:31.130 --> 01:29:32.380
Armin?

01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:35.760
Annie, why...

01:29:36.850 --> 01:29:39.770
did you have Marco's
three-dimensional maneuver device?

01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:45.150
Down to the slightest scratches and dents...

01:29:45.150 --> 01:29:47.690
Because we maintained our equipment together...

01:29:48.570 --> 01:29:50.730
I recognized them all.

01:29:52.110 --> 01:29:53.450
I see.

01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:55.110
It was...

01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:57.410
something I found.

01:29:59.740 --> 01:30:02.460
But if you suspected something a month ago,

01:30:02.460 --> 01:30:04.790
why didn't you do anything?

01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:07.420
Because I still can't believe it.

01:30:07.420 --> 01:30:11.420
I wanted to believe I was mistaken.

01:30:11.420 --> 01:30:12.670
That's why.

01:30:14.260 --> 01:30:16.640
But... you too...

01:30:18.140 --> 01:30:22.060
Back then... Because you didn't kill me...

01:30:22.430 --> 01:30:26.350
it came down to this, don't you see?

01:30:34.490 --> 01:30:37.620
Yeah, I completely agree.

01:30:38.530 --> 01:30:42.870
I never imagined you'd end up
cornering me to this extent.

01:30:45.410 --> 01:30:46.710
Back then...

01:30:47.830 --> 01:30:50.540
Why... I wonder...

01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:52.920
Hey, Annie!

01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:54.590
There's still a chance you're an idiot

01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:58.340
who has terrible timing with stupid
jokes that you carelessly throw

01:30:58.340 --> 01:31:00.390
into the conversation.

01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:02.260
Regardless, just get down here.

01:31:03.270 --> 01:31:06.350
You can prove something by
simply stepping down here!

01:31:06.350 --> 01:31:08.190
So come here and prove it!

01:31:09.270 --> 01:31:10.940
I can't go there.

01:31:10.940 --> 01:31:13.940
I've... failed to become a warrior.

01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:16.950
I'm telling you, this isn't funny at all!

01:31:16.950 --> 01:31:18.240
Let's talk this through, Annie!

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:19.820
We can still discussâ€”

01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:22.160
I've had enough.

01:31:22.370 --> 01:31:24.120
I can't listen to this anymore.

01:31:25.540 --> 01:31:27.250
It's a waste of my time.

01:31:28.750 --> 01:31:31.250
I'll slice you to shreds again...

01:31:31.250 --> 01:31:33.250
Female Titan!

01:32:03.030 --> 01:32:08.080
Armin, it's great that I was
a good person to you, huh?

01:32:08.830 --> 01:32:11.380
Your gamble paid off this time.

01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:15.050
But now...

01:32:15.750 --> 01:32:17.590
I'll see if <i>my</i> bet...

01:32:17.590 --> 01:32:18.920
pays off!

01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:33.650
Eren!

01:32:39.450 --> 01:32:40.110
Mikasa!

01:32:40.110 --> 01:32:41.200
We were too late!

01:32:57.210 --> 01:32:58.300
Annie...

01:33:04.090 --> 01:33:06.310
Our plan is for the day after tomorrow,

01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:10.020
during our passage to the capital where
we are to answer the summonsâ€”

01:33:10.020 --> 01:33:10.730
at Stohess District.

01:33:11.850 --> 01:33:14.980
It will be our first and last chance.

01:33:15.230 --> 01:33:17.650
We'll wager everything on this plan.

01:33:19.740 --> 01:33:20.900
The plan is as follows:

01:33:21.950 --> 01:33:23.700
As we pass through Stohess District,

01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:27.660
Eren will act as bait and lure the target
to this underground passage.

01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:32.210
Upon bringing them to the lowest level,
judging by their size and power,

01:33:32.210 --> 01:33:36.290
their movements should be fairly
restricted, even if they transform.

01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:38.210
Sir.

01:33:38.210 --> 01:33:42.550
So the main target is, without a doubt,
in Stohess District, correct?

01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:43.800
Yes.

01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:45.800
The target is part of the
Military Police Brigade.

01:33:46.180 --> 01:33:47.600
The Military Police Brigade?

01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:49.680
Armin was the one who inferred that.

01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:52.180
According to him,

01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:55.310
the Female Titan may be responsible
for killing the two Titans we'd captured

01:33:56.310 --> 01:34:00.230
and is possibly a member of the
104th Training Corps, like you.

01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:03.780
W-Wait just a second.

01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:06.910
The name of the female suspected
to be the Female Titan is...

01:34:06.910 --> 01:34:08.830
Wait...

01:34:11.620 --> 01:34:12.960
Annie...

01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:14.580
Leonhart.

01:34:22.090 --> 01:34:23.920
Sh... Shoot.

01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:31.600
Damn it.

01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:33.100
That ring...

01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:36.100
So she saw through me from the start, after all!

01:34:36.100 --> 01:34:39.110
She even noticed the ambush we planned too.

01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:40.900
Hey!

01:34:41.230 --> 01:34:43.360
Status of the primary capture?

01:34:43.650 --> 01:34:45.240
Unsuccessful!

01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:46.610
Please switch over to Plan B!

01:34:47.990 --> 01:34:48.700
Whaâ€”

01:34:53.790 --> 01:34:55.710
She stomped through?!

01:34:56.830 --> 01:34:57.750
We have to save them!

01:34:57.750 --> 01:34:59.670
Eren, get back!

01:34:59.670 --> 01:35:01.090
Hey, Mikasa!

01:35:01.090 --> 01:35:04.380
Is the Female Titan trying to show
she doesn't need Eren alive?

01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:08.430
If we stay like this, there's no telling when we're going to be crushed!

01:35:09.050 --> 01:35:10.720
I'll figure something out,

01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:13.520
like how I was able to block cannon fire that time.

01:35:15.930 --> 01:35:16.940
Just follow me!

01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:17.810
Heâ€”

01:35:17.810 --> 01:35:18.980
Here we go.

01:35:18.980 --> 01:35:20.190
Stick close to me.

01:35:28.530 --> 01:35:29.700
Huh?

01:35:31.030 --> 01:35:32.700
Again?!

01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:34.450
No way...

01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:39.370
At a time like this...

01:35:39.370 --> 01:35:41.710
Damn, it hurts!

01:35:44.130 --> 01:35:48.260
If you don't have a clear objective,
you can't transform, right?

01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:50.470
Visualize and focus on it again.

01:35:50.470 --> 01:35:51.760
I know!

01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:53.220
But...

01:35:55.020 --> 01:35:55.720
Deep down...

01:35:57.640 --> 01:36:01.400
you're still hesitant to fight Annie, aren't you?

01:36:04.270 --> 01:36:05.230
Eren...

01:36:06.190 --> 01:36:08.900
Don't tell me you're still thinking

01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:12.700
that we're mistaking Annie as the Female Titan.

01:36:14.740 --> 01:36:18.290
Did you not see what happened earlier?

01:36:18.290 --> 01:36:21.080
That woman's the one who
killed our comrades, right?

01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:23.250
Do you still not see that?

01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:26.710
Shut up!

01:36:26.710 --> 01:36:28.510
Can't you see I'm trying?!

01:36:32.090 --> 01:36:34.220
Annie's the Female Titan?

01:36:34.930 --> 01:36:36.220
Why...

01:36:36.220 --> 01:36:38.770
Why do you think that, Armin?

01:36:39.690 --> 01:36:43.360
The Female Titan knew what
Eren looked like from the start.

01:36:43.900 --> 01:36:47.940
Furthermore, she reacted upon hearing
Eren's nickname, "the reckless idiot",

01:36:47.940 --> 01:36:50.150
when only our generation
should know about it.

01:36:50.740 --> 01:36:52.070
And above all else,

01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:57.080
Annie was likely responsible for the murders
of Sawney and Bean, the test subjects.

01:36:58.580 --> 01:37:00.500
How can you be sure about that?

01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:04.750
Advanced techniques were required
to pull off those murders,

01:37:04.750 --> 01:37:08.460
so she must've used her three-dimensional
maneuver device, which she's proficient with.

01:37:08.460 --> 01:37:09.460
Yeah...

01:37:09.460 --> 01:37:11.970
but that's what the equipment inspection was for.

01:37:11.970 --> 01:37:13.800
Annie came out clean.

01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:17.220
That's because the device
Annie had was Marco's.

01:37:17.470 --> 01:37:18.520
Huh?

01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:20.100
Couldn't you have just been seeing things?

01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:22.520
No, that was definitely something Iâ€”

01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:25.860
Hey, kid, we've already heard that.

01:37:25.860 --> 01:37:27.400
Isn't there anything else?

01:37:27.770 --> 01:37:29.190
Not that I know of.

01:37:29.190 --> 01:37:32.860
I believe that Annie's face
resembles the Female Titan's.

01:37:32.860 --> 01:37:33.780
Huh?

01:37:33.780 --> 01:37:34.910
What're you saying?

01:37:34.910 --> 01:37:39.240
Eren, has anything come to
mind after hearing all this?

01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:51.210
When you fought hand-to-hand
with the Female Titan,

01:37:51.630 --> 01:37:55.260
did it use any techniques
that are unique to Annie?

01:38:13.070 --> 01:38:14.320
You realize now, don't you?

01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:21.080
The Female Titan is Annie.

01:38:24.710 --> 01:38:28.130
In that case, shouldn't you be fighting?

01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:30.130
Or...

01:38:30.630 --> 01:38:33.970
is some particular emotion hindering you?

01:38:33.970 --> 01:38:35.300
Huh?

01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:41.600
I have a plan.

01:38:42.930 --> 01:38:46.850
Mikasa and I will exit from that hole
and the entrance simultaneously.

01:38:46.850 --> 01:38:49.610
Doing so will force Annie to focus on one of us.

01:38:50.110 --> 01:38:53.110
At that time, Eren, follow the one she ignored.

01:38:53.570 --> 01:38:55.030
Wait!

01:38:55.030 --> 01:38:57.780
Wouldn't that mean one of you will die?!

01:38:57.780 --> 01:38:59.910
Staying here will get all three of us killed.

01:39:00.830 --> 01:39:02.620
Mikasa, get in position!

01:39:02.620 --> 01:39:04.790
Okay, I'll take the front.

01:39:06.750 --> 01:39:07.960
Mikasa!

01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:09.000
Armin!

01:39:10.090 --> 01:39:11.290
How?

01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:14.380
How can you two still fight?!

01:39:14.630 --> 01:39:16.170
How?!

01:39:20.390 --> 01:39:21.890
What choice do we have?

01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:25.890
The world is a cruel place.

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:47.160
Eren!

01:40:06.980 --> 01:40:08.940
Don't let the Female Titan get away!

01:40:08.940 --> 01:40:12.020
We'll stop her from getting out no matter what!

01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:14.520
Eren!

01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:16.530
I'm here to save you!

01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:21.490
Open your eyes!

01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:26.290
Something's off.

01:40:26.290 --> 01:40:28.910
There seemed to be some sort of explosion andâ€”

01:40:28.910 --> 01:40:30.080
Nile.

01:40:30.540 --> 01:40:32.830
Dispatch all your soldiers at once.

01:40:32.830 --> 01:40:35.630
We should assume a Titan has appeared.

01:40:35.630 --> 01:40:36.840
What are you saying?!

01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:38.920
This is Wall Sina, you know!

01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:41.800
It's impossible for a Titan to appear here!

01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:43.430
Wait!

01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:44.550
Don't move, Jaeger!

01:40:44.550 --> 01:40:47.220
I've had enough of playing doppelgÃ¤nger!

01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:51.730
Don't ever call me that again, retard!

01:40:52.350 --> 01:40:54.440
Commander, let me go too!

01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:56.610
Get your equipment from the 4th squad.

01:40:56.610 --> 01:40:57.820
Yes, sir!

01:40:57.820 --> 01:41:01.740
It's good to be enthusiastic, but don't
forget to guard your own life.

01:41:01.740 --> 01:41:02.910
Sir.

01:41:05.660 --> 01:41:06.540
Erwin!

01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:07.660
What's going onâ€”

01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:11.460
Everyone that can move, follow me!

01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:13.750
We'll join the Female Titan capture squad!

01:41:14.670 --> 01:41:17.170
Levi, you stay put.

01:41:17.170 --> 01:41:18.550
You dislike meaningless death, don't you?

01:41:19.170 --> 01:41:21.550
Yeah, that's right.

01:41:21.550 --> 01:41:24.050
Whether it's mine or others'.

01:41:24.050 --> 01:41:25.550
It's a Titan! A Titan's here!

01:41:25.550 --> 01:41:26.850
Why here of all places?!

01:41:26.850 --> 01:41:28.060
Didn't they seal the wallâ€”

01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:29.470
Eren!

01:41:29.470 --> 01:41:31.180
Hey, what're you doing?!

01:41:31.180 --> 01:41:32.060
Jean!

01:41:32.060 --> 01:41:33.310
Eren is under this!

01:41:33.310 --> 01:41:34.270
Huh?!

01:41:34.270 --> 01:41:36.310
Shouldn't he have transformed already?

01:41:36.860 --> 01:41:38.280
He wasn't able to.

01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:42.240
The fact that Annie's the Titan
might be what's hindering him.

01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:43.160
What?

01:41:49.950 --> 01:41:52.750
We'll have to do something about <i>her</i> first!

01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:57.750
Eren.

01:41:57.750 --> 01:42:00.590
People who are unable to abandon anything

01:42:00.590 --> 01:42:03.220
will fail to bring about any change.

01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:06.600
If it's required to overcome monsters,

01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:08.760
one must toss aside their humanity.

01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:11.640
I'm sure Annie is capable of that.

01:42:12.890 --> 01:42:15.190
those who can do so are victorious!

01:42:28.660 --> 01:42:29.530
Annie!

01:42:29.530 --> 01:42:31.580
If you don't kill me this time,

01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:35.460
you won't be able to make excuses like
"I'll see if <i>my</i> bet pays off!"

01:42:37.710 --> 01:42:39.000
Armin, this way!

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:40.340
All right!

01:42:45.010 --> 01:42:48.050
<i>People who are unable to abandon anything</i>

01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:51.640
<i>will fail to bring about any change.</i>

01:42:53.230 --> 01:42:54.730
<i>I know.</i>

01:42:54.730 --> 01:42:56.270
<i>When the time came...</i>

01:42:57.230 --> 01:43:01.480
<i>I clung to my comrades and the
bonds we shared, and failed.</i>

01:43:02.980 --> 01:43:04.780
<i>Think back.</i>

01:43:12.330 --> 01:43:15.710
<i>I'll... exterminate.</i>

01:43:15.710 --> 01:43:17.290
<i>No...</i>

01:43:17.290 --> 01:43:19.000
<i>I'll kill!</i>

01:43:23.050 --> 01:43:27.050
<i>I don't have time to think about
whether it's right or not!</i>

01:43:27.050 --> 01:43:28.970
<i>Just start by moving!</i>

01:43:28.970 --> 01:43:31.680
<i>Don't get caught up in ideals!</i>

01:43:32.220 --> 01:43:33.680
<i>Yes...</i>

01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:34.850
Mikasa!

01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:38.350
<i>The world's a cruel place!</i>

01:43:47.610 --> 01:43:49.700
What is it this time?!

01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:15.430
Eren!

01:44:17.230 --> 01:44:18.480
<i>Eren...</i>

01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:27.110
A Titan?

01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:28.740
Why here?

01:44:34.410 --> 01:44:36.120
It's level ground!

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:38.500
The Female Titan is approaching level ground.

01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:40.960
We can't use our gear there!

01:44:41.420 --> 01:44:43.210
Split into two groups and go around!

01:44:43.210 --> 01:44:44.420
Yes, sir!

01:44:48.050 --> 01:44:49.470
Why's a Titanâ€”

01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:07.940
<i>Annie...</i>

01:45:07.940 --> 01:45:11.950
<i>You always looked disinterested.</i>

01:45:11.950 --> 01:45:19.580
<i>But, only when you were demonstrating your
hand-to-hand techniques, you looked lively to me.</i>

01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:23.380
<i>You seemed like a terrible liar.</i>

01:45:23.380 --> 01:45:24.830
<i>That's what I thought.</i>

01:45:27.710 --> 01:45:29.840
<i>Hey, Annie.</i>

01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:33.390
<i>What in the world are you fighting for?</i>

01:45:33.390 --> 01:45:37.390
<i>What great cause justifies killing people?</i>

01:46:39.990 --> 01:46:40.870
<i>Annie...</i>

01:46:42.830 --> 01:46:43.580
<i>Annie!</i>

01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:05.190
<i>Annie...</i>

01:47:08.190 --> 01:47:11.940
<i>At least know that Dad will be on your side.</i>

01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:34.170
<i>I'll kill the Titans,</i>

01:47:35.260 --> 01:47:37.760
<i>not sparing a single one.</i>

01:48:02.830 --> 01:48:03.660
Eren!

01:48:06.910 --> 01:48:08.080
That's...

01:48:08.790 --> 01:48:09.420
Eren!

01:48:09.420 --> 01:48:10.790
Stop!

01:48:11.210 --> 01:48:14.500
We don't know if Eren can recognize you now.

01:48:30.900 --> 01:48:32.610
Hey... What...

01:49:00.590 --> 01:49:02.010
What, the wall...

01:49:02.010 --> 01:49:03.140
She's climbing it?!

01:49:15.820 --> 01:49:17.150
This is bad!

01:49:17.150 --> 01:49:18.690
She'll get away at this rate!

01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:22.570
Oh no you don't!

01:49:38.090 --> 01:49:39.800
Annie...

01:49:41.090 --> 01:49:42.130
fall.

01:49:50.810 --> 01:49:52.310
<i>Annie.</i>

01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:56.020
<i>I was wrong.</i>

01:49:56.810 --> 01:49:59.480
<i>I won't ask you to forgive me now.</i>

01:50:00.780 --> 01:50:05.530
<i>But... I just have one favor to ask.</i>

01:50:09.330 --> 01:50:12.410
<i>Turn the entire world against you if you have to.</i>

01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:19.250
<i>I...</i>

01:50:19.250 --> 01:50:23.260
<i>will destroy everything in the world!</i>

01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:28.260
<i>Even if everyone in the world comes to hate you...</i>

01:50:28.260 --> 01:50:32.270
<i>At least know that Dad will be on your side.</i>

01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:35.850
Oh, no! He'll eat her real body too!

01:50:35.850 --> 01:50:37.480
Eren, stop!

01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:38.650
Eren!

01:50:38.650 --> 01:50:40.150
<i>I'm...</i>

01:50:40.150 --> 01:50:42.150
<i>free.</i>

01:50:42.860 --> 01:50:45.150
<i>So promise me...</i>

01:50:46.530 --> 01:50:47.950
<i>that you'll come back.</i>

01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:08.470
What happened?

01:51:11.810 --> 01:51:12.930
What the...

01:51:14.770 --> 01:51:16.310
They're fusing?

01:51:25.490 --> 01:51:26.570
Eren!

01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:36.870
Don't eat our valuable witness.

01:51:36.870 --> 01:51:38.420
You idiot!

01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:18.000
Erwin, we have quite a few concerns
about the plan this time around.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:24.250
If you had a target confirmed, why didn't you
seek the Military Police Brigade's assistance?

01:52:24.250 --> 01:52:29.380
District Chief, there was a need to carry out
the plan with only those who could prove

01:52:29.970 --> 01:52:34.060
that they're not one of the Female Titan's allies,
who are known to be lurking about.

01:52:34.060 --> 01:52:35.560
I see.

01:52:35.890 --> 01:52:39.810
So, do you have some sort
of proof that you prevented

01:52:39.810 --> 01:52:43.310
mankind's demise through
this extremely costly plan?

01:52:43.940 --> 01:52:48.820
I don't believe you can get anything
out of Annie Leonhart as she is now.

01:52:49.650 --> 01:52:50.660
Indeed.

01:52:50.660 --> 01:52:52.370
I agree.

01:52:52.370 --> 01:52:54.280
So in other words,

01:52:54.280 --> 01:52:55.870
this was all for nothing?

01:53:00.410 --> 01:53:01.670
Eren.

01:53:07.300 --> 01:53:09.090
Are you feeling okay?

01:53:11.010 --> 01:53:12.510
Yeah...

01:53:13.470 --> 01:53:16.060
Okay enough to feel sick.

01:53:17.930 --> 01:53:21.190
Annie's still sealed away, I hear.

01:53:21.690 --> 01:53:23.350
Yeah.

01:53:23.350 --> 01:53:24.900
Damn it.

01:53:24.900 --> 01:53:28.400
We pull off such a large-scale
operation and gain nothing?

01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:31.490
She went that far to withhold information.

01:53:31.490 --> 01:53:32.450
Annie, I mean.

01:53:33.820 --> 01:53:34.620
Yeah.

01:53:35.950 --> 01:53:37.830
I failed at the end.

01:53:38.740 --> 01:53:42.370
When I saw Annie, I couldn't move anymore.

01:53:43.960 --> 01:53:45.590
Armin Arlert,

01:53:45.590 --> 01:53:47.420
Jean Kirstein,

01:53:47.420 --> 01:53:48.750
I'm here to question you.

01:53:48.750 --> 01:53:49.550
Okay.

01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:51.300
Us first, huh?

01:53:51.300 --> 01:53:53.130
Well, see you later.

01:53:53.130 --> 01:53:54.260
Yeah.

01:54:06.650 --> 01:54:10.230
Back then, I thought it felt great.

01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:15.490
It was as if I felt refreshed
to have my body torn apart.

01:54:17.070 --> 01:54:20.750
Enough for me to think
I might as well die then.

01:54:20.750 --> 01:54:21.580
Eren.

01:54:25.670 --> 01:54:28.170
I'm not thinking that anymore.

01:54:38.300 --> 01:54:42.890
I'm glad you... came back.

01:54:58.820 --> 01:54:59.910
Eat.

01:55:07.210 --> 01:55:08.330
However,

01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:14.340
I believe I've grasped a great potential
with which to save mankind.

01:55:17.300 --> 01:55:22.720
Compared to the time when we couldn't even
fathom humans transforming into Titans,

01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:26.520
we've come a long way by
restraining one of our enemies.

01:55:26.810 --> 01:55:27.810
Yes.

01:55:27.810 --> 01:55:30.110
They're definitely out there.

01:55:30.110 --> 01:55:32.150
Let us bring all of them to their kneesâ€”

01:55:32.780 --> 01:55:36.490
all of the Titans within the walls.

01:55:37.700 --> 01:55:40.490
Now it's our turn to advance upon them!

01:55:44.790 --> 01:55:50.130
<i>The Survey Corps and Eren Jaeger's
summons to the capital were put on hold,</i>

01:55:50.130 --> 01:55:54.760
<i>and custody of Annie Leonhart,
who is being held deep underground,</i>

01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:57.760
<i>was given to the Survey Corps.</i>

01:55:58.800 --> 01:55:59.970
<i>However...</i>

01:56:00.550 --> 01:56:06.430
<i>for mankind to realize what
they're being caged by,</i>

01:56:07.270 --> 01:56:10.900
<i>more time and sacrifices were still needed.</i>

01:57:13.540 --> 01:57:15.130
Hey, look!

01:57:15.380 --> 01:57:17.550
What? Inside the wall...

01:57:17.550 --> 01:57:19.970
Don't tell me...

01:57:20.340 --> 01:57:22.050
It's a Titan!

01:57:23.260 --> 01:57:24.760
Squad Leader, your orders?

01:57:25.220 --> 01:57:27.220
Huh... What?

01:57:27.220 --> 01:57:28.350
hold on just a second...

01:57:35.940 --> 01:57:39.610
Don't let daylight
shine on that Titan!

01:57:46.830 --> 01:57:49.620
Well, it's time you tell us
now, don't you think?

01:57:50.410 --> 01:57:53.330
What is this Titan?

01:57:53.330 --> 01:57:57.420
Why is there a Titan inside
the wall in the first place?

01:57:57.420 --> 01:58:03.380
And why have you people
kept quiet about it?

01:58:07.350 --> 01:58:09.390
I'm a busy man.

01:58:09.390 --> 01:58:12.020
The church and my followers
are in utter chaos,

01:58:12.020 --> 01:58:13.730
because of you guys!

01:58:13.730 --> 01:58:15.520
I'll charge you on the
amount of damage later!

01:58:16.860 --> 01:58:18.440
Don't mess with me!

01:58:21.780 --> 01:58:22.490
Squad Leader...?!

01:58:22.490 --> 01:58:24.410
Stay away.

01:58:24.410 --> 01:58:26.070
Do you know why we,

01:58:26.070 --> 01:58:30.740
the Survey Corps soldiers,
repeatedly shed our blood?

01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:36.130
It's to get back the freedom
that the Titans stole from us!

01:58:37.290 --> 01:58:38.290
Listen.

01:58:38.290 --> 01:58:39.710
I'm not asking for a favor.

01:58:39.710 --> 01:58:42.260
I'm ordering you. Start talking.

01:58:42.840 --> 01:58:45.340
And if you can't,
I'll just go find another.

01:58:45.340 --> 01:58:49.510
In any case, I don't think taking
only your life will be enough.

01:58:49.510 --> 01:58:52.560
Let go... of me...

01:58:53.140 --> 01:58:55.060
Are you sure you want
me to let go right now?

01:58:55.060 --> 01:58:56.560
It's useless...

01:58:56.560 --> 01:59:00.070
Kill me and learn this for yourself...

01:59:00.070 --> 01:59:04.400
We shall carry out our
mission till the very end!

01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:05.570
So...

01:59:05.570 --> 01:59:11.370
let go of me right now!

01:59:24.340 --> 01:59:25.670
Squad Leader...

01:59:27.220 --> 01:59:28.140
Kidding, kidding.

01:59:28.140 --> 01:59:29.180
I'm just kidding.

01:59:32.140 --> 01:59:34.680
Say, Pastor Nick...

01:59:37.650 --> 01:59:43.230
Are all these walls... full of Titans?
