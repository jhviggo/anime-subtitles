00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.800
<i>On that day, mankind remembered...</i>{On that day, mankind received a grim reminder...}

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.850
<i>The fear of oppression under </i>them<i>,{We lived in fear of the Titans}</i>

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.850
<i>and the humiliation of being caged like birds.{and were disgraced to live in these cages we called walls.}</i>

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.460
All hands, prepare for battle!{Squadron, prepare for battle!}

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.460
The target is alone!

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.800
Eliminate it at all costs, and make this 
mankind's first base on the outside!

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.380
Approaching target!

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.600
Split up into five groups, just like in training!

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.310
My group will act as the decoys!

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.480
Assault squads, switch to 
three-dimensional maneuvers!

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.340
We'll attack simultaneously from every direction!

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.850
Have a taste of mankind's strength!

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.790
Huh, Mikasa?

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.120
We should head back.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.540
Why am I here?

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.460
You were sleeping <i>that</i> soundly?

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.550
No, it just feels like I was 
having a <i>really</i> long dream.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.220
What was it again?

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.140
I don't remember a thing.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.650
Eren? Why are you crying?

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:17.050
[ Part 1 ]  ー Crimson Bow and Arrow ー

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:17.050
[ Part 1 ]  ー Crimson Bow and Arrow ー

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.090
Listen up!

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.550
The walls were made with the wisdom of God!

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.890
The walls are the work of God!

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.100
No matter the person, 
none may desecrate the walls!

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.940
Don't tell anyone

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.900
About me crying.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:39.480
I won't.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.070
But for you to start crying for no reason...

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.320
Why not ask Uncle to take a look at you?

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.530
Are you kidding me?

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.620
I can't tell my dad about that!

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.620
What were you crying about, Eren?

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.210
Hannes-san.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.540
Did you get scolded by Mikasa?

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.170
Huh? What makes you think I'd cry?

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.880
You reek of booze!

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.430
Nothin' wrong with that.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.340
You're drinking again?

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.470
Wanna join us?

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.220
Hum... Aren't you on duty?

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.440
Yeah, we're watching the gates today.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.820
We've been here all day. Started getting hungry and thirsty.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.910
But it's not a big deal if we happen to drink something with a little alcohol in it.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.660
But if you're drunk, how are you gonna fight?

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.910
Huh? When would we have to fight?

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.120
Do you really have to ask?

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.370
When they break the wall and come in!

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.130
Ouch.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.840
Eren, don't say things like that out loud.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.510
If it isn't Dr. Jaeger's son. You've got spirit, kid.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.720
If they do end up breaking the wall, we'll do our jobs.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.230
But you know what?

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.900
Not once in the past 100 years have they broken the wall.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.270
Still! My dad said that it's times like these when we're in the most danger!

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:07.820
While helping in the maintenance of the wall, I see them out there, wandering aimlessly

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.910
But, speaking as a soldier, I don't think they can do anything about this 50 meter wall.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.960
S-So... you don't even have the will to fight them?

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:19.590
Nope.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.760
What?! Why don't you stop calling yourselves the Town Guards and call yourselves the Wall Menders!

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.760
Has a nice ring to it.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:29.890
But Eren,

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.020
When people see soldiers fighting, they know something bad happened.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:41.070
Everyone's much happier when we're doing nothing and getting called useless freeloaders.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.450
Yeah, I know. We might not get out, but we'll live as long as we can eat and sleep.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:51.330
But...

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.500
We're living like... like livestock.

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.210
This kid sure knows how to talk!

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.340
Not like you can do anything, right Hannes?

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:05.510
Uh, right.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.220
Hey, Eren!

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.260
You're crazy, kid!

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.520
Does he... want to join the Survey Corps?

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:23.400
Eren,

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.820
I don't think you should join the Survey Corps.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.570
What?

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.860
You think they're stupid too?

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.780
I'm not saying they're stupid or anything.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:40.790
The Survey Corps are back!

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.710
The front gate is opening!

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.880
Let's go, Mikasa!

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:45.300
The heroes have returned!

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.810
Damn, I can't see.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.910
Why are there so few of them?

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:21.620
A bunch of them were eaten.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.090
This is what you get for going outside the walls.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.710
Moses! Moses!

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.300
My son, Moses... I can't find him.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.300
Where is my son?

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.010
It's her, Moses's mother.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:38.720
Bring it here.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.670
That was the only part of him we could salvage.

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:26.440
But... my son... was useful, right?

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.190
He might... not have been a hero,

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:36.950
but he at least died helping mankind fight back, right?!

00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:44.040
Of course!

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.630
No... During this mission, we...

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:53.220
No,

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:55.970
Even after all of our missions,

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.480
we still haven't made any progress!

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:05.560
I'm a failure.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.440
I've just gotten soldiers killed left and right!

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:15.400
And we haven't learned anything useful about the Titans!

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:21.290
Well, that was heavy.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:27.000
Seriously. So all we've been doing is offering ourselves to them as free lunch?

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:31.800
What was that for, kid?

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.510
Hey! What are you doing, Mikasa!

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.930
Hey, get back here!

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:42.260
Mikasa! Fine, I get it!

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:47.690
What was that for?

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.360
Look at all the wood!

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:50.480
Eren

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:54.320
Have you changed your mind about joining the Survey Corps?

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.580
Help me pick this up.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:06.660
There's not much.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.040
We're back.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:14.170
Welcome home.

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:21.010
Wow, Eren. I'm surprised you gathered this much firewood today.

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:22.600
Y-Yeah...

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.390
What was that for?

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.860
Your ear was red. You were lying.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.320
Mikasa helped you, didn't she?

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.320
Huh? Dad, are you headed out?

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:38.610
For work?

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.120
Yeah, I have to go see someone in the inner walls.

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:42.950
I'll be back in two or three days.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.580
Eren wants to join the Survey Corps.

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:56.300
Mikasa, you traitor!

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.170
Eren, what are you thinking?!

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.140
Do you know how many people die outside those walls?

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:04.970
I do!

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:05.810
You clearly don't!

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:06.600
Eren,

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:10.980
Why do you want to go outside?

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:16.530
I want to see and understand the world outside.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.650
I don't want to die inside these walls without knowing what's out there!

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:22.320
On top of that,

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:25.530
If no one takes on their jobs,

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:29.330
Then those who lost their lives will have died in vain!

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:34.340
I see.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.010
My ship's here, I must get going.

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:42.340
Wait, dear! Help me convince Eren!

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:48.680
Carla, nothing can suppress a human's curiosity.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:50.270
Eren.

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:56.520
After I've returned, I'll show you the basement that I've been keeping you away from.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:58.610
For real?

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:04.490
Have a safe trip!

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:07.950
I won't allow it.

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.660
You won't be joining something stupid like the Survey Corps.

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:13.210
Stupid?

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:18.300
People who are content living like livestock are more stupid!

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:19.420
Eren!

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.010
What's wrong, heretic?

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.810
Why don't you punch me if you want to prove me wrong?

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.720
Why would I do that?

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.140
I won't stoop so low.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.270
What did you say?!

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:40.440
You're beating me up because you know I'm right and you can't prove me wrong.

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.240
Doesn't that mean you've admitted that you're wrong?

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:47.160
Enough with your crappy arguments!

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:48.200
Stop!

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:51.080
It's Eren.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.710
What a moron. He's back again.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:55.120
Does he want to get his ass handed?

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:56.330
We'll teach you a lesson!

00:12:58.540 --> 00:12:59.550
Mi-Mikasa's with him!

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:02.510
Shit! Run!

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.020
Hey, they ran away after seeing me!

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:14.640
No, they ran away after seeing Mikasa.

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:17.190
Hey, you okay, Armin?

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:23.110
I can stand up by myself.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:24.990
Oh, sorry.

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:34.290
So, after telling them that mankind needs to go outside eventually,

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:35.620
They beat me, calling me a heretic.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:36.710
Dammit.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.210
We just want go outside. Why does everyone hate us?

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:47.590
Well, it's been peaceful living inside these walls for the past 100 years.

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:52.930
Titans might be let inside when people leave the walls,

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:58.900
so the King's government banned people from showing interest to the outside world.

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:02.730
We're risking our own lives. No one has the right to stop us.

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:04.110
You can't do that.

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:07.150
No way.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.660
Mikasa! How dare you tell my parents!

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:13.410
I don't remember agreeing to help you.

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:14.910
So how did it go?

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.290
Well, they weren't happy about it.

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:21.040
I figured.

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:32.180
People are crazy for believing that these walls will protect us forever.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:33.350
Mama!

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.270
Even though the walls have been intact for the past 100 years,

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:45.570
There's nothing that can guarantee they won't be broken down today...

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:06.260
What was that?

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:07.550
Was it an explosion?

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:09.680
Over there!

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:10.630
Something fell?

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:11.760
I'm not sure.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:15.220
Hey, Armin!

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:19.980
What happened?

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:22.520
What are you looking at?

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:35.450
You're kidding... That wall is...

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:37.790
50 meters tall!

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:40.500
It's them...

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:48.010
Titans!

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:39.060
One's coming!

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:41.680
The Titans are inside!

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.980
We need to get…

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:47.940
Eren!

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.650
My house is over there...

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.240
Mom is...

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:53.450
Mikasa!

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:01.200
It's over...

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:08.380
The Titans have invaded this town!

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:15.930
Our house is definitely safe!

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:19.510
Once I turn this corner, our 
house will be there like always!

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.310
Mom!

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:28.900
Mom!

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:31.900
Eren

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.610
Mikasa,

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:33.490
Grab that side.

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.110
We need to move this piece of wood!

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.220
Hurry, Mikasa!

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:56.220
I know!

00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:59.760
The Titans are getting close.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.680
Eren, take Mikasa and run. Hurry!

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.810
I want to run too!

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:07.890
Hurry up and get out!

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.690
My legs have been crushed by the debris.

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:15.070
I can't run even if I get out.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.200
Do you understand?

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.160
I'll carry you and run!

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:21.700
Why can't you just listen to what I say for once?!

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.490
Please just listen to me! Just one last time!

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:26.290
Mikasa!

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:29.960
No... No!

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:32.710
At this rate, all three of us will...

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:35.920
Hannes!

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:40.260
Take the kids and run!

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:43.970
Don't take me lightly, Carla.

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:46.270
I'll kill the Titan

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.270
And save all three of you.

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:51.360
Wait! You can't fight it!

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:13.210
Hey, Hannes-san! What the hell are you doing?

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:15.300
Thank you.

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:18.720
Mom is still trapped in there!

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:21.340
Eren! Mikasa!

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:24.390
Live on!

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.780
Don't go...

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:53.080
Stop!!!

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:30.000
<i>On that day, mankind remembered...</i>

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:37.750
<i>The fear of oppression under </i>them<i>,</i>

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:44.680
<i>and the humiliation of being caged like birds.</i>

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:06.700
The small, closed-off areas surrounding the walls, such as Shiganshina, were used as baits to attract the Titans,

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:10.950
fulfilling their roles of lowering costs of defense and military.

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.330
As a result of this design,

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:21.000
The people of Shiganshina could escape the assault of the Titans by traversing only one gate.

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:25.720
Toss all luggage!

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:27.800
We might even fit one more if you do that!

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:35.020
Armin, sit down.

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:37.690
But Eren and Mikasa aren't here yet.…

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.150
They're there.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:43.820
Eren...

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:02.550
Don't just stand there! Hurry up!

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:04.130
What are you waiting for?!

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:10.010
Hurry up! They're coming!

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.720
This ship is full! We're leaving!

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:16.310
Please, let us on! Even just my child!

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.940
I'm sorry, but we can't do that!

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.270
Go!

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:33.490
Don't close it yet! Just wait a little longer!

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:36.080
We've still got people out there!

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:41.630
If they break through this gate, we'll lose much more than just this small district!

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:45.800
Mankind will be pushed back to the next wall!

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:49.760
That doesn't mean it's okay to just sacrifice all those people!

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:53.200
Hurry up and close it! The Titans are coming!

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:54.930
Hurry up and close the gate!

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:55.600
Stop!

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.110
Fire!

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.460
Shit! Run! Hurry!

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:20.750
The Titans are coming!

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.130
Close the gate!

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:25.000
Hurry! Close the gate!

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:01.080
This is the end...

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:04.000
It's over...

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.460
The Titans will eat us all...

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:10.630
It's over?

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:17.470
I'll never be able to go home again.

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:21.690
Mom is gone...

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:25.560
She's gone!

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:29.690
Why?

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:35.240
I... Us humans are weak.

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:38.450
Because we're weak, we can do nothing but cry?

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:48.670
I'll erase their existence from this world...

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:50.260
Eren?

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.010
What's the matter, Eren?

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:54.260
Eren?

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:57.550
I'm going to kill them all.

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:03.060
Not even a single one of them will be left...!

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:05.900
Eren...

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:21.490
"The Holocaust" was the price of overconfidence and peace of 100 years.

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:31.760
At that moment, mankind was unaware of the existence of monsters such as the Colossus Titan.

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:32.090
Years later

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:32.090
Years later

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:40.390
Wall Maria was lost and Wall Rose became humanity's last shield.

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:48.060
Always fearing that someday the Colossus Titan would appear again and bring it down.

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:53.230
You have graduated from the Military Academy.

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:59.450
Soon you will become the wind of hope that will carry the dreams and hopes of mankind.

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:01.700
Hands upon your hearts!

00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:03.040
Yes, Sir!

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:07.620
For you trainees graduating today, three paths now open before you.

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:11.840
You can be stationed at the walls and defend the cities as members of the Garrison!

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:16.720
You can put your lives on the line to fight the Titans in their own territory as members of the Survey Corps!

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:21.600
Or you can serve the King by controlling the crowds and protecting order as members of the Military Police Brigade!

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:28.270
Of course, only ten people with the top scores we announced earlier are allowed into the Military Police!

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:36.650
<i></i>Finally, I made it this far.

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:42.660
<i>Now, it'll be our turn to devour the Titans!</i>

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:50.290
I did it! I'm in the Military Police now!

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:52.380
We'll never worry about having food again!

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:56.380
Jean, do you know which division you will join?

00:26:57.050 --> 00:26:59.050
Isn't it obvious? The Military Police.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:02.300
That's why I strived to be among the top ten.

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.600
Yes, I too want to join the Military Police

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:08.560
There's no higher honor than working near the King.

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:10.690
C'mon, Marco!

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.690
Stop being such a goody-goody and just tell the truth.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:20.660
You want to join the Military Police so you can live a simple, comfortable life within the Inner District.

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:22.950
You guys think the same, right?

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:24.530
Huh…

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:27.750
We would prefer not having to go beyond the wall…

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:29.660
You can say that again!

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.710
Nobody wants to die.

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:36.630
That's right. I will also enlist in the Military Police.

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:37.630
Me too.

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:39.260
But...

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:42.340
Don't lump me together with you.

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:47.100
So life on the interior is simple and comfortable?

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.850
Five years ago, this place was also part of the interior.

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:54.610
What's your point?

00:27:56.650 --> 00:28:02.490
Jean, you're such a simpleton, you'd be comfortable living a life in blindness and ignorance.

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:11.250
Eren...

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:18.630
Do you even know how many people have been devoured?

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:24.260
Four years ago, when we had to leave the territory do to the forces of the Titans,

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:29.220
Humanity became enraged and decided to launch a final offensive in desperation,

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:34.400
but were annihilated as mere fools.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.150
This was the answer they found:

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:41.990
Humanity can not cope with the Titans.

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:50.200
And because of that…

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.170
You're gonna give up without even trying?

00:28:56.210 --> 00:29:00.510
We are mankind's last hope! 
That's why we trained all these years.

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:06.050
We have made many sacrifices to obtain all this information on the Titans.

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:08.720
And now you say that we should just let ourselves be defeated?

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:10.100
Don't fuck with me!

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:16.650
I... will enter the Survey Corps and end the Titans!

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:18.150
Eren...

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:26.610
You're a deluded fool.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:27.820
What did you say?

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:30.490
Who enlists the Survey Corps by choice?

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:33.040
If you're so eager to die beyond the wall, go ahead.

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:36.250
Eren!

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:37.830
Hey, there's a fight!

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:39.420
Stop it!

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:40.550
The instructor is coming!

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:47.720
What are you doing?!

00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:49.220
Put me down!

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.100
Mikasa!

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:55.390
I told you to put me down! Hey!

00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:00.940
Stay out of other people's business!

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.700
When you get angry, you become too foolish.

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:15.080
What are you going to do?

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.710
I'm going to join the Survey Corps!

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:22.340
Are you sure, Armin?

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.720
You're our top theoretician! Put that to better use!

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:28.260
I don't care if I die as long as I can be useful.

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:31.510
I'm going to the Survey Corps too.

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:35.520
You got the top score, didn't you? Go to the military police!

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:40.190
I'll go to the military police if you do.

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:44.940
If you go to the Garrisons, so will I.

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.530
You'll die an early death if I'm not there for you.

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:52.830
I never asked for that.

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:56.580
I don't want to lose what's left of my family.

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:28.360
What? You enlisted in the Survey Corps?

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:31.610
Connie, you were going on and on about joining the Military Police!

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.950
Yeah, I know, but…

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:37.160
Seems like he was listening to your lecture yesterday.

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:39.580
Shut up!

00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:42.080
This is my own decision!

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:44.340
Don't be so shy about it.

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:46.630
You're not the only one.

00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:50.840
Thomas... Are you serious...

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:53.090
Um, guys...

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:57.520
I borrowed some meat from the officers' morning rations.

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:01.640
Sasha... You wanna get solitary confinement?

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:03.230
You're a real idiot!

00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:04.810
Real idiocy's scary...

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:07.480
Let's all split it up together later.

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:09.690
We'll slice it up and eat it with bread!

00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:12.200
Bring it back!

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:16.620
Yeah! Meat is a luxury now that we've lost so much land!

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:18.240
Don't worry about it.

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:26.250
Once we retake the land, we can keep pigs and cows again.

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.050
I'll take that meat!

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.720
Me too, so save my part!

00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:38.720
That goes for me too.

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:40.270
Guys...

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:42.690
What do you say, Eren?

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:45.690
They'll find us out if we don't get back to work.

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:47.730
It's still a while before lunch.

00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:56.320
Five years have passed since then.

00:32:57.910 --> 00:33:01.200
Mankind's finally regaining its dignity.

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:03.870
We can win.

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:10.880
Mankind's counterattack begins now!

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:34.200
The hell?!

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:42.870
Samuel!

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:44.870
Sasha!

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.930
Samuel! Don't move!

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:58.390
That was close.

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:04.350
The gate's... broken...

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:09.900
Again... The Titans will get in again!

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.990
Every... fucking... one...

00:34:17.910 --> 00:34:20.950
4th Fixed Cannon Maintenance 
Squad, prepare for battle!

00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:24.290
The target's right in front of us! It's the Colossal Titan!

00:34:24.910 --> 00:34:27.420
This is our chance! Don't let it slip away!

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:41.680
Hello there. It's been 5 years.

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:05.120
<i></i>It aimed for the cannons!

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:09.120
<i>So it wasn't just a coincidence that he targeted the gate!</i>

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:12.590
<i></i>He's actually...

00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:14.750
<i>Intelligent!</i>

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:21.340
<i></i>Still, this is our chance.

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:24.760
<i></i>This is the only one that can destroy the gates.

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.810
<i></i>If I can just stop him!

00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:36.400
There!

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:39.490
You're mine!

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:44.240
It burns!

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:55.880
Go!

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:00.550
<i>Did I miss?</i>

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:10.640
No... The Colossal Titan vanished...

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:15.440
Eren! Did you get it?

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:19.280
No! It's the same as five years ago!

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:22.910
He disappeared, just as suddenly as he appeared!

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.540
Bring only your most critical possessions!

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:37.630
Please remain calm and evacuate!

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:46.100
If they break through, the hell of five years ago will be repeated!

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:51.060
We must stop the Titans here!

00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:59.940
You recruits have completed training and graduated into proper soldiers!

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:02.900
I expect you to actively participate in this operation too!

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:08.240
Don't worry, Hannah. I swear I'll protect you.

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:09.370
Franz...

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:15.080
Are you okay, Armin?!

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.670
I'm fine!

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:20.170
I'll pull it together.

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:21.960
But we're still in trouble!

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:26.800
We've got an eight-meter hole in the wall, and no way to fix it quickly!

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:32.350
We couldn't even dig out that giant rock nearby!

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:37.980
Then it's only a matter of time until they break through Wall Rose!

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:38.900
Armin!

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:42.320
Calm down! This time it's different.

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:45.820
Mankind won't lose to the Titans!

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:50.870
S-Sorry. I'm fine...

00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:05.220
Why does it have to be today?

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:08.340
I'm supposed to go to the interior tomorrow!

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:11.970
Are you okay?

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:17.520
No! No! No!

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:23.320
Out of my way.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.200
Hey, Jean! What's with you?

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:31.080
Don't give me that crap, you suicidal asshole!

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:31.950
Calm down!

00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:33.910
Just chill out and accept my death?!

00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:34.830
No!

00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:39.460
Remember our three years of training!

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:44.050
We've been on the verge of death many times during those three years.

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:46.130
Some actually died.

00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:49.300
Some ran away, and some were sent away.

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:51.930
But we survived!

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:53.140
Didn't we?!

00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:56.020
We're gonna survive today too!

00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:01.900
You'll survive today, and you're bloody well going to interior tomorrow!

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:08.320
Dammit!

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:11.620
Let's go, Daz!

00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:13.620
Quit crying already!

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:21.170
Eren! If the battle gets too chaotic, come find me.

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:24.090
Huh? We're in totally different squads!

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:27.420
In the midst of the fray, nothing goes according to plan.

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:29.550
I'll protect you.

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:30.970
What are you going on about…

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:31.930
Trainee Ackerman!

00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:35.100
You were specially assigned to rear guard.

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:36.020
Come with me.

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:39.060
I'd only be in the way there, sir!

00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:41.600
The evacuation is going slow.

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:44.650
We need as many elite guards as possible protecting the civilians.

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:46.280
But I...

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:49.490
Get real, Mikasa!

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.860
It's so unlike you to panic!

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:54.370
Mankind is on the brink of extinction!

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:57.450
How can you be prioritizing what you want?!

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:05.250
I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking clearly.

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:10.670
Just one thing. Please.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.850
Please... Don't die.

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:25.310
<i>I won't die.</i>

00:40:26.690 --> 00:40:28.530
<i>I couldn't die even if I were killed here.</i>

00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:35.320
<i>I don't know anything about this world yet.</i>

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:42.750
Hey, Armin!

00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:44.920
Don't you think this is a great chance?

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:47.880
If we prove ourselves here in this first battle,

00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:50.300
before even entering the Survey Corps,

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:54.430
surely they'll promote us right up the ladder!

00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:03.600
Yeah, Without a doubt!

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:05.270
Not to burst your bubble,

00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:08.480
But quite a few of us are aiming for the Survey Corps this year!

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:10.940
I lagged behind you earlier, Eren,

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:12.190
but I'm not losing this time!

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:13.820
That's the spirit, Thomas!

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:16.820
Let's have a contest to see who can slay more Titans!

00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:19.120
Don't rig the numbers.!

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:20.700
Squad 34, advance!

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:22.370
Assist the frontline guard!

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.250
Right! Let's go!

00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:25.830
Yeah!

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:50.020
The Titans advanced this far?!

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:52.690
The front guard's already been crushed?!

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:56.200
What are our glory-hound seniors doing?!

00:41:57.490 --> 00:41:59.530
<i>I expected the situation to be bad,</i>

00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:01.490
<i>but this...</i>

00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:03.700
An abnormal one!

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:04.540
Watch out!

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:45.660
How dare you?!

00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:47.330
Eren!

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:48.920
Stop! Don't go alone!

00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:53.840
Stop, you bastard!

00:42:55.590 --> 00:42:56.970
How dare you eat Thomas?!

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:00.640
You're not getting away!

00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.770
Eren!

00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:14.270
Eren!

00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:33.630
Stop! Please stop!

00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:42.850
<i>Why... am I...</i>

00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:47.470
<i>Watching... as my comrades... get eaten?</i>

00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:59.860
<i>Why... won't my body... move?</i>

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:08.120
Eren! Eren! Eren!

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:11.790
What is it now, Armin?

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:14.500
Look at this book my grandpa was hiding!

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:17.250
It's all about the outside world!

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:19.170
The outside world?

00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:21.630
But that's forbidden, isn't it?

00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:23.300
What if the Military Police find out?

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:25.800
Who cares about that now?

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:27.220
According to this book,

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:31.270
Most of the world is covered by a huge amount of water called "sea"!

00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:34.060
And it's all salty water too!

00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:37.070
Salt? No way...

00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:40.280
There's more than just mountains of salt!

00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:44.740
Fire water! A continent of ice! Snowfields of sand!

00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:49.240
The world out there must be far more vast than the inside of the walls!

00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:51.580
The outside world...

00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:53.250
Tell me, Eren...

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:58.800
It'd be great if we could explore the outside world too someday.

00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:19.480
Eren!

00:45:21.490 --> 00:45:24.360
You think I'm gonna die here?!

00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:34.330
Hey, Armin... You told me about it...

00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:40.920
So I'm going... to the outside world...

00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:45.800
Eren! Hurry!

00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:20.590
Hey!

00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:23.130
Hey, what's wrong, Armin?

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:26.130
Get ahold of yourself! Hey! Armin!

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:28.800
Hey! Armin! Hey!

00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:33.850
Are you with me now? Are you okay? Hurt anywhere?

00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:35.680
Where's your squad?

00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.890
My... squad?

00:46:38.020 --> 00:46:41.060
Man, get it together already! Why are you alone?

00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:43.980
And why are you so... slimy?

00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:45.860
What the hell happened here?

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:53.540
I'm useless! Just leave me to die!

00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:54.790
Calm down, Armin.

00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:56.200
Where are they?

00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:59.290
Just drop it already, Connie.

00:47:00.130 --> 00:47:02.750
They're all dead... Everyone but him.

00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:05.670
No way! Armin didn't say that!

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:07.590
Open your eyes and look the fuck around you.

00:47:08.050 --> 00:47:10.390
We don't have time to babysit him.

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:13.170
Why is he unhurt then?

00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:16.480
Who knows? Maybe the Titans mistook him for dead.

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:19.940
It was just bad luck their squad 
encountered multiple Titans at once.

00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:24.480
But to think this guy was the sole survivor? 
Eren and the others didn't deserve this ending.

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:29.280
Hey, you heartless bitch, you want me to shut your mouth for good?!

00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:33.330
Stop it, you two! Of course everyone's on edge!

00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:36.160
Our friends are dying all around us.

00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:37.660
It's only natural!

00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:42.630
That's my Krista! After this mission ends, marry me, baby!

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.590
That's true... She's screwing around even more than usual.

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:50.720
Anyways, we can't stay here.

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:51.970
Can you stand, Armin?

00:47:56.970 --> 00:47:58.680
Sorry for causing you trouble.

00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:02.150
I'll go join the rear guard.

00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:04.560
Hey... Armin!

00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:09.650
We gotta go, Connie!

00:48:10.070 --> 00:48:11.400
We've been ordered to move ahead!

00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:17.990
<i>This is hell...</i>

00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:22.330
<i>No, this world hasn't become hell.</i>

00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:25.880
<i>I just didn't get it up until right now.</i>

00:48:27.130 --> 00:48:30.300
<i>This world's been hell all along.</i>

00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:35.260
<i>The strong feed upon the weak.</i>

00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:38.810
<i>It's such an obligingly simple rule.</i>

00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:49.820
<i>Except in this world, my friends tried to be strong.</i>

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:58.080
<i>They helped me, though I was weak.</i>

00:48:59.910 --> 00:49:03.580
<i>To the two of them, I was always someone to be protected.</i>

00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:06.250
<i>I wanted to become strong like them,</i>

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:11.970
<i>So we could walk together side-by-side as we lived out our lives in this world.</i>

00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:23.270
<i>Just look where that got me!</i>

00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:26.100
<i>It's my fault that Eren...</i>

00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:41.410
Hannah, what are you doing?

00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:43.500
Help me, Armin!

00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:45.420
Franz isn't breathing!

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:51.460
I've been performing CPR over and over...

00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:53.870
Franz!

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:58.010
Hannah, it's dangerous here! We should hurry...

00:49:58.010 --> 00:49:59.760
And just leave Franz behind?!

00:50:01.390 --> 00:50:02.930
That's not it, Hannah...

00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:05.440
Franz won't...

00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:19.120
Please stop... No more...

00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:26.000
I can't... take this anymore...

00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:35.170
Do you even understand the situation we're in?!

00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:36.420
Withdraw!

00:50:39.090 --> 00:50:40.800
Hey, Jean! What do we do now?

00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:44.020
We finally received the order to retreat,

00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:46.600
But we can't get over the wall because we're out of gas.

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:49.560
We're all going to die.

00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:51.940
Thanks to those fucking cowards...

00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:54.150
You mean the support squads?

00:50:55.110 --> 00:50:56.320
What happened to them?

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:57.610
Are they all dead?

00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:00.320
They probably lost their will to fight.

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:02.580
I understand how they feel.

00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:07.210
But I doubt they've abandoned their mission and barricaded themselves away in the HQ.

00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:10.500
I'm guessing the Titans have them surrounded,

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:12.380
Which is why they can't supply us with gas.

00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:16.210
I had such a boring life.

00:51:17.090 --> 00:51:19.050
If someone told me beforehand...

00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:22.800
What now, Reiner?

00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:24.100
It's not time yet.

00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:25.680
We must group up first.

00:51:26.850 --> 00:51:27.520
It's over...

00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:33.360
No matter what we do, we'll be 
dead before we make it out of here.

00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:37.030
I mean, I'm prepared to die...

00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:41.110
But what exactly am I going to die for?

00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:45.040
Mikasa! Weren't you with the rear guard?

00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:49.410
Annie! I think I understand the situation.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.630
And I apologize for bothering you,

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:54.630
but have you seen Eren's unit?

00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:58.260
No, and I haven't seen anyone climb the wall either.

00:51:58.670 --> 00:52:00.590
Armin's over there, though.

00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:03.720
Armin!

00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:06.100
<i>Mikasa?!</i>

00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:10.600
<i>Crap! How can I look her in the eye?</i>

00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:14.900
Armin, are you hurt?

00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:22.860
Where's Eren?

00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:26.530
Armin?

00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:39.340
Our unit...

00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:44.010
The 34th cadet unit...

00:52:45.050 --> 00:52:45.970
Thomas Wagner.

00:52:46.810 --> 00:52:47.600
Nic Tius.

00:52:48.850 --> 00:52:50.100
Mylius Zeramuski.

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:52.640
Mina Carolina.

00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:55.150
Eren Jaeger.

00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:59.860
All five of them have fulfilled their duty

00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:03.070
and died heroic deaths in battle!

00:53:06.570 --> 00:53:07.280
No way...

00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:12.120
So the 34th unit was nearly wiped out...

00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:15.790
If we fight the Titans, we'll end up like them.

00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:18.880
I'm sorry, Mikasa.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.630
Eren died in my stead...

00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:26.340
I couldn't do anything!

00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:29.060
I'm so sorry!

00:53:33.730 --> 00:53:34.310
Armin.

00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:39.150
Take a deep breath.

00:53:40.110 --> 00:53:42.440
This isn't the time to be emotional.

00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:45.700
Stand up.

00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:51.200
Marco, If we take out the Titans around the HQ,

00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:55.040
we can replenish our gas supplies and climb the wall.

00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:56.460
Does that sound correct?

00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:01.840
Yeah... But even if you're with us, there's just too many...

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:02.840
We can do it.

00:54:04.970 --> 00:54:06.840
I'm strong.

00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:11.560
Stronger than all of you. Extremely strong.

00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:15.770
I can kill all those Titans there.

00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:17.730
Even if I'm alone.

00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:22.650
You're either incompetent or you're spineless cowards.

00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:24.940
How pathetic.

00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:27.740
You can sit here and suck on your fingers.

00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:29.200
Yeah, do that.

00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:30.240
Hey, Mikasa!

00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:31.790
What are you saying?

00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:35.000
You want to fight all those Titans by yourself?

00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:36.790
There's no way you can do that!

00:54:36.790 --> 00:54:38.540
If I can't, then I'll just die.

00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:41.460
But if I win, I live.

00:54:42.050 --> 00:54:43.510
Unless I fight, I cannot win.

00:54:45.590 --> 00:54:46.220
Hey!

00:54:51.050 --> 00:54:53.680
The real shame is your way with words.

00:54:54.310 --> 00:54:56.430
Was the point of that to shock us into action?

00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:59.690
It's all your fault, Eren!

00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:04.820
Hey! Were we trained to let our comrades fight alone?!

00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:07.700
At this rate, we're going to turn out to be spineless cowards!

00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:10.410
I'm surprised I'd hear him say that.

00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:21.170
Hey! Cowards! Weaklings! Retards!

00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:24.630
<i>They're nuts... </i>Dammit!

00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:26.510
Let's do it!

00:55:35.810 --> 00:55:37.930
Hurry! Follow Mikasa!

00:55:38.770 --> 00:55:39.980
Let's keep this fight short!

00:55:40.310 --> 00:55:42.440
We need to kill them all before we run out of gas!

00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:45.820
Mikasa's just amazing.

00:55:46.650 --> 00:55:48.440
How can she move that fast?

00:55:49.150 --> 00:55:51.240
<i>She's using too much gas.</i>

00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:53.450
<i>She'll run out right away.</i>

00:55:54.370 --> 00:55:55.660
<i>I don't care how skilled she is...</i>

00:55:55.830 --> 00:55:57.950
<i>Without our agility, we can't do anything!</i>

00:56:00.210 --> 00:56:01.920
<i>If she keeps this up...</i>

00:56:07.550 --> 00:56:08.300
Mikasa!

00:56:09.260 --> 00:56:09.800
Dammit!

00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:12.760
Jean! You lead the others!

00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:14.300
I'll go with Armin!

00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:15.510
I'm coming with you!

00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:17.770
What are you talking about?! There are more Titans left!

00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:20.020
We need your skills!

00:56:34.030 --> 00:56:34.620
<i>Again...</i>

00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:39.500
<i>It happened again.</i>

00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:45.710
<i>I lost my family once again...</i>

00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:55.140
<i>This pain is familiar.</i>

00:56:56.430 --> 00:56:59.640
<i>Will I have to start fresh once again?</i>

00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:11.820
<i>This world is cruel...</i>

00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:26.920
<i>But it's also... Very beautiful.</i>

00:57:31.130 --> 00:57:32.670
You can have this.

00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:39.310
Come on, let's go... Back to our home.

00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:45.350
<i>I lived a good life.</i>

00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:09.170
<i>Why?</i>

00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:14.010
<i>I thought I'd given up.</i>

00:58:18.970 --> 00:58:21.510
<i>Why am I standing?</i>

00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:24.770
<i>Why am I struggling?</i>

00:58:30.690 --> 00:58:31.480
<i>Why?</i>

00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:37.490
<i>My life has no meaning anymore.</i>

00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:39.990
<i>What's keeping me going?</i>

00:58:43.410 --> 00:58:47.080
Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:49.290
Eren...

00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:57.550
Fight! You must fight! Fight! Fight!

00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:01.680
<i>I'm sorry, Eren.</i>

00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:04.640
<i>I won't give up.</i>

00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:06.850
<i>I'll never give up again.</i>

00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:10.650
<i>If I died,</i>

00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:14.280
<i>I wouldn't be able to remember you.</i>

00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:18.780
<i>So I'll win, no matter what!</i>

00:59:19.450 --> 00:59:20.780
<i>I'll survive, no matter what!</i>

00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:39.260
What's going on?

00:59:59.110 --> 01:00:04.080
A Titan... is killing... another Titan...

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:16.340
<i>Please be all right, Mikasa!</i>

01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:21.630
Mikasa!

01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:34.520
Mikasa, are you hurt?

01:00:35.570 --> 01:00:36.480
Are you guys okay?!

01:00:36.730 --> 01:00:37.280
Yeah!

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:38.990
We must get going!

01:00:42.610 --> 01:00:44.570
Shit! There are two 15 meter classes!

01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:47.240
No... That Titan's...

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:36.170
It finished the other Titan off? 
It knew of a Titan's weak point?

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:39.840
We must get going before it comes this way!

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.010
No. It doesn't care about us.

01:01:43.050 --> 01:01:44.970
It could've attacked us long ago.

01:01:46.050 --> 01:01:48.430
It seemed like it had an idea of how to perform hand-to-hand combat.

01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:50.220
What was that?

01:01:50.970 --> 01:01:52.560
Just consider it an abnormal!

01:01:52.890 --> 01:01:54.310
Anyway, we must hurry to the HQ!

01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:58.360
Wait! I have an idea!

01:01:58.980 --> 01:01:59.730
An idea?

01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:03.950
Couldn't we take advantage of this Titan?

01:02:12.790 --> 01:02:14.080
Open way!

01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:29.800
Dammit!

01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:50.780
<i>How many of us made it?</i>

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:57.500
<i>How many died on my command?</i>

01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:11.550
You're part of the supply squad, aren't you?

01:03:16.850 --> 01:03:17.730
Stop it, Jean!

01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:20.940
These bastards abandoned us!

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:24.030
Do you even have a clue how many died?!

01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:28.530
The Titans invaded the supply depot! What could we have done?!

01:03:28.530 --> 01:03:31.660
It's your job to figure something out!

01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:34.540
Take cover!

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:44.170
Dammit! There are too many people gathered here!

01:03:45.590 --> 01:03:46.920
Hurry! Inside!

01:03:47.030 --> 01:03:48.970
Run for your lives!

01:03:49.010 --> 01:03:50.430
Where's Mikasa?!

01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:52.640
She crashed back there! She's been eaten!

01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:58.020
<i>This is normal... This is reality, isn't it?</i>

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:02.980
<i>Was I just chasing a delusional dream?</i>

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:07.030
<i>Just thinking about it, it's obvious...</i>

01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:12.620
<i>There's no way to beat these gigantic monstrosities.</i>

01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:23.290
What?!

01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:37.930
What... is that?

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:42.100
Mikasa?!

01:04:42.650 --> 01:04:45.020
It's empty... We did it!

01:04:45.770 --> 01:04:48.070
We just barely made it!

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.860
You're... all alive?

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:53.570
We did it, Armin!

01:04:53.570 --> 01:04:53.860
Ouch!

01:04:54.070 --> 01:04:56.160
Your plan was a success!

01:04:56.870 --> 01:05:00.370
Everyone! That Titan's an abnormality that slaughters other Titans!

01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:03.460
It's not even interested in attacking humans!

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:06.040
If we play our cards right,

01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:08.170
We can all get outta here alive!

01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:11.010
We'd... use the Titan?

01:05:11.590 --> 01:05:15.760
You'd rely on a Titan's help? 
That's more delusional than any dream!

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:16.510
It's not a dream.

01:05:17.810 --> 01:05:19.520
I don't care if it's an abnormal or whatever.

01:05:20.350 --> 01:05:23.270
Just let it rampage here for as long as possible.

01:05:28.650 --> 01:05:34.410
Realistically, that's our best option for survival.

01:05:42.290 --> 01:05:42.870
We found some!

01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:46.290
They're Military Police supplies,

01:05:47.250 --> 01:05:48.670
Though they are covered in dust...

01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:53.340
Will three bullets be enough?

01:05:54.550 --> 01:06:00.180
Do these guns even work against the Titans in the first place?

01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:04.850
It's better than nothing.

01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:09.520
Even if there are still seven 3-4 meter class Titans in the supply room,

01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:14.320
Blinding them all at once isn't impossible with this much firepower.

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:19.490
First we'll use the lift to lower a large number of people into the center of the chamber.

01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:24.250
Next, they'll fire directly into the faces of all seven Titans at once.

01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:25.410
We'll blind them.

01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:29.960
The next instance will decide everything.

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:36.430
Seven other people hiding near the ceiling will swoop down to attack their weak spots while they're blind.

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:45.940
In other words... if we follow this plan, we'll be gambling everything on this single attack.

01:06:47.650 --> 01:06:51.690
The whole point is for seven people to kill all seven Titans simultaneously.

01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:58.610
The seven people should be the most physically capable ones.

01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:01.740
You'll have to shoulder the burden of everyone's lives...

01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:04.700
I'm sorry.

01:07:05.370 --> 01:07:06.460
No problem.

01:07:06.830 --> 01:07:09.380
Whoever fails, all of us will die.

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:10.960
The risk is the same.

01:07:11.290 --> 01:07:13.630
But... I'm a nobody.

01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:17.090
Is my plan really the best option?

01:07:17.970 --> 01:07:19.510
We've got no other choices except your plan.

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:23.220
There's no time left to think. This idea's our only shot.

01:07:23.930 --> 01:07:25.680
Now, we've just gotta give it everything we've got.

01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:28.560
Don't worry. Be confident.

01:07:29.850 --> 01:07:32.020
You've got a talent for reasoning out the best solution.

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:36.780
The lift's ready!

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:38.030
The guns too!

01:07:38.610 --> 01:07:39.700
All of them are loaded!

01:07:40.410 --> 01:07:41.530
You just aren't aware yet.

01:07:42.070 --> 01:07:43.030
I'll tell you more later.

01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:43.870
Okay...

01:08:04.850 --> 01:08:07.350
We're all good. There's still only seven.

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:14.610
Follow the plan!

01:08:24.910 --> 01:08:27.240
Calm down! Lure them in closer!

01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:33.250
Hold!

01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:38.170
<i>We shouldn't fight at a disadvantage</i>

01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:41.380
<i>if we want to keep casualties to the bare minimum.</i>

01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:43.930
<i>We must end it in this one strike!</i>

01:08:45.970 --> 01:08:46.560
Wait!

01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:56.190
Ready!

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:03.320
Fire!

01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:12.920
<i>I got it! The others?</i>

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:26.140
Pardon me... for suddenly...

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:28.350
stabbing you... from behind...

01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:30.470
It's Sasha and Connie!

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:31.980
Hurry! Help them!

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:37.400
I'm really sorry!

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:49.450
Mikasa! You saved me!

01:09:50.830 --> 01:09:51.750
Are you hurt anywhere?

01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:52.830
I'm safe, thanks to you!

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:54.170
Then stand! Now!

01:09:54.670 --> 01:09:55.620
Sorry...

01:09:56.290 --> 01:09:56.920
Never mind.

01:09:57.330 --> 01:10:00.590
Geez. That was too close, Annie.

01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:03.380
I'm glad you weren't injured.

01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:05.260
We got them all!

01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:07.510
Everyone stock up on supplies!

01:10:07.930 --> 01:10:08.510
Hell yeah!

01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:15.230
Are you all ready? Let's get outta here!

01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:17.100
We've gotta bail now!

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:19.980
Go! Go! Go! We need to meet up with the main units!

01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:23.530
Mikasa?

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:27.990
Mikasa!

01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:29.700
We've gotta hurry!

01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:31.450
That Titan...

01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:36.750
They're eating it...

01:10:40.710 --> 01:10:42.840
Its body can't regenerate?

01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:47.180
I thought uncovering the truth about that Titan might be the key

01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:53.060
to freeing ourselves from this desperate situation...

01:10:53.810 --> 01:10:54.560
I agree.

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:58.600
If they just rip it to shreds like that, then we won't have learned a single thing!

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:02.860
We should get rid of those Titans currently devouring it,

01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:04.900
And at least try to keep it alive.

01:11:05.150 --> 01:11:06.280
Are you insane, Reiner?!

01:11:06.650 --> 01:11:09.070
We can finally escape this deathtrap!

01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:14.290
But what if that Titan could become an ally?

01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:17.660
Don't you think it'd be a weapon more powerful than any cannon?

01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:21.540
Our... ally? Are you for real?!

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:24.760
That's...

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:28.180
The abnormal that ate Thomas!

01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:57.700
Hey...

01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:04.800
What was that about helping it?

01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:14.640
Looks like it burnt itself out.

01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:17.390
Whatever. Let's get going!

01:12:17.930 --> 01:12:20.020
There's no way that monster's on our side!

01:12:20.730 --> 01:12:21.940
Titans are Titans.

01:12:27.150 --> 01:12:28.360
What is it?

01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:53.890
Mikasa!

01:14:03.870 --> 01:14:04.670
<i>It's Eren...</i>

01:14:07.170 --> 01:14:12.090
<i>He's even got his limbs back...</i>

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:18.850
<i>Eren was eaten by that Titan back then.</i>

01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:31.020
What just happened here?

01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:45.370
Then Eren... did all of this?

01:14:54.210 --> 01:14:59.260
One of the reasons why the Titans' attack on Trost claimed so many soldiers' lives

01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:03.350
Was that the elite Survey Corps were absent.

01:15:05.930 --> 01:15:10.110
They'd left on an expedition outside the Wall that very morning.

01:15:10.610 --> 01:15:12.980
A Few Hours Ago

01:15:10.610 --> 01:15:12.980
A Few Hours Ago

01:15:13.230 --> 01:15:15.820
They're here! It's the main force of the Survey Corps!

01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:20.240
Commander Erwin! Kick their Titan asses for me!

01:15:20.450 --> 01:15:22.200
Look! There's Captain Levi!

01:15:22.490 --> 01:15:24.870
They say in battle, he's as strong as a whole brigade!

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.620
Shut up already...

01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:33.420
I bet they wouldn't worship you so much if they knew what an obsessive clean freak you are!

01:15:36.210 --> 01:15:40.340
An expedition with the aim of exploring the outside and look for possible settlement.

01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:46.640
When troops advanced into Titan 
territory, casualties exceeded 30%.

01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:53.320
That's just how great the power gap between Titans and men was.

01:15:54.690 --> 01:15:57.440
Just... Just watch... You bastards...

01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:01.530
Mankind will... survive...

01:16:04.370 --> 01:16:10.080
You bastards... will all... Fall to Captain Levi!

01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:22.510
One on the right...

01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:25.010
Two on the left.

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:27.770
Captain, I've gathered the reinforcements!

01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:30.730
Petra, look after that soldier down there.

01:16:31.390 --> 01:16:33.020
The rest of you attack the one to the right.

01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:35.190
I'll clean up on the left.

01:16:38.030 --> 01:16:39.740
What a lovely bunch.

01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:45.660
You all have such interesting faces.

01:16:58.630 --> 01:16:59.710
Stay still.

01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:02.340
Otherwise, I'll never get...

01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:06.300
A clean cut of your flesh.

01:17:15.730 --> 01:17:17.980
It got all filthy...

01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:30.250
Captain, I can't stop the bleeding!

01:17:34.290 --> 01:17:36.210
Captain...

01:17:41.010 --> 01:17:41.590
What?

01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:50.430
Was I... useful to... mankind?

01:17:52.850 --> 01:17:58.770
Or will I die... useless like this?

01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:05.360
You did great.

01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:08.490
And you'll do even more.

01:18:09.870 --> 01:18:13.660
Your spirit will stay with me and give me strength!

01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:16.630
I swear to you,

01:18:17.250 --> 01:18:20.420
I will exterminate the Titans!

01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:26.590
Captain, he's gone...

01:18:32.350 --> 01:18:35.020
Did he hear everything?

01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:38.610
I'm sure he heard it all.

01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:43.280
He's resting so peacefully now.

01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:47.030
Good, then...

01:18:49.530 --> 01:18:52.660
Levi! We're going back!

01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:57.330
Back? We haven't reached our limit yet.

01:18:58.210 --> 01:18:59.580
Did my men die in vain?

01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:03.340
The Titans have all started heading north towards the city.

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:08.050
It's just like five years ago.

01:19:09.050 --> 01:19:10.510
Something's happened in the city.

01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:13.640
They might've even broken through the Wall.

01:19:20.860 --> 01:19:23.570
All cadets are to ready their equipment and stand by!

01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:31.450
So that's how we managed to refill our gas and get out of Trost.

01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:37.460
Wait, then the people who aren't here are all...

01:19:38.330 --> 01:19:38.870
Yeah.

01:19:41.250 --> 01:19:42.590
Even Mikasa?

01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:47.720
No... I thought Mikasa came back late with Jean and the others...

01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:51.590
Jean! Don't tell me Mikasa was wounded?

01:19:54.010 --> 01:19:55.680
Hey, what's wrong?

01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:06.400
We were sworn to keep it secret.

01:20:06.650 --> 01:20:07.440
Secret?

01:20:07.650 --> 01:20:08.450
What the hell?

01:20:09.490 --> 01:20:12.620
It's hardly something they can keep covered up though.

01:20:13.410 --> 01:20:16.240
Soon all of mankind will know about it.

01:20:19.830 --> 01:20:24.920
Although for that, they must pass this test and gain their survival.

01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:30.880
Fire!

01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:34.300
Eren! Armin! We're going up!

01:20:50.650 --> 01:20:51.240
Cannon fire?!

01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:52.780
But why just on shot?!

01:20:53.570 --> 01:20:55.490
It can't be...
Is that smoke from a Titan?

01:20:57.660 --> 01:20:58.160
Wait!

01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:00.080
Wait!

01:21:08.050 --> 01:21:08.760
Did we get them?

01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:20.980
No way...

01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:37.030
Look at that! Stay back! It's too dangerous!

01:21:37.410 --> 01:21:39.370
Stand by on alert!

01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:40.500
Stand by!

01:21:40.910 --> 01:21:43.250
Load the next round into the cannon!

01:22:09.690 --> 01:22:10.760
Are you okay?

01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:13.360
Eren, what is this?

01:22:13.570 --> 01:22:15.820
I don't know.

01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:18.530
All I know is I've got my arm and leg back as if by magic,

01:22:20.330 --> 01:22:26.000
And that all the Garrison sees is a Titan who killed his comrades.

01:22:27.830 --> 01:22:30.380
Earlier, when I transformed,

01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:32.760
I did it unconsciously.

01:22:33.210 --> 01:22:35.260
It's as if I wasn't able to control my body!

01:22:36.590 --> 01:22:38.800
I did remember one thing, though...

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:42.020
The basement. The basement of my old house.

01:22:43.180 --> 01:22:46.190
My father said I would understand everything if I went there.

01:22:46.810 --> 01:22:50.690
Always keep this key with you. Never let go of it.

01:22:51.610 --> 01:22:54.490
And when you look at it, remember!

01:22:55.900 --> 01:22:58.700
You must go to the basement!

01:23:00.370 --> 01:23:05.160
Understood? Retake Wall Maria and reach that basement!

01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:09.210
This power will prove usefull then!

01:23:10.670 --> 01:23:12.750
My father's the reason all of this is happening to me.

01:23:14.210 --> 01:23:18.510
If I get to that basement, I'll probably find out the truth about Titans.

01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:24.220
Dammit! Why did he hide this from me?

01:23:24.970 --> 01:23:29.770
It's the intel the Survey Corps has been searching for, at the cost of thousands of lives!

01:23:30.230 --> 01:23:32.190
This is mankind's last hope!

01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:37.070
He was just keeping it locked away in the basement?

01:23:38.150 --> 01:23:40.450
What the hell was he thinking?!

01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:43.660
Eren, your nose is bleeding...

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:49.290
You're really pale. Your breathing's heavy too.

01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:52.130
Doing that clearly puts too much strain on your body!

01:23:53.670 --> 01:23:55.590
I don't care if I'm in bad shape right now.

01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:58.720
I've caused you enough trouble already.

01:24:00.130 --> 01:24:02.390
From here on out, I'm doing this alone.

01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:05.520
No! I…

01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:05.970
Eren.

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:08.310
I'm coming too.

01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:09.140
No.

01:24:10.020 --> 01:24:12.690
If I can't keep up with you, then don't concern yourself with me.

01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:15.730
But I don't have to do whatever you say either.

01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:18.320
I'm telling you to cut it out already!

01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:21.740
I'm not your little brother or your kid!

01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:26.740
<i>I guess that even in my final moments, I'm still nothing more than a coward.</i>

01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:31.000
<i>They've helped me out so many times,</i>

01:24:32.170 --> 01:24:37.210
<i>Yet never once was I able to repay them.</i>

01:24:39.670 --> 01:24:45.510
<i>After this... The three of us will never be together again.</i>

01:24:58.820 --> 01:25:03.990
<i>No! I can't give up!</i>

01:25:05.070 --> 01:25:07.120
<i>There has to be a way out!</i>

01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:11.910
I'll convince them.

01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:16.210
Do your best to show them you don't intend to resist.

01:25:23.430 --> 01:25:27.890
<i>Something's been troubling me ever since I saw Eren fight as a Titan.</i>

01:25:28.510 --> 01:25:31.020
<i>I haven't even sorted out my own 
thoughts yet, but I've got to do this.</i>

01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:33.190
<i>I'll have to think while I speak!</i>

01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:39.230
Stop!

01:25:44.490 --> 01:25:47.200
You finally showed your true colors, monster!

01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:50.330
I'll signal! I'll signal the cannon!

01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:52.710
He isn't the enemy of mankind!

01:25:53.210 --> 01:25:57.290
We're willing to share all the intelligence we've gathered!

01:25:57.420 --> 01:25:59.800
Begging for your lives is useless now!

01:26:00.210 --> 01:26:02.340
I've seen it with my own eyes!

01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:06.090
A Titan came from inside of another!

01:26:06.430 --> 01:26:11.470
And if that weren't enough, I also witnessed how Eren Jeager got out from that Titan's neck!

01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:15.730
If you say he's not an enemy, prove it!

01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:17.730
There's no need for further proof!

01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:20.400
<i>That's right! It's unnecessary!</i>

01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:25.450
The issue isn't how we see him!

01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:26.610
What?!

01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:29.520
You said everybody saw him!

01:26:29.910 --> 01:26:32.910
Then they must've seen him fighting the Titans too!

01:26:33.290 --> 01:26:36.370
And they must've seen all the Titans ganging up against him!

01:26:37.580 --> 01:26:43.210
The Titans see him as prey, just like the rest of mankind!

01:26:43.630 --> 01:26:48.050
Nothing you say can change that fact!

01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:51.140
A Titan as an ally... That can't be...

01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:58.130
That can't be...

01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:01.150
Don't fall for this clever trap!

01:27:03.190 --> 01:27:08.410
As a soldier, I swore to devote my heart to the resurrection of mankind!

01:27:09.070 --> 01:27:13.080
There is no greater glory than dying for that belief!

01:27:13.620 --> 01:27:17.790
If we added his Titan power to the might of our armies,

01:27:18.290 --> 01:27:21.090
It might even be possible to recapture the town!

01:27:21.790 --> 01:27:26.260
For the glory of the human race, I beg you! In my final moments before I die,

01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:29.300
Permit me to explain his strategic importance!

01:27:34.220 --> 01:27:37.730
Captain, we should consider wh—

01:27:37.730 --> 01:27:38.560
Silence!

01:27:40.810 --> 01:27:43.980
No matter how they plead for their lives, they're still rebels!

01:27:44.530 --> 01:27:46.380
Those who break the rules must be eliminated!

01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:48.860
That's what it means to be a soldier!

01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:54.950
Cut it out already.

01:27:56.750 --> 01:28:00.880
You haven't changed. As big as you are, 
you've still got the guts of a scared fawn.

01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:04.630
Commander Pixis?

01:28:06.710 --> 01:28:09.740
Can't you see how magnificent his salute is?

01:28:12.890 --> 01:28:16.350
I just arrived, but the situation has already been relayed to me.

01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:19.060
You go organize the reinforcements.

01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:24.270
I think it'd be worthwhile to hear what they've got to say.

01:28:30.820 --> 01:28:32.240
Dot Pixis.

01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:38.120
The Commander-in-Chief of the defense of the southern territories, including Trost.

01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:43.080
A man entrusted with complete authority over the key area of mankind's defenses.

01:28:45.170 --> 01:28:48.970
I see. So you believe that basement holds all the answers you seek?

01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:51.360
Yes. Will you believe me, sir?

01:28:52.510 --> 01:28:58.720
Since even you yourself can't say for sure, let's just say I'll just keep it in mind for now.

01:28:59.930 --> 01:29:02.350
Cadet Arlert, was it?

01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:03.310
Yes, sir!

01:29:04.150 --> 01:29:07.320
Earlier, you said that by using this "Titan power"

01:29:07.820 --> 01:29:10.440
We might be able to retake this city.

01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:12.740
Do you really believe that,

01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:16.030
Or were you just desperate to stay alive?

01:29:17.330 --> 01:29:20.500
It was... both, sir!

01:29:21.870 --> 01:29:23.960
I was trying to say that Eren could take on his Titan form,

01:29:24.830 --> 01:29:30.550
Carry that boulder to the wall, and block the gap in the gate.

01:29:31.970 --> 01:29:34.470
The thought just occurred to me...

01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:41.310
But couldn't you look at Eren's power as a chance to turn this situation to our favor?

01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:48.150
Of course, I was also desperate to save our lives...

01:29:50.190 --> 01:29:54.660
Desperate to save... Those words are worth more than anything.

01:30:04.170 --> 01:30:06.130
What do you say, Cadet Jaeger?

01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:07.920
Sir?

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.620
<i>Can you close the gap?</i>

01:30:13.510 --> 01:30:15.720
I...

01:30:16.930 --> 01:30:17.800
I'm not sure.

01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:23.020
I don't understand this any more than the rest of you.

01:30:24.270 --> 01:30:29.940
It'd be irresponsible of me to answer as if I knew either way.

01:30:29.940 --> 01:30:32.320
Oh right, sorry.

01:30:32.780 --> 01:30:34.900
I asked the wrong question.

01:30:36.610 --> 01:30:39.580
Will you do it or not? Which is it?

01:31:09.610 --> 01:31:13.150
I'll do it. I will do it.

01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:18.910
I'm not certain I can close the gap, but I'll still do it.

01:31:29.170 --> 01:31:31.420
The elite team has commenced the operation.

01:31:33.380 --> 01:31:37.380
I will now brief you about the operation for retaking Trost!

01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:40.090
I shall now introduce him.

01:31:41.390 --> 01:31:44.470
Eren Jaeger of the Cadets!

01:31:45.850 --> 01:31:51.560
He can summon a Titan body and control it at will!

01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:56.690
He will transform into a Titan, pick up that giant boulder near the front gate,

01:31:57.280 --> 01:32:00.320
carry it to the breach in the wall, and block off the hole with it!

01:32:01.570 --> 01:32:05.200
Your mission will be to protect him from the other Titans

01:32:05.830 --> 01:32:09.080
...while he's carrying the boulder to the breach!

01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:14.670
Eren Jaeger's protection will be entrusted to the squad leaders:

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:19.510
Ian Dietrich, Rico Brzenska and Mitabi Jarnach!

01:32:20.970 --> 01:32:22.920
The fate of mankind is in your hands.

01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:24.050
Yes, sir!

01:32:25.220 --> 01:32:26.470
Ready? Let's go!

01:32:38.650 --> 01:32:40.400
Since the Titans first appeared,

01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:43.370
Not once has mankind won against them!

01:32:45.490 --> 01:32:49.370
The Titans keep marching forth and we keep retreating,

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:51.710
Letting them take our land!

01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:56.130
However, when this plan succeeds,

01:32:57.050 --> 01:33:02.130
It'll be the first time we've ever reconquered land from the Titans!

01:33:03.930 --> 01:33:09.480
And in that moment, for the first time, mankind will triumph over the Titans!

01:33:10.850 --> 01:33:14.940
Compared to what's been taken from us,

01:33:15.610 --> 01:33:18.400
It may be a small thing...

01:33:19.630 --> 01:33:26.660
But it will mean mankind has finally managed an attack on the Titans!

01:33:58.230 --> 01:34:03.240
<i>By human standards, that rock is way too heavy to lift.</i>

01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:07.870
<i>But I'm sure Eren has the strength to guide us.</i>

01:34:16.630 --> 01:34:17.250
<i>Eren?</i>

01:34:35.850 --> 01:34:36.480
Ackerman!

01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:52.790
Eren, don't you recognize me? I'm Mikasa!

01:34:53.450 --> 01:34:55.330
I'm your family!

01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:58.750
You must block the hole with that boulder!

01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:00.710
Dodge, Ackerman!

01:35:15.730 --> 01:35:16.850
What's up with him?

01:35:17.650 --> 01:35:19.690
He's just a stupid Titan like all the rest!

01:35:19.770 --> 01:35:20.310
Eren!

01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:21.480
Squad leader Ian!

01:35:22.270 --> 01:35:23.650
Two approaching from ahead!

01:35:24.030 --> 01:35:25.990
One 10-meter and one 6-meter class!

01:35:26.570 --> 01:35:27.780
Another is coming from behind!

01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:30.120
It's a 12-meter class!

01:35:33.490 --> 01:35:34.830
The operation has failed.

01:35:35.870 --> 01:35:39.710
It was obvious from the start that no secret weapon existed.

01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:47.800
Hey, look at that!

01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:49.260
Look, what's that?

01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:52.720
Did they... fail?

01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:54.180
Why?

01:35:58.060 --> 01:35:59.270
Armin! Where are you going?

01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:01.480
Commander Pixis,

01:36:02.230 --> 01:36:04.730
We should fall back to defending the gate.

01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:05.980
Do you approve?

01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:06.900
No.

01:36:08.150 --> 01:36:09.910
Order the elite team to retreat.

01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:10.820
No need.

01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:14.540
Keep luring the Titans to the corner of the town.

01:36:15.990 --> 01:36:19.540
As for the elite team, they have the authority to act as they see fit.

01:36:20.290 --> 01:36:22.000
They aren't merely just skilled soldiers.

01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:25.920
They are the elite among the elite that I entrusted with the future of mankind.

01:36:27.090 --> 01:36:30.510
Giving up so easily would be unforgivable.

01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:34.140
We cannot allow our comrades' deaths to be in vain.

01:36:35.430 --> 01:36:38.480
We must struggle to our very last breaths.

01:37:02.370 --> 01:37:05.290
<i>I'm at home?</i>

01:37:13.010 --> 01:37:13.640
I need sleep...

01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:32.490
This isn't good! Behind us!

01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:36.860
A 13-meter class is heading for Jaeger!

01:37:37.620 --> 01:37:40.200
More Titans are coming in through the gate!

01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:42.790
Looks like four 10-meter class!

01:37:43.710 --> 01:37:45.210
Ackerman, handle the one behind us!

01:37:45.420 --> 01:37:45.960
Roger!

01:37:46.250 --> 01:37:47.960
Don't let them reach Jaeger!

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.010
We'll stop them here!

01:37:50.210 --> 01:37:50.760
Roger!

01:37:51.550 --> 01:37:54.260
<i>Even though they're the elite,
 just two squads can't handle four at once...</i>

01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:09.780
<i>Oh, no... Why are there so many Titans?</i>

01:38:10.690 --> 01:38:12.400
<i>There are hardly any humans around here.</i>

01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:16.240
<i>Don't tell me... They're drawn to Eren?</i>

01:38:16.820 --> 01:38:17.410
Mikasa!

01:38:18.490 --> 01:38:19.660
What happened to the plan?

01:38:19.870 --> 01:38:20.490
Armin?

01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:22.540
What's wrong with Eren?

01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:24.460
It's dangerous! Get away from there!

01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:27.380
Eren can't control that Titan!

01:38:28.170 --> 01:38:30.170
It didn't respond even when I tried talking to it!

01:38:30.750 --> 01:38:32.550
There's no use in anyone else trying either!

01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:33.590
And the plan?

01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:34.760
It failed.

01:38:35.300 --> 01:38:36.550
We can't leave Eren behind,

01:38:37.010 --> 01:38:37.970
So everyone's fighting!

01:38:38.510 --> 01:38:40.310
But with this many Titans,

01:38:40.470 --> 01:38:42.600
We're bound to get wiped out!

01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:57.160
Eren came out of the Titan's weak point before.

01:38:58.370 --> 01:38:58.990
What are you...

01:39:01.030 --> 01:39:05.500
This has to be related to the mystery of the Titan's true nature.

01:39:06.670 --> 01:39:09.500
It'll be fine. As long as I avoid the middle,

01:39:10.250 --> 01:39:12.630
It won't be fatal...

01:39:13.050 --> 01:39:16.630
It's just going to hurt a bit!

01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:17.510
Armin!

01:39:27.810 --> 01:39:29.400
Armin, don't be a fool!

01:39:29.690 --> 01:39:32.610
Mikasa! Right now, do what you can!

01:39:32.860 --> 01:39:35.120
If you go, there are lives you can save!

01:39:35.530 --> 01:39:37.360
Leave Eren to me and get going!

01:39:45.290 --> 01:39:46.960
Eren, can you hear me?!

01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:48.710
Get a grip, man!

01:39:49.370 --> 01:39:51.960
If you don't come out of there, we're all dead!

01:39:52.710 --> 01:39:54.630
Eren! Come out!

01:39:55.260 --> 01:39:56.800
Hurry! Eren!

01:39:57.550 --> 01:39:58.380
Eren!

01:40:01.930 --> 01:40:04.310
What happened to avenging your mother?!

01:40:04.810 --> 01:40:06.770
Weren't you going to exterminate all the Titans?!

01:40:07.350 --> 01:40:10.100
Don't you hate those bastards for killing your mom?!

01:40:11.810 --> 01:40:13.610
What are you saying, Armin?

01:40:15.610 --> 01:40:17.900
My mom's right here.

01:40:19.150 --> 01:40:19.860
Eren!

01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:22.620
Eren! Wake up, please! Eren!

01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:25.290
I know you're in there, Eren!

01:40:25.620 --> 01:40:28.250
If you stay here, we'll be killed by the Titans!

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.670
Everything will end right here!

01:40:32.830 --> 01:40:36.670
I told you, you're making no sense, Armin.

01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:42.180
Why should I go outside?

01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:46.140
That's right. Why should I...

01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:52.560
Join the Survey Corps...

01:40:58.190 --> 01:40:59.440
Gotcha!

01:41:06.030 --> 01:41:08.250
Take that, you piece of shit!

01:41:14.250 --> 01:41:15.290
Keep your distance!

01:41:15.540 --> 01:41:16.670
Ackerman reporting in!

01:41:17.460 --> 01:41:18.800
I'll join Mitabi's squad!

01:41:29.390 --> 01:41:29.980
Huh?

01:41:34.270 --> 01:41:34.810
Jean!

01:41:35.190 --> 01:41:36.230
Hurry and run!

01:41:40.490 --> 01:41:43.030
<i>I've had enough of people dying on my account!</i>

01:41:58.550 --> 01:42:00.380
Shit, it just had to break right now?!

01:42:18.690 --> 01:42:19.270
Jean!

01:42:25.030 --> 01:42:28.830
What's wrong? Why isn't he using his 3D Maneuver Gear?

01:42:30.450 --> 01:42:33.120
Don't tell me it broke!

01:42:34.750 --> 01:42:36.040
I'll sort this out myself!

01:43:00.070 --> 01:43:04.320
Eren! Eren! Eren!

01:43:06.740 --> 01:43:07.360
Eren!

01:43:09.370 --> 01:43:13.660
Weren't we going to explore the outside world?

01:43:16.580 --> 01:43:19.250
Far, far beyond these walls...

01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:26.260
To the burning water and the land of ice. 
To the snowfields of sand.

01:43:28.890 --> 01:43:30.640
I thought you'd forgotten about it,

01:43:31.930 --> 01:43:36.980
but you'd just stopped bringing it up because you didn't want me to join the Survey Corps.

01:43:38.810 --> 01:43:40.860
The outside world...

01:43:44.990 --> 01:43:51.870
Eren, answer me! Even though you knew hell was raging outside the walls...

01:43:52.870 --> 01:43:56.830
Why did you ever want to see the outside world?

01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:05.710
Why, you ask? Isn't it obvious?

01:44:09.180 --> 01:44:12.180
It's because I was born in this world!

01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:33.160
Squad leader, this is all we can handle! We're the only ones left!

01:44:35.450 --> 01:44:36.700
Let's fall back to the rock!

01:44:42.830 --> 01:44:43.420
Report!

01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:46.880
Five Titans incoming from the gate.

01:44:56.310 --> 01:44:57.430
Dammit!

01:44:58.100 --> 01:44:58.640
Jean!

01:44:59.730 --> 01:45:00.980
It must be his Maneuver Gear!

01:45:02.270 --> 01:45:02.810
What's wrong?

01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:10.610
C'mon, you bastard! I'm in a hurry here!

01:45:14.070 --> 01:45:14.910
Jean, calm down!

01:45:18.370 --> 01:45:20.370
Marco, what are you doing?!

01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:35.300
Jeez, what a drag!

01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:49.940
Crap! Why is the trigger so hard to pull?

01:45:54.410 --> 01:45:55.030
Jean!

01:46:01.620 --> 01:46:02.540
What are you doing?!

01:46:03.210 --> 01:46:05.130
That's my line! Fly away already!

01:46:38.410 --> 01:46:39.660
You guys are insane!

01:46:39.780 --> 01:46:42.870
My line again! I think I just died like three times over!

01:46:45.330 --> 01:46:45.960
Look at that!

01:47:21.490 --> 01:47:22.040
Eren...

01:47:22.950 --> 01:47:23.700
Mikasa!

01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:26.660
Armin!

01:47:27.670 --> 01:47:32.340
Eren won! He's trying to fulfill his duty!

01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:35.880
Now, If he can just make it to the gate,

01:47:36.380 --> 01:47:37.550
victory will be ours!

01:47:43.140 --> 01:47:44.020
Listen well!

01:47:45.390 --> 01:47:49.560
We must defend Eren until he reaches the gate, even if it costs us our lives!

01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:53.270
Don't let any Titans get near him!

01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:57.070
Keep them all out of the way! We must support Eren!

01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:02.490
You two, go to Eren!

01:48:03.580 --> 01:48:05.330
This is an order! Got it?

01:48:06.370 --> 01:48:07.000
Yes, sir!

01:48:11.540 --> 01:48:13.380
Mitabi's squad? What are they...?

01:48:14.630 --> 01:48:19.260
The Titans aren't paying us any attention! We've gotta get close enough that they can't ignore us!

01:48:20.510 --> 01:48:21.970
Look! Over here!

01:48:22.430 --> 01:48:26.350
Turn around, or I'll shove my sword right up your stinkin' ass and bleed you to death!

01:48:30.730 --> 01:48:32.520
Now! Two of them are after us!

01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:35.610
Run! Run to the buildings!

01:48:36.110 --> 01:48:39.490
No way! Staying on the ground is suicide!

01:48:40.610 --> 01:48:42.740
Without horses or buildings, we can't fight!

01:48:43.410 --> 01:48:47.370
No... It's the only way we've got left.

01:48:51.330 --> 01:48:52.630
Everyone follow their lead!

01:48:53.630 --> 01:48:55.300
Armin, we're going too.

01:48:58.670 --> 01:49:00.510
This way! Come over here!

01:49:09.390 --> 01:49:12.850
My body... It feels like I'm being crushed...

01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:19.530
Mikasa? Armin? What are you doing?

01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:23.570
If you stay down there, the Titans will eat you!

01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:27.580
Hey! What are you waiting for?

01:49:28.330 --> 01:49:29.290
Come and get me!

01:49:32.540 --> 01:49:33.460
Hey!

01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:36.210
Mitabi!

01:49:42.760 --> 01:49:46.640
<i>Why did you ever want to see the outside world?</i>

01:49:50.140 --> 01:49:56.190
When we're born, all of us are free.

01:49:59.150 --> 01:50:04.070
People who deny that, no matter how strong they are, don't matter.

01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:10.580
The burning water, the land of ice... I don't care what!

01:50:11.790 --> 01:50:17.540
Anyone who saw such things would be the freest person in the entire world!

01:50:20.050 --> 01:50:20.940
Fight!

01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:24.510
Who would value their life over something like that?

01:50:27.050 --> 01:50:30.520
However terrifying the world may be... It doesn't matter!

01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:37.150
However cruel the world may be... It doesn't matter!

01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:39.900
Fight!

01:50:40.860 --> 01:50:42.150
Fight!

01:50:42.990 --> 01:50:43.700
Fight!

01:50:44.860 --> 01:50:46.360
Fight!

01:50:50.290 --> 01:50:51.290
Watch out! Titans!

01:50:53.910 --> 01:50:54.830
I'll handle this!

01:50:57.960 --> 01:51:00.250
Out of the way!

01:51:22.940 --> 01:51:25.820
Go, Eren!

01:51:27.110 --> 01:51:28.240
Fight!

01:52:13.450 --> 01:52:17.830
Everybody... didn't die in vain.

01:52:24.250 --> 01:52:29.510
Today, for the first time, mankind triumphed over the Titans.

01:53:05.630 --> 01:53:07.840
Part of his body is still fused with the Titan.

01:53:08.380 --> 01:53:09.670
I can't pull him out!

01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:10.970
We'll have to cut it then!

01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:46.460
Hey, you brats...

01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:49.800
What's going on here?

01:53:51.550 --> 01:53:54.760
The Wings of... Freedom...

01:58:03.010 --> 01:58:04.260
Do you have any questions?

01:58:12.270 --> 01:58:12.890
Um...

01:58:15.150 --> 01:58:18.440
Where... am I?
