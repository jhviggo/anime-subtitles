WEBVTT

00:00:31.708 --> 00:00:33.542
Hey!

00:00:33.542 --> 00:00:37.667
You're not allowed to touch the girl, mister.

00:00:37.667 --> 00:00:40.917
I-It's not what you think, Hitch! I-I...

00:00:40.917 --> 00:00:45.917
Titan memories have been known
to transfer by touch!

00:00:45.917 --> 00:00:49.792
I thought I might learn something important!

00:00:49.792 --> 00:00:54.083
I wasn't doing anything inappropriate, really!

00:00:54.083 --> 00:01:01.000
You are a guy, after all.
I bet you wanna learn all about Annie.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I'm sorry, okay?!
Don't ban me from coming back!

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.917
I wasn't planning to. Annie would
get bored listening only to me.

00:01:10.917 --> 00:01:12.875
Huh?

00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:18.792
Unbelievable. You're so popular,
and all you do is sleep.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
"Guides"

00:02:56.042 --> 00:03:01.667
It's great that you've got a crush on her,
but have you heard the news?

00:03:01.667 --> 00:03:03.333
No.

00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:04.833
Read this.

00:03:07.792 --> 00:03:14.375
"Military Clings to Power by
Wrongfully Detaining Eren Jaeger."

00:03:15.375 --> 00:03:18.833
"Distrust in the Military Soars Higher."

00:03:18.833 --> 00:03:23.167
Because they're not giving
the public any answers.

00:03:23.167 --> 00:03:28.458
Well, they can't just disclose
Zeke and the rumbling.

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:31.042
Only Eren can save Eldia!

00:03:31.042 --> 00:03:35.125
Jaeger's the only one who avenges the eaten!

00:03:35.125 --> 00:03:38.875
The New Eldian Empire needs Eren Jaeger!

00:03:38.875 --> 00:03:40.750
This is...

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.167
There're citizens surrounding the entire HQ.

00:03:46.792 --> 00:03:50.000
Hey, Hitch! Lend us a hand!

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.917
Ugh! More work for me!

00:03:52.917 --> 00:03:55.042
Armin!

00:03:55.042 --> 00:03:59.417
Mikasa! You managed to make it here, huh?

00:03:59.417 --> 00:04:04.292
Yeah. We can't let this time
go to waste. Let's go.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.125
Scout recruits? What are they doing at HQ?

00:04:17.292 --> 00:04:20.875
That day, I did go to meet Eren.

00:04:20.875 --> 00:04:22.417
Oh?

00:04:22.417 --> 00:04:25.833
I'm sorry for keeping quiet about it.

00:04:25.833 --> 00:04:30.083
That's enough reason to detain the volunteers.

00:04:30.083 --> 00:04:33.708
How kind of you to admit.

00:04:33.708 --> 00:04:38.208
The way I saw it, you guys
didn't know the world.

00:04:38.208 --> 00:04:43.667
If you kept arguing and putting it off,
it would be too late.

00:04:43.667 --> 00:04:48.167
Eren felt the same sense of urgency, too.

00:04:48.167 --> 00:04:55.333
So, you convinced Eren to infiltrate
Marley alone to get our military moving?

00:04:55.333 --> 00:05:02.083
Not quite. I said someone needed to
light a fire under the administration.

00:05:02.083 --> 00:05:04.000
That's all you said?

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.792
You risked a secret meeting without
discussing any concrete plans?

00:05:09.792 --> 00:05:11.500
That's right.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:17.750
Given our position, we weren't allowed
to meet with him in public.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.667
But the risk was worth it to you.

00:05:20.667 --> 00:05:26.250
You succeeded in manipulating Eren
just as Zeke hoped you would.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.583
What would be the point in that?

00:05:28.583 --> 00:05:33.083
All I wanted was for Eren Jaeger
to know who I was!

00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:50.875
No... We wanted Eren's Founding Titan
to crush Marley into dust.

00:05:50.875 --> 00:05:56.917
Just like we hoped,
he inflicted heavy damage to Marley.

00:05:56.917 --> 00:06:00.875
No... He exceeded expectations.

00:06:00.875 --> 00:06:07.083
He delivered the divine retribution
we wished upon Marley for years.

00:06:07.083 --> 00:06:12.792
For him to achieve such things
is proof he possesses the Founder.

00:06:12.792 --> 00:06:18.458
Commander Pyxis, do you know
what we're witnessing?

00:06:18.458 --> 00:06:22.583
History is about to change before our eyes.

00:06:22.583 --> 00:06:26.500
Two brothers are reshaping the world.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.750
I simply want to see it happen from their side.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:37.458
In other words, the main reason
you met Eren was out of curiosity?

00:06:37.458 --> 00:06:43.917
Essentially. The other volunteers
don't know that I secretly met Eren.

00:06:43.917 --> 00:06:46.917
My actions were reckless.

00:06:46.917 --> 00:06:54.458
It's true that I deceived you guys,
but I did it for the sake of Eldia.

00:06:54.458 --> 00:06:57.292
I'd like to believe you.

00:06:57.292 --> 00:07:01.208
Tell me everything you and Eren spoke about.

00:07:01.208 --> 00:07:04.583
Do you know how to tell a good lie?

00:07:04.583 --> 00:07:08.958
Sometimes, you've gotta mix the truth into it.

00:07:17.167 --> 00:07:22.792
Good grief. It's appalling that people
doubt us after all this time.

00:07:22.792 --> 00:07:28.083
Aren't we comrades? We sweat
side-by-side these past three years!

00:07:28.083 --> 00:07:32.375
The railways, the trading...
We made this island prosper!

00:07:32.375 --> 00:07:35.542
We gave our everything to Eldia!

00:07:36.542 --> 00:07:43.833
I'm sorry. It's just ten months after
the rails opened and this happens...

00:07:43.833 --> 00:07:49.583
Tell me about it. Didn't we swear
to work together for the future?

00:07:49.583 --> 00:07:52.333
Wh-What's the matter?!

00:07:53.542 --> 00:07:59.167
What? Yelena said she
met Eren in secret? Seriously?

00:07:59.167 --> 00:08:01.583
You really didn't know?

00:08:01.583 --> 00:08:05.458
I-I had no idea. Honestly.

00:08:06.708 --> 00:08:12.042
Yeah. It doesn't seem like
you did. To me, at least.

00:08:12.042 --> 00:08:13.917
Yelena...

00:08:13.917 --> 00:08:18.667
I notice you're not saying
Yelena would never do that.

00:08:18.667 --> 00:08:22.958
Because you know that she might.

00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:24.625
That's not...

00:08:24.625 --> 00:08:30.167
We've done this backwards, but now
there's reason to detain you guys.

00:08:30.167 --> 00:08:36.083
Tell me what you know about Yelena
for the sake of our future.

00:08:37.708 --> 00:08:42.292
As you know, Yelena organized the volunteers.

00:08:42.292 --> 00:08:47.000
At first, people were wary
and it didn't go so well.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.625
But she got her hands dirty and proved
her loyalty to Zeke and the group.

00:08:53.625 --> 00:08:56.333
There were "accidental" deaths.

00:08:56.333 --> 00:09:01.167
We buried friends we ate and slept with.
Anyone who doubted us.

00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:08.542
But we pushed on for the sake of our
homelands that Marley took away.

00:09:08.542 --> 00:09:09.833
Strange.

00:09:09.833 --> 00:09:10.708
Huh?

00:09:10.708 --> 00:09:16.208
She pressed our government
to give Marleyans certain rights.

00:09:16.208 --> 00:09:22.000
You make Yelena sound merciless
to Marleyans, yet on our island...

00:09:23.417 --> 00:09:27.583
All right. I need you to
come with me, Onyankopon.

00:09:27.583 --> 00:09:28.958
Huh?

00:09:33.167 --> 00:09:36.542
I hear Hange's all over the place.

00:09:36.542 --> 00:09:40.458
Yeah. I guess something needed checking out.

00:09:40.458 --> 00:09:46.000
Indeed. And I permitted
a volunteer to go along.

00:09:48.208 --> 00:09:52.458
I can't allow you two to meet Eren.

00:09:52.458 --> 00:09:54.208
Why not?!

00:09:54.208 --> 00:09:58.625
Because we know Eren had
contact with the volunteers.

00:09:58.625 --> 00:10:06.333
Eren kept quiet about his secret meeting
which resulted in the raid on Marley.

00:10:06.333 --> 00:10:12.250
We're currently investigating if
anyone else was involved with it.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:16.833
Eren hasn't said a word
since the truth came to light.

00:10:16.833 --> 00:10:23.208
We're still in the dark about what he did
during his time in Marley, too.

00:10:24.708 --> 00:10:30.167
We believe that Eren is
being manipulated by Zeke.

00:10:31.125 --> 00:10:36.708
I'm telling you this because it's you two,
but keep quiet about it.

00:10:38.625 --> 00:10:41.833
Eren... No way...

00:10:42.792 --> 00:10:45.625
What will happen to Eren?!

00:10:49.458 --> 00:10:50.667
Is that...?

00:10:50.667 --> 00:10:57.208
Hmm? It's nothing. I had recruits bring it here
since there was nowhere to store it.

00:10:57.208 --> 00:11:04.542
But, Premier, if Eren isn't talking,
all the more reason I think we can help.

00:11:04.542 --> 00:11:11.250
I'm not sure we can get the truth out
of him, but there's no harm in trying.

00:11:12.417 --> 00:11:17.917
The situation is too delicate.
We're done talking here.

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:27.708
Why? You're right that there's no harm
in talking, so why can't we?

00:11:29.417 --> 00:11:36.292
One explanation might be that
they've completely given up on Eren.

00:11:44.333 --> 00:11:46.083
Excuse us!

00:11:46.083 --> 00:11:51.708
If that's true, they're already
picking the next Founding Titan.

00:11:51.708 --> 00:11:53.792
I'll listen through the door.

00:11:53.792 --> 00:11:55.042
Wait, Mikasa!

00:11:55.042 --> 00:11:57.458
It's fine. I won't get caught.

00:11:57.458 --> 00:12:00.208
We can't risk it right now!

00:12:00.208 --> 00:12:04.708
With all that's going on,
we've gotta find out their plan!

00:12:04.708 --> 00:12:07.750
No matter what happens,
I'll make sure Eren...

00:12:29.292 --> 00:12:31.417
Armin! You okay?

00:12:32.417 --> 00:12:34.583
I-I'm fine.

00:12:34.583 --> 00:12:37.167
--Put out the fire!
--Was anyone injured?!

00:12:37.167 --> 00:12:40.500
--Over here! We need a hand!
--Hurry up!

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.792
You guys okay?!

00:12:42.792 --> 00:12:44.542
Hitch! What was that?!

00:12:44.542 --> 00:12:46.458
The premier's room just...!

00:12:46.458 --> 00:12:48.042
Where is he?!

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:54.708
Give your hearts!

00:12:54.708 --> 00:12:58.250
Our anger reached 'em! Now's the time to fight!

00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:59.542
I'll fight, too!

00:12:59.542 --> 00:13:00.875
--Me, too!
--And me!

00:13:00.875 --> 00:13:05.667
--Yeah! It's time to fight!
--Let's show 'em how angry we are!

00:13:05.667 --> 00:13:07.542
Give your hearts!

00:13:07.542 --> 00:13:16.417
Give your hearts! Give your hearts!
Give your hearts! Give your hearts!

00:13:16.417 --> 00:13:19.500
Give your hearts!

00:13:22.125 --> 00:13:29.167
Premier Zachary owned a "special" chair.
We believe a bomb was placed on it.

00:13:29.167 --> 00:13:36.000
He and three soldiers were lost.
The culprit and their goal is unknown.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.500
The volunteers were on house arrest
and this one was with me all day.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.708
Who else could be responsible for it?

00:13:44.708 --> 00:13:50.000
The premier said some recruits
brought it to his room.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.750
Recruits from where?

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:54.500
He never said from where.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:14:01.167
But when Mikasa and I went to his room,
we saw recruits leaving HQ.

00:14:01.167 --> 00:14:03.167
Scout recruits.

00:14:06.458 --> 00:14:13.292
Speaking of Scouts, I hear some
of them leaked the info about Eren.

00:14:13.292 --> 00:14:15.042
--You don't think...
--It's an emergency!

00:14:15.042 --> 00:14:18.750
Eren Jaeger has escaped from his cell!

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.292
Mobilize everyone and find him!

00:14:21.292 --> 00:14:23.083
--Yes, sir!
--Hurry! Let's go!

00:14:23.083 --> 00:14:24.667
--Armin...
--Hurry! Let's go!

00:14:24.667 --> 00:14:27.917
What in the world is happening?

00:14:50.417 --> 00:14:53.542
What a crowd. This everyone?

00:14:53.542 --> 00:14:58.167
Besides us here, we have allies
hiding in the military.

00:14:58.167 --> 00:15:02.167
Including some who blew up Dhalis Zachary.

00:15:03.125 --> 00:15:10.208
The only one who can save the
Eldian Empire is you, Eren Jaeger.

00:15:10.208 --> 00:15:14.417
It's okay, Mikasa. Eren will understand.

00:15:14.417 --> 00:15:18.667
If we talk to him, I'm sure he'll understand.

00:15:23.208 --> 00:15:25.958
Find out where Zeke's being kept.

00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:30.958
"New Eldian Empire: A new name for Eldia
used by those on Paradis who are sympathetic
to Eren Jaeger's actions. They have rallied
around Eren and the name, causing disorder.

00:15:31.333 --> 00:15:37.542
Floch Forster and some 100 soldiers
and guards vanished from the prison.

00:15:37.542 --> 00:15:42.750
They're thought to have defected
timed with Eren's escape.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:46.958
I'm sure they're behind
the premier's murder, too.

00:15:46.958 --> 00:15:54.083
They need a name. Let's call these
anti-military insurgents "Jaegerists."

00:15:54.083 --> 00:15:58.750
And the goal of the Jaegerists...
is what, Hange?

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:02.375
They're hoping to bring Zeke and Eren together.

00:16:02.375 --> 00:16:06.542
They'll reform the military with Eren on top.

00:16:06.542 --> 00:16:10.917
Murdering the premier shows their resolve.

00:16:10.917 --> 00:16:13.542
It's obvious what provoked them.

00:16:13.542 --> 00:16:20.208
The military schemed to take the Founder
from Eren, all without telling us.

00:16:20.208 --> 00:16:24.625
We knew what would happen if we had.

00:16:24.625 --> 00:16:29.083
In any case, many of the
Jaegerists are from the Scouts.

00:16:29.083 --> 00:16:32.417
How will you take responsibility, Hange?

00:16:32.417 --> 00:16:34.750
I'll accept any punishment.

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:39.375
But resigning now would be
an irresponsible thing to do.

00:16:39.375 --> 00:16:44.667
Besides, we don't know how many
Jaegerists are still in hiding.

00:16:44.667 --> 00:16:50.833
Indeed. There might even be a
suicide bomber standing in front of me.

00:16:50.833 --> 00:16:53.292
Roeg, don't be ridiculous.

00:16:53.292 --> 00:17:00.917
Can you be trusted? Until we know,
we can't let you Scouts roam as you please!

00:17:00.917 --> 00:17:04.083
Enough! We have a guest here!

00:17:04.083 --> 00:17:08.208
We have more important things
to do than bicker!

00:17:08.208 --> 00:17:11.625
Hange, who knows where Zeke's being held?

00:17:11.625 --> 00:17:17.917
Levi and the 30 soldiers with him.
Also, three soldiers who deliver supplies.

00:17:17.917 --> 00:17:19.917
Lastly, there's me.

00:17:19.917 --> 00:17:25.167
Have those three brought here.
Nile, is the Queen's residence safe?

00:17:25.167 --> 00:17:29.000
Only a few know the location,
but I'll check it out.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.375
Eren will attempt to contact
Zeke and Queen Historia.

00:17:34.375 --> 00:17:37.583
Protecting those two is an absolute must!

00:17:37.583 --> 00:17:38.708
Yes, sir!

00:17:38.708 --> 00:17:40.167
Commander Pyxis!

00:17:40.167 --> 00:17:46.292
Now that we've lost the premier,
the only one who can lead us is you.

00:17:46.292 --> 00:17:49.583
What do you think we should do?

00:17:51.833 --> 00:17:56.833
We've been utterly beaten.
Let's surrender to Eren.

00:17:58.208 --> 00:18:02.333
We can't do a thing about enemies in our midst.

00:18:02.333 --> 00:18:08.292
Even if we flushed them out,
who knows how much blood it would cost?

00:18:08.292 --> 00:18:12.167
We don't have time to waste on such folly.

00:18:12.167 --> 00:18:16.042
Our decisions made soldiers
turn their backs on us.

00:18:16.042 --> 00:18:18.458
It brought about our defeat.

00:18:18.458 --> 00:18:23.542
You're kidding! Bow down to
the people who killed the premier?!

00:18:23.542 --> 00:18:26.333
I knew Zachary for many years.

00:18:26.333 --> 00:18:31.083
To live and die by revolution
would be what he wanted.

00:18:31.083 --> 00:18:39.083
Anyways, the four who died wouldn't
want their deaths to cause Eldia's fall.

00:18:39.083 --> 00:18:42.625
So instead, we submit to the Jaeger brothers?!

00:18:42.625 --> 00:18:44.542
We're not submitting.

00:18:44.542 --> 00:18:50.125
We'll use the location of Zeke
to negotiate with the Jaegerists.

00:18:50.125 --> 00:18:57.125
Like before, Eldia's survival will depend
on a test run of the rumbling.

00:18:57.125 --> 00:19:03.583
However, we must look past the fact
that they murdered the premier.

00:19:03.583 --> 00:19:09.000
If that's the price to prevent
countless comrades from being killed...

00:19:12.583 --> 00:19:14.542
...so be it.

00:19:15.792 --> 00:19:18.125
Get moving, soldiers!

00:19:18.125 --> 00:19:19.667
Yes, sir!

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.167
Commander.

00:19:23.167 --> 00:19:26.375
I'm ashamed you had to see that.

00:19:26.375 --> 00:19:29.958
Don't be. Every country goes through this.

00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:33.292
I'm afraid I can't guarantee your safety.

00:19:33.292 --> 00:19:37.375
Please wait at the port until all this is over.

00:19:37.375 --> 00:19:43.625
Right. We're hoping for Eldia's victory
from the bottom of our hearts.

00:19:43.625 --> 00:19:45.833
Lady Mikasa.

00:19:45.833 --> 00:19:49.750
If anything happens, please escape to my ship.

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:56.625
I appreciate your concern, Lady Kiyomi.
However, I am an Eldian.

00:19:56.625 --> 00:20:02.792
I want the place I was born to have a future.
Don't concern yourself with me.

00:20:02.792 --> 00:20:07.292
What are you talking about?
The whole reason we came was for you!

00:20:07.292 --> 00:20:09.792
Not our resources?

00:20:10.792 --> 00:20:19.000
You don't care who leads the country
as long as the rumbling succeeds, right?

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:27.167
Yes... Unless the rumbling's power is proven,
Hizuru will hang us out to dry.

00:20:27.167 --> 00:20:32.667
Our investments will go to waste
and the Azumabitos will be done for.

00:20:32.667 --> 00:20:35.500
All the more reason I can't rely on you.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:40.042
The Azumabitos had to adapt
to these turbulent times.

00:20:40.042 --> 00:20:47.292
Now, we're best known for being
wretched, money-grubbing vixens.

00:20:47.292 --> 00:20:53.833
Still, we haven't lost our pride in the clan
that your mother passed on to you.

00:20:53.833 --> 00:20:58.792
No matter what comes of the country,
we wish to protect you!

00:21:00.458 --> 00:21:04.000
We're helping Eren when he killed the premier?

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.417
Nobody knows if Eren did it.

00:21:06.417 --> 00:21:11.750
Keep it down, Mikasa.
People suspect us of being Jaegerists.

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:15.125
Whose side are you on anyways, Mikasa?

00:21:15.125 --> 00:21:20.417
Armin and I almost got caught
in the explosion. You have to ask?

00:21:20.417 --> 00:21:22.542
--Huh?
--Enough.

00:21:22.542 --> 00:21:27.375
Like Pyxis was saying,
infighting will be our downfall.

00:21:27.375 --> 00:21:32.125
So you're okay with entrusting
everything to Eren and Zeke?

00:21:32.125 --> 00:21:34.708
No, it's not good.

00:21:34.708 --> 00:21:41.750
Zeke and Yelena took precautions and
were ready for this sort of situation.

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:45.875
We have to expect they took
other precautions, too.

00:21:45.875 --> 00:21:51.667
We need to figure out Zeke's intentions
before he makes fools of us.

00:21:51.667 --> 00:21:55.875
Let's just hope my concerns
turn out to be nothing.

00:21:55.875 --> 00:21:58.083
Something worrying you?

00:21:58.083 --> 00:22:02.750
Yelena secured work for
Marleyan prisoners in odd places.

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:05.500
Like restaurants, for example.

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.125
What a big building!

00:22:07.125 --> 00:22:09.083
I've never seen anything like it!

00:22:09.083 --> 00:22:10.292
Me, either!

00:22:10.292 --> 00:22:12.583
It's yer lucky day, kids!

00:22:12.583 --> 00:22:14.917
Y'all fixin' to eat?

00:22:14.917 --> 00:22:16.333
Yeah!

00:22:24.208 --> 00:22:28.458
Tsk! The military's always in a rush.

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:07.792
Gabi and Falco seek help
from a Marleyan prisoner.

00:24:07.792 --> 00:24:14.250
Does a rewarding future lie beyond
the truth, or something else?

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:17.088
Next episode: "Children of the Forest."
