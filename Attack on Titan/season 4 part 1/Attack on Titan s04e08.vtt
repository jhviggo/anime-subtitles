00:00:30.625 --> 00:00:32.333
Reiner!

00:01:03.042 --> 00:01:04.458
Eren!

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.375
I think the fight's over. We're out of strength.

00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:16.250
At this point, I can't exactly kill Reiner.

00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:22.750
In that case, let's go back home.

00:01:25.042 --> 00:01:27.792
See you later, Reiner.

00:01:45.542 --> 00:01:50.917
Protect the airship from below!
Use every last shot you've got!

00:01:50.917 --> 00:01:56.583
They're retreating... Does this mean we're safe?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.042
They're running.

00:02:03.583 --> 00:02:04.833
Gabi!

00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:09.167
Eren Jaeger!

00:02:09.167 --> 00:02:10.583
Gabi!

00:02:10.583 --> 00:02:14.292
You won't get away! I'm gonna kill you!

00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:48.958
"Assassin's Bullet"

00:04:31.417 --> 00:04:34.167
Damn, you're a filthy sight.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.125
You fall in a pile of shit?

00:04:39.125 --> 00:04:41.458
Eren...

00:04:41.458 --> 00:04:43.500
Captain...

00:04:58.292 --> 00:05:05.250
This brings back memories, Eren.
You have such a kickable face.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.750
After you're all tied up, we'll have a chat.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.125
That's fine, but I explained
everything in the letters.

00:05:15.125 --> 00:05:17.833
Did you not understand it?

00:05:20.167 --> 00:05:26.542
That face... It reminds me of the
rotten shits who lived underground.

00:05:26.542 --> 00:05:30.250
Never thought I'd see it on you.

00:05:31.917 --> 00:05:36.667
Cheer up. Everything happened like you wanted.

00:05:44.875 --> 00:05:48.708
Stop 'em! Kill every last one you can!

00:05:51.625 --> 00:05:57.292
Everybody, in! They've got nothing
to take down an airship!

00:05:57.292 --> 00:05:59.250
Jean!

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.417
You go! I'll hold the rear!

00:06:02.417 --> 00:06:05.083
It's all you, Commander Lobov!

00:06:05.083 --> 00:06:08.833
I told you, I'm a recruit!

00:06:08.833 --> 00:06:12.167
Nobody needs the Garrison anymore!

00:06:13.667 --> 00:06:16.750
Especially not some overpaid geezer!

00:06:18.875 --> 00:06:19.708
Jean!

00:06:19.708 --> 00:06:21.333
Grab on!

00:06:24.625 --> 00:06:25.792
Who's left?

00:06:25.792 --> 00:06:28.292
Still waiting on Lima Squad.

00:06:28.292 --> 00:06:32.000
As far as we know, there're six casualties.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.458
I see... Shit!

00:06:34.458 --> 00:06:38.375
That's nothing compared to the damage we did!

00:06:38.375 --> 00:06:40.250
It's a huge victory!

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:45.000
The New Eldian Empire's
first battle ends in victory!

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.833
--Yeah!
--Yeah!

00:06:48.833 --> 00:06:54.708
Tonight, we celebrate in honor
of our six fallen heroes!

00:06:57.167 --> 00:07:02.542
First battle, huh?
How many more till the fighting ends?

00:07:02.542 --> 00:07:05.667
Just how many have to die?

00:07:09.583 --> 00:07:13.500
Anyways, I'm just glad we survived again.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:19.208
It's not very fair to the others,
but you guys are special...

00:07:19.208 --> 00:07:20.917
...to me.

00:07:26.458 --> 00:07:30.917
That hurts, idiot. Don't hug us
wearing hard-ass gear.

00:07:30.917 --> 00:07:36.750
Excuse me, Jean?! You're the idiot for
always fussing over your tiny-ass beard!

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:37.583
Huh?

00:07:37.583 --> 00:07:41.708
That's right! Why grow a beard
if you can't eat it?

00:07:41.708 --> 00:07:42.625
Huh?!

00:07:42.625 --> 00:07:45.125
Say, are we eating soon?

00:07:45.125 --> 00:07:47.292
Not till we reach the island.

00:07:47.292 --> 00:07:50.833
What a useless leader you are.

00:07:50.833 --> 00:07:52.333
Gabi!

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.458
Gabi, wait!

00:08:10.375 --> 00:08:12.917
C'mon, that's enough.

00:08:12.917 --> 00:08:17.125
They're flying away.
Running after them is pointless.

00:08:17.125 --> 00:08:19.375
Even you know that.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.042
Zofia...

00:08:27.042 --> 00:08:33.333
Zofia's body was crushed under debris.
I was sitting right next to her.

00:08:33.333 --> 00:08:38.917
Udo tried to help her,
but he got trampled by the stampede.

00:08:38.917 --> 00:08:44.042
Stepped on, over and over,
until his head split open.

00:08:44.042 --> 00:08:49.333
And the two gate guards... They stopped me.

00:08:49.333 --> 00:08:52.583
I was trying to run back to the plaza.

00:08:52.583 --> 00:08:58.458
I'm an Eldian, but they told me to
turn back because it's dangerous.

00:08:58.458 --> 00:09:03.250
Then they were shot by a girl
on the roof and died.

00:09:05.708 --> 00:09:12.250
Being an Eldian born in the zone,
people spit at me when I go outside.

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:18.542
I've had a lot of miserable memories,
but that's why I try so hard.

00:09:18.542 --> 00:09:23.208
To show the world that Eldians
are good people!

00:09:23.208 --> 00:09:28.250
So that someday, we could be proud
of our Eldian armbands!

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:34.333
I worked hard believing it could happen!
But they crushed everything!

00:09:34.333 --> 00:09:41.000
This internment zone is my home!
It's where the people I care about live!

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.708
Isn't trampling on it unforgivable?!

00:09:47.292 --> 00:09:52.333
And yet, you're telling me
not to run after them?

00:09:52.333 --> 00:09:57.208
When Zeke was killed before our eyes
and we could do nothing?

00:09:57.208 --> 00:10:00.917
Not knowing why any of this happened?!

00:10:00.917 --> 00:10:07.833
Why, Reiner? Why was my mom eaten by a Titan?

00:10:10.167 --> 00:10:12.292
They were trampled on.

00:10:12.292 --> 00:10:13.708
Huh?

00:10:13.708 --> 00:10:19.208
The enemy was attacked by Marley
Warriors and lots of people died.

00:10:19.208 --> 00:10:21.417
This is revenge.

00:10:23.458 --> 00:10:27.917
Did you... see it happen?

00:10:27.917 --> 00:10:31.625
No, I didn't.

00:10:31.625 --> 00:10:34.958
Neither did I.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:51.250
Besides, they're all just island devils
who threaten world peace.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:57.625
You should know that! They're cruel
devils who've always deserved to die.

00:10:57.625 --> 00:11:00.000
They're nothing like us.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:06.125
Reiner, I'm the same as you.

00:11:06.125 --> 00:11:11.958
Across the sea, within the walls...
It's the same.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:22.417
Lima Squad? That means everyone's aboard.

00:11:22.417 --> 00:11:25.417
Tell the bridge we're good to ascend!

00:11:25.417 --> 00:11:27.083
Roger!

00:11:31.458 --> 00:11:32.792
Huh?

00:11:35.667 --> 00:11:37.208
A kid?!

00:11:45.875 --> 00:11:48.000
It hit!

00:11:56.875 --> 00:12:00.583
It's still attached...

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.125
Gabi!

00:12:05.917 --> 00:12:08.250
What do you think you're doing?!

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:12.000
This trigger... If I pull it...

00:12:15.042 --> 00:12:20.292
Gabi... Don't tell me you're
thinking of boarding it!

00:12:20.292 --> 00:12:22.917
I'm gonna kill those island devils!

00:12:22.917 --> 00:12:26.208
You'll just end up dead, idiot!

00:12:26.208 --> 00:12:31.625
Tell my mom and dad.
Let Reiner and the others know:

00:12:31.625 --> 00:12:35.333
That I fought till the end.

00:12:35.333 --> 00:12:41.125
Even if we don't win today,
you guys will carry on my will.

00:12:41.125 --> 00:12:44.167
Falco! Gabi!

00:12:44.167 --> 00:12:47.333
What the hell are you guys doing?!

00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:49.000
My brother...

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.125
Goodbye, Falco.

00:12:51.125 --> 00:12:55.250
You were one of the good ones.

00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:03.792
You have to rescue Gabi
from the dark future that awaits us.

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:09.750
Falco!

00:13:13.667 --> 00:13:15.458
Falco?!

00:13:16.458 --> 00:13:17.458
Why?!

00:13:17.458 --> 00:13:21.708
The one who should inherit
the Armored Titan... is me!

00:13:21.708 --> 00:13:23.500
Huh?!

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:32.167
Did you hear a sound just now?

00:13:32.167 --> 00:13:34.000
Hey! Quiet down!

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Make some noise! Victory!

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.500
--Yeah!
--Yeah!

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:39.792
Hey!

00:13:39.792 --> 00:13:42.042
Isn't Lobov still out there?

00:13:42.042 --> 00:13:45.667
No, I think he came aboard.

00:14:04.333 --> 00:14:06.167
Sasha!

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
"The military's official bolt-action rifle fires
five shots and can be equipped with the
standard-issue knife as a bayonet. They are used
by Marley's Warrior unit, army, and navy."

00:14:27.292 --> 00:14:29.542
You bastard!

00:14:31.167 --> 00:14:33.625
Sasha! Hey!

00:14:33.625 --> 00:14:36.958
Hang in there! Hey!

00:14:38.292 --> 00:14:42.833
You're so... damn loud...

00:14:44.833 --> 00:14:49.333
Are we... eating soon?

00:14:49.333 --> 00:14:52.333
Bandages, now!
We've gotta stop the bleeding!

00:14:52.333 --> 00:14:53.208
Right!

00:14:53.208 --> 00:14:56.000
Sasha! Make it to the island!

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.375
Meat...

00:15:13.667 --> 00:15:19.042
Jean, they climbed aboard
using Lobov's ODM gear.

00:15:20.542 --> 00:15:24.375
I'll toss 'em outside. All right?

00:15:29.167 --> 00:15:36.333
If we toss kids out of an airship,
will the killing ever end?

00:15:47.375 --> 00:15:49.958
What happened to Braun and Grice?

00:15:49.958 --> 00:15:55.292
They ran off without warning
and never came back.

00:16:00.292 --> 00:16:02.167
Pieck...

00:16:04.083 --> 00:16:09.500
Commander, I remember...

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:16.333
There was a Marley soldier who
led Galliard and me into a trap.

00:16:19.167 --> 00:16:23.708
I remember seeing that
same soldier three years ago.

00:16:23.708 --> 00:16:32.833
They were on the first scout fleet sent
to Paradis after Reiner came back.

00:16:32.833 --> 00:16:35.458
The missing scout ships?

00:16:35.458 --> 00:16:39.667
Yes. I'm sure of it.

00:16:39.667 --> 00:16:43.750
They looked so awful with a beard.

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:47.292
Hey, you gonna wear that forever?

00:16:47.292 --> 00:16:52.042
Huh? I thought it was well-received.

00:16:55.542 --> 00:16:58.125
They're still celebrating?

00:16:58.125 --> 00:17:02.958
Don't touch me, you devils!
We haven't lost yet!

00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:08.208
The rest of our comrades will carry
on the will of War Chief Zeke!

00:17:08.208 --> 00:17:11.000
Gabi, stop!

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.667
What do we do with 'em, Jean?

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:19.000
Us true Eldians are gonna
haunt you till you die!

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.500
Pass that on to your
ringleader after I'm dead!

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.458
I'll take you to him.

00:17:26.458 --> 00:17:30.542
You can tell him exactly what you told me.

00:17:40.125 --> 00:17:43.500
How'd you identify the soldier?

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:50.458
Well, it's someone I had
a particular interest in.

00:17:50.458 --> 00:17:56.417
Because... she's a devout follower of Zeke.

00:17:56.417 --> 00:18:01.042
Gabi... Falco...? Why are you here?

00:18:01.042 --> 00:18:04.167
Why? Why are you?

00:18:04.167 --> 00:18:08.792
You're alive?! Why did you
let them capture you?!

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.083
Who are these kids?

00:18:14.083 --> 00:18:18.833
They killed Lobov and used
his gear to come aboard.

00:18:18.833 --> 00:18:22.250
Sasha was shot by this one here.

00:18:23.625 --> 00:18:27.000
I don't think she's gonna make it.

00:18:33.167 --> 00:18:35.750
It's all you, Onyankopon.

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:37.708
You got it, Hange!

00:18:39.708 --> 00:18:45.792
Well? Did everything play out
as you hoped, Zeke Jaeger?

00:18:47.542 --> 00:18:49.667
Huh?

00:18:49.667 --> 00:18:55.500
For the most part,
but there were a few miscalculations.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.875
Zeke...?

00:18:57.875 --> 00:19:01.750
Huh? Who are these kids?

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:03.167
Miscalculations.

00:19:03.167 --> 00:19:08.167
Yelena! What the hell happened
to trapping the Cart and Jaw?!

00:19:08.167 --> 00:19:10.833
People died because of you!

00:19:10.833 --> 00:19:18.250
I'm sorry. I assure you they fell
down the hole, but it's still my fault.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:24.667
And to cover for that slip-up, the Beast
chucked more rocks at us than planned.

00:19:24.667 --> 00:19:30.917
That was some clever improv for a clown
like you. Wouldn't you say, hairball?

00:19:30.917 --> 00:19:37.125
Don't glare at me like that, Levi.
What if I piss my pants?

00:19:37.125 --> 00:19:44.250
And you're quite the actor yourself,
considering you want to kill me so bad.

00:19:45.458 --> 00:19:50.458
I'm the kind of person
who saves the best bite for last.

00:19:50.458 --> 00:19:53.792
I like to savor the taste.

00:19:54.667 --> 00:20:00.417
We killed the Marley brass
and destroyed their port and fleet.

00:20:00.417 --> 00:20:03.250
That should buy us some time.

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:08.333
Until the whole world launches
a joint attack on Paradis?

00:20:08.333 --> 00:20:14.000
Every time you're caught by the enemy,
we sacrifice lives to get you back.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.917
No matter how many it takes.

00:20:16.917 --> 00:20:22.958
And yet knowing that, you went
so far as to make yourself a hostage.

00:20:22.958 --> 00:20:27.250
Just like you hoped,
we didn't have much choice.

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:33.542
You put your trust in us
and we lost our trust in you.

00:20:33.542 --> 00:20:39.458
But now we have the Founding Titan
and a Titan with royal blood.

00:20:39.458 --> 00:20:46.333
The cost of those sacrifices
will be paid through Eldia's freedom.

00:20:57.542 --> 00:20:59.750
Sasha...

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:01.875
...is dead.

00:21:21.708 --> 00:21:23.833
Conny.

00:21:23.833 --> 00:21:29.875
Did Sasha... have any last words?

00:21:29.875 --> 00:21:33.875
She said... "Meat."

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:49.833
I brought some meat from
the officers' storehouse!

00:21:52.125 --> 00:21:54.042
It'll be fine!

00:21:54.042 --> 00:21:59.042
We can just raise more cattle and sheep
once we retake our land!

00:22:11.833 --> 00:22:19.083
Eren... Sasha only died because you
dragged the Scouts into this.

00:24:02.875 --> 00:24:06.917
Could they have taken some other path?

00:24:06.917 --> 00:24:14.708
Unable to change the past, they must
continue down the one before them.

00:24:14.708 --> 00:24:17.088
Next episode: "Brave Volunteers."
