WEBVTT

00:00:30.072 --> 00:00:32.241
Wh-What the--?

00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:33.742
What was that?

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:35.452
Thunder?

00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:39.122
A Thunder Spear.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.292
But why?

00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:48.841
Let's head in that direction.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.197
It's so... quiet.

00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:17.119
Am I... dying?

00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:25.080
"Above and Below"

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.259
"We'll dine at the same table again soon."

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:42.556
Hasn't it happened just like I said,
Commander Pyxis?

00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:45.309
I appreciate your swift response.

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:53.817
You gathered all soldiers in Shiganshina
and forbade opposition like we asked.

00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:58.405
Given the spinal fluid,
we didn't have much choice.

00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:05.996
Only Shiganshina was evacuated,
and we could become Titans at any minute.

00:04:05.996 --> 00:04:13.003
In any case, what else could I do with
comrades pointing guns at my back?

00:04:13.003 --> 00:04:19.760
I'm sorry, Commander.
My son and I both drank the wine.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.261
Since when did you betray--?

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:24.097
There's no need to answer.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:26.767
Forgive me.

00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:32.481
It seems switching sides sooner
came with advantages.

00:04:32.481 --> 00:04:38.987
That white armband you wear so proudly
is proof you're a Jaegerist, no?

00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:46.870
Red must be for those who learned they drank
tainted wine and were forced to comply.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:55.254
The rest of us fools who drank the wine without
knowing a thing are identified with black.

00:04:55.254 --> 00:04:58.423
Sounds like how Marley does things.

00:04:58.423 --> 00:05:03.929
Didn't they do something similar
when they took over your homelands?

00:05:03.929 --> 00:05:06.515
We can learn a lot from our enemies.

00:05:06.515 --> 00:05:09.226
Such as how to make more of them.

00:05:09.226 --> 00:05:13.897
Was it not your people who
refused to side with us?

00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:20.028
That said, considering we failed to trust
guests who served us tainted wine,

00:05:20.028 --> 00:05:24.449
does that make us foolish or wise?

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.619
You were both foolish and wise.

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:34.543
If you had trusted Zeke and us from the start,
the world might be saved by now.

00:05:34.543 --> 00:05:35.919
Hmm?

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:40.257
"The world might be saved"?

00:05:40.257 --> 00:05:44.636
I was under the impression your plan
was to reunite Zeke and Eren

00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:52.019
for a small-scale rumbling to keep other
nations at bay for the next 50 years.

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:55.397
Won't only the island be saved?

00:05:58.192 --> 00:05:59.318
Yelena?

00:05:59.318 --> 00:06:04.990
It's too late. Zeke gave you plenty of time.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.953
And you answered his mercy
by planning to kill him.

00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:15.626
Zeke is the god who will save the world
and you've earned his wrath.

00:06:17.294 --> 00:06:23.634
So? All we can do is sit here
while it all plays out?

00:06:23.634 --> 00:06:25.594
Care for tea?

00:06:25.594 --> 00:06:26.887
Thanks.

00:06:26.887 --> 00:06:31.642
Armin, could you bust out
of here as a Titan?

00:06:32.684 --> 00:06:36.522
No. I'd just destroy the city.

00:06:36.522 --> 00:06:42.569
Unlike Eren's Titan, the Colossal Titan
can't do something that precise.

00:06:45.656 --> 00:06:52.913
So? Why did Eren beat you to a pulp?
It's about time you tell us.

00:06:54.748 --> 00:06:58.085
He said hurtful things to Mikasa.

00:06:58.085 --> 00:07:01.547
I swung at him and he hit back.

00:07:01.547 --> 00:07:02.422
Huh?

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:05.551
He hurt Mikasa? How?

00:07:05.551 --> 00:07:08.011
--Well--
--Stop.

00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:09.429
It's fine.

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:13.267
No, it's not. What exactly did he say?

00:07:13.267 --> 00:07:19.773
Forget it, Jean. We already
know he's a total piece of shit.

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:26.446
Now he's lost his mind and hurt the
two people he should care about most.

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:31.869
I think if he was sane,
he wouldn't do it without a good reason.

00:07:31.869 --> 00:07:36.039
Do you think there's some sort
of meaning behind it?

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:42.838
Long time no see, heroes of Shiganshina.

00:07:42.838 --> 00:07:47.426
It pains me to reunite in a place like this.

00:07:47.426 --> 00:07:51.972
Hey! You're on their side, too?! Let us out!

00:07:51.972 --> 00:07:57.895
That's a lot to ask, considering
you guys put me on house arrest.

00:07:57.895 --> 00:08:02.524
Just sit quiet and behave
until Zeke and Eren meet.

00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:03.859
You...!

00:08:03.859 --> 00:08:06.612
Must be nice, Yelena.

00:08:06.612 --> 00:08:09.948
Everything went exactly how you planned.

00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:13.452
Through you, Eren moved how Zeke wanted.

00:08:13.452 --> 00:08:21.835
Raiding Marley, getting people's support,
using wine to take over the military...

00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:25.464
Now, Eldia and the Founding Titan are yours.

00:08:25.464 --> 00:08:28.967
You can crush Marley
and avenge your homelands.

00:08:28.967 --> 00:08:33.180
Isn't that the real reason
you came to the island?

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:37.893
This place was primitive.
We brought it out of the past.

00:08:37.893 --> 00:08:38.769
Eh?!

00:08:38.769 --> 00:08:44.733
So you and your pals could enjoy it.
Once you ruled, that is.

00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:48.278
You were tricked and lost. That's all it is.

00:08:48.278 --> 00:08:55.577
Greiz! Looks like you sold us out to get
promoted to Yelena's lackey, you snitch!

00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:57.746
Are you dumb?

00:08:57.746 --> 00:09:01.792
It's you who sided with
the devils and betrayed us!

00:09:01.792 --> 00:09:02.793
What?

00:09:02.793 --> 00:09:07.965
You had the hots for some devil spawn
who reeked of potatoes!

00:09:08.924 --> 00:09:10.092
I'm gonna kill you!

00:09:10.092 --> 00:09:11.385
Chill, Nicolo!

00:09:11.385 --> 00:09:14.888
You wouldn't shut up about her, day and night.

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:18.767
Stupid me thought you'd
get a grip when the bitch died.

00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:20.310
What'd you say?!

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:25.190
I'll make it easy to understand.
That spawn-of-the-devil whore was--

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.237
Yelena?!

00:09:30.237 --> 00:09:32.990
I apologize for his disrespect.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:38.287
This island has no need for
those who would call you devils.

00:09:38.287 --> 00:09:46.044
Believe me, our true goal is nothing
as hollow as getting revenge on Marley.

00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:53.135
Our goal is to end the cycle of hatred
to save Eldia and even Marley.

00:09:53.135 --> 00:09:56.555
No more secrets. I'll tell you everything--

00:09:56.555 --> 00:10:01.894
about Zeke's plan to save the world:
His "euthanization" plan.

00:10:06.023 --> 00:10:10.861
They're devils, though. So, why am I...?

00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:17.534
Hey, brat who killed Sasha.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.037
What do you want?

00:10:20.037 --> 00:10:23.290
If you wanna save Falco, help me.

00:10:26.168 --> 00:10:30.631
Help... you? How?

00:10:30.631 --> 00:10:36.929
Call for help on the radio to
flush out intruders in the walls.

00:10:38.055 --> 00:10:41.558
Don't move. Keep quiet, Gabi.

00:10:43.769 --> 00:10:46.104
--Pieck!
--Quiet.

00:10:47.022 --> 00:10:53.070
I take it you're Eren Jaeger, correct?

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:58.075
"Shiganshina District, where the Operation to
Retake the Founding Titan began. The operation
failed and the hole in the wall was plugged.
The current state of the district is unknown."

00:11:00.452 --> 00:11:04.248
Gabi, aim the rifle at Eren.

00:11:06.792 --> 00:11:08.168
Gabi!

00:11:12.673 --> 00:11:16.134
Eren, hands out of your pockets.

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:18.387
And what if I refuse?

00:11:18.387 --> 00:11:22.808
I pull the trigger and
your brains hit the floor.

00:11:22.808 --> 00:11:26.144
Ever seen it? No time to transform.

00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:32.818
And? Why don't you pull it?
If not, why else are you here?

00:11:32.818 --> 00:11:35.112
What happens if I don't listen?

00:11:35.112 --> 00:11:39.157
That's something you'll never know.
Once your brains hit--

00:11:39.157 --> 00:11:42.286
I do know. You won't shoot.

00:11:42.286 --> 00:11:46.331
You aren't allowed to kill the Founding Titan.

00:11:46.331 --> 00:11:49.960
Your orders are just to retake it.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:56.758
But for that, you'll have to turn into
a Titan and eat me alive, right?

00:11:56.758 --> 00:11:58.218
Pieck!

00:11:59.845 --> 00:12:03.807
Gabi, take your finger off the trigger.

00:12:03.807 --> 00:12:08.353
You're not the only one who
would pay for defying the military.

00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:11.273
Your family in the zone would, too.

00:12:14.318 --> 00:12:21.700
Yeah, I won't shoot. And eating you
doesn't seem possible either, so...

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:23.285
Pieck?

00:12:23.285 --> 00:12:28.081
You found my Titan footprints
from when I invaded, right?

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:34.838
I thought I did well sneaking
into your midst without being caught.

00:12:34.838 --> 00:12:38.050
But I have other reasons for not shooting.

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:43.722
If you used the Founding Titan's power,
couldn't you defeat Marley?

00:12:45.849 --> 00:12:51.021
You wouldn't make the world your
enemy unless you knew you could win.

00:12:51.021 --> 00:12:55.150
Do you have something more
than the Founding Titan?

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:57.653
Pieck, what are you...?

00:12:57.653 --> 00:13:01.365
Gabi, put down the rifle.

00:13:01.365 --> 00:13:04.368
Supposing I did, what's your goal?

00:13:04.368 --> 00:13:09.581
To free all Eldians in Marley
and around the world.

00:13:09.581 --> 00:13:14.503
I want to free my family
in the internment zone.

00:13:14.503 --> 00:13:21.093
I became a Warrior to get my dad,
my only family, proper medical care.

00:13:21.093 --> 00:13:28.058
He survived, but he's incredibly sad
knowing my term will soon be over.

00:13:28.058 --> 00:13:35.482
Before I die and leave him behind, I want
to show him Eldia has a bright future.

00:13:35.482 --> 00:13:42.155
For that, Marley needs to be crushed.
I'll help however I can.

00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:46.785
If we can slaughter Marley,
I'll do whatever it takes.

00:13:51.665 --> 00:13:57.087
The mastermind of the attack
on Marley... was Zeke.

00:13:57.087 --> 00:14:02.092
Now, you? What have we been fighting for?!

00:14:02.092 --> 00:14:09.933
Once the world knows that we're good
Eldians, won't they let us go free?!

00:14:09.933 --> 00:14:13.312
You're the same as Zeke--a traitor!

00:14:13.312 --> 00:14:14.730
Gabi.

00:14:15.898 --> 00:14:22.571
Are we Marleyans or are we Eldians?
What do you think?

00:14:22.571 --> 00:14:25.824
We're... Honorary Marleyans.

00:14:25.824 --> 00:14:32.998
Wrong. We are Subjects of Ymir.
That's the one truth we can't escape.

00:14:32.998 --> 00:14:38.170
No matter what we're called,
we're a race that turns into Titans.

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:43.342
But like we saw at Fort Slava,
Titan power is on its way out.

00:14:43.342 --> 00:14:49.598
As soon as Marley can't use us,
they'll slaughter us all.

00:14:49.598 --> 00:14:55.938
Even if we prove we're "good Eldians,"
there's zero chance that we're freed.

00:14:55.938 --> 00:15:00.859
We have to secure our right
to live with our own hands.

00:15:02.194 --> 00:15:09.910
Prove it. If you're going to cooperate
with us, show us you mean it.

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:12.746
I'll show you where my comrades are.

00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:13.497
Wha--?!

00:15:13.497 --> 00:15:14.748
How?

00:15:14.748 --> 00:15:19.211
If we go to the roof,
I can point out where they are.

00:15:21.088 --> 00:15:23.298
Fine.

00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:26.134
Stop children from being born?

00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:30.514
Correct. That's Zeke's euthanization plan.

00:15:30.514 --> 00:15:36.812
All suffering brought about by Titans
will disappear from the world.

00:15:36.812 --> 00:15:39.481
Gradually. Peacefully.

00:15:39.481 --> 00:15:42.401
Wait. How is that peaceful?

00:15:42.401 --> 00:15:49.157
If Subjects of Ymir slowly die out,
we'll only have geezers to defend in the end.

00:15:49.157 --> 00:15:53.579
How do we protect ourselves?
You think they'll leave us alone?

00:15:53.579 --> 00:15:58.625
The rumbling can serve as a deterrent
as long as the Founding Titan

00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:02.212
and the royal bloodline are preserved.

00:16:02.212 --> 00:16:06.592
Fortunately, Queen Historia
was blessed with an heir.

00:16:06.592 --> 00:16:12.764
As long as Subjects of Ymir inherit the
Founder until her child passes away...

00:16:12.764 --> 00:16:16.435
You talk like this is a sure thing.

00:16:16.435 --> 00:16:21.732
Sure things... Certainties...
No nation can claim to have them.

00:16:21.732 --> 00:16:25.903
Each one has its own share of problems.

00:16:25.903 --> 00:16:30.782
But there is one certainty,
and that's the threat of Titans.

00:16:30.782 --> 00:16:38.290
Their history of tears and bloodshed
will be put to an end... by Zeke and Eren.

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:41.793
I don't know how long humanity will last,

00:16:41.793 --> 00:16:46.924
but it's hard to think that a greater
feat will ever come to pass.

00:16:46.924 --> 00:16:53.013
People will speak of the brothers
as legends for millennia to come.

00:16:53.013 --> 00:16:56.141
Like the gods of the past.

00:16:56.141 --> 00:17:01.980
Even after their deaths, they'll be seen
as saviors who shone over humanity.

00:17:05.484 --> 00:17:06.944
Something wrong?

00:17:06.944 --> 00:17:12.282
No... But to think your cause was so noble...

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.995
It touched my heart!

00:17:16.995 --> 00:17:19.706
That's wonderful.

00:17:19.706 --> 00:17:23.001
I'm glad to know you understand.

00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:24.837
Yelena!

00:17:24.837 --> 00:17:28.006
Come quick! Invaders!

00:17:28.006 --> 00:17:30.551
--The enemy's here!
--Someone was killed!

00:17:30.551 --> 00:17:32.386
It's the Cart Titan!

00:17:32.386 --> 00:17:35.347
--What?!
--Did she betray Marley?

00:17:35.347 --> 00:17:37.266
That's what Jaeger said.

00:17:37.266 --> 00:17:40.602
Hmm? What's all the ruckus about?

00:17:42.563 --> 00:17:47.025
Is it safe to say you and I are allies now?

00:17:47.025 --> 00:17:50.737
If you can point out the other invaders.

00:17:50.737 --> 00:17:54.032
Until then, you'll be cuffed to the Marley kid.

00:17:54.032 --> 00:17:59.121
If you try to transform, she'll bite the dust.

00:17:59.121 --> 00:18:04.042
Don't worry. This kid will
come around soon enough.

00:18:05.544 --> 00:18:07.212
--That bitty thing is a Marley soldier?

00:18:07.212 --> 00:18:09.464
--She's an ally?
--That bitty thing is a Marley soldier?

00:18:09.464 --> 00:18:11.717
Hi there!

00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:20.684
Hey... Where is Falco?

00:18:20.684 --> 00:18:27.941
Falco's here, too. But it seems he
drank some of Zeke's spinal fluid.

00:18:27.941 --> 00:18:29.276
How?

00:18:29.276 --> 00:18:36.116
Who knows? They're saying the wine
with spinal fluid got in his mouth.

00:18:36.116 --> 00:18:39.286
--Is that when...?
--Gabi?

00:18:39.286 --> 00:18:43.707
It's my fault... again.

00:18:43.707 --> 00:18:49.213
I see. You took over the military
with Zeke's spinal fluid.

00:18:49.213 --> 00:18:53.842
Do you know why Zeke
even has an ability like that?

00:18:53.842 --> 00:18:58.013
Beats me. Do you know?

00:18:58.013 --> 00:19:02.976
No. Other than Zeke himself, nobody does.

00:19:04.853 --> 00:19:10.943
Ever since I met him, I felt like
Zeke was telling lie after lie.

00:19:10.943 --> 00:19:14.446
Four years ago, I confirmed that hunch.

00:19:14.446 --> 00:19:19.326
Only with you did his words seem true.

00:19:19.326 --> 00:19:24.331
"Believe me, I know what you're
going through, Eren.

00:19:24.331 --> 00:19:28.085
Someday, I'm coming back to rescue you."

00:19:29.378 --> 00:19:34.341
If anyone, I thought he'd tell you
about his secret power.

00:19:34.341 --> 00:19:40.889
For example, like it can draw out the
Founding Titan's power or something.

00:19:45.936 --> 00:19:51.984
Oh? You shaved your beard?
I thought it suited you.

00:19:55.779 --> 00:20:00.826
Eren, it's not safe to trust that woman.

00:20:00.826 --> 00:20:05.622
Yeah. I don't trust her,
either, but it's mutual.

00:20:11.545 --> 00:20:17.759
By the way, aren't you using the
Founding Titan's power? Where's Zeke?

00:20:17.759 --> 00:20:20.095
You'll find out soon enough.

00:20:21.763 --> 00:20:25.601
Show me. Where is the enemy?

00:20:42.242 --> 00:20:43.911
There.

00:21:18.737 --> 00:21:20.155
What the--?!

00:21:21.156 --> 00:21:23.867
It's begun.

00:21:23.867 --> 00:21:27.913
The Titans... have started to move.

00:21:31.416 --> 00:21:33.669
Galliard!

00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:36.255
I knew it wouldn't be easy.

00:21:36.255 --> 00:21:39.007
Pieck! You're not a traitor?!

00:21:39.007 --> 00:21:42.261
Gabi! You thought I'd sell out my comrades?

00:21:42.261 --> 00:21:46.265
But you said we have no future
fighting for Marley!

00:21:46.265 --> 00:21:47.641
Look.

00:21:51.228 --> 00:21:54.398
I don't trust Marley.

00:21:54.398 --> 00:21:59.236
But I do trust the comrades
I've fought alongside.

00:22:02.364 --> 00:22:04.575
There's the smoke signal.

00:22:04.575 --> 00:22:08.829
Pieck and Galliard have exposed his location.

00:22:08.829 --> 00:22:11.081
It's the Founding Titan.

00:22:13.417 --> 00:22:16.086
Go get revenge for Liberio!

00:22:16.086 --> 00:22:18.881
Let's put an end to this guy.

00:22:22.843 --> 00:22:24.595
Bring it on...

00:22:27.639 --> 00:24:02.070
...Reiner!
