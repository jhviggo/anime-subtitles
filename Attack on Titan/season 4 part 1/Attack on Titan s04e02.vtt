WEBVTT

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.250
Four years we wasted squabbling
over a peninsula's sovereignty.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.542
And our two main battle Titans were
nearly shredded by the enemy fleet.

00:00:28.542 --> 00:00:34.458
"Human ingenuity surpasses
and shatters Marley's Armor at last."

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:39.958
The press from other nations
is commending the Mid-East Forces.

00:00:39.958 --> 00:00:44.000
Does this sound like a victory
for Marley to you?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.042
Magath, do you care to comment?

00:00:47.042 --> 00:00:50.625
General, I'm afraid the time has come.

00:00:50.625 --> 00:00:55.042
That is, humanity has eclipsed
the Power of the Titans.

00:00:55.042 --> 00:01:00.333
While we've been relying heavily
on Titans and colonial expansion,

00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:04.917
other nations have been developing
weapons to counter us.

00:01:04.917 --> 00:01:09.542
As a result, our strategy has
come back to bite us on the ass.

00:01:09.542 --> 00:01:15.792
For the time being, our Titans remain
unrivaled when it comes to land battles.

00:01:15.792 --> 00:01:22.542
However, if aircraft keep advancing at
this rate, bombs will soon fall like rain.

00:01:22.542 --> 00:01:29.708
All while Titans, the devils of the earth,
can do nothing but look up and watch.

00:01:33.625 --> 00:01:37.583
Do we not have any Titans with wings?

00:01:37.583 --> 00:01:40.833
General, I'm trying to say
that the era of Titans--

00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:42.417
I know.

00:01:42.417 --> 00:01:46.458
In the near future,
we will lose our initiative in war.

00:01:46.458 --> 00:01:49.375
No, perhaps we already have.

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:56.333
Though once the heroes who crushed
the Eldian devils, look at what we've become.

00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:58.875
If I may, General?

00:01:58.875 --> 00:02:01.833
Requesting permission to give counsel.

00:02:01.833 --> 00:02:06.250
Zeke, the wonderboy. Go ahead.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.250
We should resume the Paradis Island Operation
and recover the Founding Titan.

00:02:13.583 --> 00:02:20.208
As Commander Magath was saying,
Marley needs to develop better weapons.

00:02:20.208 --> 00:02:25.167
However, the world will not stand by and wait.

00:02:25.167 --> 00:02:29.125
Our military needs time
to completely restructure.

00:02:29.125 --> 00:02:33.167
But for that, the newspapers
of the world must read this:

00:02:33.167 --> 00:02:38.542
"Marley Occupies Paradis
and Wields the Power of All Titans."

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.375
You have one year left
in your term, correct?

00:02:44.375 --> 00:02:50.958
Yes, and I'm concerned that Colt can't
inherit the full power of the Beast Titan.

00:02:52.792 --> 00:02:54.292
I see.

00:02:54.292 --> 00:03:00.167
In your last year, you wish to redeem
yourself for your defeat four years ago?

00:03:00.167 --> 00:03:02.333
That is correct.

00:03:02.333 --> 00:03:07.417
The sick exploits of Grisha Jaeger
should be brought to an end

00:03:07.417 --> 00:03:11.417
by none other than me, his former son.

00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:45.958
"Midnight Train"

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.750
Sorry I bashed you to further my agenda, Colt.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.750
Don't be. You were amazing.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.667
To think, an Eldian being heard by the general!

00:05:03.667 --> 00:05:07.417
There hasn't been a Beast
like you in its history.

00:05:07.417 --> 00:05:11.375
Sometimes it reminds me
of the Founding Titan.

00:05:11.375 --> 00:05:16.708
Why are you so special?
It's not like you have any royal blood.

00:05:16.708 --> 00:05:21.417
Who knows? Guess I'll be dead
before we figure it out.

00:05:21.417 --> 00:05:27.708
Oh... But when you inherit my memories,
you'll find out my big secret.

00:05:27.708 --> 00:05:30.000
Secret? What is it?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.792
The special way I wipe my ass.
Hope you don't tell anyone.

00:05:34.792 --> 00:05:36.792
Too late. I want a report.

00:05:36.792 --> 00:05:38.042
--Commander!
--Commander!

00:05:38.042 --> 00:05:43.500
Everything down to the hairs on your ass.
Do you think Eldians get privacy?

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.458
No, sir!

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.833
You can conquer Paradis in a year?

00:05:51.833 --> 00:05:56.250
It's more like I only have
one year left to try.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:02.083
These past three years, every scout ship
we've sent to Paradis hasn't returned.

00:06:02.083 --> 00:06:05.208
Zeke, what do you think of that?

00:06:05.208 --> 00:06:12.125
Considering 32 ships were sunk, I can't
imagine a single Titan was responsible.

00:06:12.125 --> 00:06:19.000
At least two Titans, including Eren Jaeger,
must have blocked their escape.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.292
I agree. If we attack the island,
our ships will need support.

00:06:24.292 --> 00:06:29.792
Yes. But it's more than their Titans
that pose a threat.

00:06:35.083 --> 00:06:36.375
Wai--

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:46.250
It seemed like you were having a
good dream, so I didn't wake you.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:51.417
I still haven't thanked you
for back then. Galliard...

00:06:51.417 --> 00:06:53.083
Thank you.

00:06:53.083 --> 00:06:55.292
Don't thank me.

00:06:55.292 --> 00:07:01.917
If I inherited the Armored Titan nine
years ago, this wouldn't have happened.

00:07:01.917 --> 00:07:07.167
My brother wouldn't have protected you
and been eaten by a Titan, either.

00:07:07.167 --> 00:07:09.167
You saw Marcel's memories?

00:07:09.167 --> 00:07:15.417
No, but I learned enough from
that girl before me, Ymir.

00:07:15.417 --> 00:07:19.750
What an impressive name
for such a pitiful woman.

00:07:21.042 --> 00:07:25.167
Isn't it thanks to her that we
got my brother's Jaw back?

00:07:25.167 --> 00:07:27.750
Yeah, that's right.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:31.125
What the hell were you doing on that island?

00:07:31.125 --> 00:07:34.042
Getting saved by someone new every day?

00:07:34.042 --> 00:07:34.917
Yeah.

00:07:34.917 --> 00:07:37.958
I saw how you acted through her memories.

00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:43.042
What's with that?
Pretending to be a reliable guy, huh?

00:07:43.042 --> 00:07:45.583
I'd say you were imitating my brother!

00:07:45.583 --> 00:07:50.250
Pock, let's not pick on people
who just took cannons to the face.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.042
Quit calling me that, Pieck.

00:07:53.042 --> 00:07:54.250
You all right?

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:57.375
It's been two months
since I've been a human.

00:07:57.375 --> 00:08:00.958
I kinda forgot the whole bipedal thing.

00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:04.833
By the way, Reiner...
You oughta see Gabi and the others.

00:08:04.833 --> 00:08:07.083
They're worried about you.

00:08:07.083 --> 00:08:08.875
Think I will.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.208
I'm pooped.

00:08:16.208 --> 00:08:18.833
Feels like ages since I've seen you.

00:08:18.833 --> 00:08:22.958
Really? Even though we're
always fighting together?

00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:26.250
Well, we might not have to for a while.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:29.167
Let's hope so.

00:08:31.417 --> 00:08:33.500
--This way.
--Sure.

00:08:34.792 --> 00:08:39.083
Hey, if Titans lose their usefulness in battle,

00:08:39.083 --> 00:08:43.708
what will happen to the
Warrior unit and us Eldians?

00:08:45.792 --> 00:08:46.958
--A guy that lives near me said
the sea is so salty 'cuz he pisses in it.

00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:49.125
--Mr. Braun will be fine.
--A guy that lives near me said
the sea is so salty 'cuz he pisses in it.

00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:50.708
--I know.
--A guy that lives near me said
the sea is so salty 'cuz he pisses in it.

00:08:50.708 --> 00:08:53.458
--Huh? That's...
--A guy that lives near me said
the sea is so salty 'cuz he pisses in it.

00:08:55.667 --> 00:09:00.667
They're probably enemy soldiers
that survived the Pure Titan attack.

00:09:00.667 --> 00:09:05.375
Once they get home, they'll talk about
how inhumane Titan warfare is!

00:09:05.375 --> 00:09:09.292
It'll just make things
even worse for us Eldians!

00:09:09.292 --> 00:09:13.333
"People of the world!
Let us kill the Subjects of Ymir!"

00:09:15.375 --> 00:09:17.583
--Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

00:09:17.583 --> 00:09:20.167
--Cut it out, Udo.
--Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

00:09:20.167 --> 00:09:22.542
Don't beat up the city.

00:09:22.542 --> 00:09:24.417
Reiner!

00:09:24.417 --> 00:09:26.208
You're okay to walk?!

00:09:26.208 --> 00:09:29.292
Yeah. Are you guys all right?

00:09:29.292 --> 00:09:31.083
--Gabi.
--Yup!

00:09:31.083 --> 00:09:33.292
--Udo.
--I guess.

00:09:33.292 --> 00:09:36.500
--Zofia.
--Same old.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.292
Falco.

00:09:38.292 --> 00:09:39.083
Hello.

00:09:39.083 --> 00:09:43.083
Hey! They said we're going back to Liberio!

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:44.917
Let's walk around till then!

00:09:44.917 --> 00:09:45.875
Hey!

00:09:45.875 --> 00:09:47.083
We never get chances like this!

00:09:47.083 --> 00:09:50.458
Shouldn't Mr. Braun be resting?

00:09:52.708 --> 00:09:55.625
I'm all right. Don't worry.

00:09:55.625 --> 00:09:57.708
<i>You </i>go home and rest!

00:09:57.708 --> 00:09:59.542
I'm coming, too!

00:09:59.542 --> 00:10:03.292
Hold up, Gabi. Commander Magath
said that's not a place kids--

00:10:03.292 --> 00:10:06.542
But I just saw him walking that way.

00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:10.000
You worrywart.

00:10:15.125 --> 00:10:16.083
Wait!

00:10:16.083 --> 00:10:17.250
Huh?

00:10:22.167 --> 00:10:24.708
You kids are too young for that store.

00:10:24.708 --> 00:10:26.917
Aww!

00:10:30.875 --> 00:10:35.792
Did you guys witness the bravery
of our Eldian goddess?!

00:10:35.792 --> 00:10:40.667
Gabi took on the armored train
in place of 800 Eldian soldiers!

00:10:40.667 --> 00:10:43.083
Man, Colt! You stink of booze!

00:10:43.083 --> 00:10:46.375
Why'd you do it, you big idiot?!

00:10:46.375 --> 00:10:52.250
Comrades! Do you have any idea
why this idiot risked her life?!

00:10:52.250 --> 00:11:00.042
Well, I do! She did it to save
all your asses in the Eldian unit!

00:11:00.042 --> 00:11:03.458
Yeah!

00:11:03.458 --> 00:11:05.875
I'll go shut 'em up.

00:11:05.875 --> 00:11:07.750
Let 'em have it.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.083
Just this one night.

00:11:12.458 --> 00:11:16.375
--Gabi! Gabi! Gabi...!
--Me! Me! Me...!

00:11:16.375 --> 00:11:18.958
They're lifting her up again.

00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.792
They shouldn't let my brother drink.

00:11:21.792 --> 00:11:24.833
And Gabi gets carried away too easily.

00:11:24.833 --> 00:11:30.708
Still, it's looking like she'll be the one
who inherits the Armored Titan.

00:11:30.708 --> 00:11:35.792
Yeah. The girl who adores you
will inherit your Titan...

00:11:35.792 --> 00:11:38.542
...and will live till she's 27.

00:11:39.458 --> 00:11:43.500
If cannons don't shred her first, that is.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.875
Are you fine with that?

00:11:47.417 --> 00:11:53.917
What did you say? Are you insulting
the honor of inheriting one of the Nine?

00:11:53.917 --> 00:11:59.292
If I report this, you and your whole
family will become Titan weapons.

00:11:59.292 --> 00:12:03.583
W-Wait! Let me rephrase what I said!

00:12:03.583 --> 00:12:09.167
I, Falco Grice, hope to be freed from
the evil blood of Ymir and my ancestors!

00:12:09.167 --> 00:12:11.417
I pledge my life to Marley!

00:12:11.417 --> 00:12:15.458
And what about the honor
of inheriting one of the Nine?

00:12:15.458 --> 00:12:18.500
I would be proud to be an Honorary Marleyan

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:23.208
and be given the chance to display
my loyalty to our motherland!

00:12:23.208 --> 00:12:26.250
Do you want to inherit the Armored?

00:12:28.583 --> 00:12:31.667
Thank you!

00:12:31.667 --> 00:12:34.500
The one who should inherit it... is me!

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:35.458
Yes.

00:12:35.458 --> 00:12:37.333
Huh?

00:12:37.333 --> 00:12:42.917
You have to rescue Gabi from
the dark future that awaits us.

00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:49.958
"Armbands are used to differentiate the Eldian
'devils.' It is mandatory for Eldians in Marley
to wear their armband when they go outside.
Failure to do so will result in punishment."

00:13:01.208 --> 00:13:03.333
We're back!

00:13:03.333 --> 00:13:05.625
We made it back alive!

00:13:05.625 --> 00:13:08.833
It's our beloved hometown, Liberio!

00:13:08.833 --> 00:13:10.292
--We're home!

00:13:10.292 --> 00:13:11.708
--Gabi...
--We're home!

00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:14.167
Could you please tone it down?

00:13:14.167 --> 00:13:15.792
Ow, ow...

00:13:15.792 --> 00:13:20.375
You should've known
you can't hold your booze.

00:13:20.375 --> 00:13:23.458
Who's the one who gave him the drinks?

00:13:23.458 --> 00:13:25.917
He looked like he wanted some.

00:13:25.917 --> 00:13:31.083
Unbelievable. How dare you spew
Pieck's kindness all over the train.

00:13:31.083 --> 00:13:34.125
We should've shut 'em up last night.

00:13:35.167 --> 00:13:37.833
I heard they kept hoisting you up.

00:13:37.833 --> 00:13:39.375
Because of Colt!

00:13:39.375 --> 00:13:45.750
I think it's fine. You deserved a bit of fun.
What you did was impressive.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.625
Pieck!

00:13:49.792 --> 00:13:52.542
Vice Chief Braun...

00:13:52.542 --> 00:13:59.125
What if he's thinking the same as me...
and he wants us Eldians to be free from war?

00:14:00.125 --> 00:14:03.417
Can I... trust him?

00:14:11.333 --> 00:14:14.625
Later. Take it easy and enjoy the break.

00:14:14.625 --> 00:14:17.542
Not me! It's back to training tomorrow!

00:14:17.542 --> 00:14:21.083
Trying to boost your grades? Gimme a break.

00:14:21.083 --> 00:14:22.625
I am not!

00:14:22.625 --> 00:14:26.875
Hey, you two. Don't push yourselves too hard.

00:14:38.125 --> 00:14:39.625
Dad!

00:14:43.833 --> 00:14:45.083
Zeke...

00:14:45.083 --> 00:14:47.833
Grandpa! Grandma!

00:14:47.833 --> 00:14:49.750
I'm home!

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:52.292
You achieved great things, Zeke.

00:14:52.292 --> 00:14:54.500
No, not yet.

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.250
Colt! Falco!

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:57.958
Colt!

00:14:57.958 --> 00:15:00.417
Dad! Mom!

00:15:00.417 --> 00:15:02.542
--Gabi!
--Gabi!

00:15:05.292 --> 00:15:06.792
Reiner.

00:15:07.792 --> 00:15:11.542
You must be tired. Come home and rest.

00:15:11.542 --> 00:15:15.625
Mom... I think I will.

00:15:18.292 --> 00:15:19.625
Go on ahead!

00:15:19.625 --> 00:15:24.250
For crying out loud!
Do you not know how to stand?

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:26.625
Are they injured soldiers, Mr. Koslow?

00:15:26.625 --> 00:15:29.708
Huh? Stay outta the way, brat.

00:15:29.708 --> 00:15:32.708
They're Eldians with emotional trauma.

00:15:32.708 --> 00:15:34.292
Even our guys?!

00:15:34.292 --> 00:15:38.083
It's from digging trenches
on the front lines too long.

00:15:38.083 --> 00:15:41.458
All those bullets and bombs do it to you.

00:15:43.375 --> 00:15:45.000
Boom!

00:15:46.583 --> 00:15:49.250
Look! They fell over again!

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:52.500
You okay? It's all right!

00:15:53.583 --> 00:15:56.167
Your armband's on the wrong arm.

00:15:56.167 --> 00:16:02.917
It's okay. I'm sure you'll get better.
You don't have to fight anymore.

00:16:02.917 --> 00:16:04.333
Boom!

00:16:04.333 --> 00:16:05.667
Whoa!

00:16:05.667 --> 00:16:09.792
Just like I planned, I blew the
armored train right off the tracks!

00:16:09.792 --> 00:16:14.792
It actually worked! But as I ran away,
they fired a machine gun at me!

00:16:14.792 --> 00:16:17.375
And just before I ate lead...

00:16:17.375 --> 00:16:21.000
...Galliard protected me with the Jaw Titan!

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.750
Amazing, Gabi!

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:29.458
You and your bravery saved a bunch
of our soldiers! You're the savior of Eldia!

00:16:29.458 --> 00:16:32.000
I'm so proud of you!

00:16:33.083 --> 00:16:37.375
Reiner. Do you think Gabi
will become a Warrior?

00:16:37.375 --> 00:16:42.750
Yeah. It's almost a given she'll
inherit the Armored Titan.

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:44.708
That's good to hear.

00:16:44.708 --> 00:16:49.667
To think our family would have
two Warriors. I'm so proud.

00:16:49.667 --> 00:16:57.625
If only those island devils disappeared,
we Eldians could finally be happy.

00:16:57.625 --> 00:17:03.167
But, Reiner... Even you barely escaped
from the island devils, right?

00:17:03.167 --> 00:17:05.125
Don't, Dad!

00:17:05.125 --> 00:17:09.875
He survived on that island
of rotten devils for five years!

00:17:09.875 --> 00:17:15.042
Even if it wasn't classified,
it's stuff he wouldn't wanna talk about.

00:17:15.042 --> 00:17:19.208
You're right. Forgive me, nephew.

00:17:19.208 --> 00:17:22.667
No, I can talk about it.

00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:25.792
I infiltrated their military.

00:17:25.792 --> 00:17:30.833
Every last one of 'em
was a savage, heartless devil.

00:17:30.833 --> 00:17:35.042
During the entrance ceremony,
one of them started eating a potato.

00:17:35.042 --> 00:17:39.042
The instructor yelled at them,
but they hardly seemed to care.

00:17:39.042 --> 00:17:41.875
Said they stole it 'cuz it looked tasty.

00:17:41.875 --> 00:17:47.917
Realizing they crossed the line,
they said they'd share half with him.

00:17:47.917 --> 00:17:52.875
But the piece of potato they offered
wasn't even close to half.

00:17:52.875 --> 00:17:56.250
Being considerate doesn't
even cross their minds.

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.542
They're truly beyond all help.

00:17:59.542 --> 00:18:03.750
There was an idiot who forgot
why he went to the bathroom...

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:07.042
An insincere jerk who only
thought about himself...

00:18:07.042 --> 00:18:10.375
An uptight oaf who only
cared what others thought...

00:18:10.375 --> 00:18:15.917
A single-minded fool who charged ahead
and the chumps who followed him...

00:18:15.917 --> 00:18:18.500
There were all sorts of people there.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.792
And we were there, too.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.125
My days there were true hell.

00:18:30.917 --> 00:18:34.708
I've said too much. Forget it.

00:18:34.708 --> 00:18:39.667
What do you mean, "all sorts of people"?
They're bad people, right?

00:18:39.667 --> 00:18:45.000
That's right, Gabi. Those island devils
turned our world into hell.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.333
There's no knowing when they'll attack
with giant Titans and flatten the world.

00:18:50.333 --> 00:18:55.333
It's up to good Eldians like us
to make sure they never do.

00:18:55.333 --> 00:18:56.417
Mmm.

00:18:56.417 --> 00:19:02.375
Those who left us and fled to the
island deserved to be punished.

00:19:02.375 --> 00:19:05.292
They're the ones who abandoned us.

00:19:13.042 --> 00:19:16.625
What's wrong, Gabi? You seem down.

00:19:16.625 --> 00:19:19.333
Aunt Karina's worried about you.

00:19:19.333 --> 00:19:24.583
She says you changed after
coming back from the island alone.

00:19:24.583 --> 00:19:30.458
Her 12-year-old son came back a grown man.
You can't really blame her.

00:19:30.458 --> 00:19:32.750
It feels like you're lying.

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:35.375
Lying? About what?

00:19:35.375 --> 00:19:40.458
I don't know, but I think Aunt Karina does.

00:19:40.458 --> 00:19:41.708
I heard it was a soldier.

00:19:41.708 --> 00:19:44.042
That's awful.

00:19:45.583 --> 00:19:47.333
Good morning.

00:19:47.333 --> 00:19:49.167
Everyone's here?

00:19:49.167 --> 00:19:53.708
It's not every day we meet
in the war chief's room.

00:19:53.708 --> 00:19:55.417
Where's the brass?

00:19:55.417 --> 00:19:59.625
Not in this room.
Can't we just meet for some tea?

00:19:59.625 --> 00:20:01.333
Right...

00:20:02.542 --> 00:20:03.833
Now then,

00:20:03.833 --> 00:20:10.667
the last battle made it clear that normal
weapons will overtake Titans in the near future.

00:20:10.667 --> 00:20:15.833
The weaker Marley becomes,
the more the Eldian race is threatened.

00:20:15.833 --> 00:20:18.375
Our existence is in danger.

00:20:18.375 --> 00:20:25.458
To rectify this, Marley must obtain the
Founding Titan and Paradis' resources.

00:20:25.458 --> 00:20:30.750
The world must be strongly reminded
of the threat that island poses.

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:34.375
To tell that story, we need a narrator.

00:20:34.375 --> 00:20:37.708
The Tybur family will fulfill that role.

00:20:37.708 --> 00:20:40.708
The family holding the War Hammer Titan?

00:20:40.708 --> 00:20:46.042
It's said the Tyburs have never sent
the War Hammer Titan to enemy soil.

00:20:46.042 --> 00:20:52.333
They're influential abroad for driving away
King Fritz during the Great Titan War.

00:20:52.333 --> 00:20:54.958
The world will listen to them.

00:20:54.958 --> 00:20:57.917
That's Pieck for you! Precisely!

00:20:57.917 --> 00:21:02.417
But the Tyburs have been living
the life in their huge mansions.

00:21:02.417 --> 00:21:06.875
Why come out of the woodwork now
and pretend to be heroes?

00:21:06.875 --> 00:21:11.833
I know how you feel, but the Tyburs
are concerned about Marley, too.

00:21:11.833 --> 00:21:13.417
But we--

00:21:13.417 --> 00:21:17.083
If it saves our motherland
Marley, I'll be grateful.

00:21:17.083 --> 00:21:24.042
Our Warrior unit can cooperate with the Tyburs
and serve as the backbone for restoring Marley.

00:21:24.042 --> 00:21:28.583
Indeed. Here in Liberio,
there will be a festival soon.

00:21:28.583 --> 00:21:29.583
Festival?

00:21:29.583 --> 00:21:36.167
VIPs from abroad will be invited to hear
an announcement from the Tyburs:

00:21:36.167 --> 00:21:40.083
"Within a year, we'll control Paradis Island."

00:21:40.083 --> 00:21:45.917
The fate of Marley and all Eldians
rests in this plan. It cannot fail.

00:21:45.917 --> 00:21:51.833
For the future of our motherland Marley,
we must join our hearts as one.

00:21:51.833 --> 00:21:57.625
Galliard seems to have some complaints,
but he always gets the job done.

00:21:57.625 --> 00:22:00.750
If that's all they're saying, I'm not concerned.

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:03.542
Except that one line of Zeke's.

00:22:03.542 --> 00:22:05.167
Hmm?

00:22:05.167 --> 00:22:08.958
"Not in this room," huh?

00:22:19.042 --> 00:22:21.375
Am I going back...

00:22:22.375 --> 00:22:24.083
...to that island?

00:23:57.250 --> 00:24:01.125
Honorary Marleyan. Esteemed Warrior.

00:24:01.125 --> 00:24:05.208
What he wanted to be. What he couldn't be.

00:24:05.208 --> 00:24:09.625
Is the path that he's walked down
truly the right one?

00:24:09.625 --> 00:24:12.096
Next episode: "The Door of Hope."
