WEBVTT

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:29.821
I keep having the same dream.

00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:33.242
I dream about the guy
who hung himself in the fields.

00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:38.956
Why did he tell us that story
right before he hung himself?

00:00:38.956 --> 00:00:42.793
Obviously, that's something
we'll never know.

00:00:42.793 --> 00:00:45.963
I bet he wanted someone to forgive him.

00:00:45.963 --> 00:00:51.260
Considering we left Marcel and ran,
it's not like we can say much.

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.973
For some reason, I can't help but think:

00:00:55.973 --> 00:01:00.060
That old man, I think what he wanted...

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.146
...was to be judged by someone.

00:01:04.565 --> 00:01:09.236
Hey. It's been four years, Reiner.

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:17.661
Um, huh? Aren't you two
supposed to be old friends?

00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:20.122
Isn't that right, Mr. Kruger?

00:01:20.122 --> 00:01:24.585
Yeah. There's so much to catch up on.

00:01:24.585 --> 00:01:27.713
I don't even know where to start.

00:01:30.257 --> 00:01:32.050
Impossible...

00:01:33.302 --> 00:01:34.970
Eren!

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.065
"Declaration of War"

00:03:20.576 --> 00:03:24.079
Lord Tybur, it's almost time.

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.789
Right.

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:27.583
My goodness!

00:03:27.583 --> 00:03:32.796
Well, well! Come to give me
a pep talk, Madam Azumabito?

00:03:32.796 --> 00:03:37.176
I hope I'm not a bother.
I just came to see your face.

00:03:37.176 --> 00:03:41.388
Given my stage fright,
I'm sure I look hideous.

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:49.688
No, you look courageous.
My whole clan knows how brave you are.

00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:52.024
I wish you the best of luck.

00:03:52.024 --> 00:03:55.694
I appreciate it, Lady Kiyomi.

00:03:55.694 --> 00:03:58.322
Sit down, Reiner.

00:03:59.406 --> 00:04:05.662
They're good seats, right?
You can hear everything on stage.

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:08.749
The building above us is all housing.

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:16.423
It's behind the stage, but it's full of
people waiting for the curtains to rise.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.553
Directly above us.

00:04:22.554 --> 00:04:26.975
Huh? Kruger? Did you hurt your hand?

00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:31.021
Yeah. It's just a scratch.

00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:34.525
Reiner, sit down.

00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:41.698
Well, I think I'll head back.

00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:44.409
No, Falco.

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:47.579
You should stay here and listen.

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:48.747
Huh?

00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:53.502
Falco... Just do as he says.

00:04:53.502 --> 00:04:55.504
Okay.

00:04:55.504 --> 00:04:59.049
Now then, shall we leave?

00:05:03.387 --> 00:05:08.433
Oh! Long time no see, Mr. Leonhart.

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:13.522
Ms. Braun... Not since
your son came home, right?

00:05:14.523 --> 00:05:18.652
Speaking of which,
I hear Hoover passed away in bed?

00:05:18.652 --> 00:05:26.660
Yes. He never failed to say how proud
he was of his son's sacrifice for Marley.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.370
I'm sure your daughter also--

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.414
She's not dead.

00:05:32.124 --> 00:05:37.671
Annie is alive. She promised
she would come back.

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:46.889
To think, war will be declared in
the internment zone, of all places.

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:50.392
Whoa! Even General Calvi came to the zone!

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:54.271
The whole backbone
of Marley's military is here!

00:05:54.271 --> 00:05:57.441
And all these powerful families and ambassadors!

00:05:57.441 --> 00:06:02.154
Not to mention every newspaper
in the world that matters.

00:06:02.154 --> 00:06:05.282
It's like we're in the world's spotlight!

00:06:05.282 --> 00:06:08.577
The Tyburs sure are powerful.

00:06:08.577 --> 00:06:11.580
Yet they're Eldians, same as us.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:14.499
Eep!

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:16.043
It's begun.

00:06:16.043 --> 00:06:19.630
Falco and Mr. Braun aren't back yet?

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:24.218
Warriors of Marley,
Commander Magath has summoned you.

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:49.618
Eren... How? Why did you come here?

00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:54.164
Same reason you did.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.921
Don't you get it? The same reason you did.

00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:04.258
Because I had no other choice.

00:07:09.346 --> 00:07:12.432
Sounds like it started.

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:14.268
Let's listen.

00:07:16.478 --> 00:07:19.565
Let's look back in time.

00:07:19.565 --> 00:07:21.942
Roughly 100 years ago,

00:07:21.942 --> 00:07:26.822
the Eldian Empire ruled the world
with the Power of the Titans.

00:07:27.906 --> 00:07:31.952
From the rise of Founder Ymir until today,

00:07:31.952 --> 00:07:39.918
Titans have robbed enough lives
to eradicate humanity three times over.

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:51.930
Countless cultures and peoples
have been wiped out by Titans;

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.933
their histories stolen away.

00:07:54.933 --> 00:08:00.731
The Eldian Empire's path of slaughter
became humanity's history.

00:08:00.731 --> 00:08:09.281
And when the Eldian Empire ran out of enemies,
they soon began slaughtering one another.

00:08:09.281 --> 00:08:12.492
The Great Titan War had begun.

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:17.331
Families holding the eight Titans
waged a bloody war.

00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:22.544
Using this to his advantage,
one Marleyan sought victory.

00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:25.547
It was the hero, Helos.

00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:27.841
Thanks to his clever manipulations,

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:32.888
the Eldian Empire was tricked into
killing each other, one by one.

00:08:32.888 --> 00:08:35.933
By joining hands with the Tybur family,

00:08:35.933 --> 00:08:42.523
they forced the unbeatable King Fritz
to flee and retreat to the island.

00:08:44.107 --> 00:08:50.739
However, though he fled to Paradis
Island, his power still remained.

00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:58.205
Tens of millions of Titans await on
the island to trample the world.

00:08:58.205 --> 00:09:05.754
To this day, the only reason we haven't
been trampled is merely a fluke.

00:09:05.754 --> 00:09:09.258
Our scholars have no other explanation.

00:09:09.258 --> 00:09:16.640
To eliminate this threat, our motherland
Marley sent four Titans to the island,

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:22.396
but they were beaten back
and only the Armored Titan returned.

00:09:22.396 --> 00:09:29.403
The darkest blot on humanity's history,
the Eldian Empire, is alive and well.

00:09:29.403 --> 00:09:35.409
You hear that, Reiner?
Isn't that why you destroyed the wall?

00:09:35.409 --> 00:09:39.121
You guys were trying to save the world.

00:09:39.121 --> 00:09:40.998
Weren't you?

00:09:42.124 --> 00:09:44.626
You're wanted at the gate, Jaeger.

00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:46.587
Fine.

00:09:46.587 --> 00:09:48.463
This way, you two.

00:09:52.134 --> 00:09:57.139
I feel like I've seen you somewhere
before. Where are you from?

00:09:57.139 --> 00:10:04.688
Out west by Lakua, but I was called here.
I didn't come to chitchat with Eldians.

00:10:04.688 --> 00:10:08.984
That's a shame. I kinda fancy your beard.

00:10:08.984 --> 00:10:10.068
Oh!

00:10:10.068 --> 00:10:11.612
It's Pieck!

00:10:11.612 --> 00:10:16.325
The Panzer Unit! Thanks for all your hard work!

00:10:16.325 --> 00:10:18.744
W-We should be thanking you.

00:10:18.744 --> 00:10:20.829
You're in a good mood today.

00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:23.290
What are you doing? Let's go.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:24.291
What was that?

00:10:24.291 --> 00:10:30.464
Since they ride the Cart Titan into war
and all, it's good if we build a bond.

00:10:30.464 --> 00:10:35.177
Didn't you just put a rift in that bond?

00:10:35.177 --> 00:10:36.512
Anything?

00:10:36.512 --> 00:10:39.139
Nothing strange as of yet.

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:43.685
I don't care how small it seems.
Report everything to me.

00:10:43.685 --> 00:10:45.979
Yes, sir.

00:10:45.979 --> 00:10:48.023
In here. Enter.

00:10:53.904 --> 00:10:55.739
Where's Commander Magath?

00:10:55.739 --> 00:10:56.907
Porco!

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:09.628
What's going on here?
Why is Vice Chief Braun so scared?

00:11:09.628 --> 00:11:13.340
Isn't Kruger an old friend of his?

00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:19.263
Old friend? Like, how many years ago?

00:11:19.263 --> 00:11:23.475
If it's more than four,
they met on Paradis Island!

00:11:23.475 --> 00:11:26.603
No, there's no way!

00:11:26.603 --> 00:11:29.606
Because that means...

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:31.608
Impossible...

00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:33.026
Could it be--?!

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:38.031
"Four Warriors were sent to infiltrate Paradis
Island, retake the Founding Titan,
and return it to Marley. Of the four
original members, only Reiner returned safely."

00:11:38.448 --> 00:11:43.662
Now then, the story I've told
thus far is common knowledge.

00:11:43.662 --> 00:11:48.208
However, the truth is somewhat different.

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:54.381
In passing down the War Hammer Titan,
the Tybur family inherited its memories.

00:11:54.381 --> 00:12:00.554
I will now reveal the truths we learned
for the first time ever.

00:12:00.554 --> 00:12:03.640
Some 100 years ago,

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:09.855
it was neither Helos nor the Tyburs
who ended the Great Titan War.

00:12:09.855 --> 00:12:16.987
The one who ended the fighting
and saved the world... was King Fritz.

00:12:16.987 --> 00:12:21.283
He anguished over the
Eldian Empire's vicious history,

00:12:21.283 --> 00:12:23.994
tired from the endless infighting,

00:12:23.994 --> 00:12:30.000
and above all, he was pained by
the endless oppression of Marley.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.462
When he inherited the Founding Titan,

00:12:33.462 --> 00:12:39.843
he schemed with the Tybur family
and they fabricated a Marleyan hero.

00:12:39.843 --> 00:12:42.471
His name: Helos.

00:12:42.471 --> 00:12:49.269
The King moved as many Eldians as he
could to the island and closed the gates.

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:51.939
He claimed that if they were threatened,

00:12:51.939 --> 00:12:56.276
thousands of Titans would be
unleashed as revenge.

00:12:56.276 --> 00:13:01.114
However, this was never his intention.

00:13:01.114 --> 00:13:07.829
King Fritz made a vow renouncing war
so his ideology would be inherited.

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:12.543
Because of this, Karl Fritz's ideology
has been passed down,

00:13:12.543 --> 00:13:17.506
and the Titans have never left
the island to attack.

00:13:17.506 --> 00:13:24.137
That is, the one keeping our world safe
is the "vile" King of the walls--

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:28.183
Karl Fritz, and his desire for peace.

00:13:29.893 --> 00:13:33.480
Peace was all he wanted.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:39.778
But if Marley grew strong and came
to take the Founding Titan or his life,

00:13:39.778 --> 00:13:41.947
he would accept it.

00:13:41.947 --> 00:13:48.954
He believed the sins of the Eldians were
so grave, they could never be atoned for.

00:13:48.954 --> 00:13:52.624
"However, until that day of retribution,

00:13:52.624 --> 00:13:58.630
let me savor a brief paradise,
free of conflict within the walls.

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:01.508
That is all I ask of you."

00:14:01.508 --> 00:14:04.219
That was his last request.

00:14:04.219 --> 00:14:05.220
Huh?

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.306
What does this mean?

00:14:07.306 --> 00:14:09.057
If this is true...

00:14:09.057 --> 00:14:15.022
Marley and the Tyburs saving the world
was made up by King Fritz?

00:14:15.022 --> 00:14:21.653
If the King of the walls won't attack,
why do they say Paradis Island is a threat?

00:14:21.653 --> 00:14:24.698
Yes... In exchange for our safety,

00:14:24.698 --> 00:14:31.872
the Tybur family joined hands with Karl Fritz
and sold out the Eldians to Marley.

00:14:31.872 --> 00:14:38.170
We're no more than traitors
lavishing in crookedly earned honor.

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:43.467
The reason that I stand here
and willingly part with this sham

00:14:43.467 --> 00:14:48.597
is because I know our world is in great peril.

00:14:48.597 --> 00:14:50.182
Commander!

00:14:50.182 --> 00:14:54.853
The Warriors and soldiers
sent to get them are missing.

00:14:54.853 --> 00:14:57.022
Mobilize a search team!

00:14:57.022 --> 00:14:58.524
Yes, sir!

00:15:00.192 --> 00:15:02.528
Has it begun?

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:06.657
Damn, that hurt! Shit...

00:15:06.657 --> 00:15:08.867
What the hell is this?

00:15:08.867 --> 00:15:12.287
Must be a pit to restrain Warriors.

00:15:12.287 --> 00:15:18.126
It's a classic trap--too cramped for
one of us to transform, let alone two.

00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:24.424
Yeah, we'd be squashed to death.
Why'd that scrawny soldier even do it?

00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:30.347
I don't know, but I feel like
I've seen them before.

00:15:33.725 --> 00:15:38.230
Stand there and watch. This is my atonement.

00:15:41.817 --> 00:15:48.657
Using the power of the Founding Titan,
Karl Fritz erected three walls.

00:15:48.657 --> 00:15:53.787
These walls, formed by
tens of millions of Colossal Titans,

00:15:53.787 --> 00:15:58.250
have served as a shield and spear,
safeguarding peace.

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:03.088
But recently, an uprising
took place on Paradis Island.

00:16:03.088 --> 00:16:10.095
King Fritz's peace was undermined by
a person who stole the Founding Titan.

00:16:10.095 --> 00:16:16.476
Once again, there's a threat to
our world--a rebel against peace!

00:16:16.476 --> 00:16:20.355
His name: Eren Jaeger!

00:16:23.066 --> 00:16:28.989
You tricked me... And here I respected you...

00:16:28.989 --> 00:16:32.034
But you tricked me!

00:16:32.034 --> 00:16:36.205
I'm sorry, Falco. I needed your help.

00:16:36.205 --> 00:16:37.497
Huh?

00:16:38.832 --> 00:16:43.837
The letters! The ones you had me send!
What were they?!

00:16:46.798 --> 00:16:52.221
They didn't reach my family,
but they did reach my comrades.

00:16:54.306 --> 00:16:56.975
No way! You're kidding!

00:16:56.975 --> 00:17:00.604
Y-Your comrades?

00:17:00.604 --> 00:17:07.611
The threat of Paradis Island is the stampede
of millions of Colossal Titans--a rumbling.

00:17:07.611 --> 00:17:12.282
As I mentioned, the vow renouncing war
prevents the King's bloodline

00:17:12.282 --> 00:17:15.619
from fully using the Founding Titan.

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:20.624
But currently, this "Eren Jaeger"
who possesses the Founding Titan

00:17:20.624 --> 00:17:24.628
may begin this rumbling at any moment.

00:17:24.628 --> 00:17:30.551
Once the rumbling is set into motion,
there is nothing that we can do.

00:17:30.551 --> 00:17:36.098
Nothing but tremble at the
footsteps of doom, fleeing in vain.

00:17:36.098 --> 00:17:43.814
All lands and civilizations will be trampled,
literally razed to the ground.

00:17:43.814 --> 00:17:45.190
That's right.

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:46.149
Huh?

00:17:46.149 --> 00:17:54.157
It's like Willy says--I'm the bad guy.
I might just destroy the world.

00:17:54.157 --> 00:17:58.662
But to me, you were the bad guys, too.

00:17:58.662 --> 00:18:04.626
That day, when the wall was destroyed
and Titans invaded my hometown,

00:18:04.626 --> 00:18:07.504
I watched my mom get eaten.

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:11.425
I couldn't understand.

00:18:11.425 --> 00:18:17.931
Why, Reiner? Why was my mom eaten by a Titan?

00:18:17.931 --> 00:18:23.478
Because... on that day, we broke the wall.

00:18:23.478 --> 00:18:26.648
Why did you break the wall?

00:18:26.648 --> 00:18:32.571
To sneak in during the chaos
and see how the King would react.

00:18:32.571 --> 00:18:34.740
What was your mission?

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:38.577
To retake the Founding Titan and save the world.

00:18:38.577 --> 00:18:45.959
I see... If it was to save the world,
you didn't have much choice.

00:18:49.087 --> 00:18:51.590
Back then, you told me:

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:56.512
"I'll make you guys suffer and die
in the worst way possible."

00:18:56.512 --> 00:18:58.972
Isn't that why you came?

00:18:58.972 --> 00:19:02.643
Oh, I vaguely remember saying that.

00:19:02.643 --> 00:19:04.102
Huh?

00:19:04.102 --> 00:19:06.146
Just forget it.

00:19:06.146 --> 00:19:11.568
True, I saw everyone on the other side
of the sea as my enemy.

00:19:11.568 --> 00:19:14.321
But then, I crossed the sea,

00:19:14.321 --> 00:19:19.034
slept under the same roof
as them, ate the same food...

00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:23.997
Reiner, I'm the same as you.

00:19:23.997 --> 00:19:28.418
Sure, there're jerks here, but good people, too.

00:19:30.212 --> 00:19:36.260
Across the sea, within the walls...
It's the same.

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:41.890
But you guys were taught everyone
in the walls was a devil.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:47.437
You were children who knew nothing,
but it was drilled into you.

00:19:47.437 --> 00:19:52.401
You were just kids. What could you even do?

00:19:52.401 --> 00:19:58.156
Right, Reiner? Hasn't that
been eating away at you?

00:20:00.659 --> 00:20:04.663
No! You're wrong, Eren!

00:20:04.663 --> 00:20:07.749
That day, when Marcel was eaten,

00:20:07.749 --> 00:20:12.838
Annie and Bertholdt tried to turn back
and end the mission.

00:20:13.881 --> 00:20:19.720
But I... I talked them into it
and made them go on!

00:20:20.762 --> 00:20:26.685
I wanted to be a hero!
I wanted people's respect!

00:20:26.685 --> 00:20:29.771
It's my fault!

00:20:29.771 --> 00:20:33.609
Your mom was eaten by a Titan because of me!

00:20:33.609 --> 00:20:36.987
I cursed the blood I was born with.

00:20:36.987 --> 00:20:41.450
More than anyone,
I wished the Eldians were wiped out.

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:46.538
I'm sick of this... of myself! Just kill me!

00:20:46.538 --> 00:20:50.542
But I do not wish to die.

00:20:50.542 --> 00:20:55.589
And that is because
I was born into this world.

00:20:55.589 --> 00:20:59.426
We are people of different races and nations!

00:20:59.426 --> 00:21:06.308
However, it is time to join as one
and face this dreadful enemy!

00:21:06.308 --> 00:21:11.230
Lend me your strength,
those of you who wish to live!

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:14.983
Those of you who wish for a future!

00:21:16.735 --> 00:21:22.115
If we work together, we can
overcome any obstacle in our way!

00:21:24.576 --> 00:21:29.373
Like I thought, I'm the same as you.

00:21:29.373 --> 00:21:30.666
Huh?

00:21:30.666 --> 00:21:38.298
I want you to join me in the fight
against the devils of Paradis Island!

00:21:38.298 --> 00:21:41.593
I think we were born this way.

00:21:41.593 --> 00:21:48.642
Here and now, as representative of
the Marleyan government, I proclaim...

00:21:48.642 --> 00:21:51.270
I keep moving forward.

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:52.437
Huh?

00:21:52.437 --> 00:21:55.148
Until I destroy my enemies.

00:22:01.989 --> 00:22:06.994
...to the enemy forces of Paradis--
a declaration of war!

00:24:02.276 --> 00:24:05.362
The Attack Titan suddenly appears.

00:24:05.362 --> 00:24:10.450
Amid its roars, the crowd
is slaughtered mercilessly.

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:14.621
To stop Eren's rampage,
the War Hammer swings.

00:24:14.621 --> 00:24:17.088
Next episode: "The War Hammer Titan."
