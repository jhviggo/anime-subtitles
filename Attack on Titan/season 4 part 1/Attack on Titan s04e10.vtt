WEBVTT

00:00:24.583 --> 00:00:26.083
Fight.

00:00:28.083 --> 00:00:29.708
Fight!

00:00:29.708 --> 00:00:32.125
What are you doing?

00:00:32.125 --> 00:00:38.458
Were you just saying, "Fight. Fight,"
to the mirror just now?

00:00:38.458 --> 00:00:42.250
Hey. You said, "Fight. Fight," didn't you?

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.917
By "Fight. Fight," what are you fighting?

00:00:46.917 --> 00:00:53.250
If you're saying, "Fight. Fight,"
does that mean there're two fights?

00:00:55.792 --> 00:01:02.083
Keeping quiet isn't helping. Normally,
people don't talk to themselves like that.

00:01:02.083 --> 00:01:07.042
I know I've never talked to myself
in the mirror before.

00:01:09.167 --> 00:01:12.708
By the way, I think your hair is cool.

00:01:12.708 --> 00:01:18.125
When it's all disheveled, it's kinda like
you're hard-working and carefree.

00:01:18.125 --> 00:01:20.000
What did you come for?!

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.375
What? To talk, of course.

00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:28.750
The first time we met,
didn't we talk about Titans all night?

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.000
Though you mostly listened
as I blabbered on and on.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.917
I honestly believed that you would
never sacrifice Historia.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
"A Sound Argument"

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
"2 Years Ago"

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:27.708
Eren, I haven't seen you since you
lifted our ship a whole year ago.

00:03:27.708 --> 00:03:30.042
I'm honored to work with you.

00:03:30.042 --> 00:03:36.708
No, you won't be working together.
You're lucky enough to see his face.

00:03:36.708 --> 00:03:41.583
Plenty enough for me.
Today will be a joyous day.

00:03:41.583 --> 00:03:46.833
The port is complete and we're
welcoming our first outside visitor.

00:03:46.833 --> 00:03:50.917
From Paradis Island's
sole friendly nation, Hizuru--

00:03:50.917 --> 00:03:54.375
Special Envoy, Kiyomi Azumabito.

00:03:58.333 --> 00:04:01.625
Do you recognize this family crest?

00:04:02.917 --> 00:04:04.000
That's...

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.458
Show it, Mikasa.

00:04:05.458 --> 00:04:09.000
But my mom said to keep it secret.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.917
You showed it to me when we were little.
It's a secret meant for today.

00:04:14.917 --> 00:04:16.333
Go on.

00:04:21.042 --> 00:04:26.292
Before she died, this symbol was
passed down to me from my mother.

00:04:26.292 --> 00:04:29.750
She said I should pass it on to my child.

00:04:31.042 --> 00:04:34.333
What an admirable deed!

00:04:34.333 --> 00:04:40.417
Over a century ago, the shogun we
Azumabitos descended from had a son.

00:04:40.417 --> 00:04:46.417
He was on friendly terms with
King Fritz and often came to Paradis.

00:04:46.417 --> 00:04:51.833
After the Great Titan War,
Hizuru was defeated and in disarray.

00:04:51.833 --> 00:05:00.333
In the confusion, a child of the
shogunate was left behind on the island.

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:04.458
You're the lost descendant
of our nation's ruler!

00:05:04.458 --> 00:05:07.708
You're the hope of Hizuru!

00:05:10.833 --> 00:05:14.292
I still don't get what a nation is.

00:05:14.292 --> 00:05:17.792
Anyways, now we've got leverage with Hizuru!

00:05:17.792 --> 00:05:19.917
What if it's a trap?

00:05:19.917 --> 00:05:23.667
I suppose we should ask Yelena's opinion.

00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:27.750
No! That's exactly what they want!

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.875
One thing is for certain:

00:05:30.875 --> 00:05:38.000
The sea has joined us to the world,
but we're still just a child learning to walk.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.250
We should sit quiet and hear
what others have to say.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.083
Hey, why'd you only show Eren that symbol?

00:05:47.083 --> 00:05:48.000
Huh?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.833
You've never taken off
your wrist wrap for anyone.

00:05:51.833 --> 00:05:53.833
Well, that's...

00:05:53.833 --> 00:05:55.500
You seem happy.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.792
I am! You and I were both born
with a heavy burden to bear!

00:06:01.792 --> 00:06:05.583
There's nobody else I'd rather rely on!

00:06:10.417 --> 00:06:13.875
It's a historic day for both our nations.

00:06:13.875 --> 00:06:21.792
Today is only possible thanks to the one
who brought us together, Zeke Jaeger.

00:06:21.792 --> 00:06:26.958
After meeting with him in secret,
we agreed to an arrangement

00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:32.458
under the condition we were
able to meet Lady Mikasa.

00:06:33.875 --> 00:06:37.500
First, please take a look at this.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.500
That's...!

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:45.125
Huh? This is top-secret in Marley,
but you recognize it?

00:06:45.125 --> 00:06:51.292
This "omni-directional mobility gear"
is an anti-Titan weapon made in Paradis.

00:06:51.292 --> 00:06:57.875
I procured this on my own,
so don't worry. Consider it a gift.

00:06:57.875 --> 00:07:02.792
However, to make this work,
it needs a special fuel.

00:07:02.792 --> 00:07:07.333
They call it "Iceburst Stone."

00:07:07.333 --> 00:07:12.500
It's a unique underground resource
mined only in Paradis.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.792
There should be traces of it inside the weapon.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:21.625
Zeke Jaeger said if we cooperate with him,

00:07:21.625 --> 00:07:28.417
our nation may just helm an industry
that restores it to its former glory.

00:07:28.417 --> 00:07:33.042
And yet, he hasn't even
prospected your reserves.

00:07:33.042 --> 00:07:36.958
But a resource like that
in this age of modernization

00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:42.125
would be worth its weight
in jewels and treasure.

00:07:42.125 --> 00:07:44.917
I'm being used as a pretext?

00:07:44.917 --> 00:07:50.875
Yelena said the talks would go well
since the Azumabitos are money grubbers.

00:07:50.875 --> 00:07:57.542
After all, it's not worth the risk
coming here unless money is involved.

00:07:57.542 --> 00:08:03.250
And? What exactly is the arrangement
you have with Zeke Jaeger?

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:07.833
As you know, Zeke Jaeger
has a secret plan in mind.

00:08:07.833 --> 00:08:12.042
To achieve it, Hizuru's cooperation is needed.

00:08:12.042 --> 00:08:17.708
Here are his three points to protect
Paradis with the rumbling.

00:08:17.708 --> 00:08:21.583
The first is a test run of the rumbling--

00:08:21.583 --> 00:08:27.417
to release a sample of its power
and show the world its devastation.

00:08:27.417 --> 00:08:29.958
Next is Hizuru's cooperation.

00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:38.083
Your military must be strengthened
until use of the rumbling isn't necessary.

00:08:38.083 --> 00:08:45.542
Lastly, the Founding Titan and a Titan
with royal blood must be passed down.

00:08:45.542 --> 00:08:47.708
That's the third point.

00:08:47.708 --> 00:08:52.250
Zeke will pass on the Beast Titan
to someone of royal blood.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:58.417
Until their 13-year term ends,
they must bear as many kids as possible.

00:08:58.417 --> 00:09:03.750
Even if weaponry advances,
the rumbling itself is powerful.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:11.000
Unless we get rid of it, inheriting Titans
will continue for generations to come.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:19.125
Is it right for us to push this problem on
our descendants to save ourselves now?

00:09:19.125 --> 00:09:22.083
Of course not. But...

00:09:22.083 --> 00:09:27.458
Very well. I will inherit the Beast Titan.

00:09:27.458 --> 00:09:31.917
As long as the rumbling is tied to our survival.

00:09:37.667 --> 00:09:40.083
Historia...

00:09:40.083 --> 00:09:46.250
After years of getting trampled on,
now we've gotta breed like livestock?

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:49.625
If that's the price of getting to live,

00:09:49.625 --> 00:09:55.042
Zeke Jaeger can take
his damn plan and shove it!

00:09:56.333 --> 00:10:00.458
It's too dangerous to gamble
on having the rumbling.

00:10:00.458 --> 00:10:08.000
We need to spend our time exploring
what other options are available to us.

00:10:11.167 --> 00:10:15.000
You should know I felt
the same sense of urgency.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.667
But I still don't get why you went on
your own and put the island in danger.

00:10:21.667 --> 00:10:24.708
Don't you care about Historia?

00:10:24.708 --> 00:10:27.208
I ate the War Hammer Titan.

00:10:27.208 --> 00:10:28.292
Huh?

00:10:28.292 --> 00:10:35.542
It has the power to harden through
the ground and make whatever it wants.

00:10:35.542 --> 00:10:41.125
In other words, there's no prison
deep or strong enough to hold me.

00:10:41.125 --> 00:10:44.375
I can leave whenever I want.

00:10:44.375 --> 00:10:48.042
I have the Founding Titan and you can't kill me.

00:10:48.042 --> 00:10:51.792
You can't kill Zeke either,
even if you threaten to.

00:10:51.792 --> 00:10:57.583
So, Hange... What is it you can actually do?

00:10:58.958 --> 00:11:05.667
Tell me, Hange! If you've got something
up your sleeve, let's hear it!

00:11:06.625 --> 00:11:08.542
Eren, you perv!

00:11:08.542 --> 00:11:13.542
Still in a rebellious phase?! You moron! Idiot!

00:11:18.792 --> 00:11:23.542
Erwin, you only made one mistake in your life.

00:11:23.542 --> 00:11:27.125
Why did you make me commander?

00:11:32.375 --> 00:11:35.500
Come on inside, Historia.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.500
You've gotta take care of your body.

00:11:39.042 --> 00:11:44.042
"Hizuru: An eastern nation with its own culture
whose head of state is called a 'shogun.' They
flourished in weapons and aircraft development
and was at one time an Eldian Empire ally."

00:11:46.583 --> 00:11:49.125
We should've stuck with our plan

00:11:49.125 --> 00:11:54.542
and fed Zeke to Historia as soon
as he got to the island.

00:11:54.542 --> 00:11:57.458
Who would've thought?!

00:11:57.458 --> 00:12:00.583
She played around and got pregnant!

00:12:00.583 --> 00:12:05.042
In the end, she's a low-bred girl
who's Queen in name only.

00:12:05.042 --> 00:12:07.667
Hey! Quit it.

00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.958
The Queen is free to choose a partner.

00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:17.250
We've already confirmed the guy
isn't anyone's lackey.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.958
They grew up in the same area.

00:12:19.958 --> 00:12:26.917
Back then, he apparently threw rocks
at her trying to get her attention.

00:12:26.917 --> 00:12:31.542
He started helping at her
orphanage out of guilt.

00:12:31.542 --> 00:12:37.042
He worked with his head down for years,
but the one who approached the other...

00:12:37.042 --> 00:12:39.250
...was the Queen.

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:41.958
Who cares about their love story?

00:12:41.958 --> 00:12:47.875
The problem is, why did the Queen
decide to get pregnant all of a sudden?!

00:12:47.875 --> 00:12:53.333
Someone told her! "If you're pregnant,
they won't make you a Titan!"

00:12:53.333 --> 00:13:00.792
I bet it was Yelena. That woman is nuts,
but she's smart enough to be dangerous.

00:13:00.792 --> 00:13:04.667
"If the Queen is pregnant,
Zeke lives another day!"

00:13:04.667 --> 00:13:06.750
Hey! You're drunk, Roeg.

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:11.792
We should do it anyways.
Make her a Titan, pregnant or not.

00:13:11.792 --> 00:13:17.625
Her child might die. And if something
happens to the Queen, it's over.

00:13:17.625 --> 00:13:21.792
Giving birth is risky enough as it is.

00:13:21.792 --> 00:13:25.667
That sound argument
might just ruin our country!

00:13:25.667 --> 00:13:29.458
Hey! Bring another bottle, Marleyan!

00:13:29.458 --> 00:13:31.208
Certainly.

00:13:32.208 --> 00:13:33.500
Greiz.

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.167
Nicolo...

00:13:36.167 --> 00:13:38.583
This one, right?

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:51.125
Hey! Is this... something...
they really needed us... to do?!

00:13:51.125 --> 00:13:58.417
Nope! We wouldn't be doing this,
but that idiot opened their mouth.

00:13:58.417 --> 00:14:03.458
"We can develop the island and
our muscles at the same time," my ass.

00:14:03.458 --> 00:14:07.708
We can't do much but wait
for Hizuru's answer anyways.

00:14:07.708 --> 00:14:13.000
Yeah. And hope they can be
our mediator to the world.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:20.208
We're grasping at straws here trying to
avoid the rumbling and save Historia.

00:14:20.208 --> 00:14:22.833
--Yeah
--Hey!

00:14:25.583 --> 00:14:29.792
Man, you're all working hard in this heat!

00:14:29.792 --> 00:14:34.083
Yeah, well, we're stuck watching this idiot.

00:14:34.083 --> 00:14:38.250
Unbelievable. You're all growing so damn big.

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:39.833
Is it about Hizuru?

00:14:39.833 --> 00:14:42.792
The Azumabitos sent their reply.

00:14:42.792 --> 00:14:43.958
And?

00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:49.500
No good. Looks like we can't turn to Hizuru.

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:54.542
It seems they want to monopolize
Paradis Island's resources.

00:14:54.542 --> 00:14:57.625
They won't help us trade with others.

00:14:57.625 --> 00:15:03.292
The world wants Paradis Island
to be the root of all evil.

00:15:03.292 --> 00:15:09.083
It helps to unite all nations
and brings stability to the world.

00:15:10.833 --> 00:15:18.625
So, we've got no choice but to rely on
the rumbling and sacrifice Historia?

00:15:18.625 --> 00:15:19.792
That's right.

00:15:19.792 --> 00:15:25.750
You're kidding! They decided we're
devils without knowing our intentions?

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:30.833
Why won't they consider a path of peace?

00:15:30.833 --> 00:15:34.792
I think... because they don't know.

00:15:34.792 --> 00:15:38.625
They fear us because they
don't know what we are.

00:15:38.625 --> 00:15:44.125
That's right. They won't trust people
whose faces they haven't seen.

00:15:44.125 --> 00:15:50.083
So let's meet 'em! If you don't
understand something, go figure it out!

00:15:50.083 --> 00:15:53.417
Isn't that what we Scouts do?

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:58.000
Make a base in Marley and infiltrate, huh?

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.583
Hange sure has a plan for everything.

00:16:01.583 --> 00:16:05.667
I'll be able to chow down
on real Marleyan cuisine!

00:16:05.667 --> 00:16:10.833
Yeah? What should I bring?
It would stink to get the runs.

00:16:10.833 --> 00:16:14.625
Stomach medicine, toothbrush,
a taste of home...

00:16:14.625 --> 00:16:17.292
Did you even hear Hange's plan?

00:16:17.292 --> 00:16:24.000
If the world knows that we want peace,
maybe something will change.

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:34.625
If only we had more time.
I've got just over five years left.

00:16:34.625 --> 00:16:40.083
We're gonna have to decide
who inherits my Titan soon.

00:16:41.958 --> 00:16:43.333
I will.

00:16:43.333 --> 00:16:48.583
Not you. We still don't know
what the Ackermanns are.

00:16:48.583 --> 00:16:53.625
And won't it hurt any plans with Hizuru
if you become a Titan?

00:16:53.625 --> 00:16:56.167
No, for so many reasons.

00:16:56.167 --> 00:16:57.833
Then who will?

00:16:57.833 --> 00:17:02.417
Me. First of all, I'm way smarter than Eren.

00:17:02.417 --> 00:17:04.833
Instead of a suicidal maniac,

00:17:04.833 --> 00:17:09.958
you'll have a gifted leader who shows
good judgment in all situations.

00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:12.125
In other words, me.

00:17:12.125 --> 00:17:17.292
I hate getting an Eren hand-me-down,
but who better than me?

00:17:17.292 --> 00:17:22.458
Someone that amazing we don't
wanna lose in 13 years, moron.

00:17:22.458 --> 00:17:23.375
Huh?!

00:17:23.375 --> 00:17:26.458
You should aim to be a regiment leader.

00:17:26.458 --> 00:17:32.000
I'll inherit Eren's Titan.
It works out good, right?

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.042
Conny...

00:17:33.042 --> 00:17:36.750
That's not good at all. You're an idiot.

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:37.667
Eh?

00:17:37.667 --> 00:17:44.042
Don't "eh" me. We can't leave such
an important role up to an idiot.

00:17:44.042 --> 00:17:45.458
Eh?

00:17:46.333 --> 00:17:50.333
Doggone it... I'll inherit it.

00:17:50.333 --> 00:17:54.250
I've got combat experience...
I'm someone you can trust...

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:57.625
By process of elimination, it's gotta be me.

00:17:57.625 --> 00:17:58.750
You guys...

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:02.417
I dun wanna. I sure dun wanna though.

00:18:02.417 --> 00:18:05.708
Wait, huh? Isn't that weird?

00:18:05.708 --> 00:18:06.833
What?

00:18:06.833 --> 00:18:12.583
Well, you know...
You said an idiot's not fit for the role.

00:18:12.583 --> 00:18:13.708
Hmm?

00:18:13.708 --> 00:18:20.542
You're more of an idiot than I am,
so you're contradicting yourself.

00:18:20.542 --> 00:18:22.625
Huh?

00:18:22.625 --> 00:18:24.500
Huh...?

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:28.250
I don't want any of you to inherit it.

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:30.042
Why not?

00:18:30.042 --> 00:18:34.625
Because you're important to me.
More than anyone else.

00:18:34.625 --> 00:18:38.792
So, I want you to have long lives.

00:18:53.292 --> 00:18:59.458
Huh?! What are you turning red for?!
The hell kinda mood is this?!

00:18:59.458 --> 00:19:00.833
Sorry.

00:19:00.833 --> 00:19:04.167
Jean, it's the sunset.

00:19:04.167 --> 00:19:06.792
It's making our faces red.

00:19:06.792 --> 00:19:11.500
Oh. Nothing we can do about the sun.

00:19:29.292 --> 00:19:36.333
To think Commander Pyxis would go
so far as to detain the volunteers.

00:19:36.333 --> 00:19:41.917
Since they and the Scouts are so close,
we weren't told in advance.

00:19:41.917 --> 00:19:45.125
Yeah. I'm sure he didn't have much choice.

00:19:45.125 --> 00:19:51.625
Until Zeke's intentions are made clear,
it puts us in a real pickle.

00:19:51.625 --> 00:19:55.292
And Eren's suddenly aboard Zeke's plan.

00:19:55.292 --> 00:20:01.625
Whatever the two of them talked about
is something only they know.

00:20:01.625 --> 00:20:06.292
Hey. Did that look like Eren to you guys?

00:20:06.292 --> 00:20:10.500
Not me. That wasn't Eren.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:16.250
If he's made up his mind to side
with his half-brother over us...

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:18.917
If he has, then what?

00:20:18.917 --> 00:20:22.208
We've gotta be prepared
to cut him down if necessar--

00:20:22.208 --> 00:20:23.750
I won't let you!

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:25.083
Huh?

00:20:27.083 --> 00:20:30.958
Are you siding with them, too, Mikasa?

00:20:32.042 --> 00:20:35.125
I don't think it'll come to that.

00:20:35.125 --> 00:20:40.750
Eren cares about us more than anyone.
You guys should know that.

00:20:44.625 --> 00:20:50.375
Maybe that's why he's so hostile
to anyone who isn't one of us.

00:20:50.375 --> 00:20:52.458
He cares too much.

00:20:52.458 --> 00:20:54.500
That's not it.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:21:01.250
No matter how strong you were, the old him
tried to keep you off the front lines.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:06.333
But he made Armin destroy the port
and pulled you into the fight.

00:21:06.333 --> 00:21:10.000
All of us, too. The ones he called important.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.333
I think that's because he trusts us.

00:21:13.333 --> 00:21:17.375
If we hadn't gone, he couldn't have done it.

00:21:17.375 --> 00:21:20.542
And Sasha wouldn't have died.

00:21:20.542 --> 00:21:25.708
Mikasa... When Sasha died, what did Eren do?

00:21:25.708 --> 00:21:30.000
Did he cry? Did he regret his actions?

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.792
Conny, stop.

00:21:31.792 --> 00:21:34.583
He laughed.

00:21:34.583 --> 00:21:40.917
What part of it was so funny to him?
What part of Sasha dying?

00:21:40.917 --> 00:21:45.958
Explain it to me, Mikasa. Why was Eren laughing?

00:21:45.958 --> 00:21:50.542
You know everything about him, right?

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:55.750
We'll talk to Eren. Just me, Mikasa, and him.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:58.125
We'll find out his goal.

00:21:58.125 --> 00:22:03.708
But will it help? What if his goals
are the same as Zeke's?

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:09.500
Now that the military has Titan serum,
we've got options.

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:10.750
You don't mean--!

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:14.458
The option of making someone
we trust into a Titan,

00:22:14.458 --> 00:22:18.208
who would then inherit Eren's Founding Titan.

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:06.125
Gabi and Falco escape from prison.

00:24:06.125 --> 00:24:14.125
Alone and lost, they receive a helping hand
from a devil they're meant to hate.

00:24:14.125 --> 00:24:17.174
Next episode: "Deceiver."
