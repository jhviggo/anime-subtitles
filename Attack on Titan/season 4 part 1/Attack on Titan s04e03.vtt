WEBVTT

00:00:18.227 --> 00:00:21.230
We were abandoned.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.526
That's why we live in a camp
surrounded by walls.

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:29.613
Because the blood of devils
runs through us.

00:00:29.613 --> 00:00:32.783
That's also why your father isn't here.

00:00:34.618 --> 00:00:38.413
Your father... is Marleyan.

00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:42.501
He can't be with us Eldians.

00:00:43.961 --> 00:00:46.755
If only we were Marleyan...

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.514
Oh, yeah...

00:00:55.514 --> 00:01:01.728
Back then, I strove to be a Warrior
so we could be Marleyans.

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:12.155
Who said you could walk?!
Run, you filthy seed of swine!

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:15.367
Don't you wanna be Honorary Marleyans?!

00:01:18.662 --> 00:01:24.168
Did you guys hear? We're attacking
Paradis Island in just a few years.

00:01:24.168 --> 00:01:25.252
Huh?

00:01:25.252 --> 00:01:28.755
It's almost time for us to inherit Titans!

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:32.301
Out of the seven of us, they're picking six!

00:01:32.301 --> 00:01:35.888
Yes! I can finally be Marleyan!

00:01:35.888 --> 00:01:40.559
Huh? Why so excited?
If anyone's the worst, it's you.

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:42.227
Excuse me?!

00:01:42.227 --> 00:01:44.229
What's your strong point?

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.147
Huh?

00:01:45.147 --> 00:01:50.569
Your strength? Your brains?
Your aim? Combat ability?

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:56.408
Nope. The only value they see in you
is your loyalty to Marley.

00:01:56.408 --> 00:02:01.079
"I'll slaughter the island devils
real good for you, sir!"

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:07.044
You making fun of our mission?!
Or maybe you're a stray Restorationist?!

00:02:07.044 --> 00:02:07.878
Huh?!

00:02:07.878 --> 00:02:12.299
You are, aren't you?!
I'll report you to the commander!

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.469
Report this, you little shit!

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:16.762
Want some more?!

00:02:16.762 --> 00:02:18.138
Porco, enough!

00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:21.308
Hating the island doesn't make you special!

00:02:21.308 --> 00:02:24.686
Have fun waiting 13 years alone!

00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:28.023
--Tsk!
--Porco!

00:02:28.023 --> 00:02:29.775
Let's go, Pieck.

00:02:29.775 --> 00:02:35.489
Don't cry too long or the
commander will chew me out.

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.575
Reiner, I'm sorry.

00:02:41.328 --> 00:02:43.830
Stand up, Reiner.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.165
C'mon.

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:51.129
I'm gonna become a Marleyan
and live with my mom and dad.

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.298
I can't wait 13 years.

00:02:53.298 --> 00:02:57.511
But it's like he said. I'm the worst.

00:02:57.511 --> 00:03:03.225
Porco doesn't make the decision.
Besides, loyalty is important.

00:03:03.225 --> 00:03:05.602
Right, Annie?

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:08.939
Huh? What? I wasn't listening.

00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:19.491
You really want that as your goal?

00:03:19.491 --> 00:03:20.450
Huh?

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.370
Thirteen years is all you get.

00:03:24.288 --> 00:03:27.165
Thirteen years to be a hero.

00:03:28.584 --> 00:03:32.754
If I crush the devils on Paradis,
I'll save the world.

00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:37.384
Then my parents will be proud
to have me as a son.

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:44.808
I wish something would happen.

00:03:44.808 --> 00:03:47.352
Eren! There you are!

00:05:17.067 --> 00:05:22.072
"The Door of Hope"

00:05:22.614 --> 00:05:27.202
Marvelous. Even better than we expected.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.879
The Female Titan.
Versatility is its biggest strength.

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:44.344
On top of its mobility and endurance,
its hardened strikes are incredibly destructive.

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:49.099
The range is limited,
but it can call Pure Titans, too.

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:51.727
Leonhart is perfect.

00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:56.315
The Armored Titan specializes in hardening.

00:05:56.315 --> 00:06:01.278
If it charges in at full speed,
the gates of any wall will crumble.

00:06:01.278 --> 00:06:08.035
As Marley's shield that must withstand attacks,
it suits Braun's perseverance.

00:06:09.036 --> 00:06:12.247
The Jaw Titan is an assault weapon.

00:06:12.247 --> 00:06:19.213
It's as speedy as it is small, with claws
and jaw that crush nearly everything.

00:06:19.213 --> 00:06:22.466
Entrusted to the quick-witted Marcel.

00:06:22.466 --> 00:06:25.636
The Beast Titan is as potent as ever.

00:06:25.636 --> 00:06:29.014
Though slightly larger than the other Titans,

00:06:29.014 --> 00:06:33.185
its throwing technique is dreadful
on another level.

00:06:33.185 --> 00:06:37.648
What's more, his blood
seems to have hidden power.

00:06:39.358 --> 00:06:45.405
The Cart Titan has outstanding endurance,
suitable for long missions.

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:50.953
It can be outfitted with different
equipment to extend its usefulness.

00:06:50.953 --> 00:06:54.998
Pieck's superior judgment will serve well.

00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:58.335
And then, there's the Colossal Titan...

00:07:07.803 --> 00:07:10.097
A god of destruction.

00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:14.184
Hoover will be able to handle it.

00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:17.271
I feel bad for those island devils.

00:07:17.271 --> 00:07:21.316
One day, that's gonna show up to kill 'em.

00:07:21.316 --> 00:07:25.362
This new Warrior unit may
outperform their predecessors,

00:07:25.362 --> 00:07:28.615
but I question the military's decision.

00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:33.579
Sending children to retake the
Founding Titan sounds insane to me.

00:07:33.579 --> 00:07:40.335
You think? Didn't those children
just crush a nation before our eyes?

00:07:40.335 --> 00:07:44.256
It's messed up! Why was
the worst of us chosen?!

00:07:44.256 --> 00:07:46.633
What did you do?!

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:51.889
Seems you're the worst.
That's all there is to it, Pock.

00:07:51.889 --> 00:07:53.599
You little--!

00:07:53.599 --> 00:07:57.102
Porco! You sure you wanna defy the brass?!

00:07:57.102 --> 00:07:58.395
Huh?

00:08:03.192 --> 00:08:06.320
Reiner... I'm sorry.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.613
Huh?

00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:22.002
Dad!

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:27.132
It's you, right? Mom used to work in
these barracks before I was born!

00:08:27.132 --> 00:08:30.552
That's where you met her! Karina Braun!

00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:35.432
Look at this! Mom and I are
Honorary Marleyans! We can all live--

00:08:35.432 --> 00:08:37.226
Bloody hell!

00:08:37.226 --> 00:08:42.064
Did that woman send you here?!
To get revenge on me?! Shit!

00:08:42.064 --> 00:08:44.107
Now her kid's a Warrior?!

00:08:44.107 --> 00:08:47.611
If they find out where you're from,
my family is screwed!

00:08:47.611 --> 00:08:51.532
You're gonna get me hanged!
I'm running the hell away!

00:08:51.532 --> 00:08:55.911
Away from you and your damn Eldian mother!

00:08:55.911 --> 00:08:57.663
Reiner!

00:08:57.663 --> 00:08:59.706
Reiner!

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:02.167
I'll be waiting for you!

00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:05.629
That's right. Even without a father,

00:09:05.629 --> 00:09:09.383
I'm still the chosen Warrior
of the Armored Titan.

00:09:09.383 --> 00:09:14.263
I'll save everyone from the island devils
and be the world's hero.

00:09:23.188 --> 00:09:26.275
We didn't cover much ground tonight.

00:09:26.275 --> 00:09:29.027
Can't do much about the clouds.

00:09:29.027 --> 00:09:35.450
Will the King really not use the Founding
Titan, even if we break the wall?

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:39.371
What's the use asking now?
Trust Marley's research.

00:09:39.371 --> 00:09:42.833
That's right. We can't turn back.

00:09:42.833 --> 00:09:46.503
Tomorrow, we reach the wall... and then...

00:09:48.714 --> 00:09:53.760
Huh? What? Are you having second
thoughts about killing the devils?

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.638
Have you forgotten what they've done?

00:09:56.638 --> 00:10:02.352
We're the world's chosen Warriors
sent to punish the island devils!

00:10:05.147 --> 00:10:06.273
I'm sorry.

00:10:06.273 --> 00:10:07.232
Huh?

00:10:07.232 --> 00:10:13.488
Reiner, I'm sorry. You were never meant
to be chosen as a Warrior.

00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:21.038
I talked you up and criticized
my brother to influence their decision.

00:10:21.038 --> 00:10:22.247
Huh?

00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:26.752
I... just wanted to protect my brother.

00:10:26.752 --> 00:10:31.340
I'm sorry, Reiner... I'm sorry!

00:10:35.344 --> 00:10:40.265
Why... are you apologizing?

00:11:03.956 --> 00:11:09.211
Bertholdt...! Annie...! Marcel...!

00:11:09.211 --> 00:11:13.674
They got eaten!
They got eaten because of me!

00:11:13.674 --> 00:11:16.051
And I'll be next!

00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:18.929
This is where I'm gonna die!

00:11:22.683 --> 00:11:24.518
Not bad.

00:11:24.518 --> 00:11:29.857
This is a first. You actually beat me...
in a long-distance... race...

00:11:29.857 --> 00:11:30.691
Huh?

00:11:30.691 --> 00:11:37.531
If we... took out that Titan...
we wouldn't have... lost Jaw...

00:11:37.531 --> 00:11:41.702
Shit! Now Marcel's gone for good.

00:11:41.702 --> 00:11:45.205
They said there wouldn't be Titans this far out!

00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:46.832
We've gotta go home.

00:11:46.832 --> 00:11:47.708
Huh?

00:11:47.708 --> 00:11:52.713
Let's find Jaw and leave.
They would've changed back to human.

00:11:52.713 --> 00:11:57.718
Besides, without Marcel to lead,
this mission is doomed.

00:11:59.553 --> 00:12:01.221
Wait...

00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:02.639
We can't...

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:04.850
We can't!

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:09.479
We can't go home!
We've gotta continue the mission!

00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:16.361
Oh, yeah... If we go back now,
you'll just get eaten by the next Warrior.

00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:18.864
Not that I give a shit.

00:12:18.864 --> 00:12:20.741
You think only I will?

00:12:20.741 --> 00:12:21.575
Huh?

00:12:21.575 --> 00:12:25.412
That only I'll get the blame for running away?

00:12:25.412 --> 00:12:29.666
You guys are that certain
you won't get eaten, too?

00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:32.002
Catching Jaw won't be easy either.

00:12:32.002 --> 00:12:37.341
If they used its power and ran,
our Titans could never catch up.

00:12:37.341 --> 00:12:39.551
They can't control it right after becoming--

00:12:39.551 --> 00:12:43.430
You controlled the Colossal Titan, no problem!

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:46.975
Anyways, we're doomed at this rate!

00:12:46.975 --> 00:12:51.271
Without the Founding Titan,
there's no going home!

00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:56.151
Back there, if you were a fraction
as calm as you are now,

00:12:56.151 --> 00:12:59.655
we wouldn't have lost Marcel or Jaw.

00:12:59.655 --> 00:13:04.409
But you've got no problem intimidating
us to save your own ass, huh?!

00:13:05.786 --> 00:13:11.166
How about you come clean to Magath?!
Tell him, "It's all my fault!"

00:13:11.166 --> 00:13:14.545
Honorary Marleyan, my ass!
Chosen Warrior, my ass!

00:13:14.545 --> 00:13:19.800
Marleyans, Eldians! They're all liars!
Everyone only thinks about themselves!

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.262
I'm no different! I've gotta get home alive!

00:13:23.262 --> 00:13:28.642
If you feel guilty, just die!
Take all the blame and die!

00:13:41.947 --> 00:13:44.449
Reiner is dead.

00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:50.205
If we need Marcel, then I'll be Marcel.

00:13:50.205 --> 00:13:53.292
Please, stop this...

00:13:53.292 --> 00:13:57.838
This is the only way we'll be able
to go back home!

00:13:57.838 --> 00:14:03.427
Let's go back... together... to our hometown!

00:14:27.576 --> 00:14:29.786
Huh?

00:14:29.786 --> 00:14:32.497
I wanted to be a Warrior.

00:14:32.497 --> 00:14:38.086
I thought I could make my mom's wish
come true and we'd live with my father.

00:14:38.086 --> 00:14:42.841
But... I had a father who
didn't want any part of us.

00:14:42.841 --> 00:14:47.137
My mom had a dream she knew
would never come true.

00:14:47.137 --> 00:14:52.017
I should never have been chosen.
I should have died today.

00:14:52.935 --> 00:14:57.898
Why'd he apologize?
Why'd he save someone like me?

00:14:57.898 --> 00:15:01.652
No! I'm not ready for this to end!

00:15:01.652 --> 00:15:06.073
I still don't understand anything!

00:15:11.954 --> 00:15:13.372
Where is this?

00:15:13.372 --> 00:15:15.624
Inside Wall Rose.

00:15:17.042 --> 00:15:20.587
Annie... Bertholdt...

00:15:20.587 --> 00:15:22.464
I'm sorry.

00:15:22.464 --> 00:15:27.553
Marcel... I'll be the Warrior I should've been.

00:15:27.553 --> 00:15:32.015
You! What the hell did you come here for?!

00:15:32.015 --> 00:15:34.017
To save humanity!

00:15:34.017 --> 00:15:39.022
"A unit of child soldiers made up of Eldian
'devils.' They undergo harsh training and are
selected based on their grades, skills,
behavior, personality, and devotion to Marley."

00:15:41.066 --> 00:15:44.736
I lived in Wall Maria,
deep in the southeast mountains.

00:15:44.736 --> 00:15:46.947
It happened at dawn.

00:15:46.947 --> 00:15:52.160
The animals were all stirred up
and I heard a strange rumbling.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.039
Thinking it was footsteps,
I opened the window...

00:15:57.583 --> 00:16:01.336
The rest is a blur,
but I ran away on my horse.

00:16:01.336 --> 00:16:06.300
Leaving behind three kids
about the same age as you guys.

00:16:17.019 --> 00:16:23.734
Hey, missy. You've got good taste
in men to tail a geezer like me.

00:16:23.734 --> 00:16:26.153
I was born at an inn.

00:16:26.153 --> 00:16:31.909
My mom, who works there, talks about
my father so much, I know that it's you.

00:16:31.909 --> 00:16:37.289
Well, that's real touching. If you want
a hug from papa, put your hands up.

00:16:37.289 --> 00:16:39.917
How are you sure it's not you?

00:16:39.917 --> 00:16:46.632
I made a promise to my sister.
This joke of yours ain't making me laugh.

00:16:46.632 --> 00:16:49.176
You're so mean, papa!

00:16:54.681 --> 00:16:58.852
Hey now... Having a rebellious phase, are we?

00:17:00.187 --> 00:17:02.064
That's a new one.

00:17:02.064 --> 00:17:04.566
Are his legs saying snow today?

00:17:04.566 --> 00:17:07.819
Nah. That's the clear skies position.

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:11.573
Call it hail or you'll be late for muster.

00:17:11.573 --> 00:17:14.243
Wake up, Bertholdt!

00:17:14.243 --> 00:17:18.080
While you two snoozed
after playing with your friends,

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:21.250
I was busy crawling around
the capital's sewers.

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:24.878
I've hit my limit if he's around.

00:17:24.878 --> 00:17:27.047
Your limit, huh?

00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:33.136
Let's take what we know back to Marley.
They'll be happy to hear anything.

00:17:33.136 --> 00:17:35.556
Do you honestly think that?

00:17:35.556 --> 00:17:39.351
Not if it's all we have to show
after five years.

00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:42.187
Then, what are you saying we do?!

00:17:42.187 --> 00:17:44.314
Destroy Wall Rose.

00:17:44.314 --> 00:17:48.610
It's the only way we can
smoke out the Founding Titan.

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:52.364
A lot of your friends are gonna die.

00:17:52.364 --> 00:17:57.035
I keep telling you:
They're not friends--they're devils.

00:17:57.035 --> 00:18:02.040
But gaining their trust can't hurt.
And frankly, your aloof behavior isn't--

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:06.712
I'm gonna barf. Can you move
your face away from mine?

00:18:08.172 --> 00:18:13.552
I bet you're exhausted.
Sorry for always laying the burden on you.

00:18:13.552 --> 00:18:15.762
Let's call it a day.

00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:24.188
I keep having the same dream.

00:18:24.188 --> 00:18:27.983
I dream about the guy
who hung himself in the fields.

00:18:27.983 --> 00:18:34.406
Why did he tell us that story
right before he hung himself?

00:18:41.538 --> 00:18:45.000
Eren, take a break. You're gonna die.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.044
Shit!

00:18:47.044 --> 00:18:50.339
Reiner... How do you do it?

00:18:50.339 --> 00:18:54.551
How can I get like you and Mikasa?

00:18:54.551 --> 00:18:59.431
At this rate, I'll die without
doing a damn thing!

00:19:04.811 --> 00:19:07.856
Just do what you've gotta do.

00:19:07.856 --> 00:19:10.067
Keep moving forward.

00:19:11.401 --> 00:19:13.028
That's all we can do.

00:19:13.028 --> 00:19:16.240
Yeah. You're right.

00:19:17.824 --> 00:19:21.161
Aren't you gonna drive out every last Titan?

00:19:21.161 --> 00:19:23.247
I know you can do it.

00:19:38.804 --> 00:19:42.850
Shit! I can't let this go on!

00:19:50.482 --> 00:19:55.654
That's right... I still have those guys...

00:20:03.537 --> 00:20:05.289
The hospital...

00:20:05.289 --> 00:20:06.790
Hey!

00:20:11.962 --> 00:20:17.384
Um, I guess you're recovering well.
You're good enough to talk now.

00:20:17.384 --> 00:20:23.140
Kinda. I'm here for
emotional trauma, but it's a lie.

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:24.016
Huh?

00:20:24.016 --> 00:20:30.314
I said I lost my memory and can't
go home, but I just don't want to.

00:20:30.314 --> 00:20:33.609
It'd be hard to face my family now.

00:20:34.484 --> 00:20:36.361
Will you snitch on me?

00:20:36.361 --> 00:20:39.448
I wouldn't do that.

00:20:39.448 --> 00:20:43.577
You're hurt. Is it from your Warrior training?

00:20:43.577 --> 00:20:47.247
Yeah, but I won't become one.

00:20:47.247 --> 00:20:52.503
Another candidate is so talented,
I don't even stand a chance.

00:20:52.503 --> 00:20:54.213
That's good to hear.

00:20:54.213 --> 00:20:55.047
Huh?

00:20:55.047 --> 00:20:59.885
You're a good guy. I hope you live a long life.

00:21:01.386 --> 00:21:05.015
But I don't want them to be a Warrior.

00:21:05.015 --> 00:21:06.558
Why not?

00:21:08.519 --> 00:21:11.855
Is the other candidate a girl?

00:21:11.855 --> 00:21:17.819
She's famous around here.
She did incredible things in the war.

00:21:17.819 --> 00:21:22.074
Everyone's saying she should
be the next Armor.

00:21:22.074 --> 00:21:27.913
But since I'm powerless,
I can't do a damn thing about it.

00:21:31.291 --> 00:21:37.631
Every day I'm here, I think:
Why did it ever come to this?

00:21:37.631 --> 00:21:42.386
Damaged minds and bodies...
Their freedom taken away...

00:21:42.386 --> 00:21:45.138
Even losing themselves.

00:21:45.138 --> 00:21:50.727
If people knew it would come to this,
nobody would go to war.

00:21:50.727 --> 00:21:56.900
But most people are pushed by something,
forced to march into hell.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:04.366
That "something" wasn't their choice.
Their situation or others made them do it.

00:22:04.366 --> 00:22:10.163
But people who push their own backs
see a different kind of hell.

00:22:10.163 --> 00:22:13.959
They can see something beyond the hell.

00:22:13.959 --> 00:22:19.339
It might be hope.
It may even be another hell.

00:22:19.339 --> 00:22:24.595
Only those who keep moving
forward will ever know.

00:23:57.437 --> 00:24:03.318
Magath sorts out the military
for the Tybur family to tell the truth.

00:24:03.318 --> 00:24:12.096
As the festival enlivens the city,
an unexpected surprise awaits Reiner.
