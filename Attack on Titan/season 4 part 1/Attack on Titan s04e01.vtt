WEBVTT

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:28.070
Hey...

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:35.160
It's dangerous here...

00:00:38.247 --> 00:00:40.123
Fly away...

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.337
...somewhere... far away.

00:00:45.337 --> 00:00:46.380
Falco!

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.549
--Huh? What's my brother doing here?

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:49.591
--Good!
--Huh? What's my brother doing here?

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:50.884
You're still talking!

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:52.678
Colt!

00:00:52.678 --> 00:00:54.888
Time to run! Hold on!

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:06.733
Falco!

00:01:13.115 --> 00:01:15.492
Colt? Status report?

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:20.038
It was a direct hit.

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:26.003
The Eldian unit at the front got blown away.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.422
And the trench?

00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:31.592
It's hopeless! We can't dig any farther!

00:01:31.592 --> 00:01:36.263
We can't? You're calling the shots?
An Eldian, giving orders?

00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:39.683
Watch your tone with
Commander Magath, you mutt!

00:01:39.683 --> 00:01:43.145
But... at this rate...

00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:45.439
Falco, are you drunk?

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.774
He must've hit his head good.

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:51.945
Do you remember this war
we've been in for four years?

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:55.240
Who... are you guys?

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.618
Wait... Huh?

00:01:57.618 --> 00:02:01.622
Wasn't I flying around
with a sword just now?

00:02:01.622 --> 00:02:05.501
Like, whoosh!
And there were Titans that I--

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.797
Guess I'll just have to explain
everything from the start.

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:13.675
Listen up good, Falco.

00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:19.598
This battle is the climax of a war
that's lasted four years.

00:02:19.598 --> 00:02:22.851
If we can take out Fort Slava...

00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:28.607
Well, technically, if we sink the Mid-East
Allied Forces fleet in its port...

00:02:28.607 --> 00:02:33.445
...it'll spell victory for Marley
and end the war.

00:02:33.445 --> 00:02:38.116
But unless we take Fort Slava
sitting on the high ground,

00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:40.994
it's hopeless to attack the port.

00:02:41.912 --> 00:02:44.915
Why can't the Marley fleet just do it?

00:02:44.915 --> 00:02:48.544
Seriously, Zofia?!
You have faith in the fleet?!

00:02:48.544 --> 00:02:51.421
--It took those imbeciles four
years to control the seas!

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:52.548
--Ow! Ow, Ow! Ugh! Ow!
--It took those imbeciles four
years to control the seas!

00:02:52.548 --> 00:02:57.094
--Ow! Ow, Ow! Ugh! Ow!
--And guess what?! They lost
half their damn ships doing it!

00:02:57.094 --> 00:03:03.058
Now they're telling us they're too
chicken to attack till we take the fort?!

00:03:03.058 --> 00:03:05.477
Screw 'em all! They're pricks!

00:03:05.477 --> 00:03:09.147
Udo, you're gonna squeeze Falco's head off.

00:03:09.147 --> 00:03:11.984
Whoops! Sorry!

00:03:11.984 --> 00:03:17.990
So what's the deal? Why'd they send us
Warrior candidates to the front lines?

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.534
To judge us, obviously.

00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:24.788
To pick which one of us
will be the next Warrior.

00:03:26.915 --> 00:03:28.917
The time is coming.

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:33.046
Commander Magath chose the
front lines to be our final test.

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:36.592
He knows what's on the horizon.

00:03:36.592 --> 00:03:40.220
The plan to conquer Paradis
needs a main player--

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.265
the successor of the Armored Titan!

00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:20.070
"The Other Side of the Sea"

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:26.869
The Armored Titan...

00:05:27.661 --> 00:05:30.873
I wonder which one of us it'll be...

00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:38.881
Really, Gabi? Sounds to me like you're
saying none of us come close to you.

00:05:38.881 --> 00:05:41.633
Because you don't, right?

00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:45.012
Well, Gabi does have us beat.

00:05:45.012 --> 00:05:46.847
As far as our grades go.

00:05:46.847 --> 00:05:51.685
No. There's more to it than grades, Udo.
I keep telling you.

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:55.606
The difference between us
is that I'm prepared.

00:05:55.606 --> 00:05:58.025
To shoulder the fate of us Eldians...

00:05:58.025 --> 00:06:03.989
...and to slaughter that island of devils
who've done nothing but make us suffer!

00:06:03.989 --> 00:06:06.200
I'm gonna win this battle

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:11.371
and prove that the Eldians left
in this world are good Eldians!

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:16.627
I refuse to lose till I free everyone
from the internment zone!

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:23.383
Um, what exactly are you doing?

00:06:23.383 --> 00:06:25.219
Pretty cool, right?

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:27.971
It won't work, Commander Magath!

00:06:27.971 --> 00:06:34.269
We can't destroy the railroad without
the machine gun slaughtering us first.

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:37.773
They've got soldiers along
every inch of the trench.

00:06:37.773 --> 00:06:41.693
To top it off, the fort can
bombard us whenever they want.

00:06:41.693 --> 00:06:46.448
If we stay here too long,
they'll just shower us with shells!

00:06:46.448 --> 00:06:50.327
Do you have a better idea, Colt?

00:06:50.327 --> 00:06:54.122
We should let Jaw and Cart loose.

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:56.875
Galliard and Pieck will get it done.

00:06:56.875 --> 00:07:00.295
They'll wipe out the trench
and bunker in a flash.

00:07:00.295 --> 00:07:02.256
No.

00:07:02.256 --> 00:07:05.425
If we play our cards wrong, we lose.

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:09.054
Commander Magath, "that" showed up.

00:07:09.054 --> 00:07:11.723
What's "that"?

00:07:11.723 --> 00:07:14.977
That. An armored train.

00:07:14.977 --> 00:07:18.897
It's equipped with four
massive cannons in total.

00:07:18.897 --> 00:07:22.901
They're the Allied Forces' new
weapon--anti-Titan cannons.

00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:28.949
If one of those 150mm rounds hits
a Titan, it'll kill it in a single hit.

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:31.368
Even one of the Nine.

00:07:31.368 --> 00:07:36.707
But both of our Titans are incredibly fast.
The odds of hitting their nape--

00:07:36.707 --> 00:07:39.209
And if they did?

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:42.838
We would lose a Titan and a Warrior...

00:07:42.838 --> 00:07:46.383
...with no guarantee that
we get their powers back.

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:52.472
That's right. Just like our plan nine
years ago to retake the Founding Titan

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:56.727
resulted in us losing the
Colossal and Female Titan.

00:07:56.727 --> 00:08:02.441
The perceived hit to Marley's military
might is what sparked this war,

00:08:02.441 --> 00:08:06.028
putting the Paradis Island Operation on hold.

00:08:06.028 --> 00:08:10.282
What is it that makes our
motherland Marley so great?

00:08:10.282 --> 00:08:12.284
The Power of the Titans.

00:08:12.284 --> 00:08:16.955
Correct. Our nation won't last
if we keep losing 'em.

00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:22.544
The Power of the Titans is absolute,
and it must always remain that way.

00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:25.339
Prepare the Eldian unit for attack!

00:08:25.339 --> 00:08:26.340
Yes, sir!

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.091
Commander Magath! But that's--

00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:30.594
What's the matter, Eldian?

00:08:30.594 --> 00:08:34.932
Are you not warriors who
swore loyalty to Marley?

00:08:36.391 --> 00:08:39.978
This is a chance for the 800 Eldians here...

00:08:39.978 --> 00:08:44.274
...to serve our motherland with honor.

00:08:49.112 --> 00:08:51.990
All creatures drink of joy at nature's breast...

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:55.285
Everyone up! Prepare to attack!

00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:59.373
C'mon! Stand up!

00:08:59.373 --> 00:09:00.624
Eldians!

00:09:00.624 --> 00:09:06.588
Your mission is to assault and
destroy the enemy railroad!

00:09:06.588 --> 00:09:11.718
The suicide squad will rush the bunker
and disable the machine gun!

00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:17.349
Listen up! Let your actions purge the
disgrace of being spawn of the devil!

00:09:17.349 --> 00:09:22.062
This is your chance to be honored
by our great motherland Marley!

00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:23.814
Prove yourselves worthy!

00:09:23.814 --> 00:09:25.399
Yes, sir!

00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:28.902
You Warrior candidates are to stand by.

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:35.409
The 800-strong Eldian unit must
destroy the rail at whatever cost.

00:09:35.409 --> 00:09:39.329
As long as that armored
train is patrolling the fort,

00:09:39.329 --> 00:09:43.584
the Armored and Beast Titan
can't do what they came for.

00:09:43.584 --> 00:09:45.043
But...

00:09:45.961 --> 00:09:49.590
Colt. As the chosen successor
of the Beast Titan,

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:53.677
learn what it means to lead already.

00:10:01.143 --> 00:10:04.730
Perfect. We can destroy the train, too.

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:07.316
Please, let me take a shot at it.

00:10:07.316 --> 00:10:09.776
--Huh?
--Ta-da!

00:10:09.776 --> 00:10:14.406
If you'll let me, I can disable
the armored train all on my own!

00:10:15.741 --> 00:10:17.492
Hey, Gabi!

00:10:17.492 --> 00:10:23.081
How much do you think Marley's spent
training you all these years? Hell no.

00:10:23.081 --> 00:10:27.461
It's true... I am exceptional
compared to Falco and the others.

00:10:27.461 --> 00:10:32.382
There may never be another
Warrior as talented as I am.

00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:35.511
Not to mention one this cute.

00:10:35.511 --> 00:10:41.350
But if I succeed, we won't lose
the whole unit of 800 Eldians!

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:43.060
And if you fail?

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:48.899
You lose just one promising candidate
and seven hand grenades.

00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:58.242
If you think I'm more valuable than 800
Eldian soldiers, I totally understand.

00:10:58.242 --> 00:11:03.539
You love me so much that you'd rather sacrifice
the lives of 800 soldiers over me--

00:11:03.539 --> 00:11:05.165
Fine.

00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:07.876
Go ahead.

00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:09.253
Gabi, don't--

00:11:09.253 --> 00:11:16.093
I swear! I will prove to you that I'm worthy
of inheriting the Armored Titan!

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.640
What are you doing?

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.809
For this to succeed...

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:28.146
...please allow me to remove my armband.

00:11:28.146 --> 00:11:29.648
Very well.

00:11:36.405 --> 00:11:39.616
Hey, someone's coming this way.

00:11:41.785 --> 00:11:46.290
It's a woman. Girl, actually.
I think she's surrendering.

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.126
No, wait. She might be Eldian.

00:11:49.126 --> 00:11:54.381
It looks like something's wrong with her.
She's dragging her leg.

00:11:56.133 --> 00:12:00.345
What if she's Eldian?
Shoot her before she turns into a Titan.

00:12:00.345 --> 00:12:04.308
Screw that. If you wanna
shoot her, you do it!

00:12:05.517 --> 00:12:06.935
Shit.

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:13.400
What the--?

00:12:24.953 --> 00:12:26.163
Wait...

00:12:28.749 --> 00:12:30.042
Wait for it!

00:12:33.712 --> 00:12:35.047
Wait!

00:12:35.047 --> 00:12:36.131
She ain't moving.

00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:38.050
Who cares? Shoot her!

00:12:42.137 --> 00:12:46.391
Now's my chance!

00:12:55.651 --> 00:12:57.569
She really did it!

00:12:57.569 --> 00:12:59.738
Galliard! Hurry up!

00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:07.371
Dammit! You Marleyan cowards!

00:13:07.371 --> 00:13:11.208
This is why you bastards...

00:13:11.208 --> 00:13:14.253
...all deserve to die!

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:17.881
Gabi!

00:13:17.881 --> 00:13:19.508
Falco, don't!

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:40.237
Galliard! Huh?

00:13:54.918 --> 00:13:57.588
The armored train has been disabled.

00:13:57.588 --> 00:14:00.632
We'll now commence the airborne assault.

00:14:00.632 --> 00:14:03.010
Remember to stick to the plan.

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:07.556
Zeke will be our spear...
and Reiner will be our shield.

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:13.061
"Marley: A Military Dictatorship"
"Utilizing seven of the Nine Titans as
'Warriors,' Marley conquers enemy nations
with their overwhelming strength."

00:15:12.663 --> 00:15:14.164
Damn, that hurts!

00:15:14.164 --> 00:15:16.542
Why'd a Marleyan like me get shot at?!

00:15:16.542 --> 00:15:19.002
--What are you doing, Falco?
--You Eldians are supposed
to soak up the bullets!

00:15:19.002 --> 00:15:20.879
--Can't you tell?
--You Eldians are supposed
to soak up the bullets!

00:15:20.879 --> 00:15:24.007
He's in no shape to fight us anymore.

00:15:24.007 --> 00:15:25.843
Udo, gimme a tourniquet.

00:15:25.843 --> 00:15:27.177
--Here.
--Stupid kids.

00:15:27.177 --> 00:15:30.138
Screw the enemy.

00:15:30.138 --> 00:15:33.350
Is that supposed to be your selling point?

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:39.398
You really think obeying the laws of war
will earn you the spot of Armored Titan?

00:15:39.398 --> 00:15:42.025
It's not gonna help, you know.

00:15:42.025 --> 00:15:43.610
Like I care?

00:15:44.945 --> 00:15:46.613
Weirdo.

00:15:48.365 --> 00:15:50.075
He's saying something.

00:15:53.912 --> 00:15:58.417
Interpret, Udo. Say I stopped his
bleeding and that he'll be fine--

00:15:58.417 --> 00:16:00.335
"Don't touch me."

00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:02.629
"I'll be tainted."

00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:05.507
"You devil," he says.

00:16:15.893 --> 00:16:17.477
Retreat!

00:16:17.477 --> 00:16:18.937
Hurry up!

00:16:18.937 --> 00:16:20.230
Get away from the fort!

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.149
Don't get caught in it!

00:16:26.945 --> 00:16:28.739
It's begun.

00:16:59.228 --> 00:17:00.687
Ahem!

00:17:52.114 --> 00:17:54.658
No! Stop!

00:18:01.582 --> 00:18:05.878
Truly devils...

00:18:05.878 --> 00:18:11.466
Our Marleyan ancestors
were eaten, just like that.

00:18:11.466 --> 00:18:13.760
By you Eldians.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.304
Fire!

00:18:25.189 --> 00:18:27.774
The kinetic bombardment went well,

00:18:27.774 --> 00:18:32.863
but due to the altitude,
roughly half died on impact.

00:18:33.989 --> 00:18:38.118
A lot of the anti-Titan cannons
are still operational.

00:18:38.118 --> 00:18:44.374
Twenty-eight... Twenty-nine...
And now I know their locations. But still...

00:18:45.667 --> 00:18:47.669
More walls?

00:18:49.421 --> 00:18:53.050
I'm sick and tired... of walls.

00:19:11.527 --> 00:19:14.154
--It's the Armored!
--Kill it!

00:19:21.954 --> 00:19:23.539
Fire!

00:19:26.667 --> 00:19:31.004
Anti-Titan shells that
penetrate even my armor?

00:19:34.091 --> 00:19:36.802
What the--?! What hit me?!

00:19:37.928 --> 00:19:41.014
An armored train? There's another?

00:20:00.784 --> 00:20:02.035
Shit!

00:20:02.035 --> 00:20:03.495
Fire--

00:20:08.125 --> 00:20:09.793
Galliard!

00:20:09.793 --> 00:20:12.045
You son of a whore!

00:20:44.286 --> 00:20:45.537
Nice!

00:20:53.128 --> 00:20:56.048
They got it under control?

00:20:56.048 --> 00:21:00.344
Our defeat brought about this war, Reiner.

00:21:10.979 --> 00:21:14.107
Isn't war a terrible thing?

00:21:29.206 --> 00:21:33.961
Finally... With this, the war will be over.

00:21:41.927 --> 00:21:43.053
Huh?

00:21:43.053 --> 00:21:44.346
What?!

00:22:18.172 --> 00:22:20.924
With their fleet destroyed,

00:22:20.924 --> 00:22:25.179
the Mid-East Allied Forces signed
a peace treaty with Marley.

00:22:25.179 --> 00:22:30.350
The war spanning four years
ended in a Marleyan victory.

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:37.691
But as the world learned that the era
of Titan domination was coming to an end,

00:22:37.691 --> 00:22:43.906
Marley was pressed to obtain the
Founding Titan as quickly as possible.

00:22:45.073 --> 00:22:47.201
Oh, no...

00:22:50.913 --> 00:22:56.627
Thanks to the incredible bravery of the
Marley army, Fort Slava has fallen at last!

00:22:56.627 --> 00:22:58.212
Unbelievable!

00:22:58.212 --> 00:23:01.048
That's our Marley army for you!

00:23:57.521 --> 00:24:03.068
"Titans are not absolute."
Marley was shown this painful reality.

00:24:03.068 --> 00:24:05.863
Victory providing a brief joy,

00:24:05.863 --> 00:24:12.096
the warriors return to
their hometown of Liberio.
