WEBVTT

00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:25.250
I'm retaking the Founding Titan!

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:27.667
Eren!

00:00:30.542 --> 00:00:31.792
What?!

00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:38.792
Was that him?! Is that... Ackermann?!

00:00:43.208 --> 00:00:47.125
You're kidding! Can't you see I'm a Titan?!

00:00:48.625 --> 00:00:54.583
These guys are just humans,
yet they're coming to kill me?!

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.167
These guys... They're the devils of Paradis!

00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.875
Behind us! Retreat! Retreat!

00:01:08.875 --> 00:01:11.750
Shit! I can't shake 'em!

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:12.875
Tsk!

00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:27.792
Shit! That's here, too?

00:01:28.792 --> 00:01:30.750
The Cart Titan!

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.208
Pieck!

00:01:32.208 --> 00:01:34.542
Guess I made it in time.

00:01:34.542 --> 00:01:39.833
Like I thought, my machine gun gear
is perfect against their soldiers.

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:42.375
Made getting it worthwhile.

00:01:58.292 --> 00:01:59.667
Eren!

00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:18.792
That's him all right... The Beast Titan!

00:02:18.792 --> 00:02:20.292
Zeke!

00:02:28.542 --> 00:02:32.417
I'm gonna kill you, Eren Jaeger!

00:02:40.167 --> 00:02:44.833
Let none escape. Kill 'em all.

00:02:44.833 --> 00:02:48.125
Don't die on me. Survive!

00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:30.917
"Assault"

00:05:14.042 --> 00:05:16.083
This is...

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:38.667
Is that...? No way... Kruger?!

00:05:38.667 --> 00:05:42.708
No... Eren Jaeger!

00:05:42.708 --> 00:05:44.667
Damn you!

00:05:51.542 --> 00:05:53.625
Vice Chief Braun!

00:05:53.625 --> 00:05:55.167
Vice Chief!

00:05:57.458 --> 00:06:01.167
Vice Chief, I'm sorry! It's all my fault!

00:06:01.167 --> 00:06:02.458
Huh?

00:06:06.333 --> 00:06:09.625
He's alive, but...

00:06:09.625 --> 00:06:16.083
He's unconscious, but his body should
heal itself with the Power of the Titans.

00:06:16.083 --> 00:06:21.042
That is, as long as he
has the will to live, but...

00:06:22.458 --> 00:06:28.208
I'm sick of this... of myself! Just kill me!

00:06:33.875 --> 00:06:37.333
Vice Chief, I'll go get help.

00:06:39.417 --> 00:06:42.417
There're more than just enemies out there.

00:06:42.417 --> 00:06:47.833
There's me, Gabi, the others...
We're all on your side.

00:06:47.833 --> 00:06:51.458
Just hang in there, Vice Chief.

00:06:53.208 --> 00:06:54.625
Incoming!

00:06:58.833 --> 00:07:00.542
That jerk!

00:07:00.542 --> 00:07:01.833
Hey, wait!

00:07:01.833 --> 00:07:04.000
I'll slaughter him!

00:07:06.625 --> 00:07:09.333
Protect the war chief's rear!

00:07:09.333 --> 00:07:11.167
Right!

00:07:11.167 --> 00:07:12.333
Above!

00:07:12.333 --> 00:07:13.833
Bad angle!

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.375
Galliard! You're a lifesaver!

00:07:21.375 --> 00:07:22.958
--Thanks!
--Pock!

00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:25.375
That was close! Thanks!

00:07:25.375 --> 00:07:30.417
Be careful! I'm not sure where
Ackermann is! He's hiding somewhere!

00:07:30.417 --> 00:07:32.292
Are you serious?

00:07:32.292 --> 00:07:34.792
Porco! The War Hammer!

00:07:41.542 --> 00:07:48.458
She's crystallized like Annie.
My teeth are useless against that.

00:07:48.458 --> 00:07:51.708
But you're completely worn out now.

00:07:51.708 --> 00:07:57.917
If you had anything left,
you'd stab me right through my nape.

00:07:57.917 --> 00:08:01.792
You've got no more moves to play.

00:08:03.042 --> 00:08:05.667
But I have plenty.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:19.208
Shit! After all that, the bastard
still has more fight in him?

00:08:20.708 --> 00:08:23.750
But if we get him, the Founder...

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.708
What are you afraid of, Pock?

00:08:26.708 --> 00:08:27.500
--Huh?!

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.333
--There's no need for us to rush.
--Huh?!

00:08:28.333 --> 00:08:30.125
--There's no need for us to rush.

00:08:30.125 --> 00:08:34.417
We're the ones controlling the battlefield.

00:08:34.417 --> 00:08:37.333
They're being driven into a corner.

00:08:37.333 --> 00:08:43.792
They came here in ODM gear,
so their weapons and fuel are limited.

00:08:43.792 --> 00:08:49.167
In other words, they're stranded in
enemy territory without support.

00:08:49.167 --> 00:08:55.625
The Marley army has surrounded
the zone by now, so there's no escape.

00:08:55.625 --> 00:09:02.750
For starters, Paradis can't compete
against Marley in a real war anyways.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:08.583
But if we take out the Founder right here
and now, they can't do the rumbling!

00:09:08.583 --> 00:09:11.417
Their trump card is right in front of us!

00:09:11.417 --> 00:09:15.375
All the more reason to move cautiously!

00:09:15.375 --> 00:09:20.250
Right now, just focus on protecting
the war chief from Ackermann.

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:25.417
That's Pieck for you! Precisely!

00:09:35.375 --> 00:09:40.792
Eren Jaeger... is not my enemy.

00:09:48.542 --> 00:09:51.333
Someone else comes first.

00:09:51.333 --> 00:09:54.625
Show yourself, Levi.

00:09:54.625 --> 00:09:57.042
You're running out of time.

00:10:05.375 --> 00:10:09.000
Whoa! War Chief Zeke is something else!

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.208
Grice?!

00:10:11.208 --> 00:10:12.917
Commander Magath!

00:10:12.917 --> 00:10:14.542
Commander! Back in the venue--

00:10:14.542 --> 00:10:17.708
What are you doing?!
Are you okay?! You hurt?!

00:10:17.708 --> 00:10:19.625
I-I'm fine!

00:10:19.625 --> 00:10:21.667
Then get the hell out of here!

00:10:21.667 --> 00:10:26.750
Um, Vice Chief Braun is underground
behind the stage and isn't moving!

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:28.375
What?!

00:10:28.375 --> 00:10:32.667
It's my fault. He was... shielding me.

00:10:32.667 --> 00:10:34.708
Who did it to him?

00:10:34.708 --> 00:10:38.917
Eren... Jaeger.

00:10:46.667 --> 00:10:51.125
Hurry and dock! We need soldiers
at Liberio on the double!

00:10:51.125 --> 00:10:55.125
The whole zone's taking heavy damage! Huh?

00:10:55.125 --> 00:11:00.542
Hey! Get your ship outta here!
Can't you see the fleet?!

00:11:00.542 --> 00:11:01.833
Hey!

00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.875
Battle... ships?

00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:35.208
Snap out of it! Get the hell out of here!

00:11:35.208 --> 00:11:37.042
But, Commander Magath...

00:11:37.042 --> 00:11:40.500
It's the port. The only one who can do that--

00:11:41.625 --> 00:11:44.125
The Colossal Titan!

00:11:44.125 --> 00:11:48.125
The Titan they stole from Bertholdt!

00:11:48.125 --> 00:11:51.167
Those shits!

00:11:51.167 --> 00:11:55.375
Guess they didn't barge in here
without a plan after all!

00:11:55.375 --> 00:11:58.333
How about this, you damn devils?!

00:11:58.333 --> 00:12:02.750
If you lose the Founder,
your plans mean jack shit!

00:12:04.917 --> 00:12:08.958
The other Ackermann?! Outta my way!

00:12:12.542 --> 00:12:15.958
War Chief! Here comes their attack!

00:12:34.917 --> 00:12:36.792
--Zeke!
--Get down, Gabi!

00:12:43.667 --> 00:12:44.458
Zeke?

00:12:44.458 --> 00:12:47.167
Pieck! They're coming!

00:13:09.458 --> 00:13:10.292
What's wrong?

00:13:10.292 --> 00:13:11.500
Hey, Carlo!

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:15.625
Say something, man! Carlo!

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:23.833
You'll pay for that!

00:13:23.833 --> 00:13:26.208
This is for last time.

00:13:31.917 --> 00:13:34.083
Now! Fire!

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.625
Pieck!

00:13:41.167 --> 00:13:42.792
Guys!

00:13:57.333 --> 00:13:58.875
Pieck!

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
"The new ODM gear includes semi-automatic
pistols, special swords, and some soldiers are
even armed to fire shells, enabling superior
anti-personnel and anti-Titan combat."

00:14:54.500 --> 00:15:00.208
Are these the sort of sights that you saw?

00:15:00.208 --> 00:15:02.167
Bertholdt...

00:15:02.167 --> 00:15:04.833
No... Please, don't!

00:15:04.833 --> 00:15:07.125
Hurry! Finish it off!

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.042
Don't shoot! Please, stop!

00:15:24.792 --> 00:15:29.708
It missed?! Was it because of the steam, or...?

00:15:29.708 --> 00:15:32.667
Is it my fault I missed?

00:15:35.583 --> 00:15:37.083
Pieck!

00:15:37.083 --> 00:15:39.667
It's the Cart!

00:15:39.667 --> 00:15:41.583
Run... away.

00:15:41.583 --> 00:15:43.458
Pieck!

00:15:43.458 --> 00:15:45.625
Hurry!

00:15:47.708 --> 00:15:50.042
Protect Pieck!

00:15:50.042 --> 00:15:52.167
Eat shit, you devils!

00:15:52.167 --> 00:15:54.333
Braun! Give Grice a hand!

00:15:54.333 --> 00:15:55.792
Yes, sir!

00:15:57.583 --> 00:15:59.500
Look out! Stay back!

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.375
This way! Hurry!

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:07.083
Not only the war chief, but Pieck, too?!

00:16:07.083 --> 00:16:09.625
Dammit! Dammit! Dammit!

00:16:09.625 --> 00:16:13.292
Damn you!

00:16:38.625 --> 00:16:42.750
So fast! Ymir's Jaw was nothing like this.

00:16:44.833 --> 00:16:48.333
So this is the Jaw's power?

00:16:48.333 --> 00:16:50.583
I see.

00:16:50.583 --> 00:16:55.000
It's awful. Her body can't heal fast enough.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.750
But she's a Titan, so why?

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:04.000
Unlike the Armored Titan,
the Cart isn't exactly known for toughness.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.542
Reiner! Where is he?!

00:17:06.542 --> 00:17:10.167
You said Eren Jaeger got him
and he's not moving!

00:17:10.167 --> 00:17:12.417
Can't he fight? Hey!

00:17:12.417 --> 00:17:20.000
I don't know! He's still underground
behind the stage, but I...

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.333
I'm thinking we should leave Reiner out of it!

00:17:23.333 --> 00:17:26.667
What... are you saying?

00:17:26.667 --> 00:17:33.292
What about Udo and Zofia?
What about all the people Eren Jaeger killed?

00:17:40.583 --> 00:17:45.958
Hey, Gabi! Stay away from the window!
The enemy will see you!

00:17:47.333 --> 00:17:50.292
Huh?

00:17:50.292 --> 00:17:51.792
Commander!

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:54.458
Huh?

00:18:04.333 --> 00:18:05.750
Wha--?!

00:18:10.333 --> 00:18:13.583
Commander! I've spotted the guide lights!

00:18:13.583 --> 00:18:17.833
Thank goodness. So far,
the operation's going as planned.

00:18:17.833 --> 00:18:20.417
We're counting on you, Onyankopon.

00:18:20.417 --> 00:18:22.875
Leave it to me, Hange!

00:18:22.875 --> 00:18:25.833
Sneak through the zone, low and slow.

00:18:25.833 --> 00:18:29.292
We'll follow the lights and pick everyone up.

00:18:29.292 --> 00:18:33.458
We've only got one shot,
so any stragglers are out of luck.

00:18:33.458 --> 00:18:37.125
If we're not shot down first, that is.

00:18:37.125 --> 00:18:43.083
Talk about a reckless plan.
You get possessed by Erwin or something?

00:18:43.083 --> 00:18:48.417
I can only hope. If it means
his strength is with me.

00:18:48.417 --> 00:18:51.125
Now that it's come to this,

00:18:51.125 --> 00:18:57.000
if we can't recover Eren and the others,
there's no future for us.

00:19:00.042 --> 00:19:01.375
Jean, it's here.

00:19:01.375 --> 00:19:03.333
Yeah. Right on time.

00:19:03.333 --> 00:19:08.833
You guys think you're escaping on that?
Not happening!

00:19:10.458 --> 00:19:11.625
Shoot!

00:19:45.125 --> 00:19:46.708
Huh?!

00:19:53.167 --> 00:19:55.708
H-Hey!

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:01.417
You're kidding me!

00:20:05.292 --> 00:20:06.792
Stop!

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:14.667
Stop it!

00:20:24.375 --> 00:20:29.542
Please, stop!

00:20:45.583 --> 00:20:47.500
What happened?

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:53.250
The War Hammer was eaten.
And the Jaw Titan is next.

00:21:00.333 --> 00:21:04.583
It can't be... Not Galliard, too.

00:21:13.125 --> 00:21:14.000
No...

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
--Huh?
--No!

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.208
Reiner!

00:21:19.208 --> 00:21:23.958
Help us!

00:21:23.958 --> 00:21:25.333
--Hey...
--Galliard is about to get eaten!

00:21:25.333 --> 00:21:29.792
--Galliard is about to get eaten!

00:21:29.792 --> 00:21:34.625
Help us!

00:21:34.625 --> 00:21:37.208
Reiner!

00:21:37.208 --> 00:21:39.208
--Shut up.
--Reiner!

00:21:39.208 --> 00:21:40.417
--Reiner!

00:21:40.417 --> 00:21:42.792
--Can you please be quiet?
--Reiner!

00:21:42.792 --> 00:21:49.458
--Reiner!
--Reiner!

00:21:49.458 --> 00:21:53.833
--Please! Be quiet!
--Reiner!
--Reiner!

00:21:53.833 --> 00:21:54.875
--Help us!

00:21:54.875 --> 00:21:58.542
--Hey! Cut it out, you brats!
--Reiner!
--Help us!

00:21:58.542 --> 00:22:00.375
--Hey! Cut it out!
--Reiner!
--Help us!

00:22:00.375 --> 00:22:01.667
--Help us!

00:22:01.667 --> 00:22:06.167
--Why... won't you guys...
--Help us!

00:22:23.333 --> 00:22:25.083
...just let me...

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:29.292
...die in peace?!
