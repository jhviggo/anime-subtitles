00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.583
Well, your father needs to get going.

00:00:27.583 --> 00:00:31.375
Be good kids and listen to your big sister.

00:00:31.375 --> 00:00:33.625
--Where are you going?
--Don't leave!

00:00:33.625 --> 00:00:36.042
--Bring me something!
--I wanna go, too!

00:00:36.042 --> 00:00:39.625
--No fair!
--Let me come with you!
--Pretty please!

00:00:39.625 --> 00:00:43.417
Sorry. I'm afraid not this time.

00:00:43.417 --> 00:00:47.208
--Huh? How come?
--It's not fair!

00:00:47.208 --> 00:00:52.625
Behave, you guys! Don't be selfish!
You're making it hard for him!

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:57.292
Fine... Make sure all the kids get along.

00:00:57.292 --> 00:01:00.208
Yup! Good luck with your work!

00:01:00.208 --> 00:01:03.958
Thanks. I think it's time I head out.

00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.333
--Take care!
--Bring me something!

00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.083
Darling...

00:01:10.917 --> 00:01:14.833
I'm sorry. Take care of the kids.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.667
Let's go.

00:01:26.208 --> 00:01:30.833
I suppose if I'm attacked,
it'll be during the speech?

00:01:30.833 --> 00:01:35.375
I can't say for sure,
but that seems the most likely.

00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:40.333
Only then will most of our brass
be gathered in one spot.

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:46.792
However, it's protocol to make escape
plans at the last moment for security.

00:01:46.792 --> 00:01:49.917
Naturally, VIPs will use carriages.

00:01:49.917 --> 00:01:53.583
Let's sit them at the
"special seats" on the edge.

00:01:53.583 --> 00:01:57.208
Clump them together as much as possible.

00:01:58.167 --> 00:02:00.667
Are you sure about this?

00:02:00.667 --> 00:02:06.333
Compared to our predecessors,
the Tyburs haven't been playing around.

00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:10.292
We've been building relations
with the world's elite,

00:02:10.292 --> 00:02:17.083
improving the reputation of Eldians,
and watching Paradis Island's movements.

00:02:17.083 --> 00:02:21.042
But we should've been watching
our own backyard.

00:02:21.042 --> 00:02:26.167
Before we knew it, we had enemies
crossing the sea and at our necks.

00:02:26.167 --> 00:02:30.500
At this point, they might get
sliced at any moment.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.125
It's the conspirators working with
Paradis who I fear most.

00:02:35.125 --> 00:02:38.667
We still don't know who they are.

00:02:38.667 --> 00:02:43.458
As you know, our motherland
Marley has many enemies.

00:02:43.458 --> 00:02:45.958
Some, in our own military.

00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:50.167
We'll smoke them out
by lighting a fire under their asses.

00:02:50.167 --> 00:02:56.250
We can plan for their attack
and use it to our advantage.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.333
Unless you have a better idea,
we proceed as planned.

00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:05.625
Even if they take the bait,
we lose way too much.

00:03:05.625 --> 00:03:08.500
We'll sacrifice incompetent officers.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.417
If the enemy's goal is to damage
Marley's military, it works perfectly.

00:03:14.417 --> 00:03:20.250
When you rebuild the military, the party
will approve whomever you choose.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.208
But so many will die.

00:03:23.208 --> 00:03:28.000
Most of them will be Eldians!
They're spawn of the devil!

00:03:31.833 --> 00:03:35.583
Don't change on me now, Commander Magath.

00:03:35.583 --> 00:03:42.458
You've sent countless Eldians marching
into machine guns and land mines.

00:03:42.458 --> 00:03:46.250
Why does it matter whether
they wear uniforms or not?

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.458
Just keep doing what you've always done.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.625
Let me say one thing:

00:03:54.625 --> 00:04:00.958
This isn't war. We don't know the enemy,
their goal, or how they'll attack.

00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:05.083
Plus, the venue will be packed
with a huge crowd.

00:04:07.708 --> 00:04:13.167
Lord Tybur, I doubt I'll be able to protect you.

00:04:13.167 --> 00:04:19.708
If we proceed, you will die.
They won't pass you up as bait.

00:04:23.125 --> 00:04:27.125
Of course. I'm prepared for that.

00:04:27.125 --> 00:04:31.750
Unless I stand on stage,
the world will not take notice.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.167
The military, newspapers, and
ambassadors won't gather in one place.

00:04:37.167 --> 00:04:44.375
Above all, the Eldians of the internment
zone and I must be made tragic victims.

00:04:46.208 --> 00:04:49.500
Victims of an "unforeseen attack."

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:55.250
If I am the sole survivor,
the world will not become our ally.

00:05:01.875 --> 00:05:06.333
There's no doubt that Eldians
are spawn of the devil.

00:05:06.333 --> 00:05:11.208
And there's no doubt
that we are devils ourselves.

00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:12.958
"The War Hammer Titan"

00:07:30.458 --> 00:07:32.958
Get up, Gabi! Udo!

00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:35.000
Stand up! Hurry!

00:07:37.625 --> 00:07:39.833
Zofia?

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
--Zofia!
--Udo, don't!

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.833
--Zofia!
--Udo, get back!

00:07:47.792 --> 00:07:49.875
Hurry! We gotta lift this!

00:07:49.875 --> 00:07:51.208
Udo!

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:17.833
Brother... You fulfilled the
Tyburs' duty admirably.

00:08:42.875 --> 00:08:46.125
Commander! The War Hammer is getting wrecked!

00:08:46.125 --> 00:08:47.833
Commander! The Warriors are missing!

00:08:47.833 --> 00:08:49.625
--General Calvi and the brass are dead!

00:08:49.625 --> 00:08:51.042
--We should check for survivors!
--General Calvi and the brass are dead!

00:08:51.042 --> 00:08:51.875
--We should check for survivors!
--It's dangerous here!

00:08:51.875 --> 00:08:52.792
--We need orders!
--It's dangerous here!

00:08:52.792 --> 00:08:54.292
Commander!

00:08:57.042 --> 00:08:58.958
Commander?

00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:04.958
It's a useless plink, but this signals
the beginning of Marley's counterattack.

00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:08.167
To think they'd make such a grand entrance.

00:09:08.167 --> 00:09:15.167
What's more, it looks to be the usurper
of the Founding Titan--the Attack Titan.

00:09:15.167 --> 00:09:19.292
Eren Jaeger has come in person!

00:09:19.292 --> 00:09:24.625
Saves us a trip to the island.
Get in position! Prepare for battle!

00:09:24.625 --> 00:09:26.333
Yes, sir!

00:09:41.833 --> 00:09:44.292
Hey, what's all the ruckus about?

00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:47.292
What are you doing?! We have to get out--

00:09:55.167 --> 00:10:00.583
Remember it, people.
I'm the one who took the first shot.

00:10:04.792 --> 00:10:08.292
Shit! What the hell?! It's a battlefield now!

00:10:08.292 --> 00:10:10.417
Colt! How's Udo?!

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.417
Not good. He needs the hospital.

00:10:16.417 --> 00:10:19.458
Udo! You're kidding!

00:10:19.458 --> 00:10:25.083
Shit! Falco! Where are you?!

00:10:28.083 --> 00:10:30.833
What's happening out there?!

00:10:30.833 --> 00:10:35.208
By these tremors, I'd guess Titans are fighting.

00:10:35.208 --> 00:10:37.375
Are you serious?!

00:10:37.375 --> 00:10:41.083
Us being trapped down here
is answer enough.

00:10:41.083 --> 00:10:43.042
We've gotta get out somehow.

00:10:43.042 --> 00:10:44.542
How?

00:10:44.542 --> 00:10:46.208
What the hell?

00:10:46.208 --> 00:10:47.208
You're late!

00:10:47.208 --> 00:10:49.000
--Pieck!
--You okay?!

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.708
Throw us a rope!

00:10:50.708 --> 00:10:51.708
Got it!

00:10:51.708 --> 00:10:54.583
The Panzer Unit? How'd they know?

00:10:54.583 --> 00:10:58.292
I told 'em to follow since Beardy was shady.

00:10:58.292 --> 00:11:00.000
Back then?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.417
This soldier seems shady. Follow behind us.

00:11:04.417 --> 00:11:07.000
A Titan attacked during the speech!

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000
For real?!

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.958
The War Hammer is fending it off!

00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:12.583
Where's the Cart's gear?

00:11:12.583 --> 00:11:15.292
At HQ! We'll have it done in 15!

00:11:15.292 --> 00:11:16.333
Make it 10!

00:11:16.333 --> 00:11:17.250
Roger!

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:18.583
I'm going ahead.

00:11:18.583 --> 00:11:22.083
Wait, Porco. Before you rush in...

00:11:22.083 --> 00:11:23.750
What the--?!

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:27.375
You're kidding... There's no way!

00:12:11.208 --> 00:12:14.333
--Yeah, it hit!
--Anti-Titan artillery packs a punch!

00:12:14.333 --> 00:12:16.208
--Reload!
--Commander Magath,
let's finish off Eren Jaeger!

00:12:16.208 --> 00:12:17.667
--Commander Magath,
let's finish off Eren Jaeger!

00:12:17.667 --> 00:12:20.542
Without the Founding Titan, they're doomed!

00:12:20.542 --> 00:12:21.958
--No.
--Huh?

00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:25.417
Killing the Founding Titan
only postpones the problem.

00:12:25.417 --> 00:12:31.250
We need to have the War Hammer eat it!
We're here to ensure that happens!

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.917
B-But, Commander...

00:12:33.917 --> 00:12:37.833
I don't think the War Hammer
is trying to eat it.

00:12:46.458 --> 00:12:48.667
The War Hammer's a monster!

00:12:48.667 --> 00:12:50.375
It beat the Attack Titan!

00:12:50.375 --> 00:12:52.625
The War Hammer wins!

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:02.417
So that's Eren Jaeger, huh?

00:13:09.917 --> 00:13:12.875
It's really gonna finish him off!

00:13:14.542 --> 00:13:18.333
Usurper, Eren Jaeger.

00:13:18.333 --> 00:13:22.500
Do you have any last words?

00:13:30.875 --> 00:13:33.250
Now or never, Mikasa.

00:14:12.375 --> 00:14:15.792
You guys actually came.

00:14:15.792 --> 00:14:18.667
Eren, please...

00:14:18.667 --> 00:14:20.458
Come home.

00:14:21.917 --> 00:14:26.917
"The War Hammer Titan is encased in a shell
created by its extraordinary hardening abilty.
It can use that same hardening ability to
construct any weapon it envisions at will."

00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:33.458
With the chain of command broken,
our military will be put to the test!

00:14:33.458 --> 00:14:38.583
Call down all our troops doing
special training in the mountains!

00:14:38.583 --> 00:14:44.000
Bring the fleet, too! Converge on top
of 'em with 30,000 soldiers!

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.375
I want Liberio surrounded!

00:14:46.375 --> 00:14:51.208
Don't let the Founding Titan
or a single island devil escape!

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.750
Have fun while it lasts.
There's no future for you now.

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:04.917
With this massacre, you just ensured
every major nation gets involved now.

00:15:04.917 --> 00:15:11.000
The world will see the Eldian Empire
as a threat, just like Willy planned.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.417
Now, no one's gonna let you live.

00:15:15.375 --> 00:15:20.000
But even they must've
known that going into this.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.917
Which means...

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.375
You damn devils!

00:15:32.375 --> 00:15:34.458
Shoot 'em down!

00:15:39.542 --> 00:15:42.000
Those morons!

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.917
Hey! You gonna burn the whole zone down?!

00:15:44.917 --> 00:15:50.208
What part of keeping civilian casualties
to a minimum don't you get, Floch?!

00:15:50.208 --> 00:15:54.083
The only thing here are enemies
and places they live!

00:15:54.083 --> 00:15:59.250
Did you forget how they massacred
humanity inside the walls?!

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:03.042
We were eaten alive, dammit!
They've got it coming!

00:16:03.042 --> 00:16:05.000
You're still saying that?

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.750
Look. Eren's telling us something--to fight!

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:13.250
We shouldn't just wait
for our deaths in the walls.

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:17.167
What we need... is a devil like him!

00:16:17.167 --> 00:16:23.833
Eren... Do you have any idea what you've done?

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.375
You killed civilians.

00:16:30.375 --> 00:16:33.375
You killed children, too.

00:16:34.292 --> 00:16:38.042
You've done things that can't be undone.

00:16:44.208 --> 00:16:48.167
Mikasa, it's not over yet.

00:16:48.167 --> 00:16:51.708
Impossible! I blew away its nape!

00:16:51.708 --> 00:16:55.125
And I crushed it with all my strength.

00:16:55.125 --> 00:16:57.583
Yet, it's not dead.

00:17:02.917 --> 00:17:04.750
I see...

00:17:06.792 --> 00:17:12.958
The War Hammer Titan... It uses
hardening to make whatever it needs.

00:17:12.958 --> 00:17:17.958
That must be why it won't die,
no matter what we do.

00:17:17.958 --> 00:17:24.083
Mikasa, get its attention.
If this works, I can eat the War Hammer.

00:17:26.625 --> 00:17:30.792
Sorry, we're at full capacity!
And the kid's dead already!

00:17:30.792 --> 00:17:33.167
Come on! At least look at him!

00:17:33.167 --> 00:17:36.500
Aren't you a candidate? Take a look around you!

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.083
We need you, doc!

00:17:38.083 --> 00:17:40.000
Okay, I'm coming!

00:17:43.417 --> 00:17:47.375
Gabi, stay with your family.

00:17:47.375 --> 00:17:53.667
I'm not sure if anywhere's safe.
Get as far from the plaza as possible.

00:17:53.667 --> 00:17:55.542
I'm gonna look for Falco and--

00:17:55.542 --> 00:17:57.333
I'm going, too.

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:04.292
Because I don't understand
why Udo and Zofia had to die.

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:06.583
Wait, Gabi! Don't!

00:18:12.208 --> 00:18:15.667
Hey, stop! You're headed towards a war zone!

00:18:15.667 --> 00:18:16.625
Gabi!

00:18:16.625 --> 00:18:18.500
What are you doing here?!

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:22.833
Mr. Gate Guard! I'll fight, so let me through!

00:18:22.833 --> 00:18:27.042
Don't be an idiot, brat!
You head back home and...

00:18:27.917 --> 00:18:29.417
--What the--?!
--Enemy attack?!

00:18:29.417 --> 00:18:30.875
From where?!

00:18:33.708 --> 00:18:35.542
--They're above!
--Shit!

00:18:35.542 --> 00:18:37.583
Go on, Gabi! Run!

00:18:39.042 --> 00:18:40.667
Hey, are you--?

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.208
Mister...

00:18:58.708 --> 00:19:01.750
This side's blocked off. Let's go, Sasha.

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:05.458
Conny... Did you forget about the lights?

00:19:05.458 --> 00:19:07.417
Oh, right.

00:19:28.875 --> 00:19:31.542
Jean, we stalled the reinforcements.

00:19:31.542 --> 00:19:32.958
And the lights?

00:19:32.958 --> 00:19:34.917
They're all in place.

00:19:34.917 --> 00:19:36.583
Are things going well?

00:19:36.583 --> 00:19:38.667
For the time being.

00:19:44.458 --> 00:19:48.042
As long as we take that thing out in time.

00:19:48.042 --> 00:19:52.458
But who knows?
Anything can happen at this point.

00:19:56.750 --> 00:20:03.833
What's to come when this battle is over?
For us to know, we have to survive.

00:20:20.667 --> 00:20:23.792
I knew something felt off to me.

00:20:23.792 --> 00:20:28.250
It didn't seem right how
the War Hammer appeared.

00:20:29.333 --> 00:20:33.875
And that's because its body
formed from the feet up.

00:20:35.333 --> 00:20:41.042
Not from its nape, but from
underneath the stage.

00:20:44.292 --> 00:20:47.375
Which means its body is...

00:21:17.583 --> 00:21:21.667
Shoot! The War Hammer
is about to get eaten!

00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:37.167
I've been waiting for this moment!
I'm retaking the Founding Titan!

00:21:38.125 --> 00:21:39.625
Eren!

00:21:42.458 --> 00:21:45.333
What?! I can't bite?!

00:21:47.833 --> 00:21:52.208
Was that him?! Is that... Ackermann?!

00:21:57.125 --> 00:21:59.125
This ain't looking good!

00:22:09.708 --> 00:22:13.958
You're kidding! Can't you see I'm a Titan?!

00:22:16.583 --> 00:22:22.750
These guys are just humans,
yet they're coming to kill me?!

00:22:24.292 --> 00:22:29.375
These guys... They're the devils of Paradis!

00:24:02.625 --> 00:24:05.083
The devils of Paradis.

00:24:05.083 --> 00:24:10.458
The Warriors take a stand against
soldiers who soar through the air.

00:24:10.458 --> 00:24:14.833
Will Gabi and Falco's cries reach Reiner?

00:24:14.833 --> 00:24:17.003
Next episode: "Assault."
