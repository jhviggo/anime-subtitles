WEBVTT

00:00:25.708 --> 00:00:33.333
I doubt this is something you want
to hear, but just listen.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.958
Three years ago...

00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:40.167
Back then, we still might've been able
to change something.

00:00:40.167 --> 00:00:43.208
"3 Years Ago"

00:00:46.375 --> 00:00:51.500
Captain! The team that went ashore
hasn't made contact for two hours!

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.417
Hmm. Prepare to send teams two and three.

00:00:55.417 --> 00:00:56.708
Yes, sir!

00:00:56.708 --> 00:01:01.292
This island of devils defeated the Warrior unit.

00:01:01.292 --> 00:01:05.458
Whatever the cost,
Marley must learn what happened.

00:01:09.292 --> 00:01:11.375
Hang on!

00:01:13.292 --> 00:01:16.833
I-It's a devil!

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:38.292
Hello, friends from Marley!
Welcome to Paradis Island!

00:01:38.292 --> 00:01:44.417
I'm Hange, here to greet our guests
who've come so far across the sea!

00:01:44.417 --> 00:01:48.458
Now, step this way and join us for some tea!

00:01:48.458 --> 00:01:54.792
By the way, we're already friends
with this guest that arrived before you!

00:01:54.792 --> 00:01:58.458
Isn't that right, Nicolo?!

00:01:59.417 --> 00:02:03.542
Captain! Forget about me
and shoot these devils!

00:02:03.542 --> 00:02:06.167
--What are you saying, Nicolo?!

00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:08.167
--Captain!
--What are you saying, Nicolo?!

00:02:08.167 --> 00:02:11.250
He's tired of your shitty skit.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.500
Nicolo! Understand this, you devils!
Marley doesn't mingle with filthy blood!

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.042
Go drink your pig piss with your filthy friends!

00:02:22.042 --> 00:02:27.000
Aww! Hey! You sure you wanna be rude to us?!

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.792
Can't you see the Titan behind you?!

00:02:35.042 --> 00:02:40.458
We'll never yield to you devils!
Say hello to this!

00:02:53.708 --> 00:02:54.917
Hands up, Yelena!

00:02:54.917 --> 00:02:57.292
Drop your weapons.

00:02:57.292 --> 00:02:58.542
What are you...?

00:02:58.542 --> 00:03:00.625
Do as she says.

00:03:00.625 --> 00:03:04.625
Hange, I'd be happy to accept your invitation.

00:03:04.625 --> 00:03:06.750
Let's have tea.

00:03:10.708 --> 00:03:14.917
I've longed to meet you, Eren.

00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:49.958
"Brave Volunteers"

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.125
That huge lady of theirs
shot and killed her comrade.

00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:57.083
Wonder what her goal is.

00:04:57.083 --> 00:05:01.750
Who knows? Whether friend or foe,
she's not to be trusted.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.292
No napping, Sasha.

00:05:03.292 --> 00:05:09.333
But their willingness to share
information is unbelievably lucky for us.

00:05:09.333 --> 00:05:12.875
Yeah, we've been really lucky.

00:05:12.875 --> 00:05:16.250
We stopped their landing by pure chance.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.375
If Marley comes in force, we'll be screwed.

00:05:20.375 --> 00:05:22.208
We've gotta do something.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.042
Ah, I see! That's how it shoots a bunch!

00:05:31.042 --> 00:05:35.458
That's standard-issue in Marley.

00:05:35.458 --> 00:05:39.667
The Marley army has
20,000 soldiers per division.

00:05:39.667 --> 00:05:43.625
With 50 divisions, that's 1,000,000 soldiers.

00:05:43.625 --> 00:05:49.250
There's also the navy with three fleets,
each comprised of 21 battleships.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.792
They've made tremendous progress in
new weapons and aerial warfare as well.

00:05:54.792 --> 00:05:56.542
Aerial...?

00:05:56.542 --> 00:05:57.792
Tsk!

00:05:57.792 --> 00:06:00.750
Don't freak out or they'll think we're weak.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:01.833
I know!

00:06:01.833 --> 00:06:07.167
In other words, vehicles allowing one
to attack the enemy from the sky.

00:06:07.167 --> 00:06:08.625
Huh?! From the sky?!

00:06:08.625 --> 00:06:10.500
Hey!

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:19.042
If Marley had such capabilities this whole time,
why haven't they attacked in over a year?

00:06:19.042 --> 00:06:21.625
There are two main reasons.

00:06:21.625 --> 00:06:24.792
One being the Pure Titans released here.

00:06:24.792 --> 00:06:30.917
Even with the latest weapons,
they would hinder a land assault.

00:06:30.917 --> 00:06:35.292
They were used as a tool to
confine Eldians within the walls,

00:06:35.292 --> 00:06:39.833
but in turn, they've protected
Eldia from invasion.

00:06:39.833 --> 00:06:43.083
Yeah. Well, ain't that funny?

00:06:43.083 --> 00:06:48.625
Though dawn is coming soon,
and that's when Titans are active.

00:06:48.625 --> 00:06:53.500
But if we're way out here,
sipping on tea outside the walls,

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:58.125
you must have killed all
the Titans roaming around.

00:06:58.125 --> 00:07:00.375
Is that true?

00:07:00.375 --> 00:07:05.000
And what if it is?
You gonna report it to Marley?

00:07:06.542 --> 00:07:11.167
No, it blows away my expectations.

00:07:11.167 --> 00:07:13.500
And the second reason?

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.750
Currently, Marley is at war
with multiple nations.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.917
They can't be bothered with Paradis.

00:07:20.917 --> 00:07:24.833
You defeated the Warrior unit,
the pride of Marley,

00:07:24.833 --> 00:07:30.667
and captured two of their main weapons,
the Colossal and Female Titans.

00:07:30.667 --> 00:07:39.083
Marley's many enemies took notice
and were quick to unite and declare war.

00:07:39.083 --> 00:07:43.875
If you guys are secret agents
who infiltrated Marley,

00:07:43.875 --> 00:07:48.125
I'm guessing you came
from conquered nations?

00:07:49.042 --> 00:07:56.208
Oh, I'm right?! If you're going up against
Marley, I bet you've got big backers!

00:07:57.125 --> 00:08:01.833
We're not secret agents or anything of the sort.

00:08:01.833 --> 00:08:08.000
We were powerless. Marley took our
homes and forced us to be soldiers.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.750
We were close to losing hope
at ever striking back.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:16.208
Until we met him.

00:08:17.167 --> 00:08:21.917
A Titan that people of the
world feared, calling it a devil.

00:08:21.917 --> 00:08:25.083
But I saw something completely different...

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:31.542
A god. One that gave hope
to the powerless.

00:08:34.458 --> 00:08:38.958
Under Zeke Jaeger's command,
we shot our superiors.

00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:46.083
We're the Anti-Marleyan Volunteers.
Our goal: To free the Eldian people.

00:08:47.417 --> 00:08:50.792
That concludes Zeke Jaeger's requests.

00:08:50.792 --> 00:08:54.708
For the sake of all Eldians
whose existence is threatened--

00:08:54.708 --> 00:08:57.792
Absurd! I don't even want to hear it!

00:08:57.792 --> 00:08:59.833
He's the Beast Titan!

00:08:59.833 --> 00:09:04.000
He turned the people of Ragako
into Titans and incited a panic!

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.125
This is the same person who
nearly annihilated the Scouts!

00:09:09.125 --> 00:09:13.833
His one and only goal is to
retake the Founding Titan.

00:09:13.833 --> 00:09:18.792
Since he can't do it by force,
he'll attempt it diplomatically.

00:09:18.792 --> 00:09:25.708
He should know we'll expect that.
Let's hear what else he has to say.

00:09:25.708 --> 00:09:31.208
According to Zeke, he has a secret
plan to solve the Eldian issue.

00:09:31.208 --> 00:09:37.750
To carry it out, it requires the Founding
Titan and a Titan with royal blood.

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:40.792
With both, the world can be saved.

00:09:40.792 --> 00:09:46.458
However, he will only reveal the plan
when his conditions are met.

00:09:46.458 --> 00:09:47.583
Bullshit!

00:09:47.583 --> 00:09:50.500
He must think we're idiots!

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:51.458
Eren?

00:09:51.458 --> 00:09:55.250
He's telling the truth. I remember...

00:09:55.250 --> 00:10:00.292
The one time I was able to use
the Founding Titan's power

00:10:00.292 --> 00:10:04.792
was when I touched a Titan with royal blood.

00:10:04.792 --> 00:10:11.208
That Titan had to be my father's
other wife, Dina Fritz.

00:10:11.208 --> 00:10:18.250
Zeke, Dina's son, must have figured out
a way to elude the vow renouncing war.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:22.833
The one single hope remaining for us Eldians:

00:10:22.833 --> 00:10:30.000
To wake the millions of Titans sleeping
in the walls and activate the rumbling.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.417
You... Why did you keep quiet
about this for so long?

00:10:35.417 --> 00:10:38.667
I was concerned for Historia's safety.

00:10:38.667 --> 00:10:44.875
I couldn't let her get made into a Titan
based on some hunch of mine.

00:10:44.875 --> 00:10:47.542
Yeah, it was careless of me.

00:10:47.542 --> 00:10:49.375
We'll talk about it later.

00:10:49.375 --> 00:10:55.292
But if that's really true,
Zeke's secret plan holds up.

00:10:55.292 --> 00:10:57.958
Are you nuts?! You trust them?!

00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:02.083
Yeah! We can't have all those
soldiers on the island!

00:11:02.083 --> 00:11:04.958
We oughta hang 'em all!

00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:07.542
No, we can't do that.

00:11:07.542 --> 00:11:13.917
To protect the island from Marley's
scout ships, we need the volunteers.

00:11:13.917 --> 00:11:17.083
Without their "wireless radio"...

00:11:17.083 --> 00:11:21.000
This is... fir... scout fleet. Request... aid.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.625
This is... first scout fleet.

00:11:23.625 --> 00:11:25.875
Second fleet. Go ahead.

00:11:25.875 --> 00:11:31.417
What a relief! Our ship ran aground!
We've been waiting for your help.

00:11:31.417 --> 00:11:34.792
We're on the way! In the cove, huh?

00:11:34.792 --> 00:11:39.583
How many ships? Don't worry!
Two are headed your way!

00:11:40.542 --> 00:11:41.917
Hey!

00:11:41.917 --> 00:11:45.000
You okay?! We're coming to get you!

00:11:47.708 --> 00:11:50.625
--It's the Colossal Titan!
--How?!

00:11:52.042 --> 00:11:54.083
Hey! It's the enemy!

00:11:54.083 --> 00:11:55.583
Hurry! Jump!

00:11:55.583 --> 00:11:56.542
Run!

00:11:56.542 --> 00:11:58.333
Jump off!

00:12:03.167 --> 00:12:08.417
Welcome to the filthy island of
filthy devils. You're gonna love it.

00:12:08.417 --> 00:12:11.083
As long as you like pig piss.

00:12:11.083 --> 00:12:14.583
You can leave if you want, but not on a ship.

00:12:14.583 --> 00:12:17.250
Are you good at swimming?

00:12:18.208 --> 00:12:21.167
It was fun back then.

00:12:21.167 --> 00:12:27.500
Certainly, we Eldians are feared
and hated by the world.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:32.042
By people across the sea
whose faces we don't know.

00:12:32.042 --> 00:12:37.333
But not everyone across the sea
was our enemy.

00:12:37.333 --> 00:12:45.042
And we found out the world itself
was complex and full of unknowns.

00:12:45.042 --> 00:12:49.917
By the way, why do you have
dark skin, Onyankopon?

00:12:50.875 --> 00:12:57.667
Because our creator thought, "It's more
interesting with a mix of people."

00:12:57.667 --> 00:13:04.375
You Subjects of Ymir are the same.
We exist because we were wanted.

00:13:04.375 --> 00:13:06.792
Who created us?

00:13:06.792 --> 00:13:13.250
The one who gave the
Founder Ymir power. God.

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:18.708
That's what some people believe.
Aren't we free to think what we want?

00:13:23.542 --> 00:13:26.000
What the hell is this food?

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.917
Is it even edible?

00:13:27.917 --> 00:13:29.042
Smells fishy.

00:13:29.042 --> 00:13:34.125
You've never had seafood?
Nicolo's a master of Marleyan cooking.

00:13:34.125 --> 00:13:39.083
Jerks. If you don't like it, don't eat.
Eldians like you don't--

00:13:42.625 --> 00:13:45.375
So good!

00:13:45.375 --> 00:13:47.542
--Hey!
--No fair, Sasha!

00:13:49.125 --> 00:13:54.250
Nicolo! You're a food genius!

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.875
S-Stop eating like a pig!

00:13:56.875 --> 00:14:00.208
I've never had anything like this!

00:14:01.333 --> 00:14:04.250
There's plenty, so take your time.

00:14:10.167 --> 00:14:13.208
The port will be finished soon!

00:14:13.208 --> 00:14:17.750
Thanks to the Marleyan engineers,
building it's been quick.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:20.333
They've sure been cooperative.

00:14:21.125 --> 00:14:26.042
It went bad at first since
neither side trusted the other.

00:14:26.042 --> 00:14:32.833
But given enough time, if we set aside
our labels and see each other as people,

00:14:32.833 --> 00:14:35.208
we can understand each other.

00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:40.125
Armin. Have you seen Bertholdt's memories?

00:14:40.125 --> 00:14:45.417
Huh? Yeah, but there's
nothing that seems helpful.

00:14:45.417 --> 00:14:50.208
There's not much time.
Zeke has less than three years left.

00:14:50.208 --> 00:14:53.167
Yeah, about that...

00:14:53.167 --> 00:14:57.458
Do we really want to go along
with Yelena's plan?

00:14:57.458 --> 00:14:59.167
What's the problem?

00:14:59.167 --> 00:15:05.542
Is using the rumbling to threaten the
world the only way to protect Eldians?

00:15:05.542 --> 00:15:10.542
Then we <i>will </i>be the devils
that terrorize the world.

00:15:10.542 --> 00:15:13.792
Before it comes to that, can't we talk?

00:15:13.792 --> 00:15:17.792
If we can fix Marley and the
world's misconception...

00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:21.708
Misconception? What misconception?

00:15:21.708 --> 00:15:24.375
You know, like how we're scary.

00:15:24.375 --> 00:15:31.708
The world sees us as monsters who can
turn into Titans. They're not wrong.

00:15:31.708 --> 00:15:34.625
There're Marleyans who like us, too.

00:15:34.625 --> 00:15:36.500
How many?

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:40.625
Most of the Marleyans
are sitting in prison cells.

00:15:40.625 --> 00:15:43.333
But given enough time...

00:15:43.333 --> 00:15:47.125
Yeah. We need time.

00:15:48.042 --> 00:15:54.375
That's right. And to buy us that time,
we've gotta keep 'em at bay.

00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:04.875
I wonder... did we make the right choice?

00:16:06.792 --> 00:16:14.292
I can't help but think:
Could there have been some other path?

00:16:14.292 --> 00:16:20.917
I thought I understood Eren
better than anyone. Even Mikasa.

00:16:20.917 --> 00:16:24.042
But I don't know anymore.

00:16:24.917 --> 00:16:29.917
"The Scout Fleet was formed to investigate
Paradis Island after the Operation to Retake
the Founding Titan had failed. Not a single one
has returned to Marley to this day."

00:16:38.167 --> 00:16:43.083
Hey! Aren't you a Marleyan?!
What the hell are you doing here?!

00:16:43.083 --> 00:16:46.292
--This graveyard is full of people
your kind killed!

00:16:46.292 --> 00:16:47.458
--Wait!
--This graveyard is full of people
your kind killed!

00:16:47.458 --> 00:16:50.708
Let us take care of this guy!

00:16:50.708 --> 00:16:53.458
Sorry. Please.

00:16:53.458 --> 00:16:55.917
Marleyans can piss off!

00:16:55.917 --> 00:16:56.917
Hey, Nicolo!

00:16:56.917 --> 00:16:58.958
You okay?

00:16:58.958 --> 00:17:02.167
Dammit! Why?!

00:17:03.333 --> 00:17:06.708
Sasha's really dead?

00:17:06.708 --> 00:17:08.250
Yeah.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:12.750
Why? What the hell were you guys doing?!

00:17:16.625 --> 00:17:20.375
Shot by a kid who sneaked on the airship?

00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:25.333
It's too ridiculous to be true.

00:17:25.333 --> 00:17:29.833
It was no ordinary girl. She'd been trained.

00:17:29.833 --> 00:17:31.958
A Warrior candidate?

00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:36.042
I let my guard down. Sorry.

00:17:36.042 --> 00:17:41.708
Why apologize to me?
All I did was cook her food.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:50.500
Thanks for letting her eat
so much tasty food, Nicolo.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:54.625
What do you think about this, Conny?

00:17:54.625 --> 00:17:59.417
Sasha and I were like twins.

00:17:59.417 --> 00:18:02.958
It feels like half of me is gone.

00:18:05.125 --> 00:18:07.167
You're...

00:18:07.167 --> 00:18:10.375
Y'all knew my daughter, did ya?

00:18:18.167 --> 00:18:20.500
U-Um...

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:26.458
I'm just a captive Marleyan,
but I'm allowed to work as a chef.

00:18:26.458 --> 00:18:31.458
Your daughter loved eating my
food more than anyone else.

00:18:31.458 --> 00:18:38.375
So... if you ever want to...
please come and eat my food.

00:18:43.083 --> 00:18:46.125
On the house, right?

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:47.750
Of course.

00:18:54.917 --> 00:19:01.250
You guys are calling it a victory.
Isn't ignorance a scary thing?

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:06.792
If I send your dead body to Marley
and reveal your little plot,

00:19:06.792 --> 00:19:09.625
your gramps and granny are done for.

00:19:09.625 --> 00:19:15.875
But if this secret plan of yours is real,
I can wait to chop you up.

00:19:15.875 --> 00:19:18.625
Either way works for me.

00:19:18.625 --> 00:19:25.583
I appreciate your graciousness.
But don't I get to meet Eren first?

00:19:25.583 --> 00:19:30.625
Don't be in such a hurry.
We've got the finest hotel for you.

00:19:30.625 --> 00:19:34.333
You can stay there and relax a while.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:41.000
Hey... Can you please stop glaring at me?

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.708
This is all of the Titan serum
we stole from Marley.

00:19:45.708 --> 00:19:48.833
But you'll have trouble reproducing it.

00:19:48.833 --> 00:19:52.833
No, we should manage fine with this much.

00:19:52.833 --> 00:19:57.042
I only wish we could properly thank you.

00:19:57.042 --> 00:20:02.750
We owe you so much already.
We were ignorant, but you gave us hope.

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:08.042
For us to suspect you,
we're truly no better than devils.

00:20:08.042 --> 00:20:14.333
For three years, we've done nothing
but show we're friends of the Eldians.

00:20:14.333 --> 00:20:22.375
It's unfortunate. The guns we brought
were meant to give Eldians freedom.

00:20:22.375 --> 00:20:29.208
I know it's selfish to ask, but can you
overlook our cautiousness for a while?

00:20:29.208 --> 00:20:32.750
We have to keep Zeke on a tight leash.

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:39.792
It's fine, Commander Pyxis.
We'll dine at the same table again soon.

00:20:40.958 --> 00:20:43.750
<i>This </i>is my hotel?

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:46.375
You got a problem with it?

00:20:46.375 --> 00:20:51.625
It's a forest of giant trees.
I can't think of a better place for you.

00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:55.500
Might be lots of fun with ODM gear.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:21:01.583
Hey, Captain Levi. Think I could show
Gabi and Falco this natural wonder?

00:21:01.583 --> 00:21:03.208
Tsk.

00:21:03.208 --> 00:21:08.292
Whether they see the sights
or not depends on you.

00:21:15.458 --> 00:21:19.625
Eren... Jaeger!

00:21:19.625 --> 00:21:23.042
Eren would have done it alone.

00:21:23.042 --> 00:21:29.250
Whether we helped him or not,
the worst would've happened anyways.

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:33.333
In any case, we killed a lot of people.

00:21:33.333 --> 00:21:37.417
The navy, army, and civilians
got dragged into it.

00:21:37.417 --> 00:21:41.917
And just like that, all were lost.

00:21:41.917 --> 00:21:45.292
But unless that port was destroyed,

00:21:45.292 --> 00:21:50.250
Marley would've retaliated
and attacked the island.

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:56.042
We killed any hope for peace,
but we had no choice.

00:21:56.042 --> 00:22:00.167
Just like you guys that day.

00:22:00.167 --> 00:22:03.875
Hey, Annie...

00:22:03.875 --> 00:22:06.875
Say something, please.

00:22:09.542 --> 00:22:12.000
Fight or die.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.875
Win... and live.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.542
The only way to win is to fight.

00:22:25.542 --> 00:22:27.833
Fight.

00:22:27.833 --> 00:22:29.542
Fight!

00:24:02.667 --> 00:24:08.833
Without any allies on the outside,
they must kill their enemies to live.

00:24:08.833 --> 00:24:14.583
Is that the right choice or not?
There's not a soul who knows.

00:24:14.583 --> 00:24:17.046
Next episode: "A Sound Argument."
