WEBVTT

00:00:18.125 --> 00:00:22.583
Falco? Where are you headed this late?

00:00:22.583 --> 00:00:27.083
I forgot something at HQ,
so I'm going back to get it.

00:00:27.083 --> 00:00:28.750
See you later!

00:00:34.042 --> 00:00:37.417
Falco, could you do me a favor?

00:00:37.417 --> 00:00:40.708
What's that, Mr. Kruger?

00:00:40.708 --> 00:00:43.333
I want to send a letter, but...

00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:47.083
...if it's sent from the internment zone,
they'll check it.

00:00:47.083 --> 00:00:48.542
That's right.

00:00:48.542 --> 00:00:54.833
They might find out I'm not really sick,
so could you send it from outside?

00:00:54.833 --> 00:00:58.333
Sure thing. Is it to your family?

00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:03.875
Yeah. I wanna tell 'em I'm here
and doing just fine.

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:44.000
"From One Hand to Another"

00:02:49.042 --> 00:02:51.125
Hey, why all the commotion?

00:02:51.125 --> 00:02:54.167
The whole Tybur family has come to visit!

00:02:54.167 --> 00:02:56.000
Excuse me?

00:02:59.833 --> 00:03:05.958
It's the Tyburs' personal guard.
They're not part of our military.

00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.500
Come in.

00:03:08.542 --> 00:03:14.250
Sorry to drop in on you.
I'm Willy, the head of the Tybur family.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.542
Commander of the Warrior unit, Theo Magath.

00:03:17.542 --> 00:03:21.125
It's an honor to meet you, Lord Tybur.

00:03:21.125 --> 00:03:28.292
Nice to meet you, Commander Magath.
Allow me to introduce you to the family.

00:03:34.208 --> 00:03:37.708
Having managed the Warrior unit
from the outset,

00:03:37.708 --> 00:03:42.417
are you able to tell which of us
is the War Hammer Titan?

00:03:42.417 --> 00:03:49.792
No, I haven't a clue.
One might wonder if it's even here at all.

00:03:49.792 --> 00:03:53.125
You're very astute, just like I've heard.

00:03:53.125 --> 00:03:55.500
But it's here.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.542
The War Hammer Titan is among us.

00:04:05.083 --> 00:04:08.750
I came here to see the statue of Helos.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.042
A century ago, a mere human
slayed the devil of all earth

00:04:13.042 --> 00:04:18.875
and became the renowned Marleyan
hero who saved the world--Helos.

00:04:18.875 --> 00:04:24.292
How marvelous. So brave and
beautiful, with not a scratch.

00:04:24.292 --> 00:04:27.500
Truly, the spirit of Marley.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.458
The spirit, indeed.
For within, it's empty inside.

00:04:33.458 --> 00:04:36.500
You're a tough critic, Commander.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.875
I hear you're working to reinstate
Marleyan conscription?

00:04:40.875 --> 00:04:45.833
War, for Marleyans,
exists solely inside their newspapers.

00:04:45.833 --> 00:04:50.250
They're content to just read
about our lands expanding.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:57.000
If our tamed devils or conquered armies
are eating the bullets, all the better.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
One hopes letting Marleyans hear the
sound of bullets whizzing by their ears

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.375
will be enough to stop our
self-destructive march towards war.

00:05:10.417 --> 00:05:14.583
If someone controlled Marley
from the shadows, I'd tell them:

00:05:14.583 --> 00:05:18.208
It's already too late.

00:05:18.208 --> 00:05:23.083
You truly don't hold back,
Commander. What can I say?

00:05:23.083 --> 00:05:27.958
As you noted, this nation is
controlled by the Tyburs.

00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:34.042
But this path of warmongering
was one that Marley chose on its own.

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:39.292
We gave Marley both freedom
and power in hopes of atonement.

00:05:39.292 --> 00:05:43.208
But in the end, Eldia and Marley
were thrown into darkness.

00:05:43.208 --> 00:05:46.250
The Tyburs are responsible for that.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.750
I intend to reveal the truth to the world
at the upcoming festival.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:58.542
My coming to see the statue was no lie.
Marley is in need of a hero once more.

00:05:58.542 --> 00:06:04.208
Theo Magath... Will you not join hands with me?

00:06:12.917 --> 00:06:14.125
Huh?

00:06:14.125 --> 00:06:16.333
Morning, Pock!

00:06:17.625 --> 00:06:20.208
Pieck! What are you doing?!

00:06:20.208 --> 00:06:25.417
This way's more natural to me. Did I scare you?

00:06:25.417 --> 00:06:28.917
Can you just walk upright?

00:06:28.917 --> 00:06:31.250
Titans come from the south.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:36.542
The wall will be less defended the closer
you get to these mountains up north.

00:06:36.542 --> 00:06:39.208
Then, we should attack from the north?

00:06:39.208 --> 00:06:41.125
That's one option.

00:06:41.125 --> 00:06:46.875
However, the wharf is the only place
where our large ships can dock.

00:06:46.875 --> 00:06:48.833
We could press our advantage.

00:06:48.833 --> 00:06:50.792
So, the south?

00:06:50.792 --> 00:06:54.542
But the south is where
our scout ships were lost.

00:06:54.542 --> 00:06:59.500
It's where they're most focused.
The wharf might even be destroyed.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.125
So, what are you trying to say?

00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:05.875
I'm merely trying to share
the information I gathered.

00:07:05.875 --> 00:07:11.750
All right, enough.
It was dumb to let an Eldian talk.

00:07:15.667 --> 00:07:18.958
The Paradis Island planning is going just swell.

00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:22.708
The brass in charge is oh so intelligent.

00:07:22.708 --> 00:07:25.833
Can't wait to hear what they come up with.

00:07:25.833 --> 00:07:31.167
Like entrusting the whole thing to four kids?

00:07:32.125 --> 00:07:33.333
Hmm?

00:07:37.458 --> 00:07:41.500
He's ahead. Falco passed up Gabi!

00:07:45.875 --> 00:07:51.625
Look at 'em celebrate one little win.
Jeez. They've got no idea.

00:07:51.625 --> 00:07:58.375
No matter how well Falco does
at this point, he'll never surpass Gabi.

00:07:58.375 --> 00:08:00.958
Did you see him take off at the end?!

00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.833
Hey, runts. What's the big deal?

00:08:03.833 --> 00:08:06.208
Falco finally beat Gabi!

00:08:06.208 --> 00:08:08.167
In grades?! Really?!

00:08:08.167 --> 00:08:10.667
No, just in a race!

00:08:10.667 --> 00:08:12.875
This is a historic feat!

00:08:12.875 --> 00:08:16.208
Can you cut it out? You're embarrassing me.

00:08:16.208 --> 00:08:20.792
That's pretty awesome!
Maybe you'll be the next Armor!

00:08:20.792 --> 00:08:22.792
Ow!

00:08:22.792 --> 00:08:26.208
It's way too late to compete against me!

00:08:26.208 --> 00:08:30.875
I made our motherland proud in the war!

00:08:30.875 --> 00:08:33.083
I know.

00:08:33.083 --> 00:08:37.042
But they still haven't announced
a successor yet.

00:08:37.042 --> 00:08:41.167
Until then, I'll do everything I can.

00:08:42.458 --> 00:08:46.292
Man, talk about showing off.

00:08:46.292 --> 00:08:51.583
Your brother's already inheriting the Beast!
You'll be an Honorary Marleyan!

00:08:51.583 --> 00:08:54.500
What's the point of trying so hard?!

00:08:59.125 --> 00:09:01.833
I'm doing it for you!

00:09:01.833 --> 00:09:02.917
Whoa...

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:05.542
He totally said it!

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:13.625
Huh?! You're getting in my way,
but you're doing it for me?

00:09:13.625 --> 00:09:16.875
That doesn't make any damn sense!

00:09:16.875 --> 00:09:19.208
Guess it didn't get through.

00:09:19.208 --> 00:09:22.958
Huh?! What's his problem?! What gives?!

00:09:24.167 --> 00:09:27.625
Oh! Welcome back, our little Warriors!

00:09:27.625 --> 00:09:35.875
Gabi! I heard what you did, Gabi!
You're our savior, Gabi!

00:09:35.875 --> 00:09:38.417
Well, I'm Zofia, so...

00:09:38.417 --> 00:09:39.250
Huh?

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:44.958
What's wrong with you?! Quit day drinking
and grabbing girls, you geezer!

00:09:44.958 --> 00:09:49.583
Shuddap, you nincompoop!
What's wrong with praising a hero?!

00:09:49.583 --> 00:09:53.000
If anything, being praised by you is bad luck!

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.583
Go on! Stumble back home to your mom!

00:09:57.583 --> 00:10:00.958
Now then, I've got a treat for you kids!

00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:05.625
Eat up and grow big like Vice Chief Braun!

00:10:05.625 --> 00:10:07.708
Thank you!

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.625
Whoa!

00:10:12.625 --> 00:10:16.667
Will they really declare war
right here in the zone?

00:10:16.667 --> 00:10:19.667
Reminds me of a theater.

00:10:19.667 --> 00:10:22.458
I heard they're inviting VIPs here

00:10:22.458 --> 00:10:27.875
and after doing this festival,
the world will be on our side.

00:10:27.875 --> 00:10:30.208
Fantastic!

00:10:30.208 --> 00:10:34.083
All of Marley's problems will magically go away!

00:10:34.083 --> 00:10:36.208
You think it won't work?

00:10:36.208 --> 00:10:38.250
You actually do?

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:43.250
The Mid-East Forces we were
just slaughtering will be there.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:50.167
My family came from an internment zone
abroad, so I know how awful it is.

00:10:50.167 --> 00:10:54.125
The hate for Eldians abroad
makes here seem like nothing.

00:10:54.125 --> 00:10:58.375
Well, all the more reason
we've gotta try something.

00:10:58.375 --> 00:11:02.792
They might've chosen to hold it here
so people understand us!

00:11:02.792 --> 00:11:05.917
We can show 'em we're not devils!

00:11:05.917 --> 00:11:07.458
But how?

00:11:07.458 --> 00:11:08.667
Smile!

00:11:08.667 --> 00:11:14.583
I know you can't wait to show the world
they're wrong, but stop looking so smug.

00:11:14.583 --> 00:11:18.167
And, Zofia... Cut it out with your weird act.

00:11:18.167 --> 00:11:20.625
Um, this is who I am...

00:11:20.625 --> 00:11:23.750
Fine! So what are you gonna fix?!

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:28.125
Huh? There's no need, 'cuz I'm perfect as-is!

00:11:28.125 --> 00:11:30.583
I'm smart and cute as a button!

00:11:30.583 --> 00:11:36.000
And when I captivate all the VIPs,
it'll secure my spot even more!

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.667
I think I spot a devil.

00:11:38.667 --> 00:11:42.792
If you guys cheer for Falco again,
I'll make you cry!

00:11:42.792 --> 00:11:45.208
You really are a devil!

00:11:46.208 --> 00:11:48.583
It's Commander Magath.

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:50.125
Here.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:58.958
Oh? A large-scale demolition is required?

00:11:58.958 --> 00:12:02.167
It has decayed beyond repair.

00:12:05.375 --> 00:12:09.542
Congratulations, General. The military is yours.

00:12:09.542 --> 00:12:18.250
No. The military serves the nation,
and this nation's supreme commander is you.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:23.708
That's not quite true.
I'm simply the one who holds the wheel.

00:12:23.708 --> 00:12:28.833
Now I know why my
predecessors never tried to grab it.

00:12:28.833 --> 00:12:31.583
It's so heavy.

00:12:31.583 --> 00:12:38.542
I wish I could let go this very moment,
but a time has come where I must not.

00:12:38.542 --> 00:12:41.042
It just happened to be me.

00:12:41.042 --> 00:12:45.708
I'm simply the man
this responsibility fell upon.

00:12:45.708 --> 00:12:51.458
The house was in danger of collapsing,
but some pillars remained usable.

00:12:51.458 --> 00:12:57.333
According to them, the house
is already infested with rats.

00:12:58.375 --> 00:13:00.458
Nice work, Falco.

00:13:00.458 --> 00:13:03.042
It's all thanks to you, Kruger!

00:13:03.042 --> 00:13:07.833
But at this point, I honestly doubt
I can pass up Gabi.

00:13:07.833 --> 00:13:11.542
Even so, I'm gonna keep moving forward.

00:13:11.542 --> 00:13:16.375
I see. I'm the one who should be
thanking you, though.

00:13:16.375 --> 00:13:23.042
I'm grateful you've been sending
all my letters. You've been a big help.

00:13:23.042 --> 00:13:25.583
Yeah...

00:13:25.583 --> 00:13:29.125
Did your family send you that?

00:13:29.125 --> 00:13:33.000
They thought it'd make
hospital life less boring.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.417
Hard to do much in this shape, though.

00:13:36.417 --> 00:13:38.958
I need to move forward, too.

00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:43.292
When the festival's over,
I'm going back to my hometown.

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:46.292
I see.

00:13:47.375 --> 00:13:49.417
A doctor's coming.

00:13:49.417 --> 00:13:51.125
I'll get going!

00:13:51.125 --> 00:13:52.458
Yeah.

00:13:54.292 --> 00:13:56.917
May I sit next to you?

00:13:56.917 --> 00:13:59.500
Yeah, sure.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:02.000
I appreciate it.

00:14:04.583 --> 00:14:11.333
I'm Jaeger, a physician for the zone.
I come here to drink tea sometimes.

00:14:11.333 --> 00:14:14.708
Nice to meet you. I'm Kruger.

00:14:14.708 --> 00:14:20.708
Nice to meet you, Kruger.
You seem to get along with that boy.

00:14:20.708 --> 00:14:21.500
Yeah.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:25.708
I see. I think I could get along with him, too.

00:14:25.708 --> 00:14:31.250
I sit here on this bench looking
for people to talk to.

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:36.167
His uncle was a leader of
the Eldian Restorationists.

00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:41.958
Restorationists are sent to paradise
and not even their family is spared.

00:14:41.958 --> 00:14:47.000
To protect their family,
he and his brother trained to be Warriors,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.625
and when his brother was chosen
to inherit the Beast Titan,

00:14:51.625 --> 00:14:56.417
the Grice family knew they were finally safe.

00:14:56.417 --> 00:15:00.458
Why are you telling me this?

00:15:00.458 --> 00:15:04.292
Stop asking the boy to do favors for you.

00:15:04.292 --> 00:15:10.208
If he comes under suspicion, all their
effort will have been for nothing.

00:15:10.208 --> 00:15:15.917
And if you're truly healthy,
you should go back to your family.

00:15:15.917 --> 00:15:23.417
Someday, you won't see them anymore.
Don't wait and live with regret.

00:15:23.417 --> 00:15:26.333
Regret, huh?

00:15:29.333 --> 00:15:33.292
You have regrets about your own family?

00:15:35.083 --> 00:15:38.042
There's not a day that I don't.

00:15:38.042 --> 00:15:42.542
That day, my son took
my daughter outside the walls.

00:15:42.542 --> 00:15:48.375
It's because I was too strict
about him becoming a doctor!

00:15:50.667 --> 00:15:55.083
It's my fault! Everything was my fault!

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.042
Mr. Jaeger! Please don't go around on your own!

00:16:03.042 --> 00:16:07.292
I'm so sorry. I looked away for a second.

00:16:07.292 --> 00:16:09.542
This way, Mr. Jaeger.

00:16:09.542 --> 00:16:11.917
Everything will be okay.

00:16:18.917 --> 00:16:23.917
"The Tybur Family joined hands with the Marleyan
hero Helos to overcome the Eldian Empire
and bring an end to the Great Titan War.
They have long possessed the War Hammer Titan."

00:16:30.375 --> 00:16:31.625
Whoa!

00:16:31.625 --> 00:16:33.875
I've seen them in the paper!

00:16:33.875 --> 00:16:38.750
Cut the chitchat.
We've gotta be waiters like we trained.

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:42.000
Look, there's empty glasses! Get 'em!

00:16:50.708 --> 00:16:52.708
--Falco, drink!
--Here!

00:16:54.417 --> 00:16:59.000
Hmm? Oh... There's filthy blood
touching the plates.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.500
Ugh! That explains why the food stinks!

00:17:07.292 --> 00:17:09.375
I-I'm terribly sorry!

00:17:09.375 --> 00:17:11.583
Shh! Don't make a fuss.

00:17:11.583 --> 00:17:14.583
B-But your fancy clothes--!

00:17:14.583 --> 00:17:17.875
Is everything all right, madam?

00:17:17.875 --> 00:17:19.708
How embarrassing!

00:17:19.708 --> 00:17:24.250
I spilled wine on my kimono
and was asking for help!

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:25.417
Thank you.

00:17:25.417 --> 00:17:28.917
I'm sorry to hear that.
Please, come this way.

00:17:28.917 --> 00:17:31.333
Wh-Why?

00:17:31.333 --> 00:17:34.917
Who knows what would've happened to you.

00:17:35.875 --> 00:17:37.333
You okay?

00:17:37.333 --> 00:17:40.792
Yeah... She saved me.

00:17:40.792 --> 00:17:44.042
She knew I was an Eldian.

00:17:44.042 --> 00:17:49.375
That woman... I think she's
an Easterner from Hizuru.

00:17:53.292 --> 00:17:54.792
It's Willy!

00:17:55.958 --> 00:18:00.000
Willy! Kin of our saviors!

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.333
Ambassador Ogweno! Long time no see!

00:18:03.333 --> 00:18:06.417
Nambia! We were kids last time I saw you!

00:18:06.417 --> 00:18:09.833
I used to make you cry all the time!

00:18:09.833 --> 00:18:11.917
Remember this, Willy?

00:18:11.917 --> 00:18:15.708
Oh! From the time you fell out of the tree!

00:18:20.542 --> 00:18:26.542
Ladies and Gentlemen!
We thank you all for coming tonight!

00:18:26.542 --> 00:18:32.958
Until recently, we were squabbling
over resources in an unsightly war.

00:18:32.958 --> 00:18:37.500
However, yesterday's enemy is today's enemy!

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:41.833
Pardon me. Yesterday's enemy is today's friend!

00:18:41.833 --> 00:18:45.958
Let's wash the past
down the toilet with our drinks!

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:49.667
Please raise your glasses
and join me for a toast!

00:18:49.667 --> 00:18:53.083
To everlasting peace!

00:18:55.167 --> 00:19:00.125
Thank you very much! Such an elegant
joke to amuse our guests!

00:19:00.125 --> 00:19:02.375
--Huh?
--But I'm afraid our guests

00:19:02.375 --> 00:19:06.792
didn't quite understand,
so allow me to take over.

00:19:06.792 --> 00:19:08.167
Yeah, Willy!

00:19:08.167 --> 00:19:10.500
Kin of our saviors!

00:19:13.958 --> 00:19:19.833
Tomorrow, I invite all of you
to the Liberio Internment Zone.

00:19:19.833 --> 00:19:24.375
It is the home of a people
whose blood runs through me.

00:19:24.375 --> 00:19:31.083
The ones called devils for slaughtering
a great number of people--the Eldians.

00:19:31.083 --> 00:19:34.333
Though once repressed more greatly than any,

00:19:34.333 --> 00:19:40.083
Marley has used the devils to oppress
other nations and repeat the tragedy.

00:19:40.083 --> 00:19:44.458
I understand the desire
to exterminate the Eldians.

00:19:44.458 --> 00:19:51.042
But I have arrived at a single solution
that will answer this endless problem.

00:19:51.042 --> 00:19:58.375
Tomorrow, I will reveal that solution
in my first-ever theater production.

00:19:58.375 --> 00:20:02.250
To the great playwrights
and witnesses of history!

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:05.542
To the playwrights and witnesses of history!

00:20:19.875 --> 00:20:21.167
What the--?!

00:20:33.375 --> 00:20:35.042
What in the world?!

00:20:35.042 --> 00:20:37.667
Gabi! You're finally up!

00:20:37.667 --> 00:20:39.125
What's happening?!

00:20:39.125 --> 00:20:40.458
The festival!

00:20:40.458 --> 00:20:45.417
People from outside came pouring in
and opened all these stalls!

00:20:45.417 --> 00:20:46.792
Try this!

00:20:47.792 --> 00:20:49.750
<i>This </i>is a festival?!

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:51.250
Let's go!

00:21:18.333 --> 00:21:21.042
It hurts!

00:21:21.042 --> 00:21:24.458
'Cuz you stuffed your face.

00:21:24.458 --> 00:21:29.042
I wish we had festivals every day! Blech!

00:21:29.042 --> 00:21:30.375
Yeah.

00:21:30.375 --> 00:21:35.583
Lately, it seems like lots of new
things have been happening.

00:21:35.583 --> 00:21:37.333
It does.

00:21:37.333 --> 00:21:42.667
It kinda feels like something
is about to change!

00:21:42.667 --> 00:21:44.625
Yeah.

00:21:44.625 --> 00:21:46.250
It does.

00:22:50.708 --> 00:22:53.500
Oh? Did you guys have fun?

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.500
Huh? Where's Falco?

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:59.625
He said he saw someone he knew and ran off.

00:22:59.625 --> 00:23:03.167
Really? What's the matter with him?

00:23:03.167 --> 00:23:05.875
Can't you just loosen up for a day?

00:23:05.875 --> 00:23:07.542
So many people...

00:23:07.542 --> 00:23:10.042
Huh? Looks like he's back.

00:23:10.042 --> 00:23:12.083
Mr. Braun!

00:23:12.083 --> 00:23:14.792
Where the hell did you go?

00:23:14.792 --> 00:23:16.583
Can you come with me?

00:23:16.583 --> 00:23:17.917
Right now?

00:23:17.917 --> 00:23:22.583
You'll be fine. It shouldn't start for a bit.

00:23:22.583 --> 00:23:24.042
This way!

00:23:24.042 --> 00:23:26.208
What's this all about?

00:23:26.208 --> 00:23:28.625
You'll see soon enough!

00:23:32.583 --> 00:23:34.875
In here!

00:23:34.875 --> 00:23:36.375
Okay.

00:23:39.833 --> 00:23:41.500
I brought him!

00:23:42.792 --> 00:23:46.875
Hey. It's been four years, Reiner.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:54.208
Eren!

00:23:57.333 --> 00:24:01.125
In a dusky cellar, Reiner confronts Eren.

00:24:01.125 --> 00:24:06.375
As the crowd is absorbed
by Willy's speech, Eren admits:

00:24:06.375 --> 00:24:09.458
"I'm the same as you."

00:24:09.458 --> 00:24:12.096
Next episode: "Declaration of War."
