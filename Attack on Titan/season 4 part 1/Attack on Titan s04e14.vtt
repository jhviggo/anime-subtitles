WEBVTT

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.167
Why did you protect me?

00:00:27.167 --> 00:00:31.000
Because. I don't have a reason.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.708
I'm the one who killed your comrade.
I'm the one who bludgeoned the guard.

00:00:38.708 --> 00:00:43.208
Falco didn't do it. Kill me, not him.

00:00:44.208 --> 00:00:45.958
We won't kill you.

00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:48.667
But you want to, don't you?

00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:50.792
I don't want to kill you.

00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:55.875
Kill this, kill that...
It's all you think about.

00:00:55.875 --> 00:00:58.125
Just like someone I know.

00:01:01.083 --> 00:01:02.208
Er--

00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:36.958
"Savagery"

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:56.667
I just wanna talk. Conflict isn't
necessary to solve Eldia's problems.

00:02:56.667 --> 00:03:01.417
Hange and the others are fine.
We're just moving them.

00:03:01.417 --> 00:03:06.458
Eren, we're the ones who wanted to talk.

00:03:06.458 --> 00:03:10.833
What made you go attack
Marley all on your own?

00:03:10.833 --> 00:03:15.917
Did Zeke and Yelena really
talk you into joining them?

00:03:23.292 --> 00:03:24.917
I am free.

00:03:24.917 --> 00:03:26.375
Huh?

00:03:26.375 --> 00:03:34.583
The things I do and choices I make
are all decided by my own free will.

00:03:34.583 --> 00:03:39.167
So your actions after
meeting Yelena were all you?

00:03:39.167 --> 00:03:40.167
Yes.

00:03:40.167 --> 00:03:43.292
No, you're being manipulated!

00:03:43.292 --> 00:03:48.625
You wouldn't get kids and innocents
involved, even if they were enemies!

00:03:48.625 --> 00:03:53.417
Plus, I know you care
about us more than anyone!

00:03:54.292 --> 00:03:58.417
Don't you? The reason you
saved me in the cabin...

00:03:58.417 --> 00:04:01.500
The reason you gave me this
scarf... is because you're kind--

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.000
I said, "Keep your hands on the table."

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:16.875
I spoke with Zeke in Liberio,
brother to brother.

00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:22.875
Zeke knows more about Titans
than even Marley does.

00:04:22.875 --> 00:04:31.500
Armin, aren't you still visiting Annie?
Do you think that's your own free will?

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.083
Wh-What?

00:04:33.083 --> 00:04:40.250
If memories are what shape people,
a part of you is Bertholdt now.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.083
Within you is an enemy
with feelings for another enemy.

00:04:45.083 --> 00:04:49.875
Armin... Bertholdt has got into your head.

00:04:49.875 --> 00:04:54.042
You're the one manipulated by the enemy.

00:04:55.333 --> 00:04:56.375
Eren, what are--?

00:04:56.375 --> 00:04:58.125
You, too, Mikasa.

00:04:58.125 --> 00:04:59.375
Huh?

00:04:59.375 --> 00:05:05.250
The Ackermanns were intentionally
designed to protect Eldia's King.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:11.542
Back then, faced with a life-or-death
situation, you heard my order:

00:05:11.542 --> 00:05:13.333
"Fight."

00:05:16.167 --> 00:05:20.750
In that moment, instincts
awoke from within you.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.833
By mistake, you thought I was
the host you had to protect.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:27.958
No...

00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:31.250
No? No, what?

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.292
It wasn't... a mistake.

00:05:40.417 --> 00:05:46.375
It's because it was you, Eren!
I became strong because of you!

00:05:46.375 --> 00:05:52.375
Ackermanns with awakened powers
apparently get sudden headaches.

00:05:52.375 --> 00:05:58.667
It happens when their old self resists
being forced to protect their host.

00:05:58.667 --> 00:06:00.500
Sound familiar?

00:06:06.625 --> 00:06:08.042
No.

00:06:08.042 --> 00:06:09.167
I'm saying...

00:06:09.167 --> 00:06:11.958
No, I...

00:06:11.958 --> 00:06:18.125
Your family was made to forget who
they are and live only to protect.

00:06:18.125 --> 00:06:19.417
In other words, slaves.

00:06:19.417 --> 00:06:21.042
Enough, Eren!

00:06:21.042 --> 00:06:25.542
Do you know who I hate more than anyone?

00:06:25.542 --> 00:06:29.250
Those who aren't free. Just like livestock.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.375
Eren!

00:06:30.375 --> 00:06:37.583
Just seeing you has always pissed me
off so much, and now I finally know why.

00:06:37.583 --> 00:06:44.708
I can't stand the sight of a slave
who obeys orders without question.

00:06:44.708 --> 00:06:47.875
Ever since I was little...

00:06:47.875 --> 00:06:52.375
...Mikasa, I've hated you.

00:06:54.083 --> 00:06:57.458
Eren! How could you say that to--?

00:07:02.083 --> 00:07:04.125
Mikasa?

00:07:04.125 --> 00:07:09.375
Your entire life has been dictated
by your Ackermann blood.

00:07:09.375 --> 00:07:11.583
N-No!

00:07:11.583 --> 00:07:14.917
It's all you really are.

00:07:29.083 --> 00:07:31.375
Jaeger!

00:07:31.375 --> 00:07:34.208
I'm all right.

00:07:34.208 --> 00:07:40.667
Hey, Armin. You and I have
never fought before, have we?

00:07:40.667 --> 00:07:42.792
Do you know why?

00:07:47.458 --> 00:07:49.167
--Because it's not even close to a fair fight!

00:07:49.167 --> 00:07:50.917
--Stop.
--Because it's not even close to a fair fight!

00:07:50.917 --> 00:07:52.542
--Because it's not even close to a fair fight!

00:07:57.875 --> 00:08:01.292
Please, stop.

00:08:01.292 --> 00:08:09.417
Like I said, if you guys tell us where
Zeke is, there's no need for us to fight.

00:08:09.417 --> 00:08:12.750
Come along and behave. Take 'em.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:13.750
Yes, sir.

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.417
The kid who killed Sasha, too.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:23.625
Is that it? Is that all you came to say?

00:08:23.625 --> 00:08:27.833
That you wanted freedom
just so you could hurt Mikasa?

00:08:27.833 --> 00:08:32.333
Tell me: Who's the slave
that bows to a bastard again?

00:08:32.333 --> 00:08:36.375
Who you calling a slave? Let's go.

00:08:36.375 --> 00:08:38.542
Where?

00:08:38.542 --> 00:08:43.125
To where it all started--Shiganshina.

00:08:47.917 --> 00:08:49.708
It's not even funny.

00:08:49.708 --> 00:08:53.708
There's another shithead we should have eaten.

00:08:53.708 --> 00:08:55.542
What do you mean?

00:08:55.542 --> 00:08:58.667
We'll give the Beast to someone else.

00:08:58.667 --> 00:09:04.958
We'll make one of the Jaegerists
into a Titan and have them eat Zeke.

00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:12.542
I can't tell if he's manipulating Eren,
but their party's over if they lose Zeke.

00:09:12.542 --> 00:09:15.417
Go tell that to Pyxis, got it?

00:09:15.417 --> 00:09:17.458
You're serious, Captain?

00:09:17.458 --> 00:09:21.875
The old man will come around
once I chop Zeke's limbs off.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.458
Enjoying your book?

00:09:30.458 --> 00:09:34.083
I am, for one I've read seven times.

00:09:34.083 --> 00:09:37.333
You've been eavesdropping more than reading.

00:09:37.333 --> 00:09:40.833
Can you blame me when
I've read it this much?

00:09:40.833 --> 00:09:44.000
By the way, is there any wine left?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.917
Not a single drop left.
We've been here a month.

00:09:47.917 --> 00:09:50.667
Good grief.

00:09:50.667 --> 00:09:53.750
You sure know how to torture someone.

00:09:54.708 --> 00:09:56.417
Just read your book.

00:09:56.417 --> 00:09:59.458
Roger that, boss.

00:09:59.458 --> 00:10:03.375
I'm gonna chop him up
no matter what Pyxis says.

00:10:03.375 --> 00:10:08.208
There're 30 fully-armed soldiers
waiting in the forest above.

00:10:08.208 --> 00:10:13.000
Even if he becomes the Beast,
there's no way he escapes.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.583
That bearded shit was our enemy after all.

00:10:16.583 --> 00:10:22.250
And now that we know it,
he doesn't deserve to have limbs.

00:10:23.208 --> 00:10:25.500
It took long enough.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:31.875
Erwin, I'll finally uphold
the promise I made to you.

00:10:31.875 --> 00:10:38.833
There was meaning in your deaths.
And at long last, I'll prove it.

00:10:48.292 --> 00:10:49.458
Huh?

00:10:53.875 --> 00:10:55.292
Hey...

00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:23.958
"Spinal Fluid Wine: After consuming the spinal
fluid and hearing Zeke Yaeger's 'scream,'
Subjects of Ymir will turn into Pure Titans.
It has proven to be an effective weapon."

00:11:25.833 --> 00:11:26.792
What was that?

00:11:26.792 --> 00:11:28.208
My body went numb.

00:11:28.208 --> 00:11:29.417
--Yeah!
--Me, too!

00:11:29.417 --> 00:11:32.208
Huh? I didn't feel a thing.

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:39.875
What's wrong?

00:11:39.875 --> 00:11:44.417
Felt like I got zapped by electricity.

00:11:44.417 --> 00:11:46.083
You don't think--?!

00:11:46.083 --> 00:11:49.542
Zeke's done it, hasn't he?

00:11:50.792 --> 00:11:55.083
This is goodbye, Captain.
You care about your subordinates.

00:11:55.083 --> 00:12:01.125
You're not gonna slice them up
just 'cuz they've grown a bit, are you?

00:12:10.125 --> 00:12:13.458
Wine? Why bring wine on a mission?

00:12:13.458 --> 00:12:19.125
Captain! This is the rare Marleyan
stuff only MPs get to drink!

00:12:19.125 --> 00:12:21.375
Don't we deserve some?

00:12:21.375 --> 00:12:22.667
We've got tea.

00:12:22.667 --> 00:12:24.625
Captain!

00:12:24.625 --> 00:12:26.708
Gimme a break.

00:12:26.708 --> 00:12:29.292
Fine. Bring it.

00:12:29.292 --> 00:12:31.667
Dammit!

00:12:31.667 --> 00:12:35.958
Zeke's spinal fluid was
in the wine?! Since when?!

00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:40.417
Not a single person froze up! Was it all a lie?!

00:12:41.375 --> 00:12:47.458
Shit, they're fast! How do they move
like that?! Is that Zeke's doing, too?!

00:12:57.875 --> 00:12:59.417
Varis!

00:13:03.583 --> 00:13:06.750
Are you in there somewhere...

00:13:08.042 --> 00:13:09.667
...you guys?

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:26.833
Farewell. In the end,
we couldn't trust one another.

00:13:26.833 --> 00:13:31.708
All the world's might
will soon fall upon this island.

00:13:31.708 --> 00:13:34.667
You have no idea what that means.

00:13:34.667 --> 00:13:39.625
You guys thought you
had power... time... choices.

00:13:39.625 --> 00:13:46.667
Not realizing you had none of those,
Levi, was your biggest mistake.

00:13:46.667 --> 00:13:52.667
Still, even if I explained my intentions,
you wouldn't understand.

00:13:52.667 --> 00:13:55.375
Right, Eren?

00:13:55.375 --> 00:13:58.000
Only you and I do.

00:13:59.042 --> 00:14:03.083
Once I escape this forest,
that's where you'll be.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.458
I hope you remember where and when
we're supposed to meet, Eren.

00:14:10.792 --> 00:14:12.042
Hmm?

00:14:16.083 --> 00:14:18.083
Go!

00:14:24.833 --> 00:14:29.667
What the hell, dammit?! Again?!

00:14:47.042 --> 00:14:49.375
Where are you?!

00:14:49.375 --> 00:14:53.333
Where'd you go, Levi?!

00:14:56.417 --> 00:14:58.375
There you are!

00:15:05.083 --> 00:15:08.375
What happened to your lovely buddies?!

00:15:08.375 --> 00:15:13.000
Don't tell me you killed 'em all!
The poor things!

00:15:20.792 --> 00:15:22.167
Branches?!

00:15:22.167 --> 00:15:24.958
You're looking desperate, hairball!

00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:28.500
All you had to do was read your damn book.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:35.000
What gave you the idea
that you could escape from me?

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.417
Did you think I wouldn't kill my comrades
if they turned into Titans?

00:15:40.417 --> 00:15:45.250
You don't have a damn clue
how many comrades we've killed!

00:16:14.208 --> 00:16:17.250
Hi there, Beardy.

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:23.375
Damn. You stink and you're filthy,
you ugly piece of shit.

00:16:23.375 --> 00:16:28.708
Well, no worries,
'cuz I'm not gonna kill you... yet.

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:35.458
As you know, after Premier Zachary was killed,

00:16:35.458 --> 00:16:40.125
the situation within the walls
has become unstable.

00:16:40.125 --> 00:16:44.042
However, this doesn't concern you cadets.

00:16:44.042 --> 00:16:46.792
Which is why the 109th Cadet Corps

00:16:46.792 --> 00:16:51.208
will be training to defend
Shiganshina from Titan attack!

00:16:58.333 --> 00:16:59.500
You hear me?!

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.042
Y-Yes, sir!

00:17:01.042 --> 00:17:04.542
Why do we care how to cut a Titan's nape?

00:17:04.542 --> 00:17:09.167
Not like they'll attack again.
Our enemies are people now.

00:17:09.167 --> 00:17:15.917
My old man thinks we should be training
with firearms and form an Eldian army.

00:17:15.917 --> 00:17:21.833
The times have changed,
yet Commandant Shadis is stuck in the past.

00:17:21.833 --> 00:17:27.333
Eldia's only hope is for
the Jaegerists to seize full control.

00:17:27.333 --> 00:17:29.375
Surma, he can hear you!

00:17:29.375 --> 00:17:32.208
Isn't that what everyone's thinking?

00:17:32.208 --> 00:17:36.000
Everyone wants Eren Jaeger to lead Eldia.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.292
We need a leader capable
of making tough decisions.

00:17:46.542 --> 00:17:48.917
Wha--?! Hange?!

00:17:48.917 --> 00:17:51.250
Long time no see, Commandant.

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:55.750
Just so you know, this branch
is under new management.

00:17:55.750 --> 00:18:00.125
We "Jaegerists" are the ones in charge now.

00:18:00.125 --> 00:18:04.083
From now on, you take orders from us.

00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:05.792
The Jaegerists...

00:18:05.792 --> 00:18:09.750
Looks like you finally figured it out, Floch.

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:11.708
Unless you point guns at people,

00:18:11.708 --> 00:18:18.500
nobody cares what your little gang
of asswipes says, and that's a fact.

00:18:22.583 --> 00:18:23.625
Floch!

00:18:23.625 --> 00:18:25.625
I missed.

00:18:25.625 --> 00:18:29.583
I thought shooting his foot
might speed things up.

00:18:29.583 --> 00:18:31.208
Speed what up?

00:18:31.208 --> 00:18:34.708
No, it has nothing to do with you.

00:18:34.708 --> 00:18:39.542
We have little need for
hard-headed geezers like you.

00:18:39.542 --> 00:18:45.083
From now on, this is your time, cadets!

00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:53.750
We Jaegerists have sworn to give our
hearts to save Eldia from this crisis!

00:18:53.750 --> 00:19:00.167
Not for the sake of our obsolete military,
but for the people of this island!

00:19:00.167 --> 00:19:03.292
By obeying the military's archaic mindset,

00:19:03.292 --> 00:19:08.083
you're allowing us to be trampled
by enemies from outside!

00:19:08.083 --> 00:19:12.167
Therefore, I ask you: Who are you?!

00:19:12.167 --> 00:19:16.917
Someone who wants to live
alongside our leader, Eren Jaeger?!

00:19:16.917 --> 00:19:23.958
Or someone who will die alongside
Keith Shadis and his antiquated ways?!

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:34.458
For the sake of Eldia's future,
we give our hearts!

00:19:34.458 --> 00:19:38.208
Good! Now show me your resolve!

00:19:38.208 --> 00:19:42.750
Beat Commandant Shadis
till he can't stand anymore!

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:44.958
Huh?

00:19:44.958 --> 00:19:50.875
He represents the old ways that
must be driven out! Now, do it!

00:19:50.875 --> 00:19:53.708
Those who can't go to prison!

00:19:53.708 --> 00:19:57.208
That's enough, Floch! This is ridiculous!

00:19:57.208 --> 00:19:58.750
Hange!

00:20:00.125 --> 00:20:05.250
No matter how many of these tots
there are, they're no match for me!

00:20:15.083 --> 00:20:19.875
Well done. We're delighted to welcome you all.

00:20:19.875 --> 00:20:24.958
Now, could you guide us
to where Zeke's being held?

00:20:27.083 --> 00:20:29.167
Commander Hange.

00:20:30.167 --> 00:20:32.458
Hey, let's go.

00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:52.500
You awake?

00:20:53.708 --> 00:20:57.000
Hey, wait. Don't move.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.875
There's a wire around your neck
attached to the Thunder Spear fuse.

00:21:01.875 --> 00:21:07.208
Squirm too much and you'll be
blown in half or worse.

00:21:15.292 --> 00:21:18.792
Bet you wish you were dead right now.

00:21:18.792 --> 00:21:25.167
Not that I sympathize.
You toyed with the lives of my comrades.

00:21:25.167 --> 00:21:30.458
Tell me: Was whimpering while covered
in shit part of your master plan?!

00:21:32.333 --> 00:21:39.042
Shut up! Unless I slice you to bits,
you'll turn into a Titan again!

00:21:50.333 --> 00:21:54.375
Where... are... my glasses?

00:21:54.375 --> 00:21:59.917
Huh? Who cares?
You won't be needing 'em anymore.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.292
Nice one, Zeke!

00:22:05.292 --> 00:22:08.250
You're getting good at throwing!

00:22:17.208 --> 00:22:21.125
Ever thought about playing baseball?

00:22:21.125 --> 00:22:25.250
I can't, Mr. Ksaver...

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:29.292
I... have a mission.

00:24:02.875 --> 00:24:08.667
One remembers long-missed faces
and distant memories.

00:24:08.667 --> 00:24:14.208
Likewise, what must be
done to achieve one's mission.

00:24:14.208 --> 00:24:17.088
Next episode: "Sole Salvation."
