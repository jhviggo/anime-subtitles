00:00:26.167 --> 00:00:28.667
Gabi! Hey! What's wrong?!

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:30.583
Hey! Settle down!

00:00:30.583 --> 00:00:32.792
What's wrong?! What happened?!

00:00:32.792 --> 00:00:34.417
She's in pain!

00:00:34.417 --> 00:00:36.792
Hey! You okay, missy?

00:00:45.917 --> 00:00:48.125
Gabi! That's overkill!

00:00:54.042 --> 00:00:56.542
How's running away gonna help?!

00:00:56.542 --> 00:00:58.917
We'll be killed if we stay!

00:00:58.917 --> 00:01:01.333
That guy was worried about you!

00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:03.667
Can you trust those devils?!

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:08.208
I can't even trust Zeke anymore!
Or anyone else!

00:01:19.792 --> 00:01:22.542
Having nightmares or something?

00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:27.500
How I wish this all was a dream.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.333
I heard Gabi and Falco's voices.
Where are those two?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
"Deceiver"

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.917
We must've gone pretty far.
We ran all through the night.

00:03:14.917 --> 00:03:20.167
Hey, take off your armband. You'll stand out.

00:03:20.167 --> 00:03:24.917
If any normal person sees it,
they won't know what it means.

00:03:24.917 --> 00:03:28.958
But soldiers will know what it is.
Just take it off.

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:32.250
There're no soldiers out here in the sticks.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:38.000
Someone will see it eventually!
Who knows if we'll make it back home?!

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.083
I don't plan to. I just wanna get answers
from Zeke before I'm caught and killed.

00:03:45.083 --> 00:03:51.083
"Did you really betray us and Marley?"
"Why did you do it?"

00:03:51.083 --> 00:03:55.667
You can do whatever you want.
You don't have to follow me.

00:03:55.667 --> 00:04:01.500
Fine, then. I'll do whatever I want,
starting with trashing this.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.875
Give it back!

00:04:05.292 --> 00:04:09.625
What for?! What's the point
of even wearing it here?!

00:04:09.625 --> 00:04:15.000
I'm a good Eldian! Without that,
I'm the same as the island devils!

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.125
What are you saying?! You're acting crazy!

00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:20.375
Then, just leave me alone!

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.750
Why... did you come with me?

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.917
You didn't have to die, too!

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.250
What are you doing?

00:04:33.458 --> 00:04:38.250
It's so early in the morning.
Where did you come from?

00:04:39.542 --> 00:04:46.792
I-I don't wanna say. We hated our
home and ran away from it all.

00:04:46.792 --> 00:04:50.250
So, we can't go back.

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:58.458
I see. Are you guys hungry?
I live nearby, so follow me.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.333
Wait here a minute.

00:05:06.333 --> 00:05:07.750
Okay.

00:05:08.625 --> 00:05:10.875
Let's take the horse and run.

00:05:10.875 --> 00:05:12.833
What are you talking about?

00:05:12.833 --> 00:05:17.042
They'll come and search here, too.
We've gotta run farther.

00:05:17.042 --> 00:05:21.583
Besides, I'm not gonna
share a meal with devils.

00:05:21.583 --> 00:05:22.792
Listen here--

00:05:22.792 --> 00:05:25.167
All right! Come on in!

00:05:25.167 --> 00:05:27.958
O-Okay! We'll be right there!

00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:31.958
I'll do all the talking,
so keep your mouth shut.

00:05:33.125 --> 00:05:38.375
You younguns are the runaways?
Who might ya be?

00:05:38.375 --> 00:05:40.167
A southern Marleyan accent?

00:05:40.167 --> 00:05:44.667
Nice to meet you!
We're siblings, Ben and Mia!

00:05:44.667 --> 00:05:48.333
We have our reasons,
but we ran away from home!

00:05:48.333 --> 00:05:55.667
We'll do whatever work you want!
Please, let us stay for just a few days!

00:05:55.667 --> 00:05:57.417
Please!

00:05:58.542 --> 00:06:02.167
You younguns don't need
to be bowin' like that.

00:06:02.167 --> 00:06:05.125
Welcome to Braus Stables.

00:06:05.125 --> 00:06:11.125
Y'all can stay as long as ya like.
C'mon, join us for breakfast.

00:06:13.083 --> 00:06:18.333
Are y'all tired? Go lie down
once yer done eatin'.

00:06:23.792 --> 00:06:25.542
Lisa, the lass is...

00:06:25.542 --> 00:06:29.250
I'm sorry. I'm sure y'all
been through a lot.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.208
Well...

00:06:30.208 --> 00:06:34.083
Sorry about my little sister!
Th-Thanks for breakfast!

00:06:34.083 --> 00:06:37.292
Delicious! It's so good!

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.500
It's really so good!

00:06:42.042 --> 00:06:45.125
C'mon! Eat up, Mia!

00:06:58.583 --> 00:07:03.667
Congratulations on your successful
campaign against Marley.

00:07:03.667 --> 00:07:09.708
The leaders of Hizuru have nothing
but praise for Eldia's bravery.

00:07:09.708 --> 00:07:15.375
We're deeply honored. Welcome to
the world's most dangerous island.

00:07:15.375 --> 00:07:22.917
Indeed. But this time, our goal is to
witness said danger in person.

00:07:22.917 --> 00:07:27.042
Is that the observation craft you've spoken of?

00:07:27.042 --> 00:07:33.833
Yes. It may just be the world's first
flying boat powered by Iceburst Stone.

00:07:33.833 --> 00:07:39.042
With it, we will ascertain the
true power of the rumbling.

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:44.625
Are the rumors true about Jaeger being
imprisoned and the volunteers detained?

00:07:44.625 --> 00:07:47.292
We want an explanation, Hange!

00:07:47.292 --> 00:07:50.958
Why are there orders to evacuate Shiganshina?!

00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:54.458
Reeves Company was put
in charge of rebuilding it!

00:07:54.458 --> 00:07:55.750
Ask the MPs.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:08:01.042
Hange! Jaeger's victory
opened the path to our future!

00:08:01.042 --> 00:08:03.667
A future where Eldians can live!

00:08:03.667 --> 00:08:09.333
If that's true, all Eldians should have
a voice in how Jaeger is handled!

00:08:09.333 --> 00:08:14.875
Hange, you once said, "Taxpayers
decide what to make of information."

00:08:14.875 --> 00:08:18.583
Have you changed your views?

00:08:18.583 --> 00:08:22.542
The situation has changed!
Our walls are open to the world!

00:08:22.542 --> 00:08:25.083
The meaning of info has changed!

00:08:25.083 --> 00:08:28.792
I know you're in a tough situation, Hange.

00:08:28.792 --> 00:08:32.958
So look me in my eyes
and tell me I can trust you.

00:08:34.875 --> 00:08:39.292
This is all for the sake of the Eldian people.

00:08:53.708 --> 00:08:57.208
You're the ones who leaked
the info about Eren?

00:08:57.208 --> 00:09:04.000
Holger, Wim, Louise...
You three recruits, and Floch.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.792
Why did you do it?

00:09:06.792 --> 00:09:12.542
Because Eren should be freed.
He hasn't done anything wrong.

00:09:12.542 --> 00:09:16.958
He challenged an imposing enemy
and grasped victory.

00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:23.208
Victory in the form of the rumbling,
which secures our right to live.

00:09:23.208 --> 00:09:28.417
Eren saved the lives of everyone
in the New Eldian Empire.

00:09:28.417 --> 00:09:34.708
There's no guarantee that the rumbling
works as planned and can save us.

00:09:34.708 --> 00:09:37.833
At this point, it's no more than a myth.

00:09:37.833 --> 00:09:41.292
Only because you're keeping Eren locked up.

00:09:42.875 --> 00:09:47.500
Do we really have the luxury of wasting time?

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:51.500
At this rate, our victory will be squandered.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:57.292
Eren Jaeger will lead our country.
Please, release him at once.

00:09:58.875 --> 00:10:03.417
Yeah, you might just be right about that.

00:10:03.417 --> 00:10:09.167
One way or another, I made the
decision to carry out Zeke's plan.

00:10:09.167 --> 00:10:12.375
The full responsibility is mine.

00:10:12.375 --> 00:10:16.042
Therefore, I won't tolerate disobedience.

00:10:16.042 --> 00:10:20.083
You will be tried for leaking
information about Eren.

00:10:20.083 --> 00:10:22.375
Have them confined.

00:10:24.125 --> 00:10:27.917
If it's for the sake of humanity, so be it.

00:10:37.292 --> 00:10:42.000
This role of ours... There's an order to it.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.833
When one's role is done,
another steps in to start the act again.

00:10:48.833 --> 00:10:52.167
Good luck, Hange.

00:10:58.625 --> 00:11:00.583
I'm pooped.

00:11:03.875 --> 00:11:08.458
No... There's more I need to investigate.

00:11:13.208 --> 00:11:16.667
Have you ever been in this cell, Mikasa?

00:11:16.667 --> 00:11:18.708
Huh? No.

00:11:18.708 --> 00:11:22.750
I see. That's a shame.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:27.917
Oh, I don't regret what I did.
If victory is our ultimate goal,

00:11:27.917 --> 00:11:32.250
obeying the laws isn't
the end all be all, right?

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:37.375
Stop it, Louise. You'll only be here longer.

00:11:37.375 --> 00:11:42.917
I'm still the same person
as the one you saved that day.

00:11:42.917 --> 00:11:47.583
I realized something when you,
a human, took down that Titan:

00:11:47.583 --> 00:11:51.417
That without power,
you can't protect anything.

00:11:51.417 --> 00:11:56.458
I learned that it's okay to fight
against senseless violence.

00:11:57.333 --> 00:12:03.667
Ever since that day,
I wanted to get closer to you, so I...

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:13.292
Why did you join the
Scout Regiment, Mikasa?

00:12:13.292 --> 00:12:15.250
If it was for Jaeger, freeing him--

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:19.917
I only have one thing to say:
Keep your mouth shut.

00:12:41.708 --> 00:12:44.000
You're safe now...

00:12:45.667 --> 00:12:46.958
...Mikasa.

00:12:46.958 --> 00:12:51.958
"Paradis Island Devils: An insult referring to
King Fritz and the Eldians who fled to Paradis.
The 'Paradis Island Threat' theory claims they
still bear a grudge from the Great Titan War."

00:12:53.333 --> 00:12:58.375
Ten months ago, there was an opening
celebration for the Trost railway.

00:12:58.375 --> 00:13:05.333
The guard watching you suddenly
changed... to Floch Forster.

00:13:05.333 --> 00:13:10.958
While the party was in full swing,
Floch escorted you to your lodgings--

00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:14.958
a man currently detained for leaking info.

00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:21.875
Furthermore, your lodgings were a few
dozen kilometers from Eren's home.

00:13:21.875 --> 00:13:28.292
It just so happens that around this time,
Eren began moving on his own.

00:13:28.292 --> 00:13:33.917
On the bright side, now I have
an excuse to talk with a pretty lady.

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:52.458
Huh?!

00:13:53.625 --> 00:13:56.333
Gabi!

00:13:59.167 --> 00:14:02.500
Gabi!

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.292
Why is this happening to me?

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:08.958
This is the devil's doing!

00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:12.167
No, I think it's the horse's doing.

00:14:14.458 --> 00:14:18.167
There's not a horse that would let you ride it.

00:14:18.167 --> 00:14:21.333
Well, I wasn't trained how to ride one.

00:14:21.333 --> 00:14:25.250
We won't learn a thing out here in the sticks.

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:29.292
I think it's better to hunker
down here than roam around.

00:14:29.292 --> 00:14:31.250
What are you talking about?

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:34.417
We can stay here and wait for help.

00:14:34.417 --> 00:14:38.167
Eventually, the world will attack the island.

00:14:38.167 --> 00:14:41.375
I bet Reiner and my brother will come, too.

00:14:41.375 --> 00:14:46.333
Aren't you pissed at Zeke?!
There was a traitor right among us!

00:14:47.208 --> 00:14:49.875
There's nothing we can do.

00:14:53.833 --> 00:14:58.375
And what the hell is "Mia"?
Why am I your little sister?!

00:14:58.375 --> 00:15:01.125
Does it even matter?

00:15:01.125 --> 00:15:04.417
Hey, guys. Let's have lunch.

00:15:06.583 --> 00:15:10.833
You're quick learners and hard-working, too.

00:15:10.833 --> 00:15:13.750
You think? Thank you.

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:18.792
By the way, Kaya. I noticed all
the workers here are pretty young.

00:15:18.792 --> 00:15:22.292
Yeah. Everyone here is an orphan.

00:15:22.292 --> 00:15:24.417
Oh, really?

00:15:24.417 --> 00:15:28.750
The Queen's policies give support
to kids without families.

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:32.792
All of us here lost our parents four years ago.

00:15:32.792 --> 00:15:35.167
You haven't accepted your guilt.

00:15:35.167 --> 00:15:36.208
--Huh?
--Wha--?!

00:15:36.208 --> 00:15:42.458
Have you forgotten the atrocities
the people of this island committed?

00:15:42.458 --> 00:15:49.583
Only when an Eldian accepts the depths
of their sins can they begin to atone.

00:15:49.583 --> 00:15:53.042
Is that related to our parents dying?

00:15:53.042 --> 00:15:59.292
Of course. Even if you act like a saint,
your sins are too great to escape.

00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:02.333
--Is that what they teach you in Marley?
--We're in her debt, you know!

00:16:02.333 --> 00:16:05.417
--These are indisputable truths!
--Would you just...?

00:16:05.417 --> 00:16:07.542
What did you just say?

00:16:07.542 --> 00:16:10.917
You two came from Marley, right?

00:16:10.917 --> 00:16:12.500
How did you...?

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:16.417
You have to ask? You yelled it out loud.

00:16:16.417 --> 00:16:20.375
Huh? Uh... You knew from the get-go?

00:16:20.375 --> 00:16:25.000
Really? From the start? I'm so embarrassed!

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.083
Why didn't you say something?
You're so sneaky!

00:16:29.083 --> 00:16:30.208
Huh?!

00:16:37.125 --> 00:16:38.667
What are you doing?!

00:16:38.667 --> 00:16:41.625
The devil revealed her true colors!

00:16:41.625 --> 00:16:45.833
I knew something was up!
Island devils can't be this kind!

00:16:45.833 --> 00:16:47.458
Stop, you idiot!

00:16:47.458 --> 00:16:48.583
Hey!

00:16:48.583 --> 00:16:51.500
What's all the fuss about?

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:52.417
Shoot!

00:16:52.417 --> 00:16:57.500
Mia's jealous and thinks
I'm stealing her brother!

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:02.500
Kaya's actually getting along with
people? She's cheered up some.

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:07.625
Good grief... Don't horse around
or you'll get hurt!

00:17:07.625 --> 00:17:09.167
Sorry!

00:17:11.917 --> 00:17:13.667
Why?

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:19.500
This village used to be my home.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:23.167
Four years ago, a Titan showed up here.

00:17:23.167 --> 00:17:30.458
The villagers ran when they saw it
and left behind my mom, who couldn't run.

00:17:30.458 --> 00:17:34.625
There was nothing I could do, so I sat down.

00:17:34.625 --> 00:17:40.500
From right here, I sat and listened
to my mom get eaten.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.917
She was alive the whole time it happened.

00:17:43.917 --> 00:17:46.917
Eventually, she went silent.

00:17:46.917 --> 00:17:50.417
I think she screamed until she lost her voice.

00:17:51.583 --> 00:17:57.292
They say humanity outside the walls
thinks that we're devils.

00:17:57.292 --> 00:18:01.917
But I don't understand why
we're hated so much.

00:18:01.917 --> 00:18:07.583
Mia, Ben. Tell me.
What exactly did my mom do?

00:18:07.583 --> 00:18:10.833
What did she do to be hated so much?

00:18:10.833 --> 00:18:15.792
Your kind slaughtered people
for thousands of years!

00:18:15.792 --> 00:18:16.875
Thousands?

00:18:16.875 --> 00:18:19.625
Don't tell me you forgot it!

00:18:19.625 --> 00:18:25.500
Eldians used the Power of the Titans
to trample and rule the world for millennia!

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.917
They wiped out other cultures,

00:18:27.917 --> 00:18:32.792
forced them to bear their children,
and murdered endless droves of people!

00:18:32.792 --> 00:18:35.250
Stop playing the victim!

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:40.542
My mom was born and raised here.
She never did anything like that.

00:18:40.542 --> 00:18:46.083
But a century ago, the sins of your
ancestors were terrible and great!

00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:52.833
A century ago? What about the people
who live now? How have we sinned?

00:18:52.833 --> 00:18:56.625
Not long ago, you guys trampled my home.

00:18:56.625 --> 00:19:01.375
My mom was killed four years ago,
so it's not her fault.

00:19:01.375 --> 00:19:04.833
I'm telling you, your ancestors
killed people all over the--

00:19:04.833 --> 00:19:07.583
My mom didn't kill anyone!

00:19:07.583 --> 00:19:12.917
Answer me, Mia! Why did my mom
have to suffer like that?

00:19:12.917 --> 00:19:17.000
There has to be a reason!
It's crazy if there's not!

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.875
Why was my mom eaten alive, huh?!
Why was she killed?!

00:19:22.875 --> 00:19:25.583
Huh?! Why?!

00:19:27.458 --> 00:19:30.125
It was recon-in-force.

00:19:30.125 --> 00:19:37.708
The invasion of Paradis four years ago
was staging for a larger attack.

00:19:37.708 --> 00:19:41.792
You and your mother were caught up in it.

00:19:41.792 --> 00:19:45.125
Your mom didn't do anything wrong.

00:19:45.125 --> 00:19:46.833
I'm sorry.

00:19:49.583 --> 00:19:54.667
You're leaking secrets to the enemy.
And why apologize?

00:19:56.083 --> 00:20:00.000
Thanks for letting me know, Ben.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.042
But it's weird for you to apologize
for Marley. You were just born there.

00:20:08.417 --> 00:20:13.833
So, how did you manage to escape and survive?

00:20:13.833 --> 00:20:21.833
A girl a bit older than I am now grabbed
a hatchet and started hitting the Titan.

00:20:21.833 --> 00:20:24.208
No way! That's crazy!

00:20:24.208 --> 00:20:31.958
Yeah. She put herself between me and
the Titan and allowed me to escape.

00:20:31.958 --> 00:20:38.417
If she was alive, she wouldn't abandon
people like you with nowhere to go.

00:20:38.417 --> 00:20:41.375
Just like she didn't abandon me.

00:20:42.583 --> 00:20:47.208
We were invited to a restaurant
a Marleyan is working at.

00:20:47.208 --> 00:20:53.417
If you come along, you might find
a way to go back home.

00:20:53.417 --> 00:20:55.500
Why...?

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:59.667
I want to become a person like her.

00:22:02.167 --> 00:22:10.125
Investigating the Beast Titan's corpse,
we found pieces of Zeke blown apart.

00:22:10.125 --> 00:22:16.417
However, not enough of them.
We only found his arms and legs.

00:22:16.417 --> 00:22:21.292
He pretended that he was dead
in order to deceive us.

00:22:21.292 --> 00:22:27.333
We believe Zeke has sided with Paradis
and escaped on the airship.

00:22:27.333 --> 00:22:34.167
This modified Anti-Personnel ODM gear
utilizes Marleyan technology.

00:22:34.167 --> 00:22:36.583
There's also the airship they stole.

00:22:36.583 --> 00:22:42.042
It executed advanced maneuvers
only a trained pilot could perform.

00:22:42.042 --> 00:22:47.542
Zeke probably sneaked comrades
aboard the scout fleet four years ago--

00:22:47.542 --> 00:22:50.000
Eldian Restorationists, that is.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:56.417
Sh-Shit. To think we fought side-by-side
with a traitor this whole time.

00:22:56.417 --> 00:22:59.792
Obviously, we won't let him off the hook.

00:22:59.792 --> 00:23:05.708
Within six months, a global alliance
will launch an offensive on Paradis.

00:23:05.708 --> 00:23:11.292
S-Six months?! We're waiting six months
to rescue Gabi and Falco?

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:16.167
They're the most talented Warrior candidates.

00:23:16.167 --> 00:23:19.875
It'll be a huge blow to Marley if we lose them.

00:23:19.875 --> 00:23:24.792
And training new Warrior
candidates will take ages.

00:23:24.792 --> 00:23:31.292
But if Marley attacks alone,
we'll only be driven back like last time.

00:23:31.292 --> 00:23:34.333
We must wait for the global alliance.

00:23:34.333 --> 00:23:36.792
Zeke is hoping we will.

00:23:36.792 --> 00:23:42.333
He thinks Marley won't attack
after taking such heavy damage.

00:23:42.333 --> 00:23:48.125
If we wait half a year to get there,
he'll have made plans to fight back.

00:23:48.125 --> 00:23:51.042
We can't wait for the global alliance!

00:23:52.083 --> 00:23:56.042
We have to launch a surprise attack at once!

00:24:03.167 --> 00:24:08.750
Who should one hate?
What should one blame?

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:13.958
By now, one should've been used
to the shifting of truth.

00:24:13.958 --> 00:24:17.088
Next episode: "Guides."
