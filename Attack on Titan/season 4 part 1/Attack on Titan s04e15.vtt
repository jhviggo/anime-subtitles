WEBVTT

00:00:23.292 --> 00:00:28.042
Take a good look, Zeke.
That's Liberio, where we live.

00:00:28.042 --> 00:00:31.708
Compared to the world,
it's like a tiny birdcage.

00:00:31.708 --> 00:00:37.083
Since we can't leave,
we have to live here till we die.

00:00:37.083 --> 00:00:41.417
Zeke, wouldn't you like to leave?

00:00:41.417 --> 00:00:44.583
Yeah, I would.

00:00:44.583 --> 00:00:49.375
Oh, what's this? We hardly ever
get visitors this early.

00:00:49.375 --> 00:00:51.542
I'll come back later.

00:00:51.542 --> 00:00:55.000
It's okay. We're on our way out.

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:02.917
Oh, Eldians?

00:01:02.917 --> 00:01:07.042
Wh-What?! We got permission
to leave the walls!

00:01:07.042 --> 00:01:11.750
It's my job to clean the tower
and get rid of trash.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.292
You came in here and defiled it, you devils!

00:01:15.292 --> 00:01:21.917
Your kind slaughtered countless lives!
Yet here you are, pumping out kids?!

00:01:23.542 --> 00:01:24.375
Devils!

00:01:24.375 --> 00:01:26.417
Stay in the internment zone!

00:01:26.417 --> 00:01:27.917
You guys stink!

00:01:27.917 --> 00:01:31.625
--Thanks for ruining my day!
--Remember this well, Zeke.

00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:33.792
This is the outside world.

00:01:33.792 --> 00:01:37.750
If you don't like it, you've gotta change it.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.667
Zeke, you're going to save everyone.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
"Sole Salvation"

00:03:22.375 --> 00:03:25.667
One of these kids will be my successor?

00:03:25.667 --> 00:03:28.042
Yes, we'll choose one.

00:03:28.042 --> 00:03:31.417
One of them is falling behind. Who's that?

00:03:31.417 --> 00:03:34.000
Ah. Jaeger again?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.667
All the other kids are fiercely competing
to be Honorary Marleyans.

00:03:39.667 --> 00:03:43.083
Yet he has none of that drive.

00:03:43.083 --> 00:03:46.292
Why does he even come here?

00:03:47.917 --> 00:03:50.208
How was training, Zeke?

00:03:50.208 --> 00:03:51.917
It's really tough.

00:03:51.917 --> 00:03:55.875
I see. But I know you can be a Warrior.

00:03:55.875 --> 00:03:58.792
Because you have a special power.

00:03:58.792 --> 00:04:02.042
And most important of all, you're our son!

00:04:02.042 --> 00:04:03.750
Right!

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.083
Father, Mother. Thanks for watching Zeke.

00:04:07.083 --> 00:04:08.292
Yeah.

00:04:08.292 --> 00:04:11.000
I baked your favorite pie today.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.208
Yippee!

00:04:12.208 --> 00:04:17.125
Your social dance club again? Zeke misses you.

00:04:17.125 --> 00:04:20.500
But it's for the wellness of Liberio.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.833
Someday, I'm sure Zeke will
understand why we're doing this.

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:31.625
This is the Tragedy of Lago
that occurred 1,200 years ago.

00:04:31.625 --> 00:04:34.917
After Lago was destroyed in a single day,

00:04:34.917 --> 00:04:41.125
the Titans went on to cause the Horrors
of Valle and Ravaging of Monte.

00:04:41.125 --> 00:04:45.500
Marleyans in the tens of thousands
were killed by Eldia.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.917
What's more, the people who escaped
Lago fled into the countryside.

00:04:50.917 --> 00:04:55.000
However, the Eldian Empire
put Titans along the path,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.750
and at daybreak, the Titans
rose and attacked the--

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.875
Yeah, I know. A lot of people died.

00:05:03.875 --> 00:05:08.000
Is your father teaching you our actual history?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.792
He says Eldians did horrible things
to Marleyans, so we have to atone for it.

00:05:14.792 --> 00:05:19.583
Do you want to become a Warrior
and fight for Marley?

00:05:21.375 --> 00:05:25.375
Yeah. I want to be a Warrior.

00:05:27.458 --> 00:05:29.750
Well, I think it's bedtime.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.125
Oh! Next time you're here,
I'll read you the cat house book!

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:35.667
Yay!

00:05:42.542 --> 00:05:43.708
Begin!

00:06:04.417 --> 00:06:06.958
You're awful at this, Dad!

00:06:13.167 --> 00:06:14.333
Dad!

00:06:14.333 --> 00:06:15.500
Zeke?

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.625
I finished early today! Let's--

00:06:17.625 --> 00:06:22.208
Oh, good. We'll be able to study more.

00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:25.458
Right...

00:06:25.458 --> 00:06:30.000
In other words, the Tragedy
of Lago never happened.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.208
The Ravaging of Monte and Horrors of Valle
are stories made up by Marley, too.

00:06:36.208 --> 00:06:41.333
Eldians have never had such cruel
customs or culture. After all--

00:06:41.333 --> 00:06:46.417
The Founder Ymir wouldn't
want that. It's unthinkable.

00:06:46.417 --> 00:06:50.583
That's right! You're catching on, Zeke!

00:06:50.583 --> 00:06:51.958
Yeah!

00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:54.125
If you're not serious, get lost!

00:06:54.125 --> 00:06:59.375
Marley needs people willing to
give everything to our motherland.

00:06:59.375 --> 00:07:05.542
We sure as hell won't leave a Titan
in the hands of someone like you.

00:07:11.042 --> 00:07:16.458
Hey! You there! Can you toss that ball back?

00:07:23.083 --> 00:07:25.750
You've got a good arm for a kid!

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.292
Huh?

00:07:27.292 --> 00:07:28.917
Here!

00:07:28.917 --> 00:07:30.958
Nice catch!

00:07:30.958 --> 00:07:36.417
I'm sick of throwing off the wall.
You mind playing for a bit?

00:07:36.417 --> 00:07:39.042
A red armband! You're--!

00:07:39.042 --> 00:07:42.500
One of the Marleyan Warriors
you're aiming to be.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:47.417
Though, since my Beast Titan
isn't too helpful in war,

00:07:47.417 --> 00:07:50.958
I mostly just play catch around here.

00:07:50.958 --> 00:07:55.750
The name's Tom Ksaver.
I work in Titan research.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.917
So, what's your name?

00:07:58.917 --> 00:08:01.667
Zeke Jaeger!

00:08:01.667 --> 00:08:07.167
Zeke, your throw has some heat!
You'd be a good pitcher.

00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.417
I'm home! Dad, guess what?

00:08:14.417 --> 00:08:16.458
That's not what you told me!

00:08:16.458 --> 00:08:21.625
What gives, Grice? If Zeke isn't
chosen, the plan's finished!

00:08:21.625 --> 00:08:29.083
But the Owl said they can't influence the
decision unless Zeke has decent scores.

00:08:29.083 --> 00:08:33.417
I know! A chance like
this comes once a century!

00:08:33.417 --> 00:08:37.042
Doesn't Zeke still have a shot, though?

00:08:37.042 --> 00:08:41.083
Yeah, he might. If Zeke steps up--

00:08:48.583 --> 00:08:50.458
--I'm sorry.
--Zeke!

00:08:50.458 --> 00:08:55.708
I know you can do it!
You're our son, after all!

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:01.833
I said Marley has no need for you.
Why are you here?

00:09:01.833 --> 00:09:07.167
T-To show my loyalty to Marley
and atone for Eldia's sins!

00:09:07.167 --> 00:09:10.167
Let me in open training, please!

00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:31.458
What are you doing, Jaeger?!
Run! Run, boy!

00:09:32.375 --> 00:09:34.458
Dammit! It's bullshit!

00:09:34.458 --> 00:09:37.583
Don't say that! He's trying his best!

00:09:37.583 --> 00:09:41.708
He'll never be a Warrior like this!

00:09:44.208 --> 00:09:46.625
You were a mess the other day.

00:09:46.625 --> 00:09:53.500
It's not funny. They're just having me
run errands now. It's over for me.

00:09:55.792 --> 00:10:00.458
Seemed to me that you never
wanted to be a Warrior.

00:10:00.458 --> 00:10:05.875
I have to become one, yet I totally failed.

00:10:05.875 --> 00:10:09.875
No big deal. It's stupid
for you to be a Warrior.

00:10:09.875 --> 00:10:15.625
It's dumb to shorten your life for Marley
and get sent to fight other nations.

00:10:15.625 --> 00:10:16.958
Huh?!

00:10:19.333 --> 00:10:21.833
Why did you become a Warrior?

00:10:21.833 --> 00:10:27.500
To learn the secrets of Titans.
I'm a researcher, you know.

00:10:28.542 --> 00:10:33.708
Everything started when the
Founder Ymir touched "something,"

00:10:33.708 --> 00:10:37.000
but I wanted to know the truth of it all--

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.208
enough to shorten my life
to look through Titan memories.

00:10:42.208 --> 00:10:46.792
That's why I'm pretty much
useless when it comes to war.

00:10:46.792 --> 00:10:52.833
Compared to the mysteries of Titans,
hatred and war seem so trivial.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:59.208
That's why you and I aren't
interested in their war games.

00:10:59.208 --> 00:11:03.792
We're just two decent people--
a real rarity in this world.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:14.542
This is for the best. Even if I can't
leave the zone, as long as I'm alive...

00:11:20.375 --> 00:11:24.875
We finally got a lead.
They're the "Eldian Restorationists."

00:11:24.875 --> 00:11:26.875
It's a pretty large group.

00:11:26.875 --> 00:11:32.833
A traitor called the "Owl" formed it.
We've got a few hunches already.

00:11:32.833 --> 00:11:37.958
It's just a matter of time
till we get solid proof.

00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.042
Zeke?

00:11:40.042 --> 00:11:42.083
What's wrong?

00:11:42.083 --> 00:11:43.792
Eat up.

00:11:43.792 --> 00:11:46.667
M-My stomach hurts.

00:11:56.083 --> 00:12:02.125
Dad, Mom... Stop doing dangerous things.

00:12:03.167 --> 00:12:06.500
If they find out, we'll be sent to paradise--

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:11.292
sent to the island of devils
and made into Titans.

00:12:11.292 --> 00:12:14.792
Have you learned nothing I've taught you?

00:12:14.792 --> 00:12:20.500
Unless someone takes a stand,
we'll live pitiful lives in this tiny cage.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:27.167
That's right. We're fighting for the
future of all Eldians, including yours.

00:12:27.167 --> 00:12:32.417
Even if there's a chance
that I end up like Aunt Fay?

00:12:32.417 --> 00:12:38.167
Zeke! The only reason Fay died
is because this world is twisted!

00:12:38.167 --> 00:12:42.250
We have to fight so nobody
else ends up like her!

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:47.750
We must restore the strength of Eldia
and win our rights back!

00:12:48.958 --> 00:12:53.958
"Titan research concerns the unique power of
Subjects of Ymir to become Titans, including
not only the biology of Titans, but also the
ideologies of Eldians who possess the power."

00:12:56.625 --> 00:12:58.583
You're kidding me!

00:12:58.583 --> 00:13:04.125
Your parents are Restorationists?!
You'll all be sent to paradise!

00:13:04.125 --> 00:13:05.625
Yeah.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:13.167
Mr. Ksaver, thanks for playing catch with me.

00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:17.208
Even when I'm a Titan, I'll remember you.

00:13:20.917 --> 00:13:23.417
Well, goodbye.

00:13:25.292 --> 00:13:26.917
Report them.

00:13:26.917 --> 00:13:27.833
Huh?

00:13:27.833 --> 00:13:30.708
It's your only hope!

00:13:30.708 --> 00:13:35.292
If you report them to Marley
and prove your loyalty,

00:13:35.292 --> 00:13:38.292
you and your grandparents might be spared.

00:13:38.292 --> 00:13:40.333
I could never do that!

00:13:40.333 --> 00:13:44.750
Zeke! Your parents have been terrible to you!

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:48.500
They gave up on you
and never cared how you felt!

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:52.667
They... never loved you!

00:13:52.667 --> 00:13:56.333
Zeke, you've done nothing wrong.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:03.042
You're a smart kid. A good kid.

00:14:08.875 --> 00:14:12.000
Take it easy on me, Zeke!

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.833
Whoops. Do I throw too hard for a geezer?

00:14:15.833 --> 00:14:18.583
Hey! I'm not that old--!

00:14:19.833 --> 00:14:21.250
Mr. Ksaver!

00:14:23.833 --> 00:14:27.333
It won't be long till my term is over.

00:14:27.333 --> 00:14:28.708
Yeah.

00:14:28.708 --> 00:14:33.917
I didn't get to grow old,
but I don't regret a life of research.

00:14:33.917 --> 00:14:37.083
I'll be able to release a compilation.

00:14:37.083 --> 00:14:39.792
Yeah? What about?

00:14:39.792 --> 00:14:44.750
The things the Founding Titan
did to the Subjects of Ymir.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:48.792
Oh. Like rewriting their memories?

00:14:48.792 --> 00:14:54.958
Not just memories. It can change
the anatomy of their bodies.

00:14:54.958 --> 00:15:01.833
Around 600 years ago, a terrible
pandemic devastated the population.

00:15:01.833 --> 00:15:08.417
But all of a sudden, the disease just
vanished from the Eldian Empire.

00:15:08.417 --> 00:15:15.042
The King at the time used the Founding
Titan to change how their bodies work.

00:15:15.042 --> 00:15:21.750
No matter where we go, we Subjects of
Ymir are like part of the Founding Titan.

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:24.250
Scary, right?

00:15:25.792 --> 00:15:26.958
Then...

00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:29.875
Why are you pumping out more devils?!

00:15:29.875 --> 00:15:36.625
Can the Founding Titan make it
so Subjects of Ymir can't bear children?

00:15:36.625 --> 00:15:44.583
If none of us were able to have kids,
Titans would be wiped out in 100 years.

00:15:44.583 --> 00:15:50.250
The world wouldn't have to fear
or be threatened by Titans anymore.

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:56.125
What's more, if we hadn't been born,
we wouldn't have had to suffer!

00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:00.875
Mr. Ksaver?

00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:07.333
I've never spoken about it,
but I had a family once.

00:16:07.333 --> 00:16:10.875
In my foolish youth, I removed my armband.

00:16:10.875 --> 00:16:16.333
And hiding the fact I was an Eldian,
I had a wife and child.

00:16:16.333 --> 00:16:19.500
My wife was a Marleyan.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:26.000
I knew I couldn't hide it forever,
but when my wife found out I was Eldian,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.667
she slit my son's throat and her own.

00:16:29.667 --> 00:16:37.125
Me becoming a Warrior was merely
a grandiose way to commit suicide, but...

00:16:37.125 --> 00:16:45.250
For 13 years, I immersed myself in
Titan research, met you, played catch...

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:47.833
It's been fun.

00:16:47.833 --> 00:16:54.708
I looked for my dead son in you.
I ran from my sins with my Titan powers!

00:16:54.708 --> 00:16:58.792
If only I hadn't been born in this world!

00:16:59.917 --> 00:17:03.375
I'll inherit the Beast Titan.

00:17:03.375 --> 00:17:10.833
Not for Marley, but to retake the
Founding Titan and save the world!

00:17:10.833 --> 00:17:14.667
I'll free the world from the terror of Titans

00:17:14.667 --> 00:17:17.667
and free all Eldians from suffering!

00:17:21.375 --> 00:17:28.875
This is something I haven't told Marley--
a way to break the vow renouncing war.

00:17:28.875 --> 00:17:33.958
As luck would have it, it's only
possible because it's you.

00:17:33.958 --> 00:17:39.375
If a Titan with royal blood comes
in contact with the Founding Titan,

00:17:39.375 --> 00:17:42.542
it's possible to draw out its power.

00:17:42.542 --> 00:17:49.375
However, the power isn't yours to use.
That right lies with the Founding Titan.

00:17:49.375 --> 00:17:53.208
Essentially, you're the key to the lock.

00:17:53.208 --> 00:17:58.125
The Founding Titan needs
to be someone you trust.

00:17:58.125 --> 00:18:02.917
Someone who understands
our "euthanization" plan.

00:18:02.917 --> 00:18:05.625
I know you'll find that someone.

00:18:08.917 --> 00:18:14.875
I'll always be watching over you, Zeke.

00:18:14.875 --> 00:18:18.750
I'll find that someone, Father.

00:18:22.208 --> 00:18:24.875
Eren Jaeger?

00:18:24.875 --> 00:18:28.708
Yes. Eren possesses the Founding Titan.

00:18:28.708 --> 00:18:36.250
And in the basement of his house in Shiganshina
there's some sort of vital information.

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:41.458
Did you hear Eren say
anything about his father?

00:18:41.458 --> 00:18:46.750
I believe he said his father's
missing and used to be a doctor.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.292
Unbelievable! "That" father was alive?

00:18:53.292 --> 00:18:59.875
Eren, we're victims.
You've been brainwashed by him.

00:18:59.875 --> 00:19:04.125
Someday, I'll come and rescue you!

00:19:08.125 --> 00:19:12.083
You're starting to resemble Father a bit.

00:19:15.333 --> 00:19:20.917
First of all, thanks for coming
here to talk with me.

00:19:20.917 --> 00:19:25.208
My stance is exactly what Yelena told you.

00:19:25.208 --> 00:19:30.375
Do you support the Eldian euthanization plan?

00:19:30.375 --> 00:19:36.625
Four years ago, some of Dad's
memories opened up to me--

00:19:36.625 --> 00:19:41.833
memories of when he slaughtered
the wall's royal family.

00:19:41.833 --> 00:19:47.000
He crushed their little kids
and smeared them like bugs.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.500
I felt it, too.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:54.542
If those kids lived, the royal family
would retake the Founding Titan.

00:19:54.542 --> 00:20:01.917
Bound by the vow renouncing war,
humanity in the walls would be doomed.

00:20:01.917 --> 00:20:06.417
Those kids dying is what let us live.

00:20:06.417 --> 00:20:12.125
I see. So you believe that Father was right?

00:20:12.125 --> 00:20:15.667
No, he was wrong.

00:20:15.667 --> 00:20:21.042
And I, the son that he raised, was wrong, too.

00:20:21.042 --> 00:20:25.250
If Eldians hadn't been born, this city--

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:30.083
these people wouldn't have
to die in this plan of ours.

00:20:30.083 --> 00:20:35.417
There's no greater salvation
than never being born in this world.

00:20:35.417 --> 00:20:42.708
I'll do it. I'll put an end
to 2,000 years of Titan domination.

00:20:42.708 --> 00:20:45.750
Until then, I keep moving forward.

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:48.583
Right, Brother?

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:56.417
Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Let's do it.

00:20:56.417 --> 00:21:03.625
I wish I could shake your hand, but it's best
that we don't make contact just yet.

00:21:03.625 --> 00:21:07.458
So instead, take this.

00:21:07.458 --> 00:21:12.125
Eren, we're gonna save everyone.

00:21:16.208 --> 00:21:19.000
Our sole salvation...

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.875
...is Eldia's euthanization.

00:21:28.333 --> 00:21:31.708
You say something? Euthanization?

00:21:31.708 --> 00:21:35.167
You're about to find yourself
in a Titan's mouth,

00:21:35.167 --> 00:21:39.417
listening to what it sounds like to be digested.

00:21:39.417 --> 00:21:43.625
Compared to how you stole
the lives of my comrades,

00:21:43.625 --> 00:21:46.875
it sounds like a pleasant way to die.

00:21:46.875 --> 00:21:51.875
I didn't steal... I saved lives.

00:21:51.875 --> 00:21:55.333
The lives of the children they would bear...

00:21:55.333 --> 00:21:59.250
...from this cruel world.

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:02.208
--Looks like your legs are growing back.
--Isn't that right...

00:22:02.208 --> 00:22:06.833
...Mr. Ksaver?! I hope you're watching!

00:24:03.583 --> 00:24:06.625
The futures they seek are incompatible.

00:24:06.625 --> 00:24:10.292
All they can do is clash,
fighting for their beliefs

00:24:10.292 --> 00:24:14.250
in the place it all began, Shiganshina.

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:17.088
Next episode: "Above and Below."
