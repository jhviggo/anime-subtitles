WEBVTT

00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:51.750
It's called a "gas weapon."

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.333
The gas contains some of my spinal fluid.

00:00:55.333 --> 00:01:00.083
Breathing just a slight amount
makes Subjects of Ymir freeze up.

00:01:00.083 --> 00:01:04.208
They can't control their bodies
and lose consciousness.

00:01:04.208 --> 00:01:11.333
On my command, I send the Power of
the Titans to the coordinate via Paths.

00:01:13.375 --> 00:01:17.875
That's why the people
of that village obeyed my orders.

00:01:17.875 --> 00:01:21.417
It's not "that" village. It's Ragako.

00:01:21.417 --> 00:01:26.583
Don't forget the name of the village
you slaughtered, you bearded shit.

00:01:26.583 --> 00:01:29.833
Well, I didn't want to do it.

00:01:29.833 --> 00:01:34.458
But if I hadn't, and they found out
I was sided with Eldia,

00:01:34.458 --> 00:01:38.542
I couldn't have brought hope to this island.

00:01:38.542 --> 00:01:43.417
You know, I told you all this
when I landed on the island.

00:01:43.417 --> 00:01:46.167
Why do you keep asking?

00:01:46.167 --> 00:01:51.000
You don't have a shred of guilt
in you and it shows.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.917
You may or may not want to save Eldia,
but those lives meant nothing to you.

00:01:57.917 --> 00:02:04.125
You can't have been popular.
You think you know everyone's feelings.

00:02:04.125 --> 00:02:06.542
I do know.

00:02:06.542 --> 00:02:09.417
And I was popular enough.

00:02:09.417 --> 00:02:15.375
Well, ain't that great? So?
When will Eren and I begin the test?

00:02:15.375 --> 00:02:19.458
It's not up to me. We're waiting for HQ.

00:02:19.458 --> 00:02:24.125
They may think they have
time to spare, but they don't.

00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:26.083
I'm with you there.

00:02:26.083 --> 00:02:27.625
Captain Levi!

00:02:29.333 --> 00:02:32.500
What? Are you serious?

00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:07.958
"Children of the Forest"

00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:10.583
What a big building!

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:12.542
I've never seen anything like it!

00:04:12.542 --> 00:04:13.750
Me, either!

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.042
It's yer lucky day, kids!

00:04:16.042 --> 00:04:18.292
Y'all fixin' to eat?

00:04:18.292 --> 00:04:19.458
Yeah!

00:04:19.458 --> 00:04:23.000
What's wrong, Mia? Got the jitters?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.458
Um, no...

00:04:24.458 --> 00:04:26.375
You're so nervous, Mia!

00:04:26.375 --> 00:04:29.167
I know! What a total bumpkin!

00:04:29.167 --> 00:04:30.583
N-No!

00:04:30.583 --> 00:04:35.083
Kaya! Does a Marleyan captive really work here?

00:04:35.083 --> 00:04:39.958
It's true, so get a grip.
Soldiers use this place, too.

00:04:39.958 --> 00:04:43.542
It'll be good to know another Marleyan.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.167
Mr. Braus! Thank you for coming!

00:04:48.167 --> 00:04:51.333
Thanks a bunch for the invite!

00:04:55.583 --> 00:04:59.625
Oh, my. You sure brought a crowd.

00:04:59.625 --> 00:05:04.708
Since it's on the house,
I brought the whole gang. Sorry.

00:05:04.708 --> 00:05:08.542
It's fine. Welcome, everyone. This way, please.

00:05:08.542 --> 00:05:10.542
I'm starving, dad!

00:05:10.542 --> 00:05:13.000
--You and me both!
--We skipped breakfast for this!

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.750
That's Nicolo, the Marleyan
who invited Mr. Braus.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.917
See if he can help you.

00:05:18.917 --> 00:05:23.458
Mr. Braus isn't a soldier,
so why was he invited?

00:05:23.458 --> 00:05:27.500
His daughter was the girl
soldier who saved me.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:34.542
Nicolo was at her grave and wanted
to treat him to the food she loved.

00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:39.167
But, personally, I thought they were in love.

00:05:43.167 --> 00:05:44.792
Ben?

00:05:44.792 --> 00:05:47.125
What's wrong? Tummy ache?

00:05:47.125 --> 00:05:49.000
Uh, no!

00:05:52.875 --> 00:05:56.917
Delicious! I've never had anything this good!

00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:02.917
Just wait till you've had the main dish!

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.208
Nicolo, you've got guests.

00:06:07.208 --> 00:06:10.792
Huh?! Who is it now?!

00:06:10.792 --> 00:06:13.667
The Scouts.

00:06:13.667 --> 00:06:20.875
You guys? What, is it urgent?
My hands are full with some customers.

00:06:20.875 --> 00:06:24.125
Uh, you can get back to work if you want.

00:06:24.125 --> 00:06:28.333
It's just, we'd like to talk once you're done.

00:06:28.333 --> 00:06:31.208
Talk? About what?

00:06:31.208 --> 00:06:34.958
Oh, you know. Like any concerns you have.

00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:40.292
They're investigating our detainment.
We're hoping you can help.

00:06:40.292 --> 00:06:43.042
Yeah, all right.

00:06:44.625 --> 00:06:46.583
You can wait here.

00:06:46.583 --> 00:06:49.417
Oh? What a fancy room.

00:06:49.417 --> 00:06:52.292
I bet it's reserved for MPs.

00:06:52.292 --> 00:06:57.083
Huh? Is this the wine all the
soldiers are gossiping about?!

00:06:57.083 --> 00:07:00.208
They say only higher ranks can get it!

00:07:00.208 --> 00:07:03.500
Yeah? Aren't we high rank in the Scouts?

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:08.125
Yup! We deserve a bit
of fun, too! A sip or two--

00:07:08.125 --> 00:07:09.625
Don't touch that!

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.125
Ch-Chill out, Nicolo.
We're just screwing around.

00:07:16.125 --> 00:07:18.625
No need to overreact.

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:23.667
This good stuff would be wasted on Eldians!

00:07:23.667 --> 00:07:27.708
Nicolo, you're still saying stuff like that?

00:07:27.708 --> 00:07:31.000
The booze don't give a damn what race we are!

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.250
Don't touch me, Eldian. Just because
I've been nice doesn't make us pals.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:40.833
Have you forgotten what you are? You're just a--

00:07:40.833 --> 00:07:46.625
A filthy captive, huh?
That makes us even, Eldian.

00:07:50.542 --> 00:07:52.542
What's his problem?

00:07:52.542 --> 00:07:55.708
Dammit! Hell if I know.

00:08:01.583 --> 00:08:02.542
Go.

00:08:02.542 --> 00:08:05.083
Argh! My stomach hurts!

00:08:05.083 --> 00:08:06.375
You okay, Ben?

00:08:06.375 --> 00:08:08.458
Eat something bad?

00:08:08.458 --> 00:08:11.167
I think I need to use the restroom!

00:08:11.167 --> 00:08:14.333
I think I better go help my brother!

00:08:14.333 --> 00:08:15.958
Good luck.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.333
Hmm? The restroom is the other way.

00:08:28.333 --> 00:08:30.917
That's not why we're here, Nicolo.

00:08:30.917 --> 00:08:35.042
We came from Marley. We're Warrior candidates.

00:08:35.042 --> 00:08:36.125
What?!

00:08:36.125 --> 00:08:41.833
We think there will be a huge
offensive against the island soon.

00:08:41.833 --> 00:08:47.792
Until then, hang in there! And let any
of your Marleyan comrades know!

00:08:47.792 --> 00:08:52.667
H-Hold up! What are Warrior
candidates doing here?

00:08:52.667 --> 00:08:55.917
The island devils raided Liberio.

00:08:55.917 --> 00:09:01.583
We got aboard their airship
as it retreated and rode it here.

00:09:04.125 --> 00:09:08.250
Did you... kill anyone?

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:12.000
A female... soldier?

00:09:12.917 --> 00:09:14.792
Yes, I did!

00:09:14.792 --> 00:09:16.292
--I've only killed a few, but our real
revenge has yet to begin!

00:09:16.292 --> 00:09:20.750
--Gabi, wait! Hey!
--I've only killed a few, but our real
revenge has yet to begin!

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:22.458
--We won't let those spineless
devils get away with...

00:09:22.458 --> 00:09:24.458
--Gabi, stop!
--We won't let those spineless
devils get away with...

00:09:24.458 --> 00:09:27.625
--What?!
--So it was you...

00:09:27.625 --> 00:09:30.458
...who killed her?

00:09:30.458 --> 00:09:33.500
You're the one who killed Sasha?!

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.500
Falco?!

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.958
Hey, Falco!

00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:53.417
Are you okay, Falco?!

00:09:53.417 --> 00:09:57.125
--Falco! Falco! Get up! Wake up!
Hey! Say something, Falco!

00:09:57.125 --> 00:10:00.083
--Shit!
--Falco! Falco! Get up! Wake up!
Hey! Say something, Falco!

00:10:07.042 --> 00:10:11.083
Nicolo! What'd ya do to Ben and Mia?!

00:10:11.083 --> 00:10:17.792
She's the one who killed Sasha.
She took your daughter's life.

00:10:19.042 --> 00:10:23.917
Though she's just a kid,
she's a trained Marleyan soldier.

00:10:23.917 --> 00:10:28.875
She got aboard the airship leaving
Marley and shot your daughter.

00:10:28.875 --> 00:10:31.625
She shot Sasha.

00:10:31.625 --> 00:10:33.500
Daughter?

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.292
Mr. Braus, here.

00:10:39.292 --> 00:10:44.500
If you can't kill her, I will.
Is that all right?

00:10:49.542 --> 00:10:52.958
Wh-What the--?! Come here, guys!

00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.333
Huh? What is it?

00:10:56.292 --> 00:10:58.500
The kid who shot Sasha!

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:03.542
What's going on, Nicolo?
I heard she's on the run!

00:11:03.542 --> 00:11:05.667
What do you think you're doing?! Hey!

00:11:05.667 --> 00:11:11.208
Don't move! Get back!
I'm avenging Sasha! Stay put!

00:11:13.333 --> 00:11:15.125
Stop...

00:11:15.125 --> 00:11:17.042
Not Falco!

00:11:17.042 --> 00:11:22.000
What is this brat to you?!
He took the hit for you!

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.750
Do you care about him?!
I cared about someone, too!

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:28.833
An Eldian! Spawn of the devil!

00:11:28.833 --> 00:11:33.333
One who loved my cooking
more than anyone!

00:11:33.333 --> 00:11:37.083
She saved me from this shitty-ass war!

00:11:37.083 --> 00:11:41.958
She taught me that I like
making people happy with food!

00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:48.583
Her name was Sasha Braus!
She's the girl you stole from me!

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:55.250
People I cared about were killed, too!
They were shot by your Sasha Braus!

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:58.708
That's why I got revenge!
She killed people first!

00:11:58.708 --> 00:12:02.375
Who gives a damn who killed first?!

00:12:02.375 --> 00:12:05.708
Open your eyes! You're a Marleyan soldier!

00:12:05.708 --> 00:12:11.292
That devil woman bewitched you!
Don't lose to the devils!

00:12:12.708 --> 00:12:16.667
Nicolo, hand me the knife.

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:22.583
Come on.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:45.833
Don't do it, Mr. Braus.

00:12:45.833 --> 00:12:49.083
Please put down the knife.

00:12:50.167 --> 00:12:52.833
Sasha was a hunter.

00:12:52.833 --> 00:12:54.083
What?

00:12:54.083 --> 00:13:00.083
Even as a wee girl, she shot
varmints in the forest for us to eat.

00:13:00.083 --> 00:13:03.625
That was just our way of livin'.

00:13:03.625 --> 00:13:09.500
But I knew there'd come a day we'd
have to give up that style of life,

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.958
so I sent Sasha away from the forest.

00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:15.667
She went into the world,

00:13:15.667 --> 00:13:22.917
became a soldier, shot people
far yonder, and got herself shot.

00:13:22.917 --> 00:13:26.750
In the end, though she left our forest,

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:32.833
the world is a great, big forest where
everyone's fightin' for their life.

00:13:32.833 --> 00:13:38.625
I reckon Sasha died 'cuz she
wandered in the forest too long.

00:13:38.625 --> 00:13:43.250
We've gotta keep the
younguns out of the forest.

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:49.292
Otherwise, ain't nothin' gonna
stop it from happenin' again.

00:13:49.292 --> 00:13:56.958
That's why it's up to us adults
to shoulder the sins of the past.

00:13:56.958 --> 00:14:00.583
Nicolo, let Ben go.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Good, Lisa. Slowly, now.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.542
Right.

00:14:12.542 --> 00:14:13.792
Are you hurt?

00:14:13.792 --> 00:14:18.125
Mia... You okay?

00:14:18.125 --> 00:14:20.333
Do you really...

00:14:21.292 --> 00:14:23.625
...not hate me?

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:34.167
--Kaya...
--How dare you kill her!

00:14:34.167 --> 00:14:36.000
--Kaya, stop!
--How dare you kill her!

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.833
You murderer! I thought you were a friend!

00:14:39.833 --> 00:14:42.667
Let's move you! C'mon!

00:14:56.708 --> 00:14:59.917
Now the food's gone cold.

00:15:01.583 --> 00:15:07.917
Hange, try to rinse out that kid's mouth.
Some wine got in it.

00:15:07.917 --> 00:15:09.208
Huh?

00:15:09.208 --> 00:15:13.167
Though... it's probably too late.

00:15:13.167 --> 00:15:16.875
What's in... the wine?

00:15:17.833 --> 00:15:21.958
I think... Zeke's spinal fluid.

00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:26.958
"Marleyan Cuisine: The famous red wine
of Southern Marley is often used
as a secret ingredient in their cuisine,
but is paired with meals as well."

00:15:30.833 --> 00:15:33.125
Zachary was killed?

00:15:33.125 --> 00:15:39.042
Yes. The Jaegerists effectively
control everything in the walls.

00:15:39.042 --> 00:15:46.750
We think it's all part of some plan Zeke
put together using Yelena and Eren.

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:47.958
And?

00:15:47.958 --> 00:15:54.542
Soon, the Jaegerists may bring Eren to
see Zeke like they've been demanding.

00:15:54.542 --> 00:15:57.792
And Pyxis? Is he letting this happen?

00:15:57.792 --> 00:16:03.250
As you know, the commander
can be quite stubborn.

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:09.417
He's gonna make sure Eren
gets eaten... by our own hands.

00:16:09.417 --> 00:16:11.417
That's right.

00:16:13.333 --> 00:16:19.542
I've saved Eren, over and over--
each time, more comrades dying.

00:16:19.542 --> 00:16:24.375
All because I believed
he was the hope of humanity.

00:16:24.375 --> 00:16:28.875
And look--this is where my beliefs got me.

00:16:28.875 --> 00:16:35.500
It's like some awful joke.
What the hell was the hope that we saw?

00:16:36.875 --> 00:16:40.792
All that struggle for a farce like this?

00:16:42.875 --> 00:16:46.292
Such bullshit. It's not even funny.

00:16:46.292 --> 00:16:50.000
There's another shithead
we should have eaten.

00:16:52.042 --> 00:16:56.542
What do you mean?!
Zeke's spinal fluid is in the wine?!

00:16:56.542 --> 00:17:00.167
I don't have proof, but...

00:17:00.167 --> 00:17:04.750
They packed the first scout fleet
to the brim with it--

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:08.625
well more than any scouting mission needed.

00:17:08.625 --> 00:17:10.708
--Again.
--And...

00:17:10.708 --> 00:17:15.750
...around the time I secured
my job here as a chef,

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:18.125
--I was told to serve it
to high-ranking officers.

00:17:18.125 --> 00:17:20.583
--One more time.
--I was told to serve it
to high-ranking officers.

00:17:20.583 --> 00:17:22.167
By who?!

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.125
Yelena.

00:17:26.125 --> 00:17:30.667
As far as I know, she's the only one in on it.

00:17:30.667 --> 00:17:33.792
Can't speak for the other volunteers.

00:17:33.792 --> 00:17:37.833
Th-This is the first time I've heard about it!

00:17:37.833 --> 00:17:43.667
It doesn't make sense! Don't Eldians
freeze up if they drink his spinal fluid?

00:17:43.667 --> 00:17:50.208
According to Zeke. Nobody witnessed it,
so there's no way to confirm it.

00:17:50.208 --> 00:17:56.500
But... the effectiveness of his
little lie has been enormous.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:02.500
Because nobody has frozen up,
no one is even aware they drank it.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:07.583
Yeah, but... You don't know for sure, right?

00:18:07.583 --> 00:18:10.000
Yeah, I can't prove it.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:18.042
But Marleyans know how Zeke's
spinal fluid has been used in the past.

00:18:18.042 --> 00:18:23.625
About ten years ago,
we conquered a capital in just one night.

00:18:23.625 --> 00:18:27.042
Hundreds of Titans sprung up in the city.

00:18:28.708 --> 00:18:31.667
Unless that's what she's plotting,

00:18:31.667 --> 00:18:38.375
I don't know why she wants it served
to your military's top officers.

00:18:38.375 --> 00:18:44.458
So earlier, you grabbed the wine
away 'cuz you were protecting us?

00:18:44.458 --> 00:18:49.792
Who knows? I don't know what I'm doing.

00:18:49.792 --> 00:18:53.958
I came here to save the world
from island devils.

00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:58.667
Now that I've opened my mouth,
I'm sure my days are numbered.

00:18:58.667 --> 00:19:00.708
But, Mr. Braus...

00:19:00.708 --> 00:19:06.958
I don't think I can be like you,
but if this can serve as atonement...

00:19:07.875 --> 00:19:12.917
Killing a child? What's wrong with me?

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:18.625
Nicolo...

00:19:21.875 --> 00:19:25.250
Why did you protect me?

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:29.042
Because. I don't have a reason.

00:19:29.042 --> 00:19:36.875
I'm the one who killed your comrade.
I'm the one who bludgeoned the guard.

00:19:36.875 --> 00:19:41.500
Falco didn't do it. Kill me, not him.

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:43.917
We won't kill you.

00:19:43.917 --> 00:19:46.792
But you want to, don't you?

00:19:46.792 --> 00:19:49.958
I don't want to kill you.

00:19:49.958 --> 00:19:54.000
Kill this, kill that...
It's all you think about.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.292
Just like someone I know.

00:19:59.208 --> 00:20:00.542
Er--

00:20:05.042 --> 00:20:06.292
What's wrong?

00:20:06.292 --> 00:20:07.750
Commander Hange.

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:09.583
Floch!

00:20:09.583 --> 00:20:11.667
I'm glad you're here.

00:20:11.667 --> 00:20:17.042
I imagine you know where Zeke's at.
We'll have you take us there.

00:20:17.042 --> 00:20:21.208
Wait. We have no intention of fighting you.

00:20:21.208 --> 00:20:27.292
We rejected your proposal.
We won't negotiate with the military.

00:20:27.292 --> 00:20:30.167
And why is that?

00:20:30.167 --> 00:20:32.042
It's Eren's decision.

00:20:32.042 --> 00:20:37.583
Pyxis would never leave the fate
of the island in our hands.

00:20:37.583 --> 00:20:40.292
I'm sure he's frantically devising a plan

00:20:40.292 --> 00:20:45.292
to take the Founder from Eren
while we're on the move.

00:20:45.292 --> 00:20:47.542
You're imagining things.

00:20:47.542 --> 00:20:53.208
Or is that what your comrades
in the Garrison Regiment said?

00:20:53.208 --> 00:20:57.792
Does it look like I'm one of your
lackeys that'll answer you?

00:20:57.792 --> 00:21:04.667
I suggest you get moving
before I prove to you that I'm not.

00:21:04.667 --> 00:21:08.625
Shit. How'd they know we were here?

00:21:08.625 --> 00:21:13.417
Greiz? Did Yelena put you up to this?

00:21:13.417 --> 00:21:20.917
Nicolo, you're too obsessed with Eldians.
I knew this day would eventually come.

00:21:20.917 --> 00:21:24.375
I was right not to tell you how to reach them.

00:21:24.375 --> 00:21:30.000
Floch, listen! We don't have time
to be fighting among ourselves!

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.583
Wine with Zeke's spinal fluid
was spread through the military!

00:21:34.583 --> 00:21:38.000
Zeke fooled us all with this plan of his!

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.250
So what? It'll just make
the idiot MPs into bigger idiots.

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:46.875
Can we go?

00:21:46.875 --> 00:21:50.083
I never said the MPs drank it!

00:21:50.083 --> 00:21:54.375
No way! You guys knew about the wine?!

00:21:58.208 --> 00:22:01.875
Use your inside voice, please.

00:22:07.125 --> 00:22:08.667
We're going ahead.

00:22:08.667 --> 00:22:09.792
Okay.

00:22:09.792 --> 00:22:14.667
That voice... Floch must've come.

00:22:14.667 --> 00:22:16.333
Yeah.

00:22:24.875 --> 00:22:29.458
I wanted... to talk with you guys.

00:24:03.333 --> 00:24:07.083
The Jaegerists capture Hange and the others.

00:24:07.083 --> 00:24:14.208
Staring intensely at Armin and Mikasa,
Eren says that he wants to talk.

00:24:14.208 --> 00:24:17.088
Next episode: "Savagery."
