WEBVTT

00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:51.958
"Soldier"

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.708
Stand back, rookies.

00:02:19.708 --> 00:02:21.208
Leave it to us.

00:02:22.458 --> 00:02:25.208
It's time to show off our ODM gear.

00:02:27.167 --> 00:02:28.250
Let's go!

00:02:37.875 --> 00:02:41.750
"2 hours earlier"

00:02:45.292 --> 00:02:47.542
Looks like someone was here recently.

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:50.000
That's odd for a place this near the wall.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.875
Some bandits probably used it as a base.

00:02:52.875 --> 00:02:56.542
It said "Ruins of Utgard Castle"
on one of the signs.

00:02:56.542 --> 00:02:59.708
Who would have thought
there was a castle around here?

00:03:01.125 --> 00:03:04.042
Hey, check it out. Look what I found.

00:03:04.042 --> 00:03:06.167
Gelgar... Is that booze I see?

00:03:06.167 --> 00:03:07.292
Yeah.

00:03:08.417 --> 00:03:10.083
What the heck does it say?

00:03:10.083 --> 00:03:13.042
You're not gonna drink it now, are you?

00:03:13.042 --> 00:03:14.500
Don't be stupid.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.875
Not at a time like this.

00:03:17.417 --> 00:03:22.125
Convenient... All this contraband
to enjoy for ourselves.

00:03:22.125 --> 00:03:26.000
Now you're making us sound like the bandits.

00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.792
You rookies should try to get some rest.

00:03:29.792 --> 00:03:35.542
Titans won't be roaming around at this hour,
but the rest of us will take turns keeping watch.

00:03:35.542 --> 00:03:39.042
We'll leave from here
four hours before daybreak.

00:03:39.042 --> 00:03:40.917
Um...

00:03:40.917 --> 00:03:44.625
What if the wall isn't
actually broken after all?

00:03:44.625 --> 00:03:49.208
The Titans... Where could they be invading from?

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.958
Finding the answer to that...
is our job for tomorrow.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.167
But what if--? Maybe it's not nearly
as bad as we thought from the start.

00:04:05.833 --> 00:04:08.958
I'm just saying, but...

00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:12.708
Yeah... There's barely any Titans around here.

00:04:12.708 --> 00:04:15.500
If the wall was really broken, that is.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.083
The only group we've really seen
was during the initial sighting.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.500
Conny? What about your village?

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.333
It was destroyed.

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:30.125
Crushed to sticks and rubble by Titans.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.667
I see... How awful...

00:04:33.667 --> 00:04:36.042
But nobody there was eaten.

00:04:36.042 --> 00:04:41.000
I think they all escaped,
so there's that to be thankful for.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.417
Wasn't the village destroyed?

00:04:43.417 --> 00:04:48.000
The houses and stuff were wrecked,
but the villagers made it out safely.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.167
If anyone was eaten, then...

00:04:51.167 --> 00:04:54.125
...there would've been blood and remains.

00:04:54.125 --> 00:04:58.458
But there wasn't any of that,
so it's the only explanation.

00:05:01.083 --> 00:05:05.167
Still... I can't stop thinking about it...

00:05:05.167 --> 00:05:08.292
There was that Titan at my house.

00:05:08.292 --> 00:05:14.375
It couldn't move on its own,
but it was lying right on top of my house.

00:05:14.375 --> 00:05:16.417
But it's weird...

00:05:16.417 --> 00:05:21.292
I don't know why, but it
reminded me of my mother...

00:05:21.292 --> 00:05:22.667
What does that--?

00:05:22.667 --> 00:05:26.125
Conny... You're still saying that? You--

00:05:26.125 --> 00:05:27.875
What an idiot!

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.083
You think your mother
might have been that Titan?!

00:05:32.083 --> 00:05:35.208
Then how come you're so damn short, huh?

00:05:35.208 --> 00:05:41.542
Come on, Conny! I knew you were pretty stupid,
but this is taking it to another level!

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.708
Would you just shut up?

00:05:45.708 --> 00:05:47.292
This is absurd.

00:05:47.292 --> 00:05:52.625
If this theory of yours is correct,
that means your father had to be a Titan, too.

00:05:52.625 --> 00:05:55.083
Otherwise, you know...

00:05:55.083 --> 00:05:55.917
They couldn't do it--

00:05:55.917 --> 00:05:59.125
Shut up! Go to sleep, you wench!

00:06:08.792 --> 00:06:11.333
Ymir? What are you doing?

00:06:11.333 --> 00:06:14.833
Prowling at night, Reiner? Come to see me?

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:19.917
I'm shocked. I was under the impression
that you had no interest in women.

00:06:19.917 --> 00:06:24.833
Yeah. And it doesn't seem like
you have interest in guys, either.

00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:30.583
I thought I'd use this time to scavenge
for something that might fill my stomach.

00:06:30.583 --> 00:06:33.833
This'll probably end up being my last meal.

00:06:35.667 --> 00:06:38.750
About Conny's village...

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.250
Were you joking around on purpose?

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.125
I'd appreciate if you did more of that.

00:06:45.125 --> 00:06:49.000
So that he doesn't keep
worrying about his family.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.458
What are you talking about?

00:06:51.458 --> 00:06:53.292
This might do the trick.

00:06:53.292 --> 00:06:55.958
Not that I like herring, but--

00:06:55.958 --> 00:06:57.417
Is there any more?

00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:58.833
Could I see it?

00:07:00.833 --> 00:07:02.167
Go for it.

00:07:03.625 --> 00:07:05.583
Canned food, huh?

00:07:07.833 --> 00:07:11.000
What... are these letters?

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.667
I can't read any of it.

00:07:13.667 --> 00:07:16.042
This says herring on it?

00:07:17.833 --> 00:07:22.750
You... are... able to read this language?

00:07:25.042 --> 00:07:26.417
Ymir...

00:07:26.417 --> 00:07:27.833
You're...

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.417
Everyone, wake up!

00:07:31.417 --> 00:07:34.000
Get to the tower! Quickly!

00:07:37.542 --> 00:07:39.458
Gotta be fricking kidding me.

00:07:39.458 --> 00:07:42.292
I'd be drinking right now if it wasn't for you!

00:07:42.292 --> 00:07:44.500
This is all your fault!

00:07:46.417 --> 00:07:47.625
Let's go!

00:07:52.583 --> 00:07:54.292
Get your damn hands away from me!

00:07:54.292 --> 00:07:56.292
You piece of shit!

00:08:08.458 --> 00:08:12.250
Look at that. Those little ones
got crushed by the fatty.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.500
Dumb-asses.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.208
That was way too reckless!

00:08:16.208 --> 00:08:19.917
Couldn't you have avoided that
without wasting your blades?

00:08:19.917 --> 00:08:21.917
That's just how I do things.

00:08:21.917 --> 00:08:24.500
You better chalk that one up as an assist.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.208
How heroic of you.

00:08:27.167 --> 00:08:28.708
I'll think about it.

00:08:36.208 --> 00:08:37.708
I'm too late...

00:08:39.208 --> 00:08:41.000
The door is bashed in!

00:08:42.417 --> 00:08:43.750
The Titans broke through.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:46.625
Go back down and form some sort of barricade.

00:08:46.625 --> 00:08:50.750
If you can't block them,
retreat back up here as a last resort.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:55.042
But that doesn't mean we'll
be able to help you though.

00:08:56.083 --> 00:09:00.250
I'm not sure if we'll still be
alive if it comes to that.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:02.792
We've all gotta do what we're trained to do.

00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:05.333
Give it all we've got till we die!

00:09:05.333 --> 00:09:06.500
Understand?

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.750
Got it!

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.125
I'll go see how far they've come through!

00:09:13.125 --> 00:09:15.375
You guys grab boards or rods or whatever!

00:09:15.375 --> 00:09:17.417
Bring everything you can carry!

00:09:17.417 --> 00:09:18.250
Reiner!

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:19.833
Hey!

00:09:19.833 --> 00:09:22.250
Wait up, Reiner! Hold on!

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:26.125
Who does he think he is,
always taking the most dangerous job?

00:09:26.125 --> 00:09:27.292
Come on, man!

00:09:27.292 --> 00:09:30.042
Yeah, that's a bad habit of his.

00:09:40.708 --> 00:09:42.417
They're still below.

00:09:44.875 --> 00:09:47.083
Well, it's still locked...

00:09:47.083 --> 00:09:51.833
But it's not like this old wooden door
will keep them out for long.

00:10:10.333 --> 00:10:12.125
They're here!

00:10:12.125 --> 00:10:14.667
Bring something, quick!

00:10:18.667 --> 00:10:20.708
Is this it?

00:10:20.708 --> 00:10:22.333
Will this be it?

00:10:23.333 --> 00:10:25.042
Is this the end?

00:10:39.125 --> 00:10:40.792
No...

00:10:40.792 --> 00:10:42.333
It can't be.

00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.750
I won't let it happen!

00:10:49.625 --> 00:10:51.417
I'm definitely going home!

00:10:52.375 --> 00:10:53.625
Reiner!

00:11:00.833 --> 00:11:02.625
Reiner! Are you okay?!

00:11:02.625 --> 00:11:03.792
Yeah!

00:11:03.792 --> 00:11:07.375
Bertholdt, we're gonna survive and go home.

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:09.833
We're going back to our hometown for sure.

00:11:09.833 --> 00:11:12.167
Right... Right!

00:11:12.167 --> 00:11:13.833
We're going home!

00:11:13.833 --> 00:11:16.708
Reiner! Bertholdt!

00:11:16.708 --> 00:11:17.875
Hey, that's...

00:11:17.875 --> 00:11:19.458
Have powder? A cannonball?

00:11:19.458 --> 00:11:22.667
Hell no! You'll just have to
take the whole thing!

00:11:22.667 --> 00:11:24.083
Out of the way!

00:11:41.958 --> 00:11:45.167
Looks like that worked out, miraculously.

00:11:45.167 --> 00:11:46.208
Yeah...

00:11:46.208 --> 00:11:48.125
It's not getting up from that.

00:11:48.125 --> 00:11:49.833
Not one of that size.

00:11:49.833 --> 00:11:52.625
What now? All we have is this knife.

00:11:52.625 --> 00:11:53.875
Should I cut off its nape?

00:11:53.875 --> 00:11:55.292
Don't even try.

00:11:55.292 --> 00:11:57.333
You'll get hurt if it grabs you.

00:11:57.333 --> 00:12:01.625
F-For now, let's retreat back upstairs.

00:12:01.625 --> 00:12:04.958
There could be more
than just one that got inside.

00:12:09.208 --> 00:12:10.333
Conny!

00:12:10.917 --> 00:12:15.917
"It is unknown when this ancient
castle turned ruins was built."

00:12:19.083 --> 00:12:20.208
Conny!

00:12:27.333 --> 00:12:28.458
Reiner!

00:12:42.417 --> 00:12:44.375
Uh, Reiner...

00:12:45.542 --> 00:12:46.833
Don't tell me...

00:12:47.875 --> 00:12:49.958
You're gonna jump out the window with it?!

00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:51.958
I've got no other choice!

00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:53.042
Wait!

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:57.917
If I can just slice open its jaw...

00:12:59.167 --> 00:13:00.292
You're free!

00:13:17.375 --> 00:13:20.125
What will we do if another comes through?

00:13:20.125 --> 00:13:23.292
We won't be lucky enough to kill a second one.

00:13:23.292 --> 00:13:26.000
Yeah, I'm with you there.

00:13:31.292 --> 00:13:34.000
Sorry... I'm sorry.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.875
I think it's broken.

00:13:35.875 --> 00:13:38.667
Yeah, just my luck.

00:13:38.667 --> 00:13:41.333
We'll need a splint and a bandage.

00:13:41.333 --> 00:13:42.667
I know.

00:13:49.125 --> 00:13:50.375
Sorry...

00:13:52.708 --> 00:13:55.458
All I've got is this dirty cloth.

00:13:55.458 --> 00:13:56.792
Sorry.

00:13:58.042 --> 00:14:00.875
No, it helps.

00:14:00.875 --> 00:14:02.458
Gotta marry her.

00:14:02.458 --> 00:14:04.500
Are you all right, Reiner?

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.000
Yeah, I guess.

00:14:07.958 --> 00:14:09.542
By the way, Christa.

00:14:09.542 --> 00:14:11.750
My hand got scraped up a bit, too...

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:14.708
Huh? Just spit on it or something.

00:14:15.792 --> 00:14:19.042
Sorry about that, Reiner.

00:14:19.042 --> 00:14:22.458
It seems like you're always saving my ass.

00:14:22.458 --> 00:14:26.583
Speaking of which, Annie risked
her life to save me, too.

00:14:26.583 --> 00:14:29.125
I've gotta pay you back sometime.

00:14:29.125 --> 00:14:31.458
Not really. It's...

00:14:32.542 --> 00:14:35.292
It's the normal thing to do.

00:14:35.292 --> 00:14:37.625
Because we're soldiers.

00:14:37.625 --> 00:14:39.208
I'm not so sure about that.

00:14:39.208 --> 00:14:42.000
I doubt I could ever be that brave.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.583
Hey, Bertholdt.

00:14:43.583 --> 00:14:46.708
Has Reiner always been like this?

00:14:46.708 --> 00:14:52.833
No... In the past, Reiner was more of a warrior.

00:14:52.833 --> 00:14:55.542
Unlike now.

00:14:55.542 --> 00:14:57.042
What's that mean?

00:14:57.042 --> 00:14:59.333
What do you mean by warrior?

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:04.250
For now, let's try to gather
anything useful we can find.

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:08.083
That way when we die,
we can do so without regrets.

00:15:09.417 --> 00:15:11.625
That's the Scouts for you...

00:15:11.625 --> 00:15:15.167
They're on a different level
from the other soldiers.

00:15:24.083 --> 00:15:26.625
That's mostly it for the big ones.

00:15:26.625 --> 00:15:28.333
It's a good thing we have this tower.

00:15:28.333 --> 00:15:31.667
Yeah, we might actually survive.

00:15:31.667 --> 00:15:33.417
We'll go check on the recruits!

00:15:33.417 --> 00:15:34.417
Okay.

00:15:37.167 --> 00:15:38.458
What's that sound?

00:15:43.875 --> 00:15:45.583
The horses!

00:15:45.583 --> 00:15:46.750
Huh?

00:15:47.875 --> 00:15:48.833
Again?!

00:15:48.833 --> 00:15:50.750
What the hell is that sound?!

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:58.375
Lynne! Henning!

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:05.375
What was that?!

00:16:06.458 --> 00:16:07.667
It's no use.

00:16:07.667 --> 00:16:09.458
They both died instantly.

00:16:11.083 --> 00:16:13.583
This can't be...

00:16:13.583 --> 00:16:17.333
It's him! The one that
walked off towards the wall!

00:16:17.333 --> 00:16:19.708
That Beast Titan did this!

00:16:20.875 --> 00:16:24.250
A group of Titans approaching!
More than twice the number from earlier!

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:25.708
What'd you say?!

00:16:25.708 --> 00:16:29.750
Their timing is too perfect,
like it's part of some strategy.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:33.708
I get the feeling they've been
toying with us from the start.

00:17:01.833 --> 00:17:04.667
This is bad! My gas is all but gone!

00:17:10.792 --> 00:17:12.000
Did I get 'em?

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:23.750
This tower won't hold much longer.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:26.125
I only have a small amount of gas left.

00:17:26.125 --> 00:17:27.458
What about you?

00:17:27.458 --> 00:17:31.250
No gas here, and I used up all of my blades.

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:34.833
Those blunt ones the last you have left?

00:17:34.833 --> 00:17:36.167
Yeah...

00:17:36.167 --> 00:17:39.208
How many did the four of us kill?

00:17:39.208 --> 00:17:43.250
I don't know. I didn't have the luxury to count.

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:47.792
You know what? I think I did
a pretty good job myself.

00:17:47.792 --> 00:17:50.542
But the thing is...

00:17:50.542 --> 00:17:54.125
I wish I could have a drink before I go.

00:17:54.125 --> 00:17:55.333
Gelgar...

00:17:57.083 --> 00:17:59.542
Sorry, Nanaba.

00:17:59.542 --> 00:18:01.667
I must've hit my head...

00:18:01.667 --> 00:18:04.125
I can't hold...

00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:05.833
...any longer.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.417
Gelgar!

00:18:20.792 --> 00:18:22.000
Gelgar!

00:18:23.125 --> 00:18:26.000
Damn it! Is that all I've got?

00:18:42.042 --> 00:18:43.792
Thank God...

00:19:02.708 --> 00:19:05.583
H-How cruel.

00:19:05.583 --> 00:19:08.333
This just isn't fair.

00:19:08.333 --> 00:19:12.083
Who the hell drank the rest of this bottle?!

00:19:17.917 --> 00:19:19.417
They got him.

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:22.667
Quit it, Christa!

00:19:22.667 --> 00:19:25.667
The tower's about to crumble! You'll fall!

00:19:25.667 --> 00:19:28.750
But they're dying in our place!

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:29.333
--Nanaba...

00:19:29.333 --> 00:19:30.167
--No! No!
--Nanaba...

00:19:30.167 --> 00:19:31.125
--No! No!
--And Gelgar...

00:19:31.125 --> 00:19:32.750
Father, stop!

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:33.958
Father!

00:19:33.958 --> 00:19:36.708
I'm sorry! I won't do it again!

00:19:36.708 --> 00:19:39.708
Father! No!

00:19:39.708 --> 00:19:41.917
Damn it all to hell!

00:19:41.917 --> 00:19:48.167
Hey... Do we gotta wait here now until
the tower falls and we get eaten alive?

00:19:48.167 --> 00:19:51.917
Is there nothing we can do about it?!

00:19:51.917 --> 00:19:53.333
This sucks...

00:19:53.333 --> 00:19:56.958
We'll be wiped out without
even finishing our mission.

00:19:59.542 --> 00:20:02.458
I... want to keep fighting, too.

00:20:02.458 --> 00:20:04.917
If only I had some sort of weapon,

00:20:04.917 --> 00:20:07.625
then I could fight and die alongside them.

00:20:07.625 --> 00:20:12.042
Christa... You're still saying things like that?

00:20:12.042 --> 00:20:14.208
Don't you dare use their deaths.

00:20:14.208 --> 00:20:19.750
They didn't die so you'd have
an excuse to get yourself killed.

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:22.625
That's not... That's not what I...

00:20:22.625 --> 00:20:26.042
You're not like Conny and the Scouts!

00:20:26.042 --> 00:20:29.167
They don't want to die, but you don't even care.

00:20:29.167 --> 00:20:33.708
All you want to do is die in a way
that makes you seem like a hero.

00:20:33.708 --> 00:20:35.875
Th-That's not...

00:20:35.875 --> 00:20:37.333
Conny.

00:20:37.333 --> 00:20:39.417
Give me that knife you had.

00:20:39.417 --> 00:20:41.333
Huh? My knife?

00:20:41.333 --> 00:20:42.708
Just hand it over.

00:20:42.708 --> 00:20:45.417
Fine. Here.

00:20:48.083 --> 00:20:49.458
Thanks.

00:20:49.458 --> 00:20:51.708
What do you want it for?

00:20:51.708 --> 00:20:52.750
Hmm?

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:55.125
Well, you see...

00:20:56.458 --> 00:20:59.292
I'm going to fight with this.

00:20:59.292 --> 00:21:01.708
Ymir... What are you planning?

00:21:01.708 --> 00:21:05.167
Who knows? I don't even know myself.

00:21:06.167 --> 00:21:07.625
Ymir...

00:21:08.792 --> 00:21:10.750
Christa.

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:14.750
You've probably forgotten all about it by now...

00:21:19.208 --> 00:21:22.333
But this might be the end, so...

00:21:22.333 --> 00:21:27.417
Try to remember... that promise we made
training on that snowy mountain.

00:21:29.708 --> 00:21:33.833
I have no right to tell you
how to live your life.

00:21:35.042 --> 00:21:39.625
So actually, this is nothing more
than a hope of mine...

00:21:41.167 --> 00:21:44.792
I want you... to live a life you're proud of.

00:21:56.083 --> 00:21:58.458
Remember our promise, Christa.

00:22:00.125 --> 00:22:02.292
Ymir! Wait!

00:22:06.208 --> 00:22:07.833
Ymir!

00:23:58.458 --> 00:24:01.333
"Live a life you're proud of."

00:24:01.333 --> 00:24:06.958
Leaving Christa and those words behind,
Ymir unleashes the power of the Titans.

00:24:06.958 --> 00:24:12.917
Between Ymir and Christa is a
powerful promise they made in the past.

00:24:13.875 --> 00:24:16.625
As Ymir battles and puts her life on the line,

00:24:16.625 --> 00:24:22.625
Christa screams out, casting aside
the persona she's kept for so long.

00:24:22.625 --> 00:24:27.094
Next episode: "Historia."
