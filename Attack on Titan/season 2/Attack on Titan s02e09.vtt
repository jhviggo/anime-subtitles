WEBVTT

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:26.625
Let's move!

00:00:38.792 --> 00:00:40.417
Hange?

00:00:40.417 --> 00:00:43.000
G-Get me a horse.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.208
Section Commander! Where are you trying to go?

00:00:46.208 --> 00:00:50.000
To that village where we captured
the Titan who couldn't walk.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.500
You mean Ragako?

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.958
I need to see it... with my own eyes.

00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:56.167
Don't say something so ridiculous!

00:00:56.167 --> 00:00:59.667
Your body can't take riding a horse right now!

00:01:01.292 --> 00:01:05.542
I have a hunch... that we need to investigate...

00:01:08.292 --> 00:01:09.708
All right.

00:01:11.125 --> 00:01:15.250
I'll go there on my own,
so you just stay here and faint or something.

00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:24.750
Spread out! Take formation to locate any enemies!

00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:36.042
Eren...

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
"Opening"

00:03:15.583 --> 00:03:17.958
Oh, Eren?

00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.583
You're awake?

00:03:38.917 --> 00:03:40.542
What the hell?!

00:03:40.542 --> 00:03:42.833
My arms!

00:03:42.833 --> 00:03:44.375
Eren.

00:03:44.375 --> 00:03:47.875
Look at me. I'm in the same shape as you.

00:03:47.875 --> 00:03:50.625
Guess the both of us are having a bad day.

00:03:50.625 --> 00:03:52.667
Ymir...

00:03:52.667 --> 00:03:55.625
Why... don't I have any arms?

00:03:55.625 --> 00:03:57.250
That's my bad.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.250
I'm the one who did that.

00:04:00.875 --> 00:04:03.458
I kinda was in a hurry.

00:04:03.458 --> 00:04:09.083
When I rushed to bite your nape,
I neglected to take your arms into account.

00:04:11.667 --> 00:04:13.708
I see...

00:04:13.708 --> 00:04:17.167
I... must've lost.

00:04:26.875 --> 00:04:28.708
Eren, stop!

00:04:28.708 --> 00:04:31.125
Hold your horses, Eren.

00:04:31.125 --> 00:04:33.625
Take a good look around us.

00:04:33.625 --> 00:04:37.167
We're in the giant forest within Wall Maria.

00:04:37.167 --> 00:04:40.750
It's not even close to any of the walls.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.667
In other words, we're deep in Titan territory.

00:04:44.667 --> 00:04:46.500
Take a look.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.000
I think that one down there's an Abnormal.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.917
It looks like he's just lounging around,
but he's not taking his eyes off us.

00:04:55.917 --> 00:04:58.083
There's a lot of small ones down there, too.

00:04:58.083 --> 00:05:00.458
That alone is dangerous.

00:05:00.458 --> 00:05:03.375
Over that way's another big one.

00:05:03.375 --> 00:05:06.292
He staring at us, but won't come any closer.

00:05:06.292 --> 00:05:09.917
I bet you that one's a scaredy-cat.

00:05:09.917 --> 00:05:12.333
And then you've got these chumps.

00:05:12.333 --> 00:05:14.208
Those dirty bastards.

00:05:14.208 --> 00:05:17.750
They're the only ones with any ODM gear on.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.625
Reiner's wearing gear he took from you.

00:05:20.625 --> 00:05:25.083
So I don't think changing into a Titan
at this point is going to solve anything.

00:05:25.083 --> 00:05:30.458
Not only can they do that, but they can
escape high into the trees as well.

00:05:30.458 --> 00:05:33.917
Those two aside, there's Titans all around us.

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:39.625
Escaping out of this Titan territory
would be tough, even with Titan powers.

00:05:40.625 --> 00:05:42.208
Understand?

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:45.375
There's nothing to gain by acting up.

00:05:45.375 --> 00:05:47.125
No.

00:05:47.125 --> 00:05:49.917
You two can't even turn into Titans right now.

00:05:49.917 --> 00:05:53.458
So don't count on that to help you.

00:05:53.458 --> 00:05:55.417
Your body is at its limit.

00:05:55.417 --> 00:05:59.500
It's taking everything you've got
to repair the damage.

00:06:00.875 --> 00:06:02.167
Are you stupid?

00:06:02.167 --> 00:06:05.750
Why the hell would I trust anything
coming out of your mouth?

00:06:09.458 --> 00:06:10.542
Well...

00:06:10.542 --> 00:06:15.708
It's not like I know the specifics
behind how Titan powers work.

00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:20.125
Unlike you guys, I'm pretty clueless about it.

00:06:20.125 --> 00:06:22.375
Hey, Reiner.

00:06:22.375 --> 00:06:25.875
You said you would talk once Eren woke up.

00:06:25.875 --> 00:06:30.083
It's about time one of you says
what you plan to do with us.

00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:35.458
We'll take you to our hometown.

00:06:35.458 --> 00:06:39.708
I realize that you're not
going to listen and do as I say.

00:06:39.708 --> 00:06:44.042
But like Ymir was saying,
this place is swarming with Titans.

00:06:44.042 --> 00:06:46.708
We could beat the shit out of each other right now,

00:06:46.708 --> 00:06:50.750
but when we're weak, the other Titans
would just come and eat us.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:56.750
So until nightfall, when the Titans can't move,
we have no choice but to wait here.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.583
Whether you try to run and escape from us...

00:06:59.583 --> 00:07:02.875
...or don't and we take you away...

00:07:02.875 --> 00:07:06.125
...either way, we wait for night.

00:07:06.125 --> 00:07:09.708
Why didn't you stay
the Armored Titan and run home?

00:07:09.708 --> 00:07:12.583
What's the point of stopping here?

00:07:12.583 --> 00:07:15.750
Too tired and had to take a break?

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.625
Why don't you use your imagination?

00:07:22.083 --> 00:07:24.042
Let's think...

00:07:24.042 --> 00:07:26.708
If I waited for an opening and became a Titan,

00:07:26.708 --> 00:07:31.875
running away from here doesn't seem
like it would pose a challenge.

00:07:31.875 --> 00:07:36.458
But will I be able to transform
into a Titan in the first place?

00:07:37.833 --> 00:07:40.167
Reiner said that I can't...

00:07:40.167 --> 00:07:45.292
And I have to consider that even Reiner
had to stop here to take a break.

00:07:45.292 --> 00:07:51.208
If my Titan form isn't strong enough,
does that mean I'll just get eaten by the others?

00:07:53.833 --> 00:07:56.875
Are you simply waiting here for it to become night?

00:07:56.875 --> 00:07:58.833
Maybe I am.

00:07:58.833 --> 00:08:02.667
No... There's no way they'd wait until nightfall.

00:08:02.667 --> 00:08:07.417
They're not going to give our bodies
the chance to fully recover.

00:08:07.417 --> 00:08:10.875
They'll make their move
while we're still powerless.

00:08:12.583 --> 00:08:15.042
At this rate, I can't do anything.

00:08:15.042 --> 00:08:16.875
At this rate...

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:22.208
What happened to everybody?

00:08:22.208 --> 00:08:23.958
Where are the Scouts?

00:08:27.833 --> 00:08:30.333
Don't tell me they're coming this way...

00:08:30.333 --> 00:08:33.292
If they try to help,
no one's gonna make it back safely.

00:08:33.292 --> 00:08:38.125
What's it matter? Those Titans at the castle
moved just fine at night.

00:08:38.125 --> 00:08:40.250
Won't these Titans, too?

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:43.083
The Titans here can't move at night.

00:08:43.083 --> 00:08:46.917
You should know all about it, Ymir.

00:08:49.583 --> 00:08:53.250
Speaking of which,
why can Ymir turn into a Titan?

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:57.125
I don't think she's like me,
who knew nothing about it.

00:08:57.125 --> 00:08:59.125
Is she on our side?

00:08:59.125 --> 00:09:01.917
I don't even know what her goal is yet.

00:09:01.917 --> 00:09:05.125
She's hard enough to understand as it is.

00:09:07.167 --> 00:09:09.208
I've made up my mind.

00:09:09.208 --> 00:09:13.167
Right now, what I need is information.

00:09:13.167 --> 00:09:16.792
I need to figure out
everything I can from these guys.

00:09:16.792 --> 00:09:20.333
And then I'll make my escape.

00:09:20.333 --> 00:09:22.625
To do that, I need...

00:09:24.292 --> 00:09:27.375
...to suppress all my emotions...

00:09:27.375 --> 00:09:30.000
...and for my body to heal.

00:09:30.917 --> 00:09:35.917
"Those with the power to become Titans
possess an inherent ability to regenerate."

00:09:40.208 --> 00:09:44.208
Titan spotted at three 'o clock! Fire the smoke!

00:09:44.208 --> 00:09:46.875
Smoke shell confirmed on the right wing!

00:09:46.875 --> 00:09:48.333
Do not change direction!

00:09:48.333 --> 00:09:51.833
Have the right wing merge
with the center and hold course!

00:09:51.833 --> 00:09:53.958
We only have until sunset!

00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:57.083
We must take the shortest possible path!

00:09:59.583 --> 00:10:01.333
Mikasa.

00:10:01.333 --> 00:10:03.042
Hey, Mikasa!

00:10:03.042 --> 00:10:05.167
Mikasa!

00:10:05.167 --> 00:10:07.083
Stop pushing so hard.

00:10:07.083 --> 00:10:09.333
You're drifting near the vanguard.

00:10:09.333 --> 00:10:12.167
It'll ruin the whole formation.

00:10:12.167 --> 00:10:15.250
I know how you feel, but... didn't I tell you?

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:19.208
Eren won't get taken away
without putting up a fight.

00:10:19.208 --> 00:10:20.667
Don't you agree?

00:10:22.708 --> 00:10:25.042
You know he'll never give up.

00:10:25.042 --> 00:10:29.750
So it's up to us to stay calm
and be there when he needs us.

00:10:33.292 --> 00:10:35.583
Just like we did back then.

00:10:58.583 --> 00:11:00.000
Reiner.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.833
You got any water?

00:11:01.833 --> 00:11:05.417
If I don't get some soon,
I'm going to dry up and die.

00:11:05.417 --> 00:11:11.625
Even if it's a matter of life and death,
there's nothing we can do given our situation.

00:11:11.625 --> 00:11:16.958
He's completely right...
This situation couldn't be any shittier.

00:11:18.833 --> 00:11:20.542
Speaking of which...

00:11:20.542 --> 00:11:26.500
Ever since the Titans showed up yesterday morning,
we've been working our asses off.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:30.500
With nothing to eat or drink
and not even a wink of sleep.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:34.583
Fortunately, the wall wasn't broken or anything.

00:11:34.583 --> 00:11:37.667
So I think we deserve to take a break for once.

00:11:37.667 --> 00:11:41.417
We'll see about getting promoted later.

00:11:41.417 --> 00:11:42.917
Reiner...

00:11:44.083 --> 00:11:48.875
What? We've done plenty enough to deserve it.

00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:53.792
I think we've performed outstandingly,
considering all we've been put through.

00:11:53.792 --> 00:11:58.042
I know soldiers like us are expected
to fulfill their duties, but...

00:11:58.042 --> 00:12:00.667
I think we've all earned it.

00:12:06.792 --> 00:12:09.042
Reiner...

00:12:09.042 --> 00:12:11.708
What in the world are you talking about?

00:12:11.708 --> 00:12:13.708
Huh? What do you mean?

00:12:13.708 --> 00:12:17.375
I'm not saying we go demand to be
promoted to captains or anything.

00:12:17.375 --> 00:12:20.000
That's... not what I mean.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.333
Oh, yeah. Where did you all get that cannon from?

00:12:24.333 --> 00:12:27.417
That really saved my ass.

00:12:28.625 --> 00:12:31.708
It's a good thing Christa helped me after that.

00:12:31.708 --> 00:12:34.625
To be honest, I think she has a thing for me.

00:12:34.625 --> 00:12:35.667
Hey...

00:12:35.667 --> 00:12:38.875
Now that I think about it,
Christa has always treated me especially--

00:12:38.875 --> 00:12:40.125
Hey!

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.917
You bastard... You've gotta be kidding me.

00:12:49.917 --> 00:12:51.208
Huh?

00:12:51.208 --> 00:12:53.333
What are you so angry about, Eren?

00:12:53.333 --> 00:12:56.042
Did I... say something wrong?

00:12:56.042 --> 00:12:59.167
If you want to die, just keep talking!

00:12:59.167 --> 00:13:01.083
Hold up, Eren.

00:13:01.083 --> 00:13:03.958
This isn't normal, no matter how you look at it.

00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:06.500
Isn't that right, Bertholdt?

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:12.625
If you know something,
quit with the silence and come out and say it.

00:13:12.625 --> 00:13:13.792
Huh?

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.000
Reiner...

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.208
You're not... a soldier, remember?

00:13:23.208 --> 00:13:25.083
You and I...

00:13:25.083 --> 00:13:27.125
...we're warriors.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.750
Reiner!

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:40.333
What are you doing?!

00:13:45.542 --> 00:13:47.208
Hey...

00:13:47.208 --> 00:13:48.542
Why...

00:13:51.167 --> 00:13:53.708
...is Marco...

00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:55.583
...getting eaten?

00:14:03.583 --> 00:14:05.167
Right.

00:14:05.167 --> 00:14:08.375
That's... how it is.

00:14:13.833 --> 00:14:15.583
Huh?

00:14:17.208 --> 00:14:19.208
What's he doing?

00:14:20.333 --> 00:14:24.708
More or less, I think I've figured it out.

00:14:24.708 --> 00:14:26.750
I thought it was strange.

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:31.583
Why would the guy who broke the wall
risk his life to save Conny?

00:14:31.583 --> 00:14:36.042
Everything he does is contradictory,
but he doesn't realize it himself.

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:40.625
I don't know why he
ended up like this, but probably...

00:14:40.625 --> 00:14:44.542
He was originally a warrior
whose goal was to break the wall, but...

00:14:44.542 --> 00:14:47.250
...after pretending to be a soldier for so long,

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:51.542
he lost sight of who he was
and couldn't tell which one was real.

00:14:51.542 --> 00:14:52.917
No...

00:14:52.917 --> 00:14:58.125
Unable to bear the weight of his sins, he convinced
himself he was a soldier protecting the wall

00:14:58.125 --> 00:15:02.333
to maintain emotional balance
within his own heart.

00:15:02.333 --> 00:15:05.625
And in the end, he believed it.

00:15:05.625 --> 00:15:10.083
As a result, his heart was split
and his memories broken.

00:15:10.083 --> 00:15:14.208
This must not be the first time
Reiner's talked and made no sense...

00:15:14.208 --> 00:15:17.250
...judging by Bertholdt's grim expression.

00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:20.167
It's amazing, really.

00:15:20.167 --> 00:15:22.583
For someone excessively honest like you to--

00:15:22.583 --> 00:15:23.875
Enough!

00:15:25.208 --> 00:15:27.375
Shut your mouth.

00:15:30.667 --> 00:15:32.250
Sorry about that.

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:34.375
I might've pried too much.

00:15:38.208 --> 00:15:40.750
You've gotta be kidding me.

00:15:41.792 --> 00:15:44.875
Why are you pretending to be the victim here?

00:15:44.875 --> 00:15:47.917
What's your deal?

00:15:47.917 --> 00:15:53.125
That day, what the hell were
you thinking when you talked to us?

00:15:54.333 --> 00:15:56.708
Tell me, Bertholdt.

00:15:56.708 --> 00:16:00.000
I'm talking to you, you damn lackey.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.167
I told you everything...
while you looked at me right in the eyes.

00:16:04.167 --> 00:16:07.167
About the day my mother was eaten alive...

00:16:07.167 --> 00:16:10.833
Stop!

00:16:10.833 --> 00:16:12.542
Isn't that right?

00:16:12.542 --> 00:16:16.750
Thanks to the piece of wall you kicked
that went flying straight into my house,

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:20.333
my mother couldn't escape or run away.

00:16:20.333 --> 00:16:24.208
You remember, right? I told you my story.

00:16:25.208 --> 00:16:27.833
What were you thinking?

00:16:27.833 --> 00:16:31.000
What were you thinking when I told you?

00:16:35.208 --> 00:16:37.125
Back then...

00:16:38.792 --> 00:16:42.500
...I thought... I felt sorry for you.

00:16:47.125 --> 00:16:48.750
Oh...

00:16:49.792 --> 00:16:52.625
I see...

00:16:52.625 --> 00:16:54.792
You guys...

00:16:54.792 --> 00:16:56.333
You guys...

00:16:56.333 --> 00:16:59.917
...are neither soldiers nor warriors.

00:16:59.917 --> 00:17:02.583
You're just murderers.

00:17:02.583 --> 00:17:03.917
You're psychotic mass-murderers

00:17:03.917 --> 00:17:07.625
who've killed countless innocent people
who never did anything wrong!

00:17:07.625 --> 00:17:09.583
You don't think I know that?!

00:17:09.583 --> 00:17:11.958
I don't need you to point that out to me!

00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:15.583
Then don't pretend to have emotions
like you're one of us!

00:17:15.583 --> 00:17:18.000
You guys aren't even human anymore!

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.250
It's you two who've turned
this world into a living hell!

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:22.792
Does that make you happy, murderers?!

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:26.792
What are you after by calling us murderers?!

00:17:26.792 --> 00:17:28.250
Do you want us to regret it?

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:29.792
Do you want us to apologize?!

00:17:29.792 --> 00:17:31.708
Would that give you satisfaction?

00:17:31.708 --> 00:17:34.375
The people you thought we were no longer exist!

00:17:34.375 --> 00:17:39.125
If screaming will make you feel better,
then scream your damn head off!

00:17:52.375 --> 00:17:54.125
That's right...

00:17:55.417 --> 00:17:57.792
I'm still...

00:17:57.792 --> 00:17:59.667
...too naïve.

00:18:01.125 --> 00:18:03.000
I've...

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.458
...gotta do what I can.

00:18:05.458 --> 00:18:07.958
Do what I can...

00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:09.417
...to make you guys...

00:18:09.417 --> 00:18:12.875
...suffer and die in the worst way possible.

00:18:12.875 --> 00:18:14.875
You've got it coming.

00:18:22.708 --> 00:18:25.417
You can't be serious.

00:18:25.417 --> 00:18:26.875
Huh?

00:18:26.875 --> 00:18:28.667
Quit it, Eren.

00:18:28.667 --> 00:18:32.917
If you keep saying childish crap like that,
I've got no hope for you.

00:18:32.917 --> 00:18:34.333
Huh?!

00:18:37.792 --> 00:18:39.667
Hey, Reiner.

00:18:41.917 --> 00:18:44.125
What's the deal with that monkey?

00:18:47.417 --> 00:18:49.917
Monkey? What do you mean?

00:18:49.917 --> 00:18:53.083
Hmm? You don't know?

00:18:53.083 --> 00:19:00.250
That's surprising, given how much you two stared
at it with stars in your eyes like two little brats.

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:02.458
That monkey...

00:19:02.458 --> 00:19:05.625
What's that? A monkey?

00:19:05.625 --> 00:19:07.625
Just listen.

00:19:07.625 --> 00:19:13.000
That monkey Beast Titan
is what caused this recent fiasco.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.625
It made Titans rise up from within the wall.

00:19:16.625 --> 00:19:20.917
I wonder if he was trying to assess our strength.

00:19:20.917 --> 00:19:24.375
That's where these guys are trying to get.

00:19:24.375 --> 00:19:30.167
If you guys get to him,
you'll be able to go back home, right?

00:19:30.167 --> 00:19:32.708
You... knew this?

00:19:32.708 --> 00:19:35.375
What do you know?! Tell me everything!

00:19:35.375 --> 00:19:38.625
Just wait. I've got circumstances of my own.

00:19:38.625 --> 00:19:41.667
What the hell do you mean by that?!

00:19:41.667 --> 00:19:45.833
Eren... if you think killing these two
will bring an end to everything...

00:19:45.833 --> 00:19:47.583
...you're gravely mistaken.

00:19:47.583 --> 00:19:48.833
Huh?!

00:19:48.833 --> 00:19:50.708
Then who's the enemy?!

00:19:50.708 --> 00:19:52.292
Enemy?

00:19:52.292 --> 00:19:53.583
If I said that, the--

00:19:53.583 --> 00:19:55.042
Ymir!

00:19:55.042 --> 00:19:59.208
Do you think there's any future for this world?

00:19:59.208 --> 00:20:03.000
If you know so much,
think about what you want to do.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.125
It's not out of the question
for you to join our side.

00:20:07.125 --> 00:20:09.125
And trust you?

00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:12.833
Yeah, right. You two don't even trust me.

00:20:12.833 --> 00:20:15.625
Wrong. We can trust you.

00:20:15.625 --> 00:20:18.417
Because your one goal...

00:20:18.417 --> 00:20:20.833
...is to protect Christa.

00:20:22.875 --> 00:20:27.000
When it comes to her,
we should be able to trust one another.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.833
You might think that I'm joking, but...

00:20:29.833 --> 00:20:36.042
Is it that hard for you to believe that
we might want the best for Christa as well?

00:20:36.042 --> 00:20:41.125
Or... would you rather put your hopes
in Eren and rely on him over us?

00:20:41.125 --> 00:20:42.708
Huh?!

00:20:45.667 --> 00:20:51.583
You're probably thinking your best chance
is to use Eren to escape from here.

00:20:51.583 --> 00:20:56.875
Because if you're taken by us,
there's little chance for your rescue.

00:20:56.875 --> 00:20:59.750
To be honest, that's pretty much true.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:04.583
Even if you come with us,
we can't guarantee your safety.

00:21:04.583 --> 00:21:09.125
But if it's Christa we're talking about,
we might be able to do something for her.

00:21:11.917 --> 00:21:17.125
Will it be your petty life...
or Christa's future?

00:21:17.125 --> 00:21:19.333
It's up to you to decide.

00:21:20.333 --> 00:21:22.917
There's no future for this world?

00:21:22.917 --> 00:21:25.750
Why's that? What's this about a monkey?

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:28.458
What's going on?

00:21:28.458 --> 00:21:30.417
Hey!

00:21:30.417 --> 00:21:33.750
Hey, say something! Who's the enemy?!

00:21:35.083 --> 00:21:36.583
Ymir!

00:21:43.792 --> 00:21:46.083
Who knows...

00:21:46.083 --> 00:21:47.458
It's settled then.

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.542
Too bad, Eren.

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:04.000
The Scouts... are already...

00:22:05.875 --> 00:22:08.125
Dammit!

00:22:08.125 --> 00:22:09.500
Shit!

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:12.125
Damn you, Ymir.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:18.208
There's just one hour left until sunset.

00:23:58.625 --> 00:24:01.208
As sunset swiftly approaches...

00:24:01.208 --> 00:24:07.417
...the Scout Regiment closes in, intent on
rescuing Eren from Reiner and Bertholdt.

00:24:07.417 --> 00:24:13.167
The pair plot to make their escape,
fleeing by use of ODM gear.

00:24:13.167 --> 00:24:21.208
However, reflecting on her past and emotions,
Ymir offers a plan of her own.

00:24:22.208 --> 00:24:27.072
Next episode: "Children."
