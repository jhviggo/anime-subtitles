00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:51.958
"Historia"

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.167
Come on! The goal is right here!

00:02:09.167 --> 00:02:10.667
Keep it up!

00:02:10.667 --> 00:02:12.333
Nine hours and twelve minutes.

00:02:12.333 --> 00:02:15.583
Not a bad time, considering the weather.

00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.625
Thought we were gonna die out there.

00:02:19.625 --> 00:02:23.333
No one ever said winter training
would be this tough.

00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:25.667
Damn it, I can't feel my legs.

00:02:25.667 --> 00:02:28.500
I wish they'd let us inside already.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.458
I bet they're busy putting together
a huge feast for us! Yum...

00:02:32.458 --> 00:02:33.583
Hey!

00:02:34.667 --> 00:02:35.917
Christa is missing.

00:02:35.917 --> 00:02:36.958
Huh?

00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:41.125
She was sticking with Daz
since he wasn't doing so well.

00:02:41.125 --> 00:02:43.333
Daz isn't here either.

00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:45.042
Ymir as well.

00:02:45.042 --> 00:02:47.458
Maybe they're with the last squad?

00:02:47.458 --> 00:02:51.125
Can't be. The last squad,
led by Thomas, just arrived.

00:02:51.125 --> 00:02:52.917
They never saw those three.

00:02:52.917 --> 00:02:54.125
Huh?

00:02:57.375 --> 00:03:00.208
You don't think... they got lost?

00:03:00.208 --> 00:03:01.333
Hey...

00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:04.125
They don't stand a chance
if they're stuck in this blizzard.

00:03:04.125 --> 00:03:05.542
Shit!

00:03:06.542 --> 00:03:07.833
Eren!

00:03:07.833 --> 00:03:10.250
I'm going back out to try and find them!

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.417
Me, too.

00:03:11.417 --> 00:03:13.583
Everyone, get in the cabin.

00:03:13.583 --> 00:03:14.625
But... Christa and--

00:03:14.625 --> 00:03:18.167
Yeah. We'll send a rescue team
first thing in the morning.

00:03:18.167 --> 00:03:20.000
It'll be too late by then!

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.042
We won't make any more victims!

00:03:30.917 --> 00:03:32.375
Shit.

00:03:46.625 --> 00:03:48.042
Christa.

00:03:49.625 --> 00:03:52.292
Christa, give it up.

00:03:54.125 --> 00:03:55.250
Listen to me.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.667
Never.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.792
Daz already has one foot in the grave.

00:04:01.792 --> 00:04:04.458
It's his own fault for doing
this training to boost his score

00:04:04.458 --> 00:04:08.958
without knowing how much his body can take.

00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:12.875
He's just not cut out to be a soldier.

00:04:12.875 --> 00:04:16.500
If you keep crawling to the foot
of the mountain at this rate,

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.125
he'll probably be a goner by then,
and we'd be lucky not to be.

00:04:21.125 --> 00:04:24.167
Which means there's only two outcomes.

00:04:24.167 --> 00:04:29.792
Leave Daz here and save ourselves,
or all three of us die.

00:04:29.792 --> 00:04:31.583
Which will it be?

00:04:32.875 --> 00:04:34.917
You forgot one.

00:04:34.917 --> 00:04:37.333
That your prediction is entirely wrong.

00:04:37.333 --> 00:04:42.292
I'll be able to reach our base
at the foot of the mountain... with Daz.

00:04:42.292 --> 00:04:45.667
You can go ahead of us and get back safe.

00:04:45.667 --> 00:04:47.583
How about that?

00:04:47.583 --> 00:04:50.000
There's no trouble in it for you.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.583
We'll make it back for sure.

00:04:52.583 --> 00:04:54.458
Go ahead of us.

00:05:10.333 --> 00:05:14.750
Hey. Why haven't you
asked me to help at all?

00:05:16.333 --> 00:05:17.917
I think...

00:05:17.917 --> 00:05:20.833
...you have no intention of saving Daz.

00:05:34.083 --> 00:05:38.708
You don't care. You've resigned
yourself to death already.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.917
You're hoping to die here, aren't you?

00:05:44.917 --> 00:05:48.583
How could you? I thought you were a good girl.

00:05:48.583 --> 00:05:53.125
You've gotta at least make it look like
you're trying to save his life.

00:05:53.125 --> 00:05:57.417
If you want people to remember you
as a hero who died trying to save someone,

00:05:57.417 --> 00:06:00.000
don't drag him down with you.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.625
That's what a bad girl would do.

00:06:02.625 --> 00:06:03.958
You're wrong!

00:06:05.125 --> 00:06:06.833
I didn't...

00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:08.708
That's not...

00:06:13.083 --> 00:06:14.708
I...

00:06:17.333 --> 00:06:22.750
It's you, right? The mistress' daughter
who had people after your life.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.458
How do you know?

00:06:25.458 --> 00:06:27.042
I see...

00:06:27.042 --> 00:06:29.250
So it was you after all.

00:06:30.333 --> 00:06:32.667
It's something I happened to overhear.

00:06:34.583 --> 00:06:40.958
At a church in the interior, back when
I snuck around borrowing things to stay alive.

00:06:42.875 --> 00:06:45.125
What a sob story it was.

00:06:45.125 --> 00:06:48.875
An illegitimate child
can't succeed a powerful noble.

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:54.208
So they just wanted to kill her,
to end all the fuss once and for all.

00:06:54.208 --> 00:07:00.042
But they'd look aside if she changed
her name and lived a humble life.

00:07:00.042 --> 00:07:04.750
In the end, I heard the girl was forced
to join the Cadet Corps.

00:07:06.542 --> 00:07:08.375
Don't you worry.

00:07:08.375 --> 00:07:13.000
I haven't told anyone. I don't plan to either.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.792
Then...

00:07:14.792 --> 00:07:18.250
...did you enter the Cadet Corps just to find me?

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.625
If that's the case... why?

00:07:23.792 --> 00:07:26.833
Who knows. Maybe because we're similar.

00:07:26.833 --> 00:07:28.625
What?

00:07:28.625 --> 00:07:33.125
You and me... have similar backgrounds?

00:07:33.125 --> 00:07:36.667
Well, more or less.

00:07:36.667 --> 00:07:39.458
That's the reason you became a soldier?

00:07:39.458 --> 00:07:42.500
Could be. I don't really know.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.625
No, it's not.

00:07:45.875 --> 00:07:47.875
You wanted...

00:07:47.875 --> 00:07:50.333
...to become friends with me?

00:07:50.333 --> 00:07:53.542
Huh? You've got to be kidding me.

00:07:56.292 --> 00:07:59.125
You and I can't even compare.

00:07:59.125 --> 00:08:02.042
We both got a second chance at life.

00:08:02.042 --> 00:08:05.042
But I'm not the one who took on a fake name.

00:08:05.042 --> 00:08:08.750
If I abandon my name
and reject who I am, they win.

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:13.125
I'm going to keep the name I have
and make the best of my life.

00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:17.167
That's the one and only way
I can get my revenge.

00:08:17.167 --> 00:08:19.875
So how do you explain yourself?

00:08:19.875 --> 00:08:24.667
Are you gonna commit suicide and
make everyone who ruined your life happy?

00:08:24.667 --> 00:08:27.208
Why is your desire to kill aimed at yourself?

00:08:27.208 --> 00:08:32.333
If you're so eager, use that passion
to change your own fate!

00:08:32.333 --> 00:08:34.917
I... I can't...

00:08:34.917 --> 00:08:36.458
Even now...

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:42.292
There's no way the three of us
can make it out of here alive.

00:08:43.292 --> 00:08:44.167
There is.

00:08:44.167 --> 00:08:45.250
Huh?

00:08:53.875 --> 00:08:56.875
I can see the base straight down from here.

00:08:59.792 --> 00:09:01.917
We drop Daz off this cliff.

00:09:01.917 --> 00:09:03.125
What?

00:09:03.125 --> 00:09:07.875
Hopefully he survives the fall,
and hopefully someone down there finds him.

00:09:07.875 --> 00:09:12.125
Sure, it might be a long shot, but...

00:09:12.125 --> 00:09:14.583
...that's his only real chance now.

00:09:14.583 --> 00:09:19.375
Unless some miracle happens, he'll be
an icicle long before you drag him down.

00:09:19.375 --> 00:09:20.833
But...

00:09:20.833 --> 00:09:24.042
But he'll die for sure if he falls!

00:09:24.042 --> 00:09:25.250
Shut up!

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:26.167
Huh?

00:09:26.167 --> 00:09:27.542
Quit it!

00:09:27.542 --> 00:09:28.750
Ymir!

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:31.583
I'll do it myself, so get moving already!

00:09:53.875 --> 00:09:56.292
It can't be...

00:09:56.292 --> 00:09:57.542
Wait!

00:09:58.708 --> 00:10:00.542
Ymir, wait!

00:10:05.875 --> 00:10:07.667
They're both...

00:10:10.167 --> 00:10:11.625
...gone.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:17.208
It's better if you guys don't come along.

00:10:17.208 --> 00:10:21.833
Like our instructor said, you'll only
end up becoming more victims.

00:10:21.833 --> 00:10:24.417
I'm going so that doesn't happen.

00:10:24.417 --> 00:10:27.583
I'm not leaving Christa and the others.

00:10:27.583 --> 00:10:30.792
Hey. What do you think you're doing?

00:10:30.792 --> 00:10:32.000
Don't try to stop--

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.750
You're gonna need a lot more gear than that.

00:10:35.958 --> 00:10:40.208
If you go by yourselves,
you'll be in the same pickle as Christa.

00:10:40.208 --> 00:10:43.333
In a search, the more eyes, the better.

00:10:43.333 --> 00:10:45.583
You guys...

00:10:45.583 --> 00:10:46.875
Thanks.

00:10:46.875 --> 00:10:48.583
To be honest, we could use you.

00:10:48.583 --> 00:10:50.083
Hey.

00:10:50.083 --> 00:10:52.000
We're coming too.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.542
The weather's steadily improving.

00:10:54.542 --> 00:10:55.750
I think we'll be fine.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:57.667
I brought extra rations!

00:10:57.667 --> 00:10:59.292
You guys...

00:11:04.917 --> 00:11:07.458
What was that sound just now?

00:11:16.167 --> 00:11:17.833
Somebody's coming!

00:11:34.542 --> 00:11:36.333
Ymir...

00:11:37.333 --> 00:11:41.292
Took you long enough.
I got here before you.

00:11:41.292 --> 00:11:46.125
I told Reiner and the others I'd wait
since you'd come along eventually.

00:11:47.083 --> 00:11:50.375
What a stupid thing I've done...

00:11:50.375 --> 00:11:51.792
Where's Daz?

00:12:04.458 --> 00:12:06.583
That was the cliff?

00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:10.458
But you didn't have any rope.

00:12:10.458 --> 00:12:13.333
Even if you did, it's too high.

00:12:13.333 --> 00:12:16.125
How did you get Daz down from there?

00:12:20.625 --> 00:12:22.208
Why not?

00:12:22.208 --> 00:12:25.375
I think I can trust you.

00:12:25.375 --> 00:12:27.292
However...

00:12:27.292 --> 00:12:29.250
Promise me.

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:34.625
When I reveal my secret to everyone, promise me.

00:12:34.625 --> 00:12:37.500
Take back your old name and live.

00:12:52.042 --> 00:12:53.500
Ymir!

00:12:55.458 --> 00:12:58.167
Christa... I felt the same.

00:12:58.167 --> 00:13:02.333
That it would have been better
if I was never born at all.

00:13:02.333 --> 00:13:06.167
I was hated by the world just for existing.

00:13:06.167 --> 00:13:07.542
I...

00:13:07.542 --> 00:13:12.417
To give countless people joy, I gave up my life.

00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:17.042
But from that time,
there was a wish I held in my heart.

00:13:17.042 --> 00:13:20.750
If someday, I was given
a second chance at life...

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.333
...this time...

00:13:22.333 --> 00:13:24.917
...I would live for no one but myself!

00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:33.958
"Soldiers able to move freely and swiftly in such
poor conditions gain considerable odds for victory."

00:13:45.125 --> 00:13:47.208
Is this real?

00:13:47.208 --> 00:13:49.917
Ymir is a Titan, too?

00:13:49.917 --> 00:13:52.292
Ymir...

00:13:52.292 --> 00:13:55.542
Th-That Titan is...

00:14:01.833 --> 00:14:03.750
...from that day...

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.167
Th-Thanks, Reiner.

00:14:22.167 --> 00:14:24.958
Ow, it hurts! Reiner, my leg!

00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.375
Reiner! That's enough!

00:14:27.375 --> 00:14:29.792
Let her leg go! Her leg!

00:14:29.792 --> 00:14:30.917
Hey!

00:14:33.375 --> 00:14:34.417
S-Sorry.

00:14:34.417 --> 00:14:36.667
No, you saved me.

00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:39.750
Christa... Did you know?

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:44.292
That Ymir is a Titan?

00:14:45.792 --> 00:14:48.208
I had no idea.

00:14:48.208 --> 00:14:50.667
I was always so close to her, too.

00:14:50.667 --> 00:14:53.917
How? How could this be?

00:14:56.083 --> 00:14:58.917
That Titan... is Ymir?

00:15:01.125 --> 00:15:05.958
In other words, she knew
some of the secrets of our world.

00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.458
And I never suspected a thing.

00:15:10.042 --> 00:15:14.042
Hey... Do you think she's known about it?

00:15:14.042 --> 00:15:18.708
Eren's a Titan, too,
but he didn't know until it happened.

00:15:18.708 --> 00:15:23.333
But Ymir is like... she is aware
of being a Titan all along.

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:27.292
Are you saying she might be
an enemy of humanity?

00:15:27.292 --> 00:15:30.917
I'm saying that's one hell of a power to hide.

00:15:30.917 --> 00:15:34.417
Who knows what she might have been thinking.

00:15:34.417 --> 00:15:38.000
I wonder... What could be Ymir's goal?

00:15:47.208 --> 00:15:48.542
Ymir!

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:15.167
She's--

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:19.708
Wh-What was that?

00:16:19.708 --> 00:16:23.167
Is she worried about the tower falling?

00:16:23.167 --> 00:16:24.833
She has to be.

00:16:24.833 --> 00:16:30.417
If she wanted to, Ymir could use this power
of hers to escape all on her own.

00:16:30.417 --> 00:16:33.250
And yet, she's not doing that.

00:16:34.833 --> 00:16:39.333
It's us... She's risking her life to protect us.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.625
Why?

00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:48.583
Why?

00:16:48.583 --> 00:16:50.042
Ymir!

00:16:52.833 --> 00:16:54.667
Don't you die, Ymir!

00:16:54.667 --> 00:16:56.208
Not in a place like this!

00:16:56.208 --> 00:16:57.375
Hey!

00:16:57.375 --> 00:17:00.042
Don't pretend like you're good, you idiot!

00:17:01.583 --> 00:17:05.667
You wanna go out in a blaze of glory?
Are you stupid?!

00:17:05.667 --> 00:17:08.542
It's too late for you to try
and get into heaven!

00:17:08.542 --> 00:17:11.708
Live for yourself, goddammit!

00:17:11.708 --> 00:17:16.708
If you're gonna die protecting this tower,
forget about it! Tear it down!

00:17:16.708 --> 00:17:18.125
Hey!

00:17:31.583 --> 00:17:34.625
H-Hey! She's really tearing it down!

00:17:34.625 --> 00:17:36.458
Keep it up, Ymir!

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:41.917
Want live...?

00:17:41.917 --> 00:17:43.917
Grab me!

00:18:20.458 --> 00:18:21.708
Titans again?

00:18:21.708 --> 00:18:24.792
Hey, ugly! Go and finish the job!

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.833
Ymir!

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:41.917
This looks bad.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.167
Ymir is...

00:19:00.125 --> 00:19:02.417
This can't...

00:19:02.417 --> 00:19:04.000
This can't...

00:19:05.917 --> 00:19:07.750
Christa!

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.083
This can't...

00:19:09.083 --> 00:19:10.708
Ymir, wait!

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:13.625
I still...

00:19:13.625 --> 00:19:16.417
...want to talk to you!

00:19:16.417 --> 00:19:17.833
I still--

00:19:17.833 --> 00:19:22.667
I still haven't told you my real name!

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:36.750
Wait...

00:19:37.833 --> 00:19:39.125
I still...

00:19:49.625 --> 00:19:53.083
Christa. Everyone, get back.

00:19:53.083 --> 00:19:54.958
We've got this.

00:19:54.958 --> 00:19:56.958
Leave the rest to us.

00:19:56.958 --> 00:19:58.375
Mikasa!

00:20:06.292 --> 00:20:08.625
Have the others disperse and cover the area!

00:20:08.625 --> 00:20:11.833
The rest of us will attack
where the Titans are gathering!

00:20:11.833 --> 00:20:13.500
Got it!

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:14.250
Hey!

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:17.125
We don't need you to be a part of the attack!

00:20:19.167 --> 00:20:20.417
Die!

00:20:22.042 --> 00:20:24.708
I did it! My first kill!

00:20:29.292 --> 00:20:32.500
You moron! I told you to stay back, Eren!

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:34.542
Right! I'm sorry!

00:20:34.542 --> 00:20:35.917
Ouch...

00:20:35.917 --> 00:20:37.750
Hey!

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:39.583
Eren!

00:20:39.583 --> 00:20:41.083
You guys!

00:21:30.375 --> 00:21:32.375
It can't be...

00:21:32.375 --> 00:21:34.417
Ymir is...

00:21:39.583 --> 00:21:41.125
Ymir...

00:21:55.125 --> 00:21:57.083
My real name...

00:21:58.167 --> 00:22:00.875
...is Historia.

00:23:58.167 --> 00:24:02.292
There was no damage seen along Wall Rose.

00:24:02.292 --> 00:24:07.625
Then how is it that Titans appeared
on the inside of the wall?

00:24:07.625 --> 00:24:09.167
Thrown into confusion,

00:24:09.167 --> 00:24:14.833
the Scouts decide to return to Trost
with doubts weighing heavily on their mind.

00:24:14.833 --> 00:24:16.708
However...

00:24:16.708 --> 00:24:22.542
...Eren learns a shocking secret--
one that changes everything.

00:24:22.542 --> 00:24:27.094
Next episode: "Warrior."
