WEBVTT

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.500
Conny!

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.125
Are there any survivors?

00:00:30.083 --> 00:00:31.500
No...

00:00:32.542 --> 00:00:34.083
None at all.

00:00:35.083 --> 00:00:37.250
It's all over...

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.042
My hometown... It's gone forever.

00:00:47.917 --> 00:00:50.625
Hey! Something's strange here.

00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:55.708
Has anyone spotted any bodies?

00:00:55.708 --> 00:00:57.208
No...

00:00:57.208 --> 00:00:58.667
I haven't.

00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:00.542
How is that even possible?

00:01:00.542 --> 00:01:02.583
Titans come and not a single drop of blood?

00:01:02.583 --> 00:01:04.292
Everyone must've escaped!

00:01:04.292 --> 00:01:06.375
It means nobody here was eaten.

00:01:06.375 --> 00:01:08.958
Including your family, too.

00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:11.833
I see... That's gotta be it!

00:01:11.833 --> 00:01:18.333
Yeah. It's unbelievable to think Titans
ate everyone without leaving blood behind.

00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:20.792
That's not all that's unbelievable.

00:01:21.792 --> 00:01:25.833
If the entire village was really evacuated,

00:01:25.833 --> 00:01:32.375
why would Titans obliterate
these houses with nobody in them?

00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:37.458
But what really boggles my mind is the stables.

00:01:37.458 --> 00:01:43.458
If they tried to escape without horses,
their chances of survival would be slim.

00:01:43.458 --> 00:01:45.583
Everyone got their torches?

00:01:45.583 --> 00:01:46.958
Let's move!

00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:50.042
Our mission now is to locate
and assess the breach in the wall!

00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:51.208
Yes, sir!

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.000
Wel... come... home...

00:02:19.875 --> 00:02:22.167
Just now...

00:02:22.167 --> 00:02:24.042
Conny, hurry up!

00:02:24.042 --> 00:02:26.958
We're falling behind Gelgar!

00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.167
Reiner? Did you hear that?

00:02:29.167 --> 00:02:29.917
The Titan--

00:02:29.917 --> 00:02:32.750
I didn't hear anything at all.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.042
Enough with the chit-chat.
Focus on the mission!

00:02:36.042 --> 00:02:38.375
But it... I think...

00:02:38.375 --> 00:02:40.125
I don't know how, but...

00:02:40.125 --> 00:02:41.708
I think...

00:02:41.708 --> 00:02:42.583
My mom...

00:02:42.583 --> 00:02:46.875
Conny! Do you understand
the situation we're in?!

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:52.083
Hundreds of thousands of lives depend
on whether we complete this mission or not!

00:02:52.083 --> 00:02:55.917
Your family might have escaped,
but it's not over yet!

00:02:55.917 --> 00:02:58.333
If you're a soldier, put the mission first!

00:03:02.458 --> 00:03:03.750
Yeah...

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.625
Good point.

00:03:07.042 --> 00:03:08.667
He's absolutely right!

00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:49.000
"Southwestward"

00:04:52.708 --> 00:04:53.833
"7 hours after the Titan spotting"
"Western Team"

00:04:53.833 --> 00:04:58.375
We're getting close to the wall now,
so there's no people living in the area.

00:04:58.375 --> 00:05:01.917
Right. That didn't take us very long.

00:05:03.625 --> 00:05:07.208
All right, let's head to the south.

00:05:07.208 --> 00:05:08.958
What for?

00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:12.292
There shouldn't be any villages south of here.

00:05:12.292 --> 00:05:15.625
We need to find the location
the wall was breached.

00:05:15.625 --> 00:05:19.375
We'll ride along the wall
from the west until we find it.

00:05:19.375 --> 00:05:22.625
But Christa and I don't have our battle gear.

00:05:22.625 --> 00:05:26.250
There's probably Titans
roaming everywhere to our south.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.333
It's very possible that
we'll become Titan fodder.

00:05:30.333 --> 00:05:33.625
Let the two of us withdraw from the front.

00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:34.708
Ymir...

00:05:34.708 --> 00:05:38.833
You can't. I'll need somebody
to relay back a report.

00:05:38.833 --> 00:05:42.958
I know how you feel,
but you signed up for this as a soldier.

00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.333
Ymir.

00:05:50.333 --> 00:05:53.250
I'm fine with putting my life on the line.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.542
After all, I'm the one
who chose to join the Scouts.

00:05:59.542 --> 00:06:02.667
But... it's not the same for you.

00:06:03.792 --> 00:06:06.208
The only reason you joined
the Scouts was because--

00:06:06.208 --> 00:06:09.833
Hmph! You think I did it for you?!

00:06:09.833 --> 00:06:12.542
Then why are you even here?

00:06:12.542 --> 00:06:16.167
You kept trying to convince me
to join the Military Police.

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:18.583
But then you gave that privilege to me!

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.542
There's no way I'm good enough
to make the top ten on skill alone.

00:06:24.542 --> 00:06:29.625
I'm sure if I asked anyone,
they'd say you deserved to be in it, not me.

00:06:29.625 --> 00:06:31.917
I don't know how you did it, but...

00:06:33.667 --> 00:06:35.250
Why?

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.417
Why would you go that far for me?

00:06:41.542 --> 00:06:43.042
Does it...

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:46.792
...have to do with my family?

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.417
Yeah, it does.

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.042
Christa...

00:06:55.042 --> 00:06:57.458
Don't worry about it.

00:06:57.458 --> 00:07:02.458
The only reason I'm here...
is for myself and nothing else.

00:07:04.292 --> 00:07:05.833
I see...

00:07:08.792 --> 00:07:10.375
Thank goodness.

00:07:17.625 --> 00:07:21.750
"9 hours after the Titan spotting"
"Eastern defensive line"

00:07:24.125 --> 00:07:26.583
The target has come within range!

00:07:26.583 --> 00:07:29.250
All cannons, prepare to fire!

00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:33.458
Not yet! Wait for the order!

00:07:33.458 --> 00:07:35.250
Sir!

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.250
Fire!

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.042
Did I get 'em?

00:07:59.625 --> 00:08:01.417
You did it, Captain Rico!

00:08:01.417 --> 00:08:04.917
At this rate, they'll never break our defense!

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:08.958
No... The Titans' strength is in their numbers.

00:08:08.958 --> 00:08:13.333
If they attack as a group,
this line won't stand a chance.

00:08:14.542 --> 00:08:16.917
But... what is it?

00:08:16.917 --> 00:08:18.500
Something isn't...

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:21.542
This is strange...

00:08:21.542 --> 00:08:24.500
Captain Hannes! Is something wrong?

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.292
We haven't even spotted a single Titan yet.

00:08:28.292 --> 00:08:31.708
We've got to be getting close to the hole now.

00:08:31.708 --> 00:08:34.958
And yet, doesn't it seem
awful quiet around here?

00:08:38.083 --> 00:08:43.417
Hopefully, we can sneak in and out
without stirring up a storm.

00:08:57.792 --> 00:09:02.583
"11 hours after the Titan spotting"
"Southern Team"

00:09:04.917 --> 00:09:06.458
When?

00:09:07.792 --> 00:09:09.708
When will they show?

00:09:10.917 --> 00:09:13.208
When will it happen?

00:09:13.208 --> 00:09:16.958
At any second, they could
leap out from the shadows.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.542
No...

00:09:20.542 --> 00:09:27.000
The closer we get to the hole,
the more inevitable it becomes.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.542
Damn it!

00:09:29.542 --> 00:09:31.917
This is driving me crazy!

00:09:57.042 --> 00:10:00.000
Did you follow the wall here, too?

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.958
Yeah. Where did you find the hole?

00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.958
Huh?

00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:08.667
We didn't find anything to the west.

00:10:08.667 --> 00:10:11.625
Didn't you find it your way?

00:10:11.625 --> 00:10:12.875
No...

00:10:13.833 --> 00:10:16.125
There's no hole this way either.

00:10:22.458 --> 00:10:24.333
Is it possible we missed it?

00:10:24.333 --> 00:10:25.792
No way.

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:28.833
Not a hole big enough for Titans to use.

00:10:28.833 --> 00:10:31.583
Should we go back and look again?

00:10:31.583 --> 00:10:36.792
We'll need to, but the horses
and the rest of us are exhausted.

00:10:37.792 --> 00:10:40.000
If only we had some moonlight...

00:10:41.542 --> 00:10:42.625
Yeah...

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.083
What's that?

00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.917
Castle ruins?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
"Due to their usefulness and long burning time,
torches are issued as standard equipment."

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:16.625
It looks like a mess, but we can
make it work for one night of rest.

00:11:16.625 --> 00:11:20.042
Right. Luckily the moon is out.

00:11:28.792 --> 00:11:30.083
Hange.

00:11:31.792 --> 00:11:33.500
Hey, four-eyes.

00:11:34.708 --> 00:11:39.417
Are your hobbies so boring that playing
with rocks is somehow fun for you?

00:11:39.417 --> 00:11:42.208
Yeah. That's right.

00:11:42.208 --> 00:11:44.458
But this is no ordinary rock.

00:11:44.458 --> 00:11:48.292
It's a hardened fragment of skin
left behind by the Female Titan.

00:11:48.292 --> 00:11:50.833
Huh? It didn't disappear?

00:11:50.833 --> 00:11:55.833
Right! Annie reverted from a Titan, but it's still
intact even though it broke off her body.

00:11:55.833 --> 00:11:59.375
It didn't evaporate. It didn't disappear.

00:11:59.375 --> 00:12:01.583
So I thought, "What if?"

00:12:01.583 --> 00:12:03.500
When I compared it to a piece of the wall,

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:08.125
its pattern and composition
were practically identical.

00:12:08.125 --> 00:12:11.708
In other words, the wall is
a barricade of humongous Titans.

00:12:11.708 --> 00:12:17.792
And if I'm right, the surface is
constructed with hardened Titan skin.

00:12:17.792 --> 00:12:20.750
That's exactly what Armin was saying...

00:12:22.708 --> 00:12:24.625
Th-Then--

00:12:24.625 --> 00:12:27.542
Let me finish, Armin.

00:12:27.542 --> 00:12:31.833
As it stands, we'll be hard pressed
to fill the hole in Wall Rose.

00:12:31.833 --> 00:12:35.625
That is, unless we can find
the perfect boulder to plug it.

00:12:36.583 --> 00:12:40.583
But if... But if Eren, in his transformed state,

00:12:40.583 --> 00:12:45.375
could use the Titans' hardening ability
to seal the hole in the wall...

00:12:46.583 --> 00:12:47.958
Use me...

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:51.250
...to seal the wall?

00:12:52.667 --> 00:12:55.458
It should be made of the same material.

00:12:55.458 --> 00:13:01.292
And seeing how the hardened section won't
evaporate, even after you revert from a Titan...

00:13:01.292 --> 00:13:02.583
...it's possible...

00:13:06.417 --> 00:13:09.708
I think it's well worth the risk to try.

00:13:09.708 --> 00:13:16.083
And assuming it really does work,
reclaiming Wall Maria is feasible, too.

00:13:16.083 --> 00:13:20.583
Up until now, we've had to transport
a large quantity of materials and supplies.

00:13:20.583 --> 00:13:24.792
That's why the need for outposts
past the wall limited our progress.

00:13:24.792 --> 00:13:28.417
But if we don't have to
accommodate supply wagons...

00:13:28.417 --> 00:13:31.625
...we could quickly make our way to Shiganshina.

00:13:31.625 --> 00:13:34.792
What if we carried out the plan at night?

00:13:34.792 --> 00:13:35.750
At night?

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:36.833
Yes.

00:13:36.833 --> 00:13:39.292
During the night, when Titans can't move.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.833
I see...

00:13:41.833 --> 00:13:46.417
If the group was small enough,
you could sneak all the way to Wall Maria.

00:13:47.792 --> 00:13:50.833
The current situation is as bad as it gets, but...

00:13:50.833 --> 00:13:54.542
...we still have a glimmer of hope.

00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:57.375
Yes, but remember...

00:13:57.375 --> 00:14:01.042
...it all depends on whether Eren
can seal the hole or not.

00:14:02.792 --> 00:14:06.625
I realize asking this hardly seems fair, but...

00:14:06.625 --> 00:14:08.583
Think you can do it?

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.542
It doesn't matter what you think.

00:14:21.542 --> 00:14:24.833
You have to. There's no other choice.

00:14:24.833 --> 00:14:26.667
We're out of options.

00:14:26.667 --> 00:14:31.750
Our forces are struggling so desperately,
there's nothing else they can do.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:34.375
You have to succeed.

00:14:34.375 --> 00:14:35.333
I will!

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:38.542
I'll do whatever it takes to seal the wall!

00:14:39.458 --> 00:14:41.083
Whatever it takes...

00:14:48.458 --> 00:14:49.958
The basement...

00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.333
My dad's basement...

00:14:52.333 --> 00:14:58.083
If what my dad said was true,
we'll find the answers to everything there.

00:15:05.583 --> 00:15:07.125
It's Ehrmich District.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:22.875
Hey, keep moving.

00:15:22.875 --> 00:15:25.458
You'll end up like a little lost kid.

00:15:25.458 --> 00:15:27.583
Th-This is...

00:15:27.583 --> 00:15:30.958
What did you expect you'd see?

00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:33.667
This is what happens when the wall falls.

00:15:35.542 --> 00:15:39.417
Mommy! Daddy!

00:15:41.125 --> 00:15:42.792
Hey!

00:15:42.792 --> 00:15:45.292
Where do you think you're going?

00:15:45.292 --> 00:15:49.417
Take a good look at the faces of people
who've lost everything.

00:15:50.375 --> 00:15:54.208
The faces of everyone you
and your people abandoned.

00:15:54.208 --> 00:15:59.750
If your church's wish comes true,
and Titans come flooding through the walls,

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:07.000
we'll all be gobbled up in their stinking mouths
and die in the most miserable way possible.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.667
All of humanity, digested as one.

00:16:13.292 --> 00:16:17.292
Once we leave Ehrmich,
we'll be in Titan territory.

00:16:17.292 --> 00:16:19.833
Eren? Think you can ride a horse?

00:16:19.833 --> 00:16:23.125
Yes. I feel fully recovered now.

00:16:23.125 --> 00:16:26.958
Yours is ready at the west lift. Let's hurry.

00:16:30.042 --> 00:16:32.333
Section Commander. We should hurry.

00:16:32.333 --> 00:16:34.625
Give me a minute, Moblit.

00:16:35.875 --> 00:16:39.125
Have you had a change of heart yet?

00:16:43.792 --> 00:16:46.333
We don't have time for this!
You know, don't you?!

00:16:46.333 --> 00:16:50.000
Will you talk, or won't you?!
Make up your mind already!

00:16:51.208 --> 00:16:53.583
I cannot say anything.

00:16:53.583 --> 00:16:58.500
The other believers are the same as I,
and that will never change.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.250
Well thanks for nothing!

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:03.542
We're so grateful for all the help you've been!

00:17:03.542 --> 00:17:09.708
It's too great a decision
for a single person to make.

00:17:09.708 --> 00:17:15.292
The Order of the Walls must always adhere
to the sacred will we're bound to obey.

00:17:15.292 --> 00:17:17.417
Whose will?

00:17:17.417 --> 00:17:18.833
God or something?

00:17:18.833 --> 00:17:21.208
I cannot say anything.

00:17:21.208 --> 00:17:22.167
However,

00:17:22.167 --> 00:17:29.583
I can inform you of a name, who under their
sacred will, we were instructed to monitor.

00:17:29.583 --> 00:17:30.917
Monitor?

00:17:32.708 --> 00:17:37.375
That person joined the Scout
Regiment as of this year.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:41.750
Their name is...

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:43.417
Excuse me!

00:17:43.417 --> 00:17:45.500
104th Cadet Corps!

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.333
Sasha Braus!

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:50.542
Her?

00:17:50.542 --> 00:17:51.500
Who's that?

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.167
Um, this is for you, Section Commander.

00:17:54.167 --> 00:17:56.792
You must find her at once.

00:17:56.792 --> 00:18:02.583
Only she... She may know the truths
which even we cannot perceive.

00:18:02.583 --> 00:18:05.792
That is all the information I can share.

00:18:06.917 --> 00:18:09.875
The rest I leave in your hands.

00:18:09.875 --> 00:18:14.042
If she's in the 104th, then she's deep
in the front lines right now.

00:18:14.042 --> 00:18:15.458
Let's go!

00:18:15.458 --> 00:18:17.375
We need to hurry!

00:18:17.375 --> 00:18:18.625
Wait!

00:18:18.625 --> 00:18:20.167
Ouch...

00:18:20.167 --> 00:18:21.958
Sasha?!

00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:24.125
What are you doing here?

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:30.042
Upon my arrival, I gave my report
to the Commander!

00:18:30.042 --> 00:18:34.083
Afterwards, I was entrusted to deliver
this message to the Section Commander!

00:18:34.083 --> 00:18:38.250
Message? Thank you. Good work.

00:18:40.292 --> 00:18:43.792
So, who is this girl in the 104th?

00:18:43.792 --> 00:18:46.417
She's the smallest one of us.

00:18:46.417 --> 00:18:48.667
She's got long golden hair.

00:18:48.667 --> 00:18:51.833
Um, and...

00:18:51.833 --> 00:18:53.125
She's cute.

00:18:54.625 --> 00:18:57.250
She's always hanging around Ymir.

00:18:58.250 --> 00:18:59.792
Ymir?

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.500
What's the meaning of this?

00:19:06.125 --> 00:19:07.417
Ymir...

00:19:08.958 --> 00:19:10.458
You...

00:19:12.292 --> 00:19:13.750
Everyone, wake up!

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:16.542
Get to the tower! Quickly!

00:19:25.167 --> 00:19:28.417
I couldn't see them in the darkness,
but then the moon...

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.292
Why? Why can they move?

00:19:34.292 --> 00:19:37.042
It's been so long since the sun set!

00:19:38.083 --> 00:19:39.917
What's going on here?

00:19:39.917 --> 00:19:42.500
Hey! Look at that!

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:47.833
It's huge! What the hell is it? A Titan?

00:19:47.833 --> 00:19:50.167
No, it's more like...

00:19:50.167 --> 00:19:52.500
It's like a beast!

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:53.875
Right?

00:19:58.083 --> 00:20:00.667
It's... headed for the wall!

00:20:07.667 --> 00:20:09.375
Everyone understand?

00:20:09.375 --> 00:20:10.417
Yes!

00:20:11.625 --> 00:20:12.708
We've got to go!

00:20:12.708 --> 00:20:14.292
Calm down, Eren.

00:20:16.042 --> 00:20:18.167
You all listen, too.

00:20:18.167 --> 00:20:20.250
We're going our own ways now.

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:22.625
The rest is up to you.

00:20:22.625 --> 00:20:28.417
Erwin may have thrown together your squad,
but everything's riding on you.

00:20:28.417 --> 00:20:30.542
Got it, Armin?

00:20:30.542 --> 00:20:33.458
Work with Hange and combine your knowledge.

00:20:33.458 --> 00:20:35.583
Y-Yes sir!

00:20:35.583 --> 00:20:37.083
Mikasa.

00:20:37.083 --> 00:20:40.583
I don't know why you're
so attached to Eren, but...

00:20:40.583 --> 00:20:44.458
...use the utmost of your ability
to protect Eren at all costs.

00:20:44.458 --> 00:20:47.042
Yes, sir! Of course!

00:20:47.042 --> 00:20:49.417
And finally...

00:20:49.417 --> 00:20:50.583
Eren.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.958
Hey, wait!

00:20:56.958 --> 00:20:59.083
Wait, wait, wait up!

00:21:00.083 --> 00:21:02.708
Don't you be coming in here!

00:21:02.708 --> 00:21:06.750
You're fricking kidding me.
Gotta be fricking kidding me.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:09.625
I'd be drinking right now if it wasn't for you!

00:21:09.625 --> 00:21:11.833
This is all your fault!

00:21:11.833 --> 00:21:14.917
Stand back, rookies.

00:21:14.917 --> 00:21:16.208
Leave it to us.

00:21:17.208 --> 00:21:19.958
It's time to show off our ODM gear.

00:21:22.042 --> 00:21:23.083
Let's go!

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.458
And finally, Eren.

00:21:43.458 --> 00:21:45.833
Learn how to restrain yourself.

00:21:46.875 --> 00:21:50.333
Don't succumb to rage
and lose sight of the goal.

00:21:50.333 --> 00:21:53.083
We can't afford another mistake.

00:21:53.083 --> 00:21:54.167
Yes, sir!

00:21:56.583 --> 00:22:00.208
There's a tower nearby
where we can assess the wall.

00:22:00.208 --> 00:22:03.917
It's in an abandoned castle to the southwest.

00:22:03.917 --> 00:22:06.542
We'll ride to Utgard Castle.

00:23:58.792 --> 00:24:05.333
While searching for the Titans' breach in
the wall, the Scouts arrive at Utgard Castle.

00:24:05.333 --> 00:24:12.417
Their rest is cut short by Titans who move
even under the darkness of night.

00:24:12.417 --> 00:24:15.333
The Scouts fight back gallantly.

00:24:15.333 --> 00:24:22.750
As the Titans' invasion presses within the
castle, Reiner recollects a scene of his past.

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:27.136
Next episode: "Soldier."
