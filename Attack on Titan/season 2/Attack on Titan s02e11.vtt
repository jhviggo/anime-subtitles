WEBVTT

00:00:20.208 --> 00:00:22.000
Here she comes, Reiner.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.208
Right.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.542
Oh no...

00:00:44.542 --> 00:00:46.833
Eren's being taken away!

00:00:55.042 --> 00:00:58.167
All squads! Let the Titans chase after you!

00:00:58.167 --> 00:01:00.167
Follow my lead!

00:01:01.083 --> 00:01:02.500
Erwin...

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.125
You demon! Are you trying
to use us as bait again?!

00:01:07.125 --> 00:01:08.917
That's not my intention!

00:01:08.917 --> 00:01:11.167
The Military Police have fought well!

00:01:11.167 --> 00:01:14.167
Now serve your duty as soldiers!

00:01:14.167 --> 00:01:20.250
The Armored Titan plans to escape with Eren!
We have to stop him no matter what!

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
"Charge"

00:03:02.875 --> 00:03:06.167
He's not fast enough to escape! We'll catch up!

00:03:06.167 --> 00:03:10.625
This time, I won't hesitate.
I'll kill them both, I swear!

00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:15.292
And if Ymir gets in my way,
she's asking for it, too.

00:03:15.292 --> 00:03:19.000
No matter what it takes... I will!

00:03:33.833 --> 00:03:35.208
Christa!

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.125
Ymir...

00:03:51.625 --> 00:03:52.958
Ymir!

00:03:56.875 --> 00:03:58.167
Chris--

00:03:59.292 --> 00:04:06.917
No... Historia.
Sorry... for eating you... like that.

00:04:06.917 --> 00:04:10.250
I bet... you're mad at me.

00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:13.125
Ymir...

00:04:13.125 --> 00:04:16.000
What is this? What are you doing?

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.292
We came here to rescue you and Er--

00:04:18.292 --> 00:04:20.375
I don't need rescuing!

00:04:20.375 --> 00:04:22.583
Just stay right there.

00:04:22.583 --> 00:04:25.958
I'm following Reiner and Bertholdt now.

00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:29.292
You, too. Come with me.

00:04:29.292 --> 00:04:32.250
There's no future within the walls!

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.333
Listen to me, Historia...

00:04:38.333 --> 00:04:42.042
Outside the walls isn't as bad as you think.

00:04:42.042 --> 00:04:48.583
Especially... because there won't be anyone
saying that you're better off not being born.

00:04:49.833 --> 00:04:52.917
I'm pretty sure Titans won't be
saying that to me...

00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:55.875
...because they'll be too busy trying to eat me!

00:04:55.875 --> 00:04:59.083
Everyone has at least one or two faults!

00:04:59.083 --> 00:05:02.042
If you can just overlook that,
they're not so bad after all!

00:05:02.042 --> 00:05:08.083
Ymir! Everything you're saying
and doing isn't making any sense!

00:05:08.083 --> 00:05:13.167
Could it be... that Reiner and
Bertholdt threatened you?

00:05:19.333 --> 00:05:22.417
It's... the reverse.

00:05:22.417 --> 00:05:24.833
Am I right, Ymir?!

00:05:24.833 --> 00:05:28.875
I'll fight them with you,
so let me out of your hand!

00:05:28.875 --> 00:05:31.625
I don't care if there's something
you can't tell me.

00:05:31.625 --> 00:05:33.292
No matter what happens...

00:05:33.292 --> 00:05:36.417
...I will always be your ally!

00:05:43.167 --> 00:05:44.458
Ymir!

00:05:45.625 --> 00:05:47.292
Look...

00:05:47.292 --> 00:05:50.500
The Scouts have already gotten this close.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.292
If only we had run right away,
we probably would've been able to escape.

00:05:55.292 --> 00:06:00.458
But because you forced us to bring Christa...
at this rate, they'll catch us!

00:06:01.542 --> 00:06:07.417
Hey, Ymir... are you telling us
we did all of that for nothing?

00:06:07.417 --> 00:06:09.875
Did you change your mind?

00:06:09.875 --> 00:06:15.000
Is that really what you want?
Letting Christa rot within the walls?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.542
Don't be stupid! Ymir!

00:06:17.542 --> 00:06:20.500
Ymir! Hurry up and let me go!

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.792
I can't!

00:06:29.042 --> 00:06:31.500
Historia...

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.375
To be honest...

00:06:33.375 --> 00:06:37.000
...the reason I snatched you away...

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.208
...was only... to save myself.

00:06:41.208 --> 00:06:42.625
Huh?

00:06:43.792 --> 00:06:49.292
A long time ago, I stole the Power of the Titans
from one of their comrades.

00:06:49.292 --> 00:06:51.625
There's nothing I can do against them.

00:06:51.625 --> 00:06:54.583
Sooner or later, they'll kill me.

00:06:54.583 --> 00:06:58.958
But... if I hand you over
and cooperate with them...

00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:04.833
...they said they would see what they could do...
and try to make it so my crime goes away.

00:07:04.833 --> 00:07:09.750
Because you know the secrets of the wall,
you're someone important to the Church.

00:07:11.208 --> 00:07:12.833
Does it...

00:07:12.833 --> 00:07:15.208
...have to do with my family?

00:07:15.208 --> 00:07:18.542
Yeah, it does.

00:07:18.542 --> 00:07:21.583
Once this world started going to hell...

00:07:21.583 --> 00:07:26.583
...I thought being with you would
give me insurance in the future.

00:07:26.583 --> 00:07:30.458
I almost died during the battle at that castle...

00:07:30.458 --> 00:07:33.000
...and that feeling scarred me for life.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.917
I'm afraid to die...

00:07:34.917 --> 00:07:37.333
I'll do whatever it takes to live...

00:07:37.333 --> 00:07:39.167
I'm pathetic...

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:42.625
I told myself I was doing it for your sake...

00:07:42.625 --> 00:07:46.125
But really, I did it for myself.

00:07:48.125 --> 00:07:51.208
Please, Historia...

00:07:53.542 --> 00:07:55.125
Please...

00:07:56.625 --> 00:07:59.125
Please save me!

00:08:06.542 --> 00:08:09.167
I told you already, Ymir.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:17.042
No matter what happens...
I will always be your ally!

00:08:57.042 --> 00:08:59.458
Reiner! Protect us!

00:09:12.208 --> 00:09:16.542
I knew it! I'll have to kill Ymir first!

00:09:16.542 --> 00:09:18.208
Wait, Mikasa!

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.792
Don't kill Ymir!

00:09:22.792 --> 00:09:24.917
That all depends on Ymir!

00:09:24.917 --> 00:09:29.083
What will it be? I'll kill everyone
that gets in my way, so choose!

00:09:29.083 --> 00:09:30.625
No, wait!

00:09:30.625 --> 00:09:33.833
Ymir will be killed unless she does
what Reiner and Bertholdt say!

00:09:33.833 --> 00:09:36.333
She doesn't have a choice!

00:09:37.375 --> 00:09:40.708
There's only so many lives
that I actually care about.

00:09:40.708 --> 00:09:45.125
My enemies made
deciding that easy six years ago.

00:09:45.125 --> 00:09:49.250
So... you're mistaken to seek
any compassion from me.

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:54.667
Because right now, I'm all out of time
and room in my heart to care.

00:09:54.667 --> 00:09:59.875
Christa... do you pick Eren or Ymir? Which is it?

00:09:59.875 --> 00:10:02.042
Will you get in my way, too?!

00:10:03.167 --> 00:10:05.250
Stop, Ymir!

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:07.708
Don't fight back! You'll die!

00:10:07.708 --> 00:10:09.167
Don't move!

00:10:19.042 --> 00:10:20.625
Quit it, Eren!

00:10:20.625 --> 00:10:22.583
Don't struggle!

00:10:22.583 --> 00:10:25.125
Good luck with that, Bertholdt.

00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:28.375
It's impossible to get him to calm down.

00:10:28.375 --> 00:10:30.917
He's the most irritating guy there is!

00:10:30.917 --> 00:10:32.708
I know better than anyone!

00:10:32.708 --> 00:10:35.375
I hate him as much as you do.

00:10:35.375 --> 00:10:38.208
So let's beat him up together.

00:10:38.208 --> 00:10:40.292
Why don't you come out of there?

00:10:40.292 --> 00:10:42.375
Bertholdt! Give him back!

00:10:42.375 --> 00:10:46.875
Hey... You're kidding, right?
Bertholdt? Reiner?

00:10:46.875 --> 00:10:50.875
This whole time...
you kept quiet and deceived us?

00:10:50.875 --> 00:10:52.833
That's so cruel!

00:10:52.833 --> 00:10:56.292
You guys! Tell us it's all a lie!

00:11:00.167 --> 00:11:04.833
Hey, hey, hey...
You think you can just keep running away?

00:11:04.833 --> 00:11:06.833
That's not gonna happen!

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:12.083
For three years, didn't we sleep under
the same roof as comrades through thick and thin?

00:11:12.083 --> 00:11:17.292
Bertholdt... Your odd sleeping positions
were truly an art form.

00:11:17.292 --> 00:11:21.958
After a while, we all looked forward
each morning to seeing your pose...

00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:25.292
...and tried using it to predict the weather.

00:11:25.292 --> 00:11:27.375
But you...

00:11:27.375 --> 00:11:32.125
To think you, the invader...
could sleep like a log...

00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:34.583
...right next your victims!

00:11:34.583 --> 00:11:37.250
Was everything just a lie?

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:40.500
Remember we talked
about surviving this together?

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:44.542
And that we'd grow old, and someday
we'd all go out for drinks together?

00:11:44.542 --> 00:11:48.292
Was everything... all a lie?

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.750
Was it?!

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:52.167
You guys...

00:11:52.167 --> 00:11:55.125
What were you guys thinking this whole time?

00:11:55.125 --> 00:11:58.083
What's it even matter anymore?

00:11:58.083 --> 00:12:01.542
Just focus on cutting open his neck.

00:12:01.542 --> 00:12:05.833
If you hesitate for a moment,
we won't be able to get Eren back.

00:12:05.833 --> 00:12:08.000
They are enemies of humanity.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.792
That's all there is to know.

00:12:11.542 --> 00:12:13.417
T-Tell me who!

00:12:13.417 --> 00:12:17.625
Who the hell would want to kill people
by their own choice?!

00:12:21.292 --> 00:12:24.708
Who the hell would like
doing this sort of thing?!

00:12:24.708 --> 00:12:28.292
Do you think I wanted to do this?!

00:12:28.292 --> 00:12:30.333
People hate and despise us...

00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:33.833
We've done such terrible things,
we deserve to die.

00:12:33.833 --> 00:12:36.708
Things we'll never be able to take back...

00:12:38.458 --> 00:12:44.125
But... we just...
couldn't come to terms with our sins.

00:12:44.125 --> 00:12:49.917
The only time we had some respite...
was when we pretended to be soldiers.

00:12:49.917 --> 00:12:51.750
That's not a lie!

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:57.333
Conny! Jean! It's true we may have
deceived everyone, but it's not all a lie!

00:12:57.333 --> 00:13:00.208
We really considered you comrades!

00:13:01.625 --> 00:13:06.125
Neither of us have any right to even apologize.

00:13:06.125 --> 00:13:08.875
But... someone...

00:13:08.875 --> 00:13:11.417
Please...

00:13:11.417 --> 00:13:14.500
Someone, please...

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.583
Someone find us!

00:13:22.167 --> 00:13:24.583
Bertholdt...

00:13:24.583 --> 00:13:27.083
Give Eren back.

00:13:27.083 --> 00:13:30.708
It's no use... I can't.

00:13:30.708 --> 00:13:33.750
Someone has to be the one to do it.

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:38.333
Someone has to be the one
to stain their hands with blood.

00:13:38.333 --> 00:13:40.208
You guys!

00:13:40.208 --> 00:13:42.833
Get away from there!

00:13:42.833 --> 00:13:44.625
I can't believe him...

00:13:44.625 --> 00:13:48.250
What the hell is that Erwin thinking?

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:51.708
He's leading a horde of Titans this way!

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
"There are some Titans with special powers. It
remains unknown how they possess such abilities."

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.750
You guys! Jump and get outta there!

00:14:16.083 --> 00:14:17.792
All soldiers, disperse!

00:14:17.792 --> 00:14:19.750
Get far away from the Titans!

00:14:40.083 --> 00:14:41.583
Historia!

00:14:50.625 --> 00:14:52.708
What's going on?

00:14:52.708 --> 00:14:54.208
Is this hell?

00:14:55.958 --> 00:14:58.917
No... but it will be!

00:14:58.917 --> 00:15:01.250
All soldiers, charge!

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:07.667
The fate of humanity will be determined
in this very moment!

00:15:07.667 --> 00:15:13.750
There is no future where humanity
can inhabit these lands without Eren!

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:17.583
We recover Eren and immediately retreat!

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:20.792
Give your hearts!

00:15:22.042 --> 00:15:23.250
Mikasa!

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.375
Those crazy Scouts.

00:15:33.375 --> 00:15:36.167
Something's wrong with their heads.

00:15:36.167 --> 00:15:37.000
Hey!

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.208
Huh?

00:15:43.792 --> 00:15:45.875
What's happening out there?

00:15:45.875 --> 00:15:47.750
What the hell's going on?

00:15:51.583 --> 00:15:53.333
I can't move...

00:15:53.333 --> 00:15:57.792
Unless I tear these Titans off me,
it'll only get worse.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:00.458
In that case...

00:16:00.458 --> 00:16:04.333
Brace yourself, Bertholdt!

00:16:04.333 --> 00:16:06.375
A little more...

00:16:06.375 --> 00:16:08.708
Just a little more!

00:16:08.708 --> 00:16:10.167
It worked!

00:16:10.167 --> 00:16:11.750
His hand's gone!

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:12.833
Now's our chance!

00:16:12.833 --> 00:16:16.250
Hey, Mikasa?! Can't you see all those Titans?!

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:20.125
How do you plan on getting through that mess?

00:16:20.125 --> 00:16:22.417
You'd have to slip through a horde of 'em.

00:16:22.417 --> 00:16:24.542
Advance!

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:34.500
Commander Erwin!

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:38.625
Advance!

00:16:38.625 --> 00:16:40.708
Eren is just ahead!

00:16:40.708 --> 00:16:43.167
Advance!

00:16:44.625 --> 00:16:45.792
Right!

00:17:23.125 --> 00:17:25.292
Mikasa!

00:17:25.292 --> 00:17:27.125
You piece of shit!

00:17:27.125 --> 00:17:29.500
Let her go!

00:17:36.458 --> 00:17:38.792
We've come this far already.

00:17:38.792 --> 00:17:40.917
We're taking Eren home with us.

00:17:40.917 --> 00:17:43.125
We're going back to our hometown.

00:17:43.125 --> 00:17:46.333
Shit... This is all because I got caught.

00:17:46.333 --> 00:17:48.792
Everyone's gonna die because of me.

00:17:48.792 --> 00:17:50.208
Bertholdt!

00:17:52.542 --> 00:17:54.042
Armin?!

00:17:56.833 --> 00:17:59.667
Those who can't abandon anything...

00:17:59.667 --> 00:18:02.625
...can't change anything.

00:18:02.625 --> 00:18:05.083
Advance!

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.292
What is it?

00:18:08.292 --> 00:18:10.708
What do I have to abandon?

00:18:10.708 --> 00:18:12.750
Is it my life?

00:18:13.875 --> 00:18:15.792
Or something else?

00:18:34.625 --> 00:18:38.083
Are you two okay with this?

00:18:38.083 --> 00:18:41.917
Leaving behind your comrade
and returning home?

00:18:45.417 --> 00:18:48.042
You're abandoning Annie?

00:18:48.042 --> 00:18:49.708
You know where she's at?

00:18:49.708 --> 00:18:54.875
Far north, deep underground in
the Utopia District... and being tortured.

00:18:56.708 --> 00:18:59.625
It was her screams that taught us something.

00:18:59.625 --> 00:19:05.208
That even with her body's healing,
you can never get rid of the pain.

00:19:06.583 --> 00:19:10.583
They're taking special care
to ensure she doesn't die.

00:19:10.583 --> 00:19:15.917
And as we speak,
they're not giving her body any rest.

00:19:15.917 --> 00:19:20.917
They're torturing her every way they know how.

00:19:20.917 --> 00:19:22.833
You spawn of the devil!

00:19:22.833 --> 00:19:25.000
I'll pulverize you!

00:19:45.083 --> 00:19:47.792
All soldiers, retreat!

00:20:02.333 --> 00:20:04.292
I did it.

00:20:04.292 --> 00:20:06.375
My first kill.

00:20:06.375 --> 00:20:07.292
Ymir...

00:20:07.292 --> 00:20:08.583
Christa!

00:20:11.083 --> 00:20:13.583
What the hell are you doing?! We're leaving!

00:20:13.583 --> 00:20:16.083
Let's hurry home and chow down!

00:20:16.083 --> 00:20:18.667
Conny! Sasha! Leave me be!

00:20:18.667 --> 00:20:19.542
Lemme go!

00:20:19.542 --> 00:20:20.792
Huh?

00:20:20.792 --> 00:20:25.500
Ymir said if I don't go with her,
Reiner and Bertholdt are going to kill her!

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.625
If she hands me in, they'll let her go free!

00:20:28.625 --> 00:20:31.458
We were gonna go with them!

00:20:33.042 --> 00:20:35.417
What the heck? Ymir said that?

00:20:35.417 --> 00:20:37.917
Yes, so let me down!

00:20:37.917 --> 00:20:43.167
It's a lie! Of course that's a lie!
She's lying to you!

00:20:43.167 --> 00:20:45.000
Sasha is right.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.250
You think the one who fought like a maniac
to save you would do something like that?

00:20:53.417 --> 00:20:57.583
The only time Ymir ever shows some effort
is when you're in trouble.

00:20:57.583 --> 00:21:01.042
I don't know about her getting killed, but...

00:21:01.042 --> 00:21:02.958
For now, just calm down.

00:21:02.958 --> 00:21:04.250
That's right!

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:10.042
If you two stay here any longer, there's a huge
chance that you'll die and it'll only get worse!

00:21:11.542 --> 00:21:15.583
You know, even an idiot could figure that out.

00:21:29.583 --> 00:21:31.042
Damn that Reiner!

00:21:31.042 --> 00:21:33.792
He's tossing Titans like a madman!

00:21:45.708 --> 00:21:47.833
Eren! Mikasa!

00:21:52.167 --> 00:21:53.667
Eren...

00:23:58.542 --> 00:24:02.583
Eren encounters the very Titan
that devoured his mother.

00:24:02.583 --> 00:24:07.083
Unable to move his body,
Hannes steps in to protect him.

00:24:07.083 --> 00:24:11.375
What is the enemy? What is the war?

00:24:11.375 --> 00:24:17.667
Not knowing what to brandish
their swords against, the Scouts battle on.

00:24:17.667 --> 00:24:22.750
Where will they ever find
the future that they pursue?

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:27.094
Next episode: "Scream."
