WEBVTT

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.542
It's like the report said...

00:00:23.542 --> 00:00:25.958
The entire village is devastated,

00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:29.292
and yet there's not a drop of blood,
let alone any bodies here.

00:00:29.292 --> 00:00:33.875
Then... the villagers of Ragako
were able to safely evacuate?

00:00:33.875 --> 00:00:40.208
If that's the case, then the Titans were having
a field day in a completely empty village.

00:00:40.208 --> 00:00:42.333
That's hard to believe.

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:49.375
Furthermore... why would they evacuate
without even taking a single horse?

00:00:49.375 --> 00:00:51.083
Then what happened?

00:00:51.083 --> 00:00:53.083
What could this mean?

00:00:53.083 --> 00:00:56.292
Moblit, I found one! This way!

00:00:58.708 --> 00:01:00.500
There you are...

00:01:05.167 --> 00:01:07.708
Moblit, look at this.

00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.792
This is a portrait of Conny Springer's parents?

00:01:12.792 --> 00:01:15.250
It's a strong possibility.

00:01:19.875 --> 00:01:20.875
Kill it!

00:01:20.875 --> 00:01:22.958
Wait! Hold up!

00:01:36.583 --> 00:01:38.667
Unbelievable...

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
"Children"

00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:20.375
Will it be your petty life...
or Christa's future?

00:03:20.375 --> 00:03:22.875
It's up to you to decide.

00:03:22.875 --> 00:03:26.875
Hey, say something! Who's the enemy?!

00:03:26.875 --> 00:03:28.458
Ymir!

00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:33.125
Who knows...

00:03:33.125 --> 00:03:34.583
It's settled then.

00:03:34.583 --> 00:03:36.750
Too bad, Eren.

00:03:46.083 --> 00:03:47.500
You're kidding...

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.458
The Scouts... are already...

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.750
Dammit!

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.500
Reiner. What are you right now?

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.833
Relax, I'm a warrior.

00:03:58.833 --> 00:04:02.167
You're saying to trust Ymir as a warrior?

00:04:02.167 --> 00:04:04.792
Isn't she the one who ate Marcel?

00:04:04.792 --> 00:04:09.125
Yeah, that's my point. Ymir's motive is clear.

00:04:09.125 --> 00:04:11.167
Once she turned human again,

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:15.792
she probably roamed around
and lived only caring about herself.

00:04:15.792 --> 00:04:18.792
Until she met Christa...

00:04:18.792 --> 00:04:24.333
And as cute as Christa is, we have
other reasons to bring her to our side.

00:04:24.333 --> 00:04:28.042
She's an important person
in a family of the Church.

00:04:28.042 --> 00:04:33.333
If Eren turns out not to be the Coordinate,
our job isn't over yet.

00:04:33.333 --> 00:04:38.333
Having Christa with us at that point
will make our search much easier.

00:04:43.583 --> 00:04:45.542
They're close.

00:04:45.542 --> 00:04:47.750
What are they talking about?

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.458
Are they planning to leave before the sun sets?

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:53.958
Let's bring an end to it.

00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:59.667
The next time we come here,
we can take Annie, Christa, and that back home.

00:04:59.667 --> 00:05:02.292
That way we won't have to come here anymore.

00:05:02.292 --> 00:05:06.333
Right. And our mission will be over.

00:05:06.333 --> 00:05:08.167
But as for you...

00:05:08.167 --> 00:05:11.000
When we get to our hometown,
tell Annie how you feel.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Huh? Wh-What do you mean?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.667
You stare too much.
Enough that everyone can tell.

00:05:17.667 --> 00:05:18.625
But I--

00:05:18.625 --> 00:05:22.958
You should go for it.
You're both murderers with short lives ahead.

00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:26.917
Who better to understand what
we've gone through than one of us?

00:05:32.667 --> 00:05:34.292
What's going on, Reiner?

00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:36.042
Aren't we waiting until night?

00:05:36.042 --> 00:05:38.875
Nope. We're leaving now.

00:05:38.875 --> 00:05:42.083
Eren, don't try to resist.

00:05:46.583 --> 00:05:50.292
Come on, don't get violent with me.

00:05:50.292 --> 00:05:55.125
Look at the shape that I'm in.
Does it look like I can resist?

00:05:55.125 --> 00:05:57.500
Please, gimme a break.

00:06:05.625 --> 00:06:10.125
Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:17.958
I'll kill you! I'll slaughter you!

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.750
--I'll kill you!
--Hey. Why are we leaving already?

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:24.750
--Let go!
--Ymir.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:30.083
When you turned back into a human,
do you remember the person you ate?

00:06:32.042 --> 00:06:35.542
No, I don't remember...

00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:40.375
But if it was five years ago...

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.500
Was it one of your comrades?

00:06:50.042 --> 00:06:51.500
I see...

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.125
Sorry... for not even remembering.

00:07:00.083 --> 00:07:03.500
It's not your fault for forgetting.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.792
It was the same for us, too.

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:07.625
I see...

00:07:07.625 --> 00:07:10.292
Eren doesn't seem to remember either.

00:07:10.292 --> 00:07:12.708
Is that how it works?

00:07:15.125 --> 00:07:17.625
Do you resent me for it?

00:07:17.625 --> 00:07:22.667
I'm not sure... I... don't know.

00:07:22.667 --> 00:07:26.250
You probably didn't want
to eat a human either...

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:30.625
How long were you wandering
outside the walls for?

00:07:30.625 --> 00:07:32.958
About 60 years.

00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:37.875
It was like... I was stuck in
a nightmare that would never  end.

00:07:48.708 --> 00:07:50.375
A red smoke signal.

00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.250
What?

00:08:00.083 --> 00:08:02.333
Commander! We're surrounded!

00:08:02.333 --> 00:08:05.333
There's a way around!
Should we head towards it?

00:08:06.833 --> 00:08:10.542
No... Any detours and we'll be too late.

00:08:10.542 --> 00:08:15.042
We'll force our way through!
All soldiers, prepare for battle!

00:08:16.917 --> 00:08:20.083
For now, let's get to a place without Titans!

00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:23.042
We need to get as far away as possible!

00:08:23.042 --> 00:08:25.542
My Titan form isn't very fast.

00:08:25.542 --> 00:08:28.958
If I get surrounded,
I won't be able to protect you guys!

00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:32.917
Then why didn't we just wait until nightfall?!

00:08:32.917 --> 00:08:36.292
Smoke signals?
Did the Scouts come to rescue us?

00:08:36.292 --> 00:08:40.708
Unless they brought loads of horses over the wall,
that scouting formation won't work.

00:08:40.708 --> 00:08:42.500
Someone made that call...

00:08:43.667 --> 00:08:46.250
I didn't think it would happen so soon.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:50.208
It must be Commander Erwin.
A tough opponent!

00:08:51.917 --> 00:08:54.917
Shit... They're already that close?

00:08:54.917 --> 00:08:57.625
It's Eren's fault for going berserk.

00:09:01.375 --> 00:09:03.625
It can't be...

00:09:03.625 --> 00:09:05.083
She's...

00:09:07.625 --> 00:09:09.292
No, she is!

00:09:09.292 --> 00:09:13.250
Reiner! Christa's here!
Christa came with them!

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:13.875
Huh?!

00:09:13.875 --> 00:09:15.333
If you want her, now's the chance!

00:09:15.333 --> 00:09:17.917
How do you know? You can't see her from here!

00:09:17.917 --> 00:09:19.375
I just know it!

00:09:19.375 --> 00:09:25.792
She's such a good-natured person, it's stupid!
I guarantee she came to save me! I know it!

00:09:25.792 --> 00:09:28.917
Even if that's true, it's no use!

00:09:28.917 --> 00:09:30.167
We'll do it later!

00:09:30.167 --> 00:09:31.458
Huh?!

00:09:31.458 --> 00:09:34.417
Our chance of succeeding is way too low!

00:09:34.417 --> 00:09:37.042
How will you get Christa out of that formation?

00:09:37.042 --> 00:09:38.917
Wait for a chance!

00:09:38.917 --> 00:09:41.083
Wait for a chance?

00:09:41.083 --> 00:09:45.375
Seriously? Will that be after
I'm eaten by one of your warriors?

00:09:45.375 --> 00:09:47.250
No! I don't trust you!

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:51.500
Trust me! Christa is indispensable to us, too!

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:55.208
Then get her now!
Go prove it to me this instant!

00:09:55.208 --> 00:09:57.750
It has to be now or never!

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:00.167
I want to see her right now!

00:10:01.625 --> 00:10:06.958
At this rate...
I'll never get a chance... to see her again.

00:10:08.042 --> 00:10:13.042
"It is not known where Ymir's hometown is located.
However, it is most certainly outside of the walls."

00:10:16.208 --> 00:10:17.750
It's impossible.

00:10:19.375 --> 00:10:21.500
I'm sorry, Ymir.

00:10:24.167 --> 00:10:29.000
We don't even know if we can escape ourselves,
let alone go back for her.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.875
I promise you!

00:10:30.875 --> 00:10:35.042
If anyone, it's Christa I want
to save from this conflict!

00:10:35.042 --> 00:10:39.625
You have to trust us! So just bear with it!

00:10:39.625 --> 00:10:43.833
This is for Christa's own sake! Got it, Ymir?!

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:49.458
Is it... really for Christa's sake?

00:10:49.458 --> 00:10:50.875
Yeah!

00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.250
Fine...

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:54.833
Thank you.

00:10:56.542 --> 00:10:59.083
It's happening again, Christa...

00:10:59.083 --> 00:11:01.125
I've come this far...

00:11:01.125 --> 00:11:03.542
...and yet it seems...

00:11:03.542 --> 00:11:07.458
Will I have to lie to myself again?

00:11:07.458 --> 00:11:10.458
Hey... Here's a promising one.

00:11:19.208 --> 00:11:20.750
How's this kid?

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.625
Yeah.

00:11:22.625 --> 00:11:27.375
Hey, you there. You're going to
come live with us from now on.

00:11:27.375 --> 00:11:30.917
You'll be able to live a brand-new life now.

00:11:30.917 --> 00:11:35.833
A brand-new life... needs a brand-new name.

00:11:35.833 --> 00:11:37.292
Understand?

00:11:38.667 --> 00:11:43.042
That day... was the first time I lied to myself.

00:11:43.042 --> 00:11:48.625
From that point on, I convinced myself...
that I never had a choice.

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:50.708
But...

00:11:50.708 --> 00:11:55.167
It is this Lady Ymir who inherits
the blood of the king.

00:11:55.167 --> 00:12:01.042
As long as Lady Ymir is with us,
we will be blessed with immortality.

00:12:01.042 --> 00:12:02.625
Lady Ymir!

00:12:05.583 --> 00:12:09.917
To be honest... it wasn't all that bad.

00:12:11.083 --> 00:12:13.583
My food wasn't cold anymore...

00:12:13.583 --> 00:12:16.833
And neither was my bed off the ground.

00:12:16.833 --> 00:12:18.667
Lady Ymir.

00:12:18.667 --> 00:12:22.917
But more than all... was the feeling
of being needed by someone.

00:12:22.917 --> 00:12:26.667
I served a purpose in someone's life
for the first time ever.

00:12:26.667 --> 00:12:31.042
To me, that was more precious
than anything else.

00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:33.708
But then, one day...

00:12:38.458 --> 00:12:41.875
It's her! She's the one who did it!

00:12:41.875 --> 00:12:47.542
She told us she has the blood of the king!
All we did was believe her!

00:12:47.542 --> 00:12:51.625
I was cruelly reminded
that everything in my life...

00:12:51.625 --> 00:12:53.458
...was a lie.

00:12:54.667 --> 00:12:56.708
Is that right?

00:12:56.708 --> 00:12:59.333
N-N--

00:13:09.667 --> 00:13:11.458
It's true.

00:13:13.208 --> 00:13:17.875
I am Ymir! The blood of the king
runs through me!

00:13:19.208 --> 00:13:22.958
And once again... I told more lies.

00:13:24.042 --> 00:13:27.917
If that's what it took to save everyone else...

00:13:27.917 --> 00:13:29.417
However...

00:13:30.458 --> 00:13:32.667
Things didn't work that way.

00:13:36.917 --> 00:13:38.833
No!

00:13:45.208 --> 00:13:49.000
Stop... Please, stop! I'm begging you!

00:13:55.875 --> 00:13:58.792
That's when I knew...

00:13:58.792 --> 00:14:01.375
This was my punishment.

00:14:02.583 --> 00:14:09.167
It's not that I was being punished
for deceiving all those people.

00:14:09.167 --> 00:14:14.125
It was for convincing myself to believe...
to feel needed by someone.

00:14:14.125 --> 00:14:18.000
It's what I deserved for
continuing to lie to myself.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.208
This was my punishment.

00:14:31.333 --> 00:14:33.708
It's a Titan! Run!

00:15:11.458 --> 00:15:13.750
When I opened my eyes...

00:15:14.792 --> 00:15:19.000
...what I saw was freedom spread out before me.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:25.583
If there was such a thing as fate,
I can only laugh at how fickle it can be.

00:15:26.583 --> 00:15:29.292
And in that moment...

00:15:29.292 --> 00:15:32.417
...I made a promise to myself.

00:15:32.417 --> 00:15:35.917
I was done with telling lies.

00:15:35.917 --> 00:15:39.250
I wasn't going to lie to myself anymore.

00:15:40.583 --> 00:15:43.875
From then on, I'd live honest to myself.

00:15:46.333 --> 00:15:49.250
So? What ever happened with that?

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:54.167
She was given the name Christa Lenz
and sent off to become a cadet.

00:15:54.167 --> 00:15:59.167
What a pity. She would have been
better off not being born.

00:16:01.083 --> 00:16:03.000
Are you talking about me?!

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.167
Come on, now. It makes no difference to me.

00:16:11.333 --> 00:16:12.958
And then...

00:16:14.417 --> 00:16:15.917
Hey, you.

00:16:15.917 --> 00:16:18.542
So you're trying to do something "nice," huh?

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:21.708
Uh...

00:16:21.708 --> 00:16:23.833
And then I met you.

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:30.708
I could tell right away...
that you were the same as me...

00:16:30.708 --> 00:16:33.667
That you fed yourself lies...

00:16:33.667 --> 00:16:35.792
Give your hearts!

00:16:37.125 --> 00:16:39.000
Yes, Sir!

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.542
That you were someone desperately trying
to convince yourself...

00:16:44.542 --> 00:16:48.125
But you know, Christa...

00:16:48.125 --> 00:16:52.500
That's why... I won't ask you to understand.

00:16:53.917 --> 00:16:56.000
Just that...

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.042
...that you give me one last time...

00:16:59.042 --> 00:17:02.625
...to be honest with myself.

00:17:02.625 --> 00:17:04.083
I'm sorry...

00:17:06.042 --> 00:17:09.542
In this environment, I'm the strongest one here.

00:17:13.833 --> 00:17:15.625
Q-Quit it, Ymir!

00:17:15.625 --> 00:17:21.500
Don't you think a forest like this
is where I can shine the most? Well?

00:17:29.125 --> 00:17:31.833
Ymir! Stop! We'll fall!

00:17:31.833 --> 00:17:33.875
Do you think I care?

00:17:33.875 --> 00:17:38.333
If I became a Titan, I might be
powerless compared to you,

00:17:38.333 --> 00:17:41.167
but I can jump through the trees and move swiftly.

00:17:41.167 --> 00:17:46.042
I could snatch Eren away from you
and go back to meet up with the Scouts...

00:17:46.042 --> 00:17:47.958
...and probably succeed.

00:17:50.125 --> 00:17:53.542
If you don't agree to take
Christa with you right now,

00:17:53.542 --> 00:17:56.375
I'll get in your way and fight you right here.

00:17:56.375 --> 00:17:59.625
Wh-What are you saying?!
Don't you care what happens to her?!

00:17:59.625 --> 00:18:01.625
We can't help her that way!

00:18:01.625 --> 00:18:04.292
Yeah, that's fine.

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:10.500
Even if it means taking her future away,
I'll do what it takes to live and meet her.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.958
I might be the shittiest person there ever was.

00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:16.708
You guys don't know what it's like.

00:18:16.708 --> 00:18:22.458
She knows how awful I am,
and yet she still smiles at me... that girl.

00:18:22.458 --> 00:18:23.458
You...

00:18:23.458 --> 00:18:25.583
Don't be mad at me.

00:18:25.583 --> 00:18:27.500
I have a plan for it.

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:32.167
If I stay and fight, it should be easier
for you to escape anyways!

00:18:32.167 --> 00:18:34.958
Or would you rather stay and kill each other?!

00:18:34.958 --> 00:18:37.792
Do you want me to prove how crazy I am?!

00:18:50.458 --> 00:18:51.625
A light?

00:18:51.625 --> 00:18:54.833
Straight ahead in the forest! I saw a light!

00:18:54.833 --> 00:18:57.833
It's the light that appears
when a Titan transforms!

00:18:57.833 --> 00:18:59.292
Then we're just in time.

00:18:59.292 --> 00:19:01.500
Soldiers, disperse!

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:04.042
We believe the enemy has already transformed!

00:19:04.042 --> 00:19:06.625
Locate Eren and recover him!

00:19:16.333 --> 00:19:17.792
Another one of the Police!

00:19:17.792 --> 00:19:19.917
Battle is not our objective!

00:19:19.917 --> 00:19:23.458
Prioritize recovery and retreat!

00:19:23.458 --> 00:19:25.250
Phil! Round up the horses!

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:26.625
Yes, Sir!

00:19:31.042 --> 00:19:34.042
First thing is to find the enemy
and let the others know!

00:19:34.042 --> 00:19:36.208
They should be fleeing from the forest!

00:19:36.208 --> 00:19:38.375
Break!

00:19:38.375 --> 00:19:39.125
Eren.

00:19:39.125 --> 00:19:40.333
Where are you?!

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.542
Is that the scream of a Titan?

00:19:47.542 --> 00:19:49.417
It came from ahead!

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.000
You can't hide from me!

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.458
Wait!

00:19:59.958 --> 00:20:01.292
This is Ymir!

00:20:01.292 --> 00:20:04.875
She's the one they took! In Titan form!

00:20:04.875 --> 00:20:09.333
Hey, Ymir! Why are you the only one here?!

00:20:09.333 --> 00:20:13.583
Where's Eren?!
What about Reiner!? Bertholdt?!

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.500
So that's Ymir?

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.250
Did she turn into a Titan
and fight with Reiner?!

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:21.458
Ymir?

00:20:21.458 --> 00:20:24.792
Did you get away from Reiner?!
Where are they?!

00:20:24.792 --> 00:20:27.833
Tell us anything, Ymir!

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.083
Say something already!

00:20:31.083 --> 00:20:33.625
Hey, ugly! We're in a hurry!

00:20:35.458 --> 00:20:38.083
Is she keeping an eye out for Reiner?

00:20:40.375 --> 00:20:42.458
Something's not right.

00:20:42.458 --> 00:20:46.042
Why... is she looking at everybody one by one?

00:20:46.042 --> 00:20:47.833
Ymir!

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.458
Thank goodness!

00:20:50.458 --> 00:20:52.292
You're all right!

00:20:54.292 --> 00:20:55.375
Huh?

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:00.667
No...

00:21:00.667 --> 00:21:02.042
She...

00:21:02.042 --> 00:21:04.208
She ate Christa!

00:21:07.667 --> 00:21:10.292
Don't just stand there! Chase her!

00:21:14.333 --> 00:21:16.917
She's fast! We're losing her!

00:21:16.917 --> 00:21:18.292
Why would Ymir do that?!

00:21:18.292 --> 00:21:22.625
I can't be the only one who could've guessed
it would turn out this way!

00:21:22.625 --> 00:21:25.292
Yeah! She's clearly hostile to us now!

00:21:25.292 --> 00:21:30.250
Looks like she's cooperating with Reiner!
She lured us right in!

00:21:31.458 --> 00:21:33.208
Here she comes, Reiner.

00:21:33.208 --> 00:21:34.500
Right.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.708
Oh no...

00:22:04.708 --> 00:22:07.750
Eren's being taken away!

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:09.292
Don't stop!

00:22:09.292 --> 00:22:11.333
Get on your horse and chase!

00:22:18.458 --> 00:22:21.500
I'm getting him back no matter what!

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:24.458
Even if it means trading my life for it!

00:23:58.417 --> 00:24:01.500
The battle of pursuit begins.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.458
The hunters and the hunted.

00:24:04.458 --> 00:24:11.000
The intense emotions of friends made foe...
spill and clash on the battlefield.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.625
But soldiers are falling far too quickly.

00:24:14.625 --> 00:24:22.583
In a gamble waging the fate of humanity,
Erwin executes a do-or-die strategy.

00:24:22.583 --> 00:24:27.222
Next episode: "Charge."
