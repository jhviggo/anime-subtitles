WEBVTT

00:00:29.417 --> 00:00:33.667
I'm going to return to the hometown we lost.

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:37.125
That's all I care about now.

00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:41.333
I chose to be a soldier in the hopes
of joining the Military Police

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:44.833
so I could work in the safety of the interior.

00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:47.708
Why do <i>you </i>want to be a soldier?

00:00:49.833 --> 00:00:51.583
I...

00:00:51.583 --> 00:00:54.500
I decided I have to kill them.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.667
I decided I have to slaughter all the Titans...

00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:01.625
...with my own two hands.

00:01:15.792 --> 00:01:21.833
So your encounter with the Titans
<i>didn't </i>break your will?

00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:25.792
You'll be able to do it.

00:01:25.792 --> 00:01:28.875
Eren Jaeger, was it?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.458
You damn traitors!

00:03:24.917 --> 00:03:29.958
"Close Combat"

00:03:37.167 --> 00:03:38.583
Eren!

00:03:46.042 --> 00:03:48.167
If only...

00:03:48.167 --> 00:03:51.792
If only I'd cut off their heads!

00:03:51.792 --> 00:03:54.000
That was the perfect chance!

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.417
I should've been able to do it, so why?!

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.250
That was it. There won't be another chance!

00:04:14.292 --> 00:04:16.375
Everyone, jump away from the wall!

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.250
It got Ymir!

00:04:27.917 --> 00:04:30.042
And somebody else, too!

00:04:33.083 --> 00:04:34.542
He ate 'em!

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.208
Th-This can't be...

00:04:40.417 --> 00:04:42.083
Bertholdt...

00:04:53.417 --> 00:04:56.000
All soldiers, prepare to attack!

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.625
We're taking down the Colossal Titan!

00:04:58.625 --> 00:05:01.333
It's a threat to all of humanity!

00:05:01.333 --> 00:05:03.750
Swarm the huge bastard!

00:05:25.708 --> 00:05:28.458
Just like the reports said, he's slow!

00:05:28.458 --> 00:05:30.500
It might be big, but that's it!

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.542
Compared to the Titans we
normally fight, this'll be easy!

00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:36.042
We've got this!

00:05:36.042 --> 00:05:38.833
Now's our chance! Slice up his neck!

00:05:44.333 --> 00:05:46.042
Too hot!

00:05:46.042 --> 00:05:48.542
Everyone, fall back!

00:05:55.375 --> 00:05:56.375
My hand!

00:05:56.375 --> 00:05:58.792
Water! Bring water!

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.042
He's trying to disappear again?

00:06:02.042 --> 00:06:05.042
No, something is different.

00:06:05.042 --> 00:06:07.208
The last time he vanished instantly,

00:06:07.208 --> 00:06:12.458
but now, he's maintaining his form
and emitting heat like a furnace.

00:06:12.458 --> 00:06:15.333
If he keeps protecting himself with steam...

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.125
We're unable to attack him with ODM gear!

00:06:21.125 --> 00:06:24.125
Wh-What do we do?!

00:06:24.125 --> 00:06:27.542
We can't do anything. We wait.

00:06:27.542 --> 00:06:30.917
Squads three and four,
take position behind the target.

00:06:30.917 --> 00:06:32.292
Rashad has command.

00:06:32.292 --> 00:06:33.542
Got it!

00:06:33.542 --> 00:06:35.458
Squad two will wait here.

00:06:35.458 --> 00:06:37.417
Lauda is in command.

00:06:37.417 --> 00:06:39.333
Understood!

00:06:39.333 --> 00:06:42.958
It's yet to be seen how long
he can keep his body burning, but...

00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.125
...eventually he has to come out.

00:06:45.125 --> 00:06:47.708
We wait for that moment to attack.

00:06:47.708 --> 00:06:49.375
Listen up.

00:06:49.375 --> 00:06:51.708
Forget about capturing them.

00:06:51.708 --> 00:06:52.917
Kill 'em...

00:06:52.917 --> 00:06:54.458
...and don't hesitate!

00:06:57.833 --> 00:07:01.542
Armin... and squad one follow me!

00:07:01.542 --> 00:07:03.792
We've got a date with the Armored Titan!

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:05.625
Hot!

00:07:05.625 --> 00:07:09.583
Christa! Conny! Get further back!

00:07:09.583 --> 00:07:12.250
And take care of those two injured soldiers.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:13.542
U-Um!

00:07:13.542 --> 00:07:15.167
Huh?

00:07:15.167 --> 00:07:18.292
Ymir can't possibly be dead yet.

00:07:18.292 --> 00:07:22.000
Please... Rescue her!

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.417
Right.

00:07:23.417 --> 00:07:27.000
Where are Reiner and Bertholdt?!

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.542
They don't have their ODM gear either!

00:07:30.542 --> 00:07:34.208
Please, go find and help those two!

00:08:03.875 --> 00:08:05.625
You shit...

00:08:05.625 --> 00:08:08.167
You big piece of shit.

00:08:08.167 --> 00:08:11.500
And here you wouldn't shut up
about a soldier's duty...

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:17.500
During close combat training,
were you always holding back on me?

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.875
You're so strong, it's ridiculous.

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:23.958
I can't even move an inch of my body.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:32.083
I always thought you were a stand-up guy.

00:08:32.083 --> 00:08:35.292
Someone who remained calm,
regardless of the situation...

00:08:35.292 --> 00:08:39.875
A guy who put your comrades ahead of yourself...

00:08:39.875 --> 00:08:41.875
And I...

00:08:41.875 --> 00:08:47.500
To think at one time I wished...
to be as strong as you someday.

00:08:53.667 --> 00:08:55.417
That did nothing!

00:08:59.833 --> 00:09:02.333
Eren's attack didn't...

00:09:02.333 --> 00:09:04.625
And my blades don't work either?!

00:09:08.083 --> 00:09:11.667
What's worse, unlike Annie,
his whole body is hard!

00:09:15.667 --> 00:09:17.042
Eren!

00:09:21.917 --> 00:09:25.625
Hey, Reiner...

00:09:25.625 --> 00:09:31.208
I don't know what kind of face
you're making right now, but...

00:09:33.833 --> 00:09:39.000
You guys... You really are
the worst pieces of shit.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.125
I bet in the history of mankind,
nobody's done anything as terrible as you.

00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:55.792
I've gotta erase you.

00:09:55.792 --> 00:10:00.000
You shouldn't be allowed to exist anymore.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.542
What the hell are you thinking?

00:10:02.542 --> 00:10:05.167
I've never felt so revolted before.

00:10:05.167 --> 00:10:10.167
Just remembering you and
your self-righteous face is making me sick.

00:10:11.542 --> 00:10:18.125
It makes me want to vomit.
You... big damn pest!

00:10:19.333 --> 00:10:22.667
It's time to exterminate you!

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
"Martial arts is similarly effective
for Titans as it is for humans."

00:10:43.625 --> 00:10:46.917
Damn, that hurt, Annie!

00:10:46.917 --> 00:10:50.375
Haven't you ever heard the concept
of pulling your punches?

00:10:50.375 --> 00:10:53.250
I did it because you're coming at me full-force.

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:56.917
I've gotta respond with
equal strength of my own.

00:10:56.917 --> 00:10:59.000
And if you're a guy...

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.625
...aren't you... supposed to be gentle
with this delicate body of mine?

00:11:03.625 --> 00:11:07.500
Huh? Your jokes aren't funny at all.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:13.000
If strength is the deciding factor, then why
am I on my ass and you're still standing?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.542
Well...

00:11:17.208 --> 00:11:19.875
I didn't throw you using my strength.

00:11:19.875 --> 00:11:25.417
It's a technique used to protect yourself
against an opponent stronger than you.

00:11:27.292 --> 00:11:30.458
If I were you, I'd think about learning it.

00:11:30.458 --> 00:11:33.750
All right, already! Why don't we take a break?

00:11:45.833 --> 00:11:47.167
Annie!

00:11:47.167 --> 00:11:48.583
Surrender!

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:50.000
I surrender!

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.500
Surrender? Try to learn something first
before you surrender.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:58.500
Learn how to use your strength and
the proper way to speak to women!

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.500
All right! I promise I'll learn,
so let go already!

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:05.167
Yeah? Do you want to learn that badly?

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.750
Why the hell did Reiner come flying this way?

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:18.833
Hey, Annie.

00:12:18.833 --> 00:12:21.417
I wanna learn that move, too.

00:12:22.417 --> 00:12:24.000
Show me.

00:12:28.083 --> 00:12:29.792
I don't know...

00:12:29.792 --> 00:12:35.917
That move is meant to be used against humans,
so I don't think you have any use for it.

00:12:35.917 --> 00:12:40.417
But... I'm interested to see if it works...

00:12:40.417 --> 00:12:42.833
...on a beast like you.

00:12:42.833 --> 00:12:45.750
Are you serious? It's happening...

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:47.542
Hey, hey!

00:12:47.542 --> 00:12:49.083
Are they going at it?

00:12:49.083 --> 00:12:50.417
It's the big showdown!

00:12:50.417 --> 00:12:51.000
--Who'll win?!

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.292
--Annie, you think?
--Who'll win?!

00:12:52.292 --> 00:12:53.917
Huh? Are you stupid?!

00:12:53.917 --> 00:12:56.083
I bet my whole dinner on Mikasa!

00:12:56.083 --> 00:12:58.250
What do you think, Eren?

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.000
I...

00:13:05.917 --> 00:13:07.833
Which one, I wonder?

00:13:14.917 --> 00:13:16.375
Huh?

00:13:16.375 --> 00:13:19.833
How did that turn out in the end?

00:13:19.833 --> 00:13:22.917
No... Why am I remembering it now?

00:13:22.917 --> 00:13:26.667
Is this what they call having
your life flash before your eyes?

00:13:28.292 --> 00:13:31.750
Actually, who gives a shit anymore?

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:37.000
I don't think I've felt...
this awful in my whole life.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.083
Eren!

00:13:38.083 --> 00:13:41.542
Don't do it! You can't win in a slugfest!

00:13:41.542 --> 00:13:43.083
Run this way!

00:13:43.083 --> 00:13:46.042
Eren! Don't try to fight him!

00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:55.792
Eren!

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.042
This is bad!

00:13:58.042 --> 00:13:59.958
Did he lose control?!

00:14:22.458 --> 00:14:24.333
He threw the Armored Titan!

00:14:24.333 --> 00:14:26.917
Wait... Isn't that...

00:14:26.917 --> 00:14:29.583
...the technique Annie used?

00:14:29.583 --> 00:14:35.083
I don't know what the hell you guys are trying
to accomplish by doing all this, but...

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:40.208
Now that I think of it, your plan
has been full of flaws from the start!

00:14:41.125 --> 00:14:43.542
Your biggest mistake was this!

00:14:43.542 --> 00:14:47.375
You should've thought twice
about teaching me how to fight!

00:14:49.958 --> 00:14:52.917
It's working! I've got him now!

00:14:52.917 --> 00:14:54.583
I still have a chance!

00:14:58.958 --> 00:15:00.667
Think again!

00:15:04.208 --> 00:15:05.750
Eren!

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:08.375
You're not getting away from this!

00:15:24.458 --> 00:15:25.625
He did it!

00:15:33.708 --> 00:15:36.125
Eren! Can you hear me?!

00:15:36.125 --> 00:15:39.500
Run away! Get closer to the wall!

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:43.083
Their goal is to kidnap and take you away!

00:15:43.083 --> 00:15:46.458
We've gotta escape and
prevent that from happening!

00:15:47.417 --> 00:15:51.792
But, Armin, Reiner isn't going to
let us do as we please!

00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:00.917
It's dangerous here! Get back, you two!

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:28.417
Huh?

00:16:31.667 --> 00:16:34.542
Nice, Eren! Good call!

00:16:34.542 --> 00:16:36.292
He's back in control again.

00:16:36.292 --> 00:16:39.417
Yeah, but like you were saying,

00:16:39.417 --> 00:16:42.292
it'll be almost impossible to escape Reiner.

00:16:51.208 --> 00:16:52.917
What the hell?

00:16:55.750 --> 00:17:01.458
I knew it... The Colossal Titan.
Why did that bastard show up here?!

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.458
Where's Eren?

00:17:05.458 --> 00:17:07.667
What's the situation?

00:17:07.667 --> 00:17:09.875
Eren and the others are that way!

00:17:15.875 --> 00:17:17.125
Eren?!

00:17:17.125 --> 00:17:20.042
Is that Eren's Titan form?

00:17:20.042 --> 00:17:21.333
Listen up, Eren.

00:17:21.333 --> 00:17:27.542
If you're gonna escape, we've got to find a way
to halt Reiner and buy you some time!

00:17:27.542 --> 00:17:32.917
Can you break his leg with
another one of those joint locks?

00:17:32.917 --> 00:17:35.417
Our blades don't seem to work on him,

00:17:35.417 --> 00:17:39.667
so use your head and figure out
the best course of action!

00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:52.042
Mikasa!

00:17:52.042 --> 00:17:55.125
Use these. It's the rest of my blades.

00:17:55.125 --> 00:17:56.583
I'm counting on you!

00:18:00.417 --> 00:18:04.208
This time, running away is a guaranteed victory.

00:18:04.208 --> 00:18:08.250
It's you guys that are screwed
for revealing what you are.

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:11.167
You're the ones backed into a corner.

00:18:23.333 --> 00:18:24.375
He's fast!

00:18:28.792 --> 00:18:29.833
Shit!

00:18:29.833 --> 00:18:32.000
Leg! His leg!

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:36.875
Don't stay on the ground! Eren!

00:18:36.875 --> 00:18:38.083
Stand up!

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.958
Dammit! His tackle is too much to handle!

00:18:48.167 --> 00:18:51.625
Shit... Since when could he move so quick?

00:18:51.625 --> 00:18:54.542
Are we completely useless here?!

00:18:54.542 --> 00:18:55.750
No...

00:18:55.750 --> 00:19:01.958
If his entire body was hard like stone,
there's no way he could move like that.

00:19:01.958 --> 00:19:04.792
In the armor they used in wars of the past,

00:19:04.792 --> 00:19:09.500
it had sections at the joints not covered
in metal to allow for movement.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.000
Like at the armpits and groin...

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.417
And also... the spot behind the knee.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:19.750
I can't evade it...

00:19:20.875 --> 00:19:24.250
Since I'll get knocked over anyways...

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:25.667
Bring it!

00:19:26.667 --> 00:19:29.125
Gimme that neck!

00:19:29.125 --> 00:19:32.125
You're mine!

00:19:36.292 --> 00:19:39.000
Yeah! That's it, Eren!

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.542
I've got 'em! Now it's a battle of strength!

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:45.958
This freak...

00:19:47.083 --> 00:19:48.333
Not enough!

00:19:57.792 --> 00:19:59.125
Mikasa!

00:20:00.125 --> 00:20:01.375
She cut him!

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.667
He can't fight back as much anymore!

00:20:18.583 --> 00:20:20.000
You've got this!

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.083
Go for it, Eren!

00:20:22.083 --> 00:20:24.417
Tear the head off his neck!

00:20:24.417 --> 00:20:27.208
Pull the traitor outta there!

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.125
I can win!

00:20:31.125 --> 00:20:34.583
Against Reiner... I can win!

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.708
Wh-What the--?

00:20:48.708 --> 00:20:50.458
Heh, it's useless.

00:20:50.458 --> 00:20:52.958
Keep at it! Don't let up!

00:21:02.667 --> 00:21:04.125
He stopped...

00:21:06.042 --> 00:21:07.792
But why there?

00:21:23.417 --> 00:21:25.167
Be on your guard!

00:21:25.167 --> 00:21:27.083
He's calling in Titans!

00:21:34.958 --> 00:21:37.542
No other Titans spotted in the area!

00:21:37.542 --> 00:21:39.375
What a useless struggle.

00:21:39.375 --> 00:21:42.167
Try screaming for help with
your head ripped off, you idiot!

00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:44.125
Look, he's tearing it off!

00:21:45.208 --> 00:21:47.500
What's with the Armored Titan?

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.083
Why'd he scream like that?

00:21:58.792 --> 00:22:00.458
Hey...

00:22:00.458 --> 00:22:02.833
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:22:15.292 --> 00:22:18.708
Above you! Look out!

00:23:58.458 --> 00:24:03.042
The battle between Eren and the Armored Titan
comes to an abrupt conclusion.

00:24:03.042 --> 00:24:04.917
With its fall from the wall,

00:24:04.917 --> 00:24:11.125
Mikasa is injured by the Colossal Titan
and Hannes comes running to her side.

00:24:11.125 --> 00:24:17.375
To protect Eren through his reckless behavior...
to stand proudly at his side...

00:24:17.375 --> 00:24:22.750
...that is, and has always been,
the wish of Mikasa and Armin.

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:27.136
Next episode: "The Hunters."
