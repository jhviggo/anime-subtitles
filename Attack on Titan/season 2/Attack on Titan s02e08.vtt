WEBVTT

00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:23.542
I can win!

00:00:23.542 --> 00:00:26.792
Against Reiner, I can win!

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.042
Hey...

00:00:34.042 --> 00:00:35.958
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:00:35.958 --> 00:00:39.417
Above you! Look out!

00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:02.292
Eren!

00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:39.958
"The Hunters"

00:03:49.375 --> 00:03:53.042
"Trost District"

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.917
Commander.

00:04:03.875 --> 00:04:07.542
Wake up, Commander Pyxis.

00:04:07.542 --> 00:04:10.083
You'll get sick if you fall asleep here.

00:04:11.083 --> 00:04:13.875
I can't believe you drank all this.

00:04:13.875 --> 00:04:16.208
You're not young anymore.

00:04:16.208 --> 00:04:20.167
And I'd rather not spend my days
changing your diapers.

00:04:20.167 --> 00:04:24.208
Being cared for by a pretty lady
sounds all right to me.

00:04:24.208 --> 00:04:26.333
So? What's the situation?

00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:33.750
Patrols were sent out once the Titans were
gone from the 1st and 2nd defensive lines,

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.958
but any Titan sightings are few and far between.

00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:38.458
Hmm...

00:04:38.458 --> 00:04:42.583
If Hannes and the advance squad
followed the wall without problem,

00:04:42.583 --> 00:04:46.292
they'll be returning any minute now.

00:04:46.292 --> 00:04:54.208
It would mean they met the unit from
Krolva District and turned around halfway.

00:04:54.208 --> 00:04:58.458
And they couldn't have encountered
many Titans, if any.

00:04:58.458 --> 00:05:03.500
If there was a hole in the wall,
it would never work out like that.

00:05:06.583 --> 00:05:07.833
Commander Pyxis.

00:05:07.833 --> 00:05:09.667
Hmm?

00:05:09.667 --> 00:05:12.000
Oh. If it isn't Erwin.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.625
I hear you've captured
one of those troublesome mice.

00:05:16.625 --> 00:05:17.792
Yes.

00:05:17.792 --> 00:05:21.083
Unfortunately, we were one step behind.

00:05:21.083 --> 00:05:22.708
Hmm...

00:05:22.708 --> 00:05:26.583
But at least it will get those goons
in the interior thinking.

00:05:26.583 --> 00:05:32.208
Maybe they'll reconsider how important
their stale beliefs and motives are to them.

00:05:32.208 --> 00:05:35.125
Yes, it appears they have.

00:05:35.125 --> 00:05:36.875
Look over there.

00:05:36.875 --> 00:05:43.083
The Military Police have finally been
forced into an area with Titans.

00:05:44.375 --> 00:05:47.750
Can't believe we didn't see any Titans.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.583
Was there really none at all?

00:05:49.583 --> 00:05:53.333
Seems so. It's unusually quiet out there.

00:05:56.583 --> 00:05:58.917
I wonder if they're still alive...

00:05:58.917 --> 00:06:02.042
Can you believe it?
I thought this was an emergency.

00:06:02.042 --> 00:06:05.417
Yeah. And everyone's just sitting around here.

00:06:05.417 --> 00:06:09.125
Hey, Levi. Where you hiding the Titans at?

00:06:10.083 --> 00:06:14.917
Oh? You all seem so disappointed.

00:06:14.917 --> 00:06:19.042
Sorry... A shame you couldn't fight Titans today.

00:06:19.042 --> 00:06:25.708
If you're looking for another chance,
there's plenty of expeditions outside the walls.

00:06:25.708 --> 00:06:30.000
How about we join forces
and face some Titans together?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.500
Uh, well you know...

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.958
We're busy with work on the interior...

00:06:34.958 --> 00:06:37.458
The advance squad's returned!

00:06:37.458 --> 00:06:39.500
Inform Commander Pyxis!

00:06:42.875 --> 00:06:44.417
I see...

00:06:44.417 --> 00:06:47.625
So there was nothing wrong with the wall?

00:06:47.625 --> 00:06:48.833
Yes, sir!

00:06:49.958 --> 00:06:51.625
As I suspected...

00:06:54.125 --> 00:06:57.875
H-However, there's a bit of a situation!

00:06:57.875 --> 00:07:00.792
We were heading back to Trost to give our report

00:07:00.792 --> 00:07:04.000
when we ran into the Scout unit
led by Section Commander Hange.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Along with them, there were recruits
from the 104th without their equipment.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.833
And it turns out, three of them...

00:07:11.833 --> 00:07:13.542
...were Titans!

00:07:15.292 --> 00:07:17.458
What are you talking about?

00:07:17.458 --> 00:07:20.208
Are you saying there were more?!

00:07:20.208 --> 00:07:22.417
Th-Three more of them?!

00:07:22.417 --> 00:07:23.708
Who was it?!

00:07:23.708 --> 00:07:25.750
U-Uh, well...

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.500
Jean, relax.

00:07:28.375 --> 00:07:31.042
What happened when their forms were revealed?

00:07:31.042 --> 00:07:36.333
The Scouts engaged the Colossal
and Armored Titan in battle.

00:07:36.333 --> 00:07:40.333
But by the time we joined up with them to fight...

00:07:40.333 --> 00:07:42.000
...it was all over.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:04.208
Unbelievable. What a disaster.

00:08:04.208 --> 00:08:07.875
Luckily we were above so we got away unscathed.

00:08:07.875 --> 00:08:13.083
Everyone underneath got blasted by steam
and wind. There's nothing they could do.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.708
How's Mikasa doing?

00:08:17.708 --> 00:08:22.667
I don't see any bad wounds,
so I'm guessing it's a concussion.

00:08:22.667 --> 00:08:24.333
I see...

00:08:25.875 --> 00:08:29.083
Armin... You haven't eaten, have you?

00:08:29.083 --> 00:08:30.833
I'll get you something.

00:08:34.083 --> 00:08:35.958
You've gotta eat.

00:08:40.917 --> 00:08:45.917
"Field Rations" "An extremely nutritious ration
utilized by the Scout Regiment."

00:08:54.542 --> 00:08:55.833
Mikasa!

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.083
Mikasa! It's Eren!

00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:04.625
What happened to Eren?!

00:09:04.625 --> 00:09:06.542
It's those three bullies again.

00:09:06.542 --> 00:09:08.792
They took some bread I bought from me.

00:09:08.792 --> 00:09:12.125
So he went on his own to get--

00:09:12.125 --> 00:09:13.583
I tried to stop him!

00:09:15.625 --> 00:09:18.042
Wait!

00:09:18.042 --> 00:09:19.875
Give it back!

00:09:19.875 --> 00:09:24.292
I thought I told you already.
There's none left 'cause I ate it.

00:09:24.292 --> 00:09:25.083
Got it?

00:09:25.083 --> 00:09:27.833
That was three days' worth
of food for his family!

00:09:27.833 --> 00:09:31.375
You gotta be kidding me. Those table scraps?

00:09:31.375 --> 00:09:34.042
Quit it, man. I feel bad now.

00:09:34.042 --> 00:09:36.750
If you're fine with vomit, I'll give it back.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.167
Pay him back for what you took!

00:09:48.292 --> 00:09:49.958
Hey! Knock it off!

00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:50.875
Hey!

00:09:50.875 --> 00:09:53.375
You drunk, good-for-nothing soldiers!

00:09:53.375 --> 00:09:54.833
Come and break up this fight!

00:09:54.833 --> 00:09:56.917
Put a sock in it.

00:09:56.917 --> 00:09:59.583
Can't you see the kids are just fooling around?

00:09:59.583 --> 00:10:02.750
Like hell they're fooling around!
Come and stop 'em!

00:10:04.542 --> 00:10:07.000
It'll be fine, I'm telling ya.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.625
Someone will be along
who can help more than we can.

00:10:10.625 --> 00:10:11.958
Huh?!

00:10:14.208 --> 00:10:16.167
Eren!

00:10:16.167 --> 00:10:17.625
Eat this!

00:10:26.958 --> 00:10:28.208
It's Mikasa!

00:10:29.292 --> 00:10:32.167
Mikasa! Why are you here?!

00:10:32.167 --> 00:10:36.958
Eren, if you don't get home and chop wood,
your mother will get angry again.

00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:40.000
You little... Don't underestimate me!

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.583
You asked for it!

00:10:42.583 --> 00:10:43.708
Eren!

00:10:43.708 --> 00:10:44.958
Let Mikasa handle this!

00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.583
Yeah, right!

00:10:49.708 --> 00:10:51.042
Nice one, Eren!

00:10:51.042 --> 00:10:53.292
Don't lose to Mikasa!

00:10:55.292 --> 00:10:56.500
The hell you doing?!

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:59.708
I told you to stop the fight,
you damn freeloaders!

00:10:59.708 --> 00:11:01.625
What was that?!

00:11:01.625 --> 00:11:03.292
Wanna say that again?!

00:11:03.292 --> 00:11:06.583
Damn straight I will! You're a waste of taxes!

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:07.667
You son of a--!

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:11.458
Don't let it get to you.
It's the truth whether you like it or--

00:11:13.625 --> 00:11:14.708
Heh.

00:11:16.625 --> 00:11:21.083
That was a pretty good punch
for a chump who runs a stall.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:33.458
Get 'em! Knock his lights out, Hannes!

00:11:33.458 --> 00:11:36.917
You've got this!
Don't let that useless turd beat you!

00:11:36.917 --> 00:11:40.542
Hey, you idiots! What the hell are you doing?!

00:11:40.542 --> 00:11:41.250
--Cut it out!

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:42.875
--Give it back!
--Cut it out!

00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:50.042
Damn it!

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.708
Knock it off!

00:11:55.708 --> 00:12:00.875
Hey! This is turning pretty serious, you guys!

00:12:00.875 --> 00:12:02.458
Forget it! Let's scram!

00:12:02.458 --> 00:12:03.917
Wait right there!

00:12:05.875 --> 00:12:06.750
Wait!

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:09.917
Eren! I don't care about the bread anymore!

00:12:09.917 --> 00:12:11.167
Thanks for trying!

00:12:11.167 --> 00:12:13.792
Eren. We should get back home, too.

00:12:13.792 --> 00:12:15.333
Go home without me!

00:12:15.333 --> 00:12:16.167
Eren!

00:12:16.167 --> 00:12:18.125
Stop right there!

00:12:18.125 --> 00:12:20.500
Eren! Wait!

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.000
Eren!

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.708
Mikasa?

00:12:48.708 --> 00:12:50.542
Armin! Where's Eren?!

00:12:50.542 --> 00:12:52.750
Mikasa, calm down!

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:54.000
You shouldn't be moving!

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.625
We don't know how badly you're injured!

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:07.917
Where is he?!

00:13:09.125 --> 00:13:11.500
Eren was taken away.

00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:16.250
Ymir, too, by Bertholdt and Reiner.

00:13:19.708 --> 00:13:21.917
Eren, he...

00:13:21.917 --> 00:13:24.583
...he lost to the Armored Titan.

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:28.708
It's been five hours since then.

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:32.375
Is anyone...

00:13:32.375 --> 00:13:34.667
Is anyone chasing them?

00:13:38.792 --> 00:13:39.750
No...

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:41.083
Why not?!

00:13:43.667 --> 00:13:47.250
All the horses are on the other side of the wall.

00:13:50.208 --> 00:13:56.250
In order to rescue Eren, we have to wait
for lifts to come so we can move the horses.

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:59.417
There's nothing we can do.

00:13:59.417 --> 00:14:03.833
Section Commander Hange and
the other officers are too injured to move.

00:14:03.833 --> 00:14:09.625
To even send out a small scouting party,
we're going to need more soldiers than this.

00:14:09.625 --> 00:14:12.417
Soldiers with experience.

00:14:12.417 --> 00:14:13.875
Understand?

00:14:21.917 --> 00:14:23.750
Not this again...

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:25.958
Does it hurt somewhere?

00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:27.458
No...

00:14:27.458 --> 00:14:31.708
I must've hit my head pretty hard, but I'm fine.

00:14:31.708 --> 00:14:33.792
But...

00:14:33.792 --> 00:14:37.000
When Eren was taken away by Annie...

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.375
...I chased them right away.

00:14:39.375 --> 00:14:44.125
And fighting alongside
Captain Levi, in the end...

00:14:44.125 --> 00:14:47.250
...in the end, we were able to get him back.

00:14:51.125 --> 00:14:55.083
But... if it's already been five hours...

00:15:06.833 --> 00:15:10.208
Hey, Armin.

00:15:10.208 --> 00:15:12.042
Why?

00:15:12.042 --> 00:15:16.500
Why does Eren always go
somewhere far away from us?

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.708
Yeah, now that you mention it...

00:15:20.708 --> 00:15:26.875
Eren has always run off on his own,
leaving us behind...

00:15:27.875 --> 00:15:34.167
I guess that's just the way things
are meant to happen... for Eren at least.

00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:45.333
But all I want... is to be at his side.

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.583
That's all I ask for...

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.917
Mikasa? So you're up, huh?

00:16:07.917 --> 00:16:10.917
I bet you're hungry. Here, eat this.

00:16:12.292 --> 00:16:13.875
Armin, catch.

00:16:15.833 --> 00:16:19.917
As usual, field rations are all there is.

00:16:23.875 --> 00:16:25.208
Hmm...

00:16:25.208 --> 00:16:29.458
Taste neither good nor bad. Same as always.

00:16:34.583 --> 00:16:37.625
Speaking of which,
this is the same as always, too.

00:16:37.625 --> 00:16:43.958
Ever since the good old days, you two have
been there to clean up the mess of that brat.

00:16:43.958 --> 00:16:48.083
That's what I call a lousy relationship. Sheesh.

00:16:48.083 --> 00:16:55.292
It's a different time and a different place, but you
kids are doing the same thing you always have.

00:16:55.292 --> 00:16:56.708
Am I right?

00:16:58.208 --> 00:17:03.667
The neighborhood bullies and Titans
are a little bit different in size.

00:17:03.667 --> 00:17:09.125
True... The thing is, that brat isn't
even all that good at fighting.

00:17:09.125 --> 00:17:14.250
But no matter if he's up against three or five,
he'll charge in all the same.

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:19.333
By the time Mikasa or soldiers showed up,
he'd been beaten into a pulp every time.

00:17:20.625 --> 00:17:22.083
But you know...

00:17:23.542 --> 00:17:30.208
I've never seen him win a fight before, but I've
never seen him get beat and give up either.

00:17:33.083 --> 00:17:38.417
Sometimes he's so tenacious
that even I think it's scary.

00:17:38.417 --> 00:17:42.042
No matter how many times
he's knocked over, he gets back up.

00:17:42.042 --> 00:17:43.708
That's the kinda guy he is.

00:17:43.708 --> 00:17:47.792
You think he'll get taken away
without putting up a fight?

00:17:47.792 --> 00:17:51.833
Nope. He'll keep resisting
as long as he has strength.

00:17:51.833 --> 00:17:55.042
Even more so when he's up against just two.

00:17:55.042 --> 00:17:58.458
He'll give 'em hell no matter who he's up against.

00:17:58.458 --> 00:18:01.167
Until you or I show up to help.

00:18:01.167 --> 00:18:03.667
That's how Eren's always been.

00:18:10.833 --> 00:18:14.708
I loved those good old days.

00:18:14.708 --> 00:18:21.458
If you ask Eren, he'd say those days
were nothing more than a false peace.

00:18:21.458 --> 00:18:27.000
But for me, I'm more than happy
to be a drunk, useless soldier.

00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:31.875
If it means getting back to
those plain, ordinary days...

00:18:31.875 --> 00:18:34.917
...I'll do whatever I have to.

00:18:34.917 --> 00:18:37.708
No matter how long it takes to get there.

00:18:38.958 --> 00:18:41.000
I'm coming, too.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.583
Without you three together again,
I can't bring back the good old days.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.958
They're here!

00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:19.250
Hey!

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:20.792
Isn't that...?

00:19:22.917 --> 00:19:24.583
Commander Erwin!

00:19:24.583 --> 00:19:26.250
And the Military Police!

00:19:28.667 --> 00:19:31.667
I never thought they'd ride along the wall.

00:19:31.667 --> 00:19:33.917
That's probably the quickest route.

00:19:35.417 --> 00:19:37.583
Christa...

00:19:37.583 --> 00:19:40.833
I'd prefer if you stayed back, but...

00:19:40.833 --> 00:19:43.750
No matter what you say, I won't.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:47.833
I refuse to wait here when Ymir was taken away.

00:19:47.833 --> 00:19:50.292
You two should know how I feel.

00:19:50.292 --> 00:19:53.583
Christa has a point, Armin.

00:19:53.583 --> 00:19:57.792
We have plenty of reasons
for chasing after them.

00:19:57.792 --> 00:20:00.917
One of which I still can't believe...

00:20:00.917 --> 00:20:04.708
That Reiner and Bertholdt are our enemies.

00:20:04.708 --> 00:20:07.750
I've gotta hear it straight from their mouths.

00:20:11.667 --> 00:20:14.917
You made it, Commander Erwin!

00:20:14.917 --> 00:20:16.583
Is the situation the same?

00:20:16.583 --> 00:20:17.417
Yes, sir!

00:20:17.417 --> 00:20:18.667
Good.

00:20:18.667 --> 00:20:20.417
Deploy the lifts!

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:23.375
Hange?!

00:20:23.375 --> 00:20:24.833
Moblit...

00:20:24.833 --> 00:20:27.000
G-Gimme a map.

00:20:31.542 --> 00:20:35.375
It might be a long shot,
but there's a giant forest here.

00:20:35.375 --> 00:20:37.625
We should head straight for it.

00:20:37.625 --> 00:20:42.708
Though, it's not like they have a way
to hide the Armored Titan's footsteps, but...

00:20:42.708 --> 00:20:46.042
...I think that's where they're headed.

00:20:46.042 --> 00:20:47.708
Why's that?

00:20:47.708 --> 00:20:51.625
It's a gamble, but even if they have
the strength to change into Titans,

00:20:51.625 --> 00:20:55.917
the other Titans outside
the wall might still be a threat.

00:20:55.917 --> 00:20:58.458
Especially after all that fighting.

00:20:58.458 --> 00:21:03.583
They might not be as bad off as Eren,
but I'm sure they're exhausted.

00:21:03.583 --> 00:21:06.417
Like how Annie was out cold for a while.

00:21:06.417 --> 00:21:11.375
Let's assume for now that their destination
is somewhere outside of Wall Maria.

00:21:11.375 --> 00:21:14.167
Considering the distance they'll have to cover,

00:21:14.167 --> 00:21:18.083
we can assume they'll need
to recover their stamina.

00:21:18.083 --> 00:21:23.875
Which means... they'll want to rest somewhere
where Titans are unable to reach them.

00:21:23.875 --> 00:21:26.750
At least until nightfall when Titans can't move.

00:21:51.625 --> 00:21:53.292
Oh, Eren...

00:21:59.083 --> 00:22:00.625
You're awake?

00:22:05.167 --> 00:22:06.667
We have until night!

00:22:09.917 --> 00:22:15.542
If we reach the forest before nightfall,
we still might make it in time!

00:22:15.542 --> 00:22:17.083
Let's move!

00:23:58.542 --> 00:24:01.917
Eren wakes up within the giant forest.

00:24:01.917 --> 00:24:08.458
Desperate to escape, Eren attempts to
transform once again, but is stopped by Ymir.

00:24:08.458 --> 00:24:15.583
Deep in the isolated forest, the emotions
of Eren and Reiner violently clash.

00:24:15.583 --> 00:24:18.667
They must settle things once and for all.

00:24:18.667 --> 00:24:22.458
Not only for themselves,
but for all those who've died.

00:24:22.458 --> 00:24:27.030
Next episode: "Opening."
