WEBVTT

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.208
The walls gave the people
a century of peace and security.

00:00:39.042 --> 00:00:44.167
The terror of being at their mercy
and the humiliation of being trapped

00:00:44.167 --> 00:00:46.792
became a distant memory.

00:00:49.417 --> 00:00:50.625
Until...

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.792
The battle for humanity's survival

00:01:08.792 --> 00:01:11.958
began the moment the Titans breached the wall.

00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:21.792
After innumerable casualties
among soldiers and civilians alike,

00:01:21.792 --> 00:01:27.208
it was learned that some Titans
were hiding among the humans.

00:01:27.208 --> 00:01:34.458
Finally, five years after the first wall fell,

00:01:34.458 --> 00:01:39.083
humans succeeded in capturing one of
these disguised Titans: Annie Leonhart.

00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:49.417
Nevertheless...

00:01:51.417 --> 00:01:57.958
...the next threat to humanity
was already close at hand.

00:02:11.583 --> 00:02:12.292
Hey!

00:02:12.292 --> 00:02:13.458
Look!

00:02:19.833 --> 00:02:21.167
A Titan?!

00:02:21.167 --> 00:02:23.458
In the wall?!

00:02:23.458 --> 00:02:24.833
It can't be!

00:02:27.792 --> 00:02:29.708
Your orders, Section Commander?

00:02:29.708 --> 00:02:33.875
Huh? What? Hold on!

00:02:33.875 --> 00:02:37.417
Was that there just by coincidence?

00:02:37.417 --> 00:02:41.167
Or does this mean...?

00:02:46.083 --> 00:02:47.792
Pastor Nick?

00:02:47.792 --> 00:02:49.792
Whatever you do...

00:02:50.792 --> 00:02:54.958
...you <i>must </i>keep that Titan out of the sunlight!

00:02:56.542 --> 00:02:57.792
Huh?

00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:33.958
"Beast Titan"

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:40.292
For now, we've covered
the Wall Titan with sheets.

00:04:40.292 --> 00:04:43.500
We'll take more proper measures after sunset.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.125
I see.

00:04:45.125 --> 00:04:48.708
What are we supposed to make of this, Sir?

00:04:48.708 --> 00:04:51.542
I never imagined there were
Titans in the walls...

00:04:51.542 --> 00:04:54.750
No one did.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.667
There were only people who knew,
and people who didn't.

00:05:01.333 --> 00:05:03.375
What's the deal?!

00:05:03.375 --> 00:05:08.583
We just fought a Titan here.
Why are they keeping us in the dark?

00:05:08.583 --> 00:05:10.625
Business as usual.

00:05:10.625 --> 00:05:14.083
But what's scummiest of all...

00:05:14.083 --> 00:05:19.792
...is that there's no "official" reason
why all these people died.

00:05:22.583 --> 00:05:24.625
Now then,

00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:27.458
it's time for you to talk.

00:05:28.917 --> 00:05:32.917
What is this Titan?

00:05:32.917 --> 00:05:36.708
What is it doing inside the wall?

00:05:38.417 --> 00:05:44.833
And... why did you people
keep this a secret all this time?

00:05:50.167 --> 00:05:52.042
I have work to do!

00:05:52.042 --> 00:05:54.875
My church and followers have been devastated!

00:05:54.875 --> 00:05:58.958
This is your fault! I <i>will </i>demand restitution!

00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.917
Now let me back down!

00:06:01.917 --> 00:06:03.542
Certainly.

00:06:04.833 --> 00:06:06.958
Will straight down do?

00:06:09.583 --> 00:06:10.333
Section Commander!

00:06:10.333 --> 00:06:12.042
Stay back.

00:06:12.042 --> 00:06:14.167
Enough of this!

00:06:14.167 --> 00:06:19.917
Do you people know why we Scouts
have shed so much blood?!

00:06:19.917 --> 00:06:25.167
To take back our freedom from the Titans!

00:06:25.167 --> 00:06:30.167
I was willing to sacrifice
my own life for that cause!

00:06:30.167 --> 00:06:35.750
I'm not asking you to talk,
I'm ordering you. Is that clear?

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.958
And if you won't talk, I'll try the next person.

00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:44.500
<i>Your </i>measly life wouldn't
make up for much, anyway!

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.250
Let... go of me!

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.792
Like this? Right now?

00:06:49.792 --> 00:06:51.125
Yes!

00:06:51.125 --> 00:06:53.292
Fine, then. Die.

00:06:53.292 --> 00:06:54.583
Section Commander!

00:06:54.583 --> 00:06:57.958
Kill me and learn!

00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:02.250
We <i>will </i>fulfill our duty, without fail!

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.833
So...

00:07:03.833 --> 00:07:09.292
...let go of me this instant!

00:07:13.083 --> 00:07:16.875
Deliver me... O Lord...

00:07:26.708 --> 00:07:28.875
Just kidding. I wasn't serious.

00:07:30.875 --> 00:07:34.000
Tell me, Pastor Nick...

00:07:35.458 --> 00:07:38.542
Are <i>all </i>the walls made of Titans?

00:07:41.333 --> 00:07:43.083
Section Commander...

00:07:43.083 --> 00:07:47.875
Whew, I forgot how this feels.

00:07:47.875 --> 00:07:53.833
I haven't felt this way since
my first time outside the walls.

00:07:56.542 --> 00:07:58.625
Talk about terrifying...

00:08:05.792 --> 00:08:08.625
Hurry! Inform Commander Erwin!

00:08:08.625 --> 00:08:10.125
Hurry!

00:08:10.125 --> 00:08:13.167
There are Titans inside Wall Rose!

00:08:25.958 --> 00:08:28.625
"12 hours earlier"

00:08:30.125 --> 00:08:33.417
"South of Wall Sina"

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.167
My village isn't far south of here, you know...

00:08:41.167 --> 00:08:44.167
My hometown is close by, too...

00:08:44.167 --> 00:08:48.458
Damn. Why can't I go visit?

00:08:49.542 --> 00:08:51.917
Maybe I'll sneak out at night.

00:08:51.917 --> 00:08:57.875
They told me not to come back until I'm normal.

00:08:57.875 --> 00:09:02.667
They told <i>me </i>I was too puny to be a soldier.

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:07.875
Was <i>genius </i>enough to be one, though.
I was in our class' top ten.

00:09:07.875 --> 00:09:11.167
I'm gonna go make 'em eat their words.

00:09:11.167 --> 00:09:15.042
Conny. If you're serious, I'll help.

00:09:15.042 --> 00:09:17.542
What? How come?

00:09:17.542 --> 00:09:19.875
Doesn't it seem strange?

00:09:19.875 --> 00:09:22.000
We're on standby in our plain clothes,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.625
and we're not allowed to train
or wear our uniforms.

00:09:26.792 --> 00:09:28.500
Even more suspicious...

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.958
...is that everyone else is fully armed.

00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:34.667
We're inside the wall, not on the front line.

00:09:34.667 --> 00:09:36.667
Who are we fighting?

00:09:36.667 --> 00:09:40.792
Well, there <i>are </i>bears in the area.

00:09:40.792 --> 00:09:42.792
Yeah. Bears.

00:09:42.792 --> 00:09:45.333
Guns are enough to handle bears.

00:09:56.417 --> 00:09:59.375
I hear thuds! They sound like footsteps!

00:09:59.375 --> 00:10:00.458
Huh?

00:10:00.458 --> 00:10:02.583
Get serious, Sasha.

00:10:02.583 --> 00:10:06.042
If you're suggesting there are Titans here...

00:10:06.042 --> 00:10:09.750
...that'd mean Wall Rose has fallen.

00:10:12.333 --> 00:10:14.125
Miche?

00:10:14.125 --> 00:10:17.958
Tomas! Take three couriers and go!

00:10:17.958 --> 00:10:19.000
Huh?

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.750
Notify each district!

00:10:22.167 --> 00:10:26.708
There are likely no Titans among
the 104th Cadet Corps recruits!

00:10:28.458 --> 00:10:31.750
Multiple Titans from the south!

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:35.250
Wall Rose has been breached!

00:10:36.542 --> 00:10:39.583
It's the truth! I really hear footsteps!

00:10:41.375 --> 00:10:43.083
Everyone here?

00:10:43.083 --> 00:10:44.750
Nanaba?

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:48.167
Multiple Titans, 500 meters to the south.

00:10:48.167 --> 00:10:50.583
They're coming right this way.

00:10:50.583 --> 00:10:53.042
There's no time for you to gear up.

00:10:53.042 --> 00:10:58.083
Take your horses and evacuate
all nearby homes and settlements.

00:10:58.083 --> 00:10:59.500
Understood?

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.042
From... the south?

00:11:03.167 --> 00:11:05.792
<i>Has </i>the wall been breached?!

00:11:07.417 --> 00:11:11.750
Get going! Lunch will have to wait, I'm afraid!

00:11:16.875 --> 00:11:18.000
Miche.

00:11:20.083 --> 00:11:23.833
There are nine in that swarm up ahead.

00:11:27.333 --> 00:11:30.208
They've broken through Wall Rose.

00:11:33.917 --> 00:11:40.042
We never managed to uncover the Titans' secrets
or figure out what they are.

00:11:40.042 --> 00:11:42.000
And now the day has come.

00:11:43.542 --> 00:11:46.417
Humanity...

00:11:46.417 --> 00:11:47.750
...has lost.

00:11:49.833 --> 00:11:52.458
No. Not yet.

00:11:54.375 --> 00:11:59.375
Only when a person stops fighting do they lose.

00:12:00.792 --> 00:12:04.875
As long as we continue to fight,
we are not beaten!

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.417
As soon as the Titans reach the woods,

00:12:13.417 --> 00:12:18.583
we'll split into four teams
of recruits and soldiers alike,

00:12:18.583 --> 00:12:23.292
and then simultaneously scatter
in each direction!

00:12:23.292 --> 00:12:27.583
Avoid combat when possible
and focus on getting the word out!

00:12:27.583 --> 00:12:30.208
Is anyone familiar with this region?!

00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:31.708
M-Me!

00:12:31.708 --> 00:12:33.833
My town's north of here!

00:12:33.833 --> 00:12:36.750
I know the lay of the land well!

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:39.042
And... so does Conny!

00:12:40.292 --> 00:12:41.667
Conny?!

00:12:41.667 --> 00:12:43.792
My village...

00:12:43.792 --> 00:12:46.208
My village is to the south...

00:12:46.208 --> 00:12:49.625
...where the Titans are coming from.

00:12:49.625 --> 00:12:54.000
I can take you to the nearby villages. After that...

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.333
...pease let me visit mine.

00:12:58.083 --> 00:12:59.292
All right.

00:12:59.292 --> 00:13:02.042
You'll guide the southern team.

00:13:02.042 --> 00:13:03.083
Yes, Sir!

00:13:03.083 --> 00:13:05.333
I'll come with you, Conny.

00:13:05.333 --> 00:13:09.500
The south will be crawling with Titans.
It'll be the most dangerous.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:13.792
So? I was going to help you
sneak there anyway, remember?

00:13:13.792 --> 00:13:16.375
You coming, Bertholdt?

00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:21.750
Of course I'll come.

00:13:24.875 --> 00:13:26.458
As you may know,

00:13:26.458 --> 00:13:30.000
today marks the new darkest day
in humanity's history!

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.417
If ever humankind needed
to give its all, that time is now!

00:13:35.417 --> 00:13:38.750
The Titans have reached the woods!

00:13:43.708 --> 00:13:45.458
Scatter!

00:13:45.458 --> 00:13:48.208
Ride as fast as you can!

00:13:59.708 --> 00:14:00.958
What?!

00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:02.833
They all started sprinting!

00:14:02.833 --> 00:14:04.958
Whoa! They're going to catch up!

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:07.833
Gelgar!

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.542
Take charge of the southern team!

00:14:11.542 --> 00:14:12.708
Sir?!

00:14:14.458 --> 00:14:16.833
U-Understood.

00:14:16.833 --> 00:14:19.083
He's using himself as bait?!

00:14:19.083 --> 00:14:21.042
He won't survive! I'll help!

00:14:21.042 --> 00:14:24.458
No! We can't spare anyone else!

00:14:24.458 --> 00:14:26.417
Have faith in him!

00:14:26.417 --> 00:14:29.583
His skill is second only to Captain Levi!

00:14:29.583 --> 00:14:32.042
He'll make it back alive!

00:14:53.958 --> 00:14:58.958
"Little is known about the Titans in the walls. They
appear to use a material like the Female Titan's crystal."

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:14.250
Oh, Eren.

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:17.125
Did you get into <i>another </i>fight?

00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:21.625
Those jerks started it! They made fun of me!

00:15:21.625 --> 00:15:27.125
So, I assume Mikasa had to
come to your rescue again?

00:15:27.125 --> 00:15:28.417
Thanks.

00:15:33.667 --> 00:15:34.833
Eren.

00:15:34.833 --> 00:15:37.833
No matter how cruel someone is
or how much you hate them,

00:15:37.833 --> 00:15:40.458
you can't always charge at them head-on!

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.708
You're a man!

00:15:43.708 --> 00:15:47.458
Show some restraint!
You need to be there for Mikasa, too!

00:16:35.333 --> 00:16:37.375
That's...

00:16:37.375 --> 00:16:38.833
It fell.

00:16:40.167 --> 00:16:43.917
You gotta be tired. Go get some sleep.

00:16:43.917 --> 00:16:47.083
Sorry. I'm fine.

00:16:47.083 --> 00:16:49.500
That thing's seen better days.

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:54.708
I'll get you a new one
if I see any in our supplies.

00:17:01.125 --> 00:17:03.292
Eren! Mikasa!

00:17:03.292 --> 00:17:05.083
This is really bad!

00:17:05.083 --> 00:17:08.375
The Titans! They're inside Wall Rose!

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:19.208
Ugh. Those damn Titans never give us a break.

00:17:20.875 --> 00:17:22.875
Can you go?

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:25.583
Not like there's much choice.

00:17:25.583 --> 00:17:30.167
It was wise to have
Section Commander Miche watch the 104th.

00:17:30.167 --> 00:17:33.083
I believe he can handle the situation.

00:17:33.083 --> 00:17:34.167
Yes.

00:17:35.542 --> 00:17:37.167
Let's hope so.

00:17:54.125 --> 00:17:56.208
Four left.

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:05.083
No, it's time to go.

00:18:05.083 --> 00:18:07.542
I've bought enough time.

00:18:16.542 --> 00:18:18.250
Still...

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:21.542
...I <i>am </i>concerned about that Abnormal.

00:18:21.542 --> 00:18:23.625
It's different.

00:18:23.625 --> 00:18:28.542
It looks over 17 meters tall. It's huge...

00:18:28.542 --> 00:18:33.625
And I've never seen
a Titan covered in fur before.

00:18:33.625 --> 00:18:38.042
It's just walking around
instead of coming for me.

00:18:38.042 --> 00:18:40.958
It's definitely an Abnormal, but...

00:18:43.125 --> 00:18:45.583
Great! You're back!

00:18:45.583 --> 00:18:48.875
I won't need to hold out until nightfall.

00:18:56.042 --> 00:18:58.667
It went for the horse?!

00:18:59.333 --> 00:19:00.958
You can't be serious!

00:19:22.125 --> 00:19:23.292
Wait.

00:19:44.125 --> 00:19:49.417
Huh? Didn't I just say to wait?

00:20:09.167 --> 00:20:12.875
Tell me, what is that weapon called?

00:20:17.375 --> 00:20:20.875
That thing on your waist that flies around.

00:20:32.583 --> 00:20:35.875
I'm certain we speak the same language.

00:20:35.875 --> 00:20:39.708
Perhaps you're simply too frightened.

00:20:39.708 --> 00:20:43.292
Oh, I see you use swords, too.

00:20:43.292 --> 00:20:47.500
I guess that means you know
we reside in the nape.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:51.875
Ah, well, I'll just take it back with me.

00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:21.833
Only when a person stops fighting do they lose.

00:21:26.375 --> 00:21:29.083
As long as we continue to fight...

00:21:30.458 --> 00:21:32.875
...we are not beaten!

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.792
You can move now.

00:21:47.583 --> 00:21:51.958
No! No!

00:21:51.958 --> 00:21:56.583
Stop! Don't! No! No!

00:21:59.792 --> 00:22:03.167
So you <i>can </i>speak.

00:22:07.417 --> 00:22:11.958
I must say, what a clever idea.

00:22:14.375 --> 00:22:17.542
No! No!

00:22:17.542 --> 00:22:21.875
Stop! No!

00:23:58.458 --> 00:24:02.917
Titans have suddenly appeared inside Wall Rose.

00:24:02.917 --> 00:24:09.250
The recruits from the 104th Cadet Corps
scatter across the land to spread the news.

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:13.458
Meanwhile, Eren and the others
head to their rescue.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.917
And after returning to her hometown,

00:24:17.917 --> 00:24:22.500
Sasha comes face-to-face with her past.

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:27.094
Next episode: "I'm Home."
