00:00:18.458 --> 00:00:23.417
There are likely no Titans among
the 104th Cadet Corps recruits!

00:00:23.417 --> 00:00:26.875
Multiple Titans from the south!

00:00:26.875 --> 00:00:29.917
Wall Rose has been breached!

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:41.083
The 104th Cadet Corps were kept isolated
under suspicion of Titans within their ranks.

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:49.208
But with the sudden appearance of Titans,
couriers were dispatched to warn each district.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.042
As you may know,

00:00:54.042 --> 00:00:57.458
today marks the new darkest day
in humanity's history!

00:00:57.458 --> 00:01:03.500
If ever humankind needed
to give its all, that time is now!

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.833
However...

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.958
What?!

00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:12.792
They all started sprinting!

00:01:15.167 --> 00:01:19.625
The cause of this crisis remains in the dark.

00:01:19.625 --> 00:01:22.167
For now, no one yet knows.

00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:34.542
I must say, what a clever idea.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
"I'm Home"

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.667
"Trost District"

00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:23.958
Commander Pyxis!

00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:26.083
Titans have been spotted!

00:03:26.083 --> 00:03:29.417
Wall Rose has been breached!

00:03:30.625 --> 00:03:32.042
Hmm.

00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:36.042
"Stohess District"

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.500
What the hell does all this mean?

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.333
Damn it!

00:03:43.333 --> 00:03:44.458
But...

00:03:46.042 --> 00:03:50.250
Would Titans break walls with Titans in them?

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.625
It's happened before.
They busted the wall into our city.

00:03:54.625 --> 00:03:56.583
That was a gate.

00:03:58.333 --> 00:04:01.375
Armin? What are you saying?

00:04:01.375 --> 00:04:03.458
The thing about the walls...

00:04:03.458 --> 00:04:08.083
There's no crevices between the rocks
or any signs of cracking.

00:04:08.083 --> 00:04:11.167
We can't really tell how they're made.

00:04:13.083 --> 00:04:16.583
So what if they're made of hardened Titan skin?

00:04:18.833 --> 00:04:23.208
It must be pretty versatile
if Annie can encase herself.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.542
Titans... in the wall...

00:04:29.583 --> 00:04:32.417
Section Commander! What are you doing?

00:04:32.417 --> 00:04:34.708
We're supposed to leave in 5 minutes!

00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:35.792
Please hurry up!

00:04:35.792 --> 00:04:38.542
There's something I need to confirm--

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.667
Hey.

00:04:43.667 --> 00:04:44.708
Get moving.

00:04:44.708 --> 00:04:46.417
Ah, sorry!

00:04:46.417 --> 00:04:47.542
What about him?

00:04:47.542 --> 00:04:50.042
He's been ready for a while now.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.542
Eren. Wear it right.

00:05:00.542 --> 00:05:02.333
It's cold at night.

00:05:02.333 --> 00:05:04.667
Sorry to keep ya!

00:05:04.667 --> 00:05:07.542
Took longer to prepare than we thought.

00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.500
Um...

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.583
Isn't this a priest from the Order of the Walls?

00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:20.583
Yeah. Nick and I are best buddies.

00:05:20.583 --> 00:05:22.333
Right?

00:05:22.333 --> 00:05:24.542
Don't let him bother you.

00:05:24.542 --> 00:05:28.125
The whole makeup of this squad
doesn't make any sense.

00:05:28.125 --> 00:05:30.167
Does it, Levi?

00:05:30.167 --> 00:05:32.750
No, I think it might.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.917
Erwin picked them out for a reason.

00:05:35.917 --> 00:05:37.500
Open the gate!

00:05:46.125 --> 00:05:49.000
The situation within Wall Rose is unclear.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.625
But everything up until Ehrmich is safe.

00:05:51.625 --> 00:05:53.875
We'll save time going through there.

00:05:53.875 --> 00:05:54.958
Move out!

00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.125
Yes, sir!

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:58.750
Take us out.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:59.833
Yes, sir!

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:20.125
This whole time, Titans have been
protecting us from Titans.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.792
Huh? He knew?

00:06:33.792 --> 00:06:38.042
There's Titans inside the walls
and he's known about it?!

00:06:38.042 --> 00:06:40.458
Yes, though...

00:06:40.458 --> 00:06:43.667
...he's kept his mouth shut this entire time.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.167
But now he's coming with us
to witness the harsh reality.

00:06:50.167 --> 00:06:54.042
Will his beliefs be strong enough
for him to stay silent?

00:06:54.042 --> 00:06:58.833
Or will seeing it with his own eyes
make him question himself?

00:06:58.833 --> 00:07:02.167
No, no, no, no! This is all backwards!

00:07:02.167 --> 00:07:05.250
If there's something you know, tell us about it!

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.792
Nothing's more important than
keeping humans from going extinct!

00:07:09.792 --> 00:07:12.417
Eren, settle down.

00:07:12.417 --> 00:07:14.500
You're still not fully healed.

00:07:15.542 --> 00:07:19.042
There's more than one way to get answers.

00:07:19.042 --> 00:07:25.167
I may be injured and useless right now,
but it doesn't take much to watch one man.

00:07:25.167 --> 00:07:30.417
I'm hoping we can settle this
without blasting a hole in anyone.

00:07:30.417 --> 00:07:31.625
Aren't you?

00:07:31.625 --> 00:07:33.875
Threatening him doesn't work, Levi.

00:07:33.875 --> 00:07:35.958
Believe me, I've tried.

00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:41.292
It seems to me that this priest
is capable of sound judgment.

00:07:41.292 --> 00:07:43.625
That's why I wonder...

00:07:43.625 --> 00:07:45.833
What if the reason he doesn't talk

00:07:45.833 --> 00:07:50.292
is because he knows something more
important than the fate of humanity?

00:07:53.417 --> 00:07:55.458
See that? It's the village!

00:07:55.458 --> 00:07:56.792
Is that the last one?

00:07:56.792 --> 00:08:00.833
No! My village is deep in the forest!

00:08:01.833 --> 00:08:03.958
I'll go there alone!

00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.333
All right!

00:08:05.333 --> 00:08:07.458
Leave this village to me!

00:08:07.458 --> 00:08:08.625
Got it!

00:08:15.208 --> 00:08:17.958
Hey! Quit it, Sasha!

00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:21.667
Sasha! You been nabbing snacks again?!

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:23.292
Stop! Spit it out!

00:08:23.292 --> 00:08:24.750
Get it out of yer mouth!

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:28.458
We fixin' to smoke that for winter, ya moron!

00:08:38.375 --> 00:08:41.250
You damn dumb girl!

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.000
Fine!

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.583
Have it yer way.

00:08:46.292 --> 00:08:47.708
Dagnabbit.

00:08:57.458 --> 00:08:58.833
Sasha.

00:08:58.833 --> 00:09:04.417
Have you asked yerself
why the world is a-changing?

00:09:04.417 --> 00:09:09.167
Why these past few years the forest
be shrinkin' and game harder to find?

00:09:09.167 --> 00:09:11.083
Have you ever thunk about it?

00:09:12.875 --> 00:09:17.750
It's 'cause more people be comin' and
taking food and game from the forest.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:20.458
That's why I'm hungry.

00:09:20.458 --> 00:09:23.042
That's true.

00:09:23.042 --> 00:09:24.542
But, hey...

00:09:24.542 --> 00:09:30.167
They lost their homes and got no place to go.
They got no other choice.

00:09:30.167 --> 00:09:32.167
Their fault for losing it.

00:09:32.167 --> 00:09:34.375
They oughta leave ours.

00:09:35.667 --> 00:09:37.500
Titans took it from 'em.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:42.625
They knocked a hole straight through Wall Maria.
Where else can they go?

00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:50.750
You can feed a hell of a lot more people
by clearin' the forest and plantin' grain.

00:09:53.333 --> 00:09:59.208
Maybe it's time for our family to let go
of the forest and give up huntin' for good.

00:10:00.375 --> 00:10:06.042
The government said they would pay us.
Every horse that we raise is money in our pockets.

00:10:06.042 --> 00:10:07.792
You gotta be kidding!

00:10:07.792 --> 00:10:10.750
If we give up huntin',
we be givin' up who we are!

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:14.875
Why should we give a hoot about
the people who make fun of our lifestyle?

00:10:14.875 --> 00:10:16.417
I'll tell ya why.

00:10:18.167 --> 00:10:23.042
It's because... we're all
part of the same world.

00:10:23.042 --> 00:10:27.167
We humans... We've always been pack animals.

00:10:27.167 --> 00:10:30.042
Sure, we all live our different ways.

00:10:30.042 --> 00:10:35.500
But when space is this short, we gotta
join the group and do what's best to--

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.625
No! I refuse!

00:10:37.625 --> 00:10:42.083
We've lived here all our lives,
just like the way our ancestors taught us!

00:10:42.083 --> 00:10:45.042
We don't owe nothing to any outsiders!

00:10:49.583 --> 00:10:51.167
I see...

00:10:51.167 --> 00:10:53.167
So be it.

00:10:55.125 --> 00:11:01.208
Ya can live here in this forest,
along with the others who think the same.

00:11:02.417 --> 00:11:04.375
But, Sasha...

00:11:04.375 --> 00:11:07.625
Are ya willin' to die for that choice?

00:11:08.667 --> 00:11:13.625
No matter what trouble comes yer way,
ya can't go beggin' for help.

00:11:13.625 --> 00:11:19.708
If you're not there for them,
don't expect them to be there for you.

00:11:20.792 --> 00:11:26.125
I'm willin' to give up our traditions
if it means I can live with my family.

00:11:26.125 --> 00:11:30.417
Goes to show ya our world's connected,
whether you like it or not.

00:11:32.083 --> 00:11:37.167
Sasha. Are you that much of a scaredy-cat?

00:11:37.167 --> 00:11:44.042
Is it that hard for you to leave this forest
behind and get along with others?

00:11:47.875 --> 00:11:50.667
It's been 3 years since I've been back.

00:11:50.667 --> 00:11:54.292
Surely he realized something
was amiss and fled...

00:11:58.083 --> 00:12:01.333
It can't be! Way out here?

00:12:03.917 --> 00:12:07.042
They've already come this far?!

00:12:08.458 --> 00:12:12.375
This place isn't safe for people anymore.

00:12:16.333 --> 00:12:20.417
What's that? A new village?

00:13:26.042 --> 00:13:31.042
"In addition to the cities at the walls, there exist
villages of various sizes contained within the walls."

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:44.750
Damn! If I don't slice it off,
it'll just heal back up!

00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:55.333
A child?

00:14:03.917 --> 00:14:06.333
I'm so sorry...

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:22.583
What's your name?

00:14:25.833 --> 00:14:27.958
Don't worry. It'll be okay.

00:14:27.958 --> 00:14:28.875
What will?

00:14:28.875 --> 00:14:32.125
Huh? What? I mean... Um...

00:14:33.292 --> 00:14:35.417
Steady... Steady...

00:14:35.417 --> 00:14:37.708
Um, you see...

00:14:37.708 --> 00:14:38.708
Huh?

00:14:39.708 --> 00:14:41.542
You're kidding me! Hey!

00:14:41.542 --> 00:14:43.750
Please wait for us!

00:14:46.125 --> 00:14:47.792
There's no need to worry.

00:14:47.792 --> 00:14:49.792
Please stay calm. It'll come right back.

00:14:49.792 --> 00:14:52.000
Why are you so nice when you talk?

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.167
What?

00:15:02.167 --> 00:15:03.667
Run away from here!

00:15:06.833 --> 00:15:08.375
It'll be okay!

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:13.250
Why? Everyone already left.

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:17.625
The whole village knew
my mother's legs were bad.

00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:20.625
But not a single person came to help.

00:15:20.625 --> 00:15:22.750
All I could do was watch.

00:15:42.042 --> 00:15:43.708
It'll be okay!

00:15:47.083 --> 00:15:48.583
It's okay.

00:15:51.625 --> 00:15:53.917
You're really starting to tick me off.

00:15:53.917 --> 00:15:55.083
What?

00:15:55.083 --> 00:15:58.417
That stupid way you talk politely to everyone.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:02.708
Why don't you talk to other cadets like normal?

00:16:02.708 --> 00:16:05.875
Um... Well, you see...

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.417
Wait. Let me guess.

00:16:09.417 --> 00:16:13.042
You're embarrassed by the way
people sound from your village.

00:16:13.042 --> 00:16:14.083
Bull's-eye?

00:16:14.083 --> 00:16:17.792
I'm surprised an idiot like you cares so much.

00:16:17.792 --> 00:16:23.875
You can't do anything but hunt,
and you're afraid of people, to top it off.

00:16:23.875 --> 00:16:27.833
I bet you don't have a single good reason
for aiming to become a soldier.

00:16:27.833 --> 00:16:29.083
Your parents probably--

00:16:29.083 --> 00:16:30.458
Stop it, Ymir! You're being--

00:16:30.458 --> 00:16:31.500
Sasha!

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:35.833
You gonna care what other people think
and be someone you're not your whole life?

00:16:35.833 --> 00:16:37.708
What a crock of shit.

00:16:37.708 --> 00:16:42.250
You're fine as is, so talk in
your own words for crying out loud.

00:16:44.083 --> 00:16:47.458
Th-Thank you...

00:16:47.458 --> 00:16:48.958
...very much.

00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:50.333
What?

00:16:50.333 --> 00:16:51.833
I'm... sorry.

00:16:51.833 --> 00:16:53.708
I'm not... yet...

00:16:53.708 --> 00:16:55.375
Cut it out!

00:16:55.375 --> 00:16:59.042
There's nothing wrong with the way she talks!

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.042
Sasha is who Sasha wants to be.

00:17:03.042 --> 00:17:05.833
Her words will always be her own.

00:17:05.833 --> 00:17:08.583
And I happen to like her.

00:17:08.583 --> 00:17:11.375
Hmph! Have it your way.

00:17:11.375 --> 00:17:16.417
Still, even if she changed the way she talks,
it won't change the fact that she's annoying.

00:17:16.417 --> 00:17:20.375
You know, not everyone is as insensitive as you.

00:17:20.375 --> 00:17:21.958
Excuse me?

00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:24.708
You little... You little...

00:17:25.917 --> 00:17:28.958
Hey! What are you laughing at?!

00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:31.500
Ah! I'm sorry!

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:41.042
Why do I remember, now of all times...

00:17:41.042 --> 00:17:44.083
...about silly, pointless days in the past?

00:17:44.083 --> 00:17:47.708
It's all... I can think of.

00:17:50.125 --> 00:17:51.792
Hey, listen up.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.417
You'll be fine. Keep following this path.

00:17:56.417 --> 00:17:58.500
Run as far as you can.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.750
I promise someone will be there to help you.

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:04.458
You might not find them right away...

00:18:04.458 --> 00:18:08.000
But still, keep running until you do!

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.708
Now, go!

00:18:09.708 --> 00:18:11.083
Run!

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:16.708
Get runnin'!

00:18:32.708 --> 00:18:36.583
If I take out both eyes,
it'll buy us plenty of time.

00:18:42.708 --> 00:18:44.792
Only... two left.

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:47.458
Relax...

00:18:47.458 --> 00:18:50.583
All it is... is a big...

00:18:50.583 --> 00:18:51.750
...slow moving...

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:53.042
...target!

00:18:56.083 --> 00:18:57.125
Got it!

00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:02.667
One more arrow.

00:19:02.667 --> 00:19:05.833
But, if I miss this...

00:19:09.083 --> 00:19:11.042
...we can't escape.

00:19:11.042 --> 00:19:14.542
If I miss, me and...

00:19:14.542 --> 00:19:16.042
...that girl...

00:19:43.792 --> 00:19:46.542
I slipped out thanks to that blood.

00:19:46.542 --> 00:19:48.417
Now I've gotta find that girl!

00:19:54.125 --> 00:19:56.542
Huh? Sasha?

00:20:15.167 --> 00:20:19.125
We been givin' horses to everyone in the area.

00:20:19.125 --> 00:20:23.333
That girl told us someone was still back there.

00:20:23.333 --> 00:20:26.833
Who'da thunk it was you?

00:20:26.833 --> 00:20:30.333
You fought off a Titan for that girl, didn't ya?

00:20:32.833 --> 00:20:35.708
Sasha... Yer all I hoped for.

00:20:37.792 --> 00:20:39.458
Father...

00:20:41.667 --> 00:20:43.167
I'm home.

00:20:47.083 --> 00:20:49.208
Conny, wait!

00:20:49.208 --> 00:20:50.583
Calm down!

00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:53.167
There could be Titans anywhere!

00:20:53.167 --> 00:20:55.250
Get back here, Conny!

00:20:58.333 --> 00:20:59.667
This can't be...

00:21:04.458 --> 00:21:08.000
Anyone?! Is anyone there?!

00:21:09.417 --> 00:21:11.542
It's me! Conny!

00:21:11.542 --> 00:21:14.125
I came back!

00:21:23.083 --> 00:21:24.250
My house!

00:21:27.958 --> 00:21:29.833
Dad...

00:21:29.833 --> 00:21:31.208
Mom...

00:21:31.208 --> 00:21:34.250
Sunny... Martin!

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:36.625
Please be okay!

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:54.958
Conny! Get back!

00:21:54.958 --> 00:21:58.333
It's... my house.

00:21:58.333 --> 00:21:59.917
My...

00:21:59.917 --> 00:22:01.625
Conny...

00:22:01.625 --> 00:22:03.292
Fall back, you two!

00:22:03.292 --> 00:22:05.000
I'll scout the area!

00:22:07.833 --> 00:22:10.333
Wait, it's...

00:22:10.333 --> 00:22:11.750
It can't move?

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:13.750
Not with those legs...

00:22:15.167 --> 00:22:19.167
Th-Then... How?

00:22:19.167 --> 00:22:21.500
How did it even get here?!

00:23:58.333 --> 00:24:01.417
"I'm sure my family is safe and sound."

00:24:01.417 --> 00:24:05.750
Shaking off the dread of Titans
appearing in his hometown,

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:08.750
Conny once again departs.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:14.458
Battle erupts across the land
while the mystery of the Titans remains.

00:24:14.458 --> 00:24:17.000
As the plight worsens,

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.625
Eren and the others heading for Ehrmich District
receive a clue that might reveal the truth.

00:24:22.625 --> 00:24:27.179
Next episode: "Southwestward."
