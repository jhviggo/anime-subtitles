00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:22.583
Eren.

00:00:22.583 --> 00:00:24.875
You're a man!

00:00:24.875 --> 00:00:29.250
Show some restraint!
You need to be there for Mikasa, too!

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.083
Stop!

00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:28.958
"Scream"

00:02:33.333 --> 00:02:34.833
Damn that Reiner!

00:02:34.833 --> 00:02:37.583
He's tossing Titans like a madman!

00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:54.625
This is all your fault!

00:02:54.625 --> 00:02:59.833
It's you who screwed up my entire plan,
you damn commander!

00:03:07.042 --> 00:03:08.292
Ymir!

00:03:08.292 --> 00:03:09.542
Conny, that way!

00:03:09.542 --> 00:03:11.000
I know!

00:03:13.833 --> 00:03:15.250
Commander!

00:03:16.458 --> 00:03:19.083
I can always be replaced.

00:03:19.083 --> 00:03:22.583
More importantly, find Eren and retreat!

00:03:22.583 --> 00:03:24.708
Time is of the essence!

00:03:37.167 --> 00:03:38.583
Eren!

00:03:43.458 --> 00:03:44.958
Hannes!

00:03:51.333 --> 00:03:53.167
What are the odds of this?!

00:03:53.167 --> 00:03:55.542
Check it out, you two!

00:03:55.542 --> 00:03:56.917
You just watch.

00:03:56.917 --> 00:04:02.083
I'm about to avenge your mother
and butcher the shit out of this!

00:04:05.833 --> 00:04:08.000
Hannes!

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.375
Give the old man backup!

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:11.458
Huh?!

00:04:18.167 --> 00:04:21.125
Reiner? What's he doing?!

00:04:21.125 --> 00:04:23.750
Does he not care if Eren is eaten?!

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.083
Don't get in our way, you big sack of shit!

00:04:35.583 --> 00:04:36.917
Ymir!

00:04:38.375 --> 00:04:41.667
Dammit... What am I supposed to do?

00:04:41.667 --> 00:04:46.708
If I can't count on Reiner, should I cooperate
with the Scouts and try to survive?

00:04:49.292 --> 00:04:52.708
But what happens after that?

00:04:52.708 --> 00:04:55.958
Even if I can somehow live through all this...

00:04:55.958 --> 00:05:01.083
...there's no avoiding the hell
that's to come trapped inside the walls.

00:05:01.083 --> 00:05:05.167
Now's my only chance
to hand Historia over to their side!

00:05:05.167 --> 00:05:09.458
I won't be able to protect her alone,
no matter how hard I try.

00:05:13.917 --> 00:05:15.500
Christa!

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.750
Conny, that's wrong.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.125
My name is Historia.

00:05:21.125 --> 00:05:24.083
Hey, Ymir...

00:05:24.083 --> 00:05:27.917
Why was it you were trying to take me away?

00:05:27.917 --> 00:05:31.333
You said it was to save yourself,
but was that a lie?

00:05:32.917 --> 00:05:35.875
No... it has to be.

00:05:36.917 --> 00:05:40.583
Why? Why did you do it?

00:05:44.292 --> 00:05:46.000
For me?

00:05:47.167 --> 00:05:50.250
To protect me again?

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.833
It's a Titan!

00:05:54.583 --> 00:05:56.042
Ymir...

00:05:56.042 --> 00:05:59.958
You're the one who said it,
so listen to yourself!

00:06:01.167 --> 00:06:03.708
Stop living for other people!

00:06:03.708 --> 00:06:08.792
From now on, let's live for nobody but ourselves!

00:06:08.792 --> 00:06:10.917
It's strange, really...

00:06:10.917 --> 00:06:14.917
When I'm with you,
no matter how screwed up it gets...

00:06:14.917 --> 00:06:16.792
...I'm not afraid!

00:06:24.417 --> 00:06:25.792
Shit!

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.708
Don't, Mikasa! You're injured!

00:06:41.375 --> 00:06:43.042
Untie my hands!

00:06:43.042 --> 00:06:44.792
Hands?

00:06:44.792 --> 00:06:46.083
Hurry up!

00:06:46.083 --> 00:06:49.042
I've gotta be the one to do it!

00:06:50.292 --> 00:06:52.917
Who said I was done with you?!

00:06:54.792 --> 00:06:56.792
That one's... mine!

00:06:56.792 --> 00:06:58.500
Eren!

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.833
Wait! We're trying to get you out of here!

00:07:01.833 --> 00:07:04.125
It's time to settle the score!

00:07:04.125 --> 00:07:05.500
Just watch!

00:07:14.083 --> 00:07:15.875
Huh?!

00:07:21.583 --> 00:07:23.125
Commander!

00:07:23.125 --> 00:07:24.625
The Armored one is--

00:07:25.625 --> 00:07:27.458
It's coming!

00:07:31.208 --> 00:07:32.333
Jean!

00:07:37.292 --> 00:07:38.583
Jean!

00:07:39.833 --> 00:07:41.708
Are you okay?!

00:07:41.708 --> 00:07:43.708
Hold it together!

00:07:48.875 --> 00:07:50.708
Shit!

00:07:50.708 --> 00:07:52.458
Shit!

00:07:53.583 --> 00:07:55.333
What's wrong?!

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.417
Eren!

00:08:20.292 --> 00:08:21.917
Commander!

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.500
Right now...

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.750
...I've gotta become a Titan...

00:08:48.458 --> 00:08:50.667
...or it's all for nothing!

00:09:33.125 --> 00:09:35.333
Eren...

00:09:35.333 --> 00:09:37.125
Nothing changed!

00:09:37.125 --> 00:09:40.917
You haven't changed one bit, dammit!

00:09:40.917 --> 00:09:44.458
You're still as useless as you ever were!

00:09:45.875 --> 00:09:48.208
Nothing changed!

00:09:58.667 --> 00:10:00.708
Mom...

00:10:00.708 --> 00:10:03.875
I... can't...

00:10:03.875 --> 00:10:08.417
I still... can't do anything at all.

00:10:08.417 --> 00:10:09.833
Eren...

00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:19.333
That's not true.

00:10:38.833 --> 00:10:41.250
Eren...

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:42.833
Listen...

00:10:44.042 --> 00:10:46.375
...I need to tell you something.

00:10:50.833 --> 00:10:54.833
You've always... been at my side.

00:10:54.833 --> 00:10:56.458
Thank you.

00:11:00.292 --> 00:11:06.083
You showed me... how to live with purpose.

00:11:06.083 --> 00:11:07.875
Thank you.

00:11:13.125 --> 00:11:14.792
And you...

00:11:17.833 --> 00:11:20.250
You wrapped this scarf around me.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.000
Thank you.

00:11:44.417 --> 00:11:49.000
I'll wrap that around you...
as many times as you want.

00:11:51.208 --> 00:11:55.500
Now and forever... As much as you want!

00:12:57.333 --> 00:13:00.500
Why... are they...?

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.417
They're eating it?

00:13:07.917 --> 00:13:10.458
Dunno what's going on, but now's our chance!

00:13:10.458 --> 00:13:11.875
Let's hurry and run!

00:13:11.875 --> 00:13:13.125
Right!

00:13:13.125 --> 00:13:15.167
So that's how it is...

00:13:15.167 --> 00:13:18.875
That's why Reiner was so desperate for Eren.

00:13:18.875 --> 00:13:22.208
Which means, even inside the walls...

00:13:22.208 --> 00:13:24.083
...there's a future.

00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.167
This is the worst...

00:13:30.167 --> 00:13:35.375
Why did the Coordinate have to fall into
the hands of the worst person imaginable?

00:13:35.375 --> 00:13:37.833
We've gotta get it back...

00:13:37.833 --> 00:13:41.458
I can say... without a doubt...

00:13:41.458 --> 00:13:44.833
...the one person in the world
I wouldn't want to have it...

00:13:44.833 --> 00:13:48.417
...Eren... is you!

00:13:48.417 --> 00:13:51.083
Get away from me!

00:13:51.083 --> 00:13:54.458
You bastards! I'll kill you all!

00:14:03.042 --> 00:14:06.625
Not good! Bertholdt!

00:14:06.625 --> 00:14:08.625
I can't protect Bertholdt like this!

00:14:08.625 --> 00:14:10.583
What? The Titans?

00:14:10.583 --> 00:14:11.750
Eren!

00:14:13.083 --> 00:14:13.875
Get on!

00:14:13.875 --> 00:14:15.958
Armin!

00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:17.708
Hurry!

00:14:17.708 --> 00:14:19.875
Don't let this chance escape!

00:14:19.875 --> 00:14:21.958
Full retreat!

00:14:30.417 --> 00:14:32.042
Ymir!

00:14:32.042 --> 00:14:35.875
Hey, ugly! What are you doing?!
We're heading back!

00:14:46.167 --> 00:14:49.625
I sorry...

00:14:49.625 --> 00:14:51.167
Huh?

00:14:56.042 --> 00:14:58.250
Ymir! Where are you going?!

00:14:58.250 --> 00:14:58.875
Leave her!

00:14:58.875 --> 00:15:00.708
But Ymir is--

00:15:21.833 --> 00:15:28.208
In that moment, I couldn't understand
the motivation behind Ymir's actions...

00:15:28.208 --> 00:15:32.500
...but the Armored Titan
didn't pursue us any further.

00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:58.000
"Through extensive research, it has become clear
that the scourge of Titans are of human origin."

00:16:13.458 --> 00:16:15.042
Ymir...

00:16:15.042 --> 00:16:17.833
Why did you come to us?

00:16:17.833 --> 00:16:20.625
Oh, well...

00:16:20.625 --> 00:16:23.208
It's because I'm an idiot.

00:16:23.208 --> 00:16:27.667
I'll be your souvenir to take back home.

00:16:27.667 --> 00:16:31.333
You can't just go back empty-handed.

00:16:31.333 --> 00:16:33.458
Ymir...

00:16:33.458 --> 00:16:37.000
If you hadn't come to bust up this wall...

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.292
...I would've never woken up
from that nightmare.

00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:43.833
All I'm doing...

00:16:43.833 --> 00:16:47.458
...is returning what I borrowed back then.

00:16:48.625 --> 00:16:53.875
Because I'm probably the only one
that understands the situation you're in.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.792
Thank you, Ymir.

00:16:58.792 --> 00:17:01.375
I'm sorry...

00:17:01.375 --> 00:17:02.958
No...

00:17:06.292 --> 00:17:10.542
It wasn't so bad, you know...
being a goddess for a while.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.333
With reports declaring the possibility
that Wall Rose has been breached,

00:17:19.333 --> 00:17:25.750
the citizens of Wall Rose were forced to take
refuge in an underground city within Wall Sina.

00:17:26.792 --> 00:17:33.625
However, with more than half the population
surviving off food stockpiled for emergency,

00:17:33.625 --> 00:17:37.167
rations would last at most for a week.

00:17:37.167 --> 00:17:45.167
Any longer than that, and people would turn on
each other, stealing and killing to survive.

00:17:45.167 --> 00:17:49.875
To stop this from happening,
within one week from the initial outset,

00:17:49.875 --> 00:17:54.167
authorities declared that Wall Rose was secure.

00:17:55.167 --> 00:17:59.208
"Trost District"

00:18:05.792 --> 00:18:07.167
It's Hange.

00:18:07.167 --> 00:18:08.583
Come in.

00:18:08.583 --> 00:18:11.000
Pardon the interruption, Erwin.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.167
I'm glad we came while you're here,
Commander Pyxis.

00:18:17.167 --> 00:18:19.750
Good timing. This is...

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:23.583
A Scout from the 104th. Conny Springer.

00:18:23.583 --> 00:18:27.333
Conny comes from Ragako Village.

00:18:27.333 --> 00:18:30.667
The village the recent
Titan invasion originated from?

00:18:30.667 --> 00:18:32.167
Yes.

00:18:32.167 --> 00:18:37.000
Actually, I confirmed with him the findings
of our investigation on the village.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.333
This only brings further credibility
to that hypothesis.

00:18:40.333 --> 00:18:42.875
He's come to report.

00:18:47.167 --> 00:18:49.750
I was taken away...

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:56.708
And because of that, the Scouts lost
more than half their veteran soldiers.

00:18:56.708 --> 00:18:59.208
Just to rescue me...

00:19:01.083 --> 00:19:05.208
Still, there were no casualties on our way back.

00:19:05.208 --> 00:19:10.875
The Titans completely ignored us
and ran off to chase Reiner and the others.

00:19:10.875 --> 00:19:15.250
About that, Jean and I sat down
to try and figure it out.

00:19:16.833 --> 00:19:21.208
We have an idea what made
the Titans act that way.

00:19:21.208 --> 00:19:22.917
It was you.

00:19:24.583 --> 00:19:26.958
Of course, that's just our theory.

00:19:27.917 --> 00:19:32.958
But without assuming that,
there's just no explaining what happened.

00:19:34.208 --> 00:19:36.958
It's a tough spot to be in, Eren.

00:19:36.958 --> 00:19:40.500
Whether or not all those
people died for nothing...

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.542
...it all depends on you.

00:19:43.542 --> 00:19:48.042
If you're worth the price they paid,
you better show it.

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:51.500
We don't have time to waste.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.917
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

00:20:01.375 --> 00:20:03.125
I've gotta do this.

00:20:03.125 --> 00:20:05.542
I'll control the Titans.

00:20:05.542 --> 00:20:07.792
I'll plug up Wall Maria.

00:20:07.792 --> 00:20:11.833
I'll capture Reiner and make him pay.

00:20:11.833 --> 00:20:16.375
That's what I've gotta do
to atone for all those lives lost.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.208
Say again?

00:20:21.417 --> 00:20:26.583
The Titans responsible for this incident...
were the citizens of Ragako?

00:20:28.333 --> 00:20:32.417
In other words, the true identity of Titans...

00:20:32.417 --> 00:20:34.833
...is humans?

00:20:37.542 --> 00:20:41.083
We don't... have proof yet.

00:20:41.083 --> 00:20:44.292
So... you're telling me...

00:20:44.292 --> 00:20:51.792
...I've spent all this time and energy
running around killing people?

00:20:51.792 --> 00:20:53.500
Is that right?

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:57.625
I said we don't have proof yet.

00:21:08.333 --> 00:21:09.833
Erwin.

00:21:12.708 --> 00:21:16.125
Hey. Tell me.

00:21:16.125 --> 00:21:18.250
The hell you smiling for?

00:21:22.208 --> 00:21:24.417
It's nothing.

00:21:26.542 --> 00:21:28.542
It's just...

00:21:28.542 --> 00:21:33.292
...with this, we've taken
one more step towards the truth.

00:21:34.583 --> 00:21:36.958
Just one step, huh?

00:21:36.958 --> 00:21:40.583
We'll run out of people
before we learn the truth.

00:21:40.583 --> 00:21:43.417
It's not worth the cost.

00:21:43.417 --> 00:21:46.792
But it is a step towards the truth.

00:21:46.792 --> 00:21:50.708
One day, we'll break it down.

00:21:50.708 --> 00:21:53.375
This wall hiding the truth...

00:21:54.542 --> 00:21:55.958
...will fall.

00:22:25.292 --> 00:23:57.120
Not yet, eh?
