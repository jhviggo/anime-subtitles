WEBVTT

00:00:18.583 --> 00:00:19.167
Again?!

00:00:19.167 --> 00:00:21.042
What the hell is that sound?!

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.792
While stopped at the ruins
of Utgard Castle to take a brief break,

00:00:29.792 --> 00:00:35.917
the Scouts were overwhelmed by a Titan assault,
vanquishing their hope of survival.

00:00:35.917 --> 00:00:37.333
--Nanaba...
--No! No!

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:38.875
--And Gelgar...
--No! No!

00:00:38.875 --> 00:00:40.875
Father, stop!

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:43.333
However, in that moment...

00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:44.792
Christa.

00:00:44.792 --> 00:00:48.875
This is nothing more than a hope of mine...

00:00:49.875 --> 00:00:53.250
I want you... to live a life you're proud of.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.500
Ymir! Wait!

00:00:58.083 --> 00:01:00.958
...Ymir suddenly transformed into a Titan.

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:04.500
Keep it up, Ymir!

00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:07.917
Want live...?

00:01:07.917 --> 00:01:09.917
Grab me!

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:17.708
This looks bad.

00:01:20.042 --> 00:01:22.042
Ymir is...

00:01:22.042 --> 00:01:23.667
This can't...

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:25.417
This can't...

00:01:25.417 --> 00:01:30.208
I still haven't told you my real name!

00:01:33.583 --> 00:01:38.042
And then the main force of the Scouts
rushed in to engage the enemy.

00:01:38.042 --> 00:01:39.208
Die!

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.500
They successfully dismantled the Titan attack.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.042
However,

00:01:51.042 --> 00:01:57.542
upon the ruins of battle,
Eren and the others learn a surprising truth.

00:01:58.917 --> 00:02:00.542
Ymir...

00:02:01.792 --> 00:02:03.750
My real name...

00:02:04.917 --> 00:02:07.458
...is Historia.

00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:51.958
"Warrior"

00:04:12.542 --> 00:04:14.125
Slowly!

00:04:14.125 --> 00:04:16.000
Bring it up slowly!

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.083
Raise it carefully now!

00:04:27.458 --> 00:04:32.083
How's Ymir? What sort of shape is she in?

00:04:32.083 --> 00:04:37.375
Her right arm and leg were bitten off,
and her insides are beaten like scrambled eggs.

00:04:38.333 --> 00:04:40.875
If she was normal, she'd be dead for sure.

00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:46.250
If she was normal, huh?

00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:57.250
Reiner! Grab on!

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.375
Right!

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.458
Please, believe me!

00:05:04.458 --> 00:05:05.833
I'm telling the truth!

00:05:05.833 --> 00:05:11.250
Ymir transformed into a Titan
to fight off the other Titans and save us!

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:17.583
She did so with no regard for her own life,
which proves her loyalty to us, her comrades!

00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:22.083
It's true that her judgement
until now is unforgivable.

00:05:22.083 --> 00:05:27.583
After all, she may know things useful
to humanity and yet she kept quiet about it!

00:05:27.583 --> 00:05:32.917
I imagine she didn't say anything
in order to protect herself.

00:05:32.917 --> 00:05:35.917
But... now she's a changed person!

00:05:35.917 --> 00:05:38.542
Ymir is an ally of humanity!

00:05:38.542 --> 00:05:40.917
I know Ymir better than anybody.

00:05:40.917 --> 00:05:43.958
She's a much simpler person than she looks!

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.875
I see.

00:05:47.875 --> 00:05:52.500
Obviously, I hope we can build
a trusting relationship with her.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:58.458
Her judgement aside, the information
she holds is a treasure for humanity.

00:05:58.458 --> 00:06:00.125
I hope we get along.

00:06:01.625 --> 00:06:03.708
But you know...

00:06:03.708 --> 00:06:06.292
...even if she is a simple person,

00:06:06.292 --> 00:06:10.500
this world becomes more of a
confusing mess with every passing day.

00:06:13.208 --> 00:06:17.917
You said... your real name was Historia Reiss?

00:06:17.917 --> 00:06:20.125
Yes, that's right.

00:06:20.125 --> 00:06:23.417
Reiss, as in that noble family?

00:06:24.583 --> 00:06:26.500
Yes.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.708
I see.

00:06:31.583 --> 00:06:34.500
Nice to meet you, Historia.

00:06:35.792 --> 00:06:37.458
Yeah...

00:06:41.333 --> 00:06:42.958
How's Ymir?

00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.042
She's still in a coma.

00:06:45.042 --> 00:06:49.667
Her bleeding has stopped, and we think
steam is coming out of her wounds.

00:06:51.542 --> 00:06:57.125
For now, take her back to Trost
so she can get some proper medical care.

00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:58.542
She's in your hands.

00:06:58.542 --> 00:07:00.042
Understood.

00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:03.708
Now then...

00:07:04.667 --> 00:07:08.500
Our original mission... was to seal this wall.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:23.792
Damn, it hurts.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:26.542
You all right, Reiner?

00:07:26.542 --> 00:07:29.167
Not by a long shot.

00:07:29.167 --> 00:07:31.958
A Titan nearly gnawed off my arm.

00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:35.292
That was... pathetic.

00:07:35.292 --> 00:07:37.167
I thought I was done for.

00:07:45.333 --> 00:07:48.750
Even someone as strong as you
gets this way sometimes.

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:52.292
What are you talking about?
This is the second time for me!

00:07:52.292 --> 00:07:53.708
Tell him, Armin.

00:07:53.708 --> 00:07:54.917
Huh?

00:07:54.917 --> 00:07:59.167
Remember the time I almost
got crushed in that Titan's hand?

00:07:59.167 --> 00:08:00.750
Oh...

00:08:03.083 --> 00:08:05.167
Back then...

00:08:05.167 --> 00:08:08.292
That makes twice I've nearly died.

00:08:08.292 --> 00:08:12.000
At this rate, I'll be dead before I know it.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.125
I picked this path on my own,
but being a soldier is rough.

00:08:17.125 --> 00:08:20.542
It's like a soldier's spirit
breaks down before their body.

00:08:22.208 --> 00:08:25.917
Though, until we plug up this wall,

00:08:25.917 --> 00:08:28.792
there's no time to waste whining about it.

00:08:28.792 --> 00:08:30.333
Yeah.

00:08:30.333 --> 00:08:34.833
You two have been driven
far enough away from your hometown.

00:08:34.833 --> 00:08:38.375
I'm thinking... this is where
we gotta draw the line.

00:08:40.542 --> 00:08:42.708
He's right, Reiner!

00:08:42.708 --> 00:08:45.250
Our hometown! Let's return!

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.500
Isn't it about time to go back?

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:51.875
Compared to all the trouble we've
been through, what's left to do is nothing!

00:08:52.917 --> 00:08:54.458
That's right.

00:08:54.458 --> 00:08:57.917
We're so close, it's just
another few steps till the end.

00:08:57.917 --> 00:09:00.083
Huh?

00:09:00.083 --> 00:09:03.167
What are you guys talking about?

00:09:07.708 --> 00:09:09.500
Thanks, Mikasa.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.958
Are you hurt?

00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:17.667
I'm fine, but... Reiner got his arm bit
and Ymir is as you can see.

00:09:17.667 --> 00:09:21.042
Who would've thought Ymir was a Titan, too?

00:09:21.042 --> 00:09:21.625
Does that--?

00:09:21.625 --> 00:09:22.750
Sasha.

00:09:23.792 --> 00:09:25.417
Is everyone clear?

00:09:25.417 --> 00:09:28.042
We'll deal with Ymir later.

00:09:28.042 --> 00:09:29.917
And Conny...

00:09:29.917 --> 00:09:33.625
I'll arrange for a Scout squad
to investigate your village later.

00:09:33.625 --> 00:09:38.083
For the time being, I want you to focus
on the mission to fix the wall.

00:09:38.083 --> 00:09:39.000
Got it?

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.125
Got it!

00:09:41.125 --> 00:09:46.167
Still... I expected this place
to be swarming with Titans.

00:09:49.042 --> 00:09:50.833
Hannes?

00:09:50.833 --> 00:09:53.417
It's the Garrison's advance squad.

00:09:53.417 --> 00:09:55.875
They came to tell us where the hole is.

00:10:03.042 --> 00:10:05.542
There's no hole anywhere!

00:10:05.542 --> 00:10:06.708
Huh?

00:10:06.708 --> 00:10:09.250
We spent all night looking for it...

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:14.333
...but at least between Trost and Krolva District,
there's nothing wrong with the wall.

00:10:14.333 --> 00:10:16.375
What'd you say?

00:10:16.375 --> 00:10:20.292
We bumped into soldiers from Krolva
and retraced our steps.

00:10:20.292 --> 00:10:23.500
We haven't seen any Titans the whole way here.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:27.792
But... we know for sure there's Titans
on this side of the wall.

00:10:27.792 --> 00:10:31.333
Did you actually look?
Are you sure you're not drunk?

00:10:31.333 --> 00:10:32.667
I didn't drink!

00:10:32.667 --> 00:10:36.000
Wait, why are all of you here anyways?

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:49.333
If there's no hole in the wall, so be it.

00:10:49.333 --> 00:10:52.083
For now, we're falling back to Trost District!

00:10:57.417 --> 00:11:00.292
Whatever you do, don't let your guard down.

00:11:01.667 --> 00:11:03.917
We're going back ahead of you.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.375
There's nothing wrong with the wall?

00:11:11.375 --> 00:11:13.792
What could this mean?

00:11:13.792 --> 00:11:18.167
There's been nothing like this in five years.
Why is it all happening now?

00:11:18.167 --> 00:11:21.125
This world is getting more and more out of hand.

00:11:21.125 --> 00:11:22.208
Eren.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:24.917
Have a minute?

00:11:24.917 --> 00:11:26.667
We need to talk.

00:11:27.625 --> 00:11:28.958
What about?

00:11:30.167 --> 00:11:35.333
Five years ago, we demolished the wall
and began our attack on humanity.

00:11:35.333 --> 00:11:39.875
Oh no... What if there's a Titan
that dug a hole underneath the wall?

00:11:39.875 --> 00:11:42.708
The hole will be hard to find in that case.

00:11:42.708 --> 00:11:46.250
I'm the Armored Titan
and he's the Colossal Titan.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:50.292
Right now, we need to focus
on getting Ymir back safely.

00:11:50.292 --> 00:11:54.167
Even with our horses,
we still have to worry about Titans.

00:11:54.167 --> 00:11:55.750
Huh?

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:57.167
What are you talking about?

00:11:57.167 --> 00:11:59.458
Why are you telling him, Reiner?

00:11:59.458 --> 00:12:04.792
Our primary goal was to ensure
all of humanity was wiped out,

00:12:04.792 --> 00:12:07.833
but now there's no need for that.

00:12:07.833 --> 00:12:08.833
Uh...

00:12:08.833 --> 00:12:09.917
Eren.

00:12:09.917 --> 00:12:15.792
If you agree to come with us, we won't
have to destroy any more of the walls.

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:18.042
Understand?

00:12:18.042 --> 00:12:19.042
Huh?

00:12:19.042 --> 00:12:21.917
No, wait! I don't understand at all!

00:12:21.917 --> 00:12:26.000
I'm saying... Why don't you just come with us?

00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:32.958
They are easily transported and assembled and are built in
such a way to capacitate emergency and tactical deployment."

00:12:39.792 --> 00:12:42.875
I know this is sudden, but we need to go now.

00:12:42.875 --> 00:12:45.833
Right now? Where will you take me?

00:12:45.833 --> 00:12:47.875
I can't say that yet.

00:12:47.875 --> 00:12:52.875
But... Well, it's something like our hometown.

00:12:52.875 --> 00:12:55.167
So? What will it be, Eren?

00:12:55.167 --> 00:12:56.083
Uh...

00:12:56.083 --> 00:12:58.083
It's not a bad deal, right?

00:12:58.083 --> 00:13:00.667
You can easily avert this crisis.

00:13:02.292 --> 00:13:04.958
I wonder about that...

00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:07.917
Hey! We're leaving!

00:13:13.208 --> 00:13:15.625
What the hell?

00:13:15.625 --> 00:13:19.833
And here I thought I had
enough to think about yesterday...

00:13:25.875 --> 00:13:27.917
"12 hours earlier"

00:13:27.917 --> 00:13:29.042
"12 hours earlier"
Eren?

00:13:29.042 --> 00:13:29.625
"Ehrmich District"
Eren?

00:13:29.625 --> 00:13:32.000
"Ehrmich District"
What is it, Section Commander?

00:13:33.208 --> 00:13:34.292
Oh, well...

00:13:34.292 --> 00:13:40.292
I was finally able to get my hands on
the background report for Annie Leonhart.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:42.500
Annie's?

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:43.750
Yeah.

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:49.250
It's taken so long to get it because managing
these reports is such a mess right now.

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:51.000
According to this,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.417
there were two others belonging to the 104th
Cadet Corps who came from the same area as her.

00:13:59.417 --> 00:14:01.708
And those two are...

00:14:01.708 --> 00:14:05.708
...Reiner Braun... and Bertholdt Hoover.

00:14:12.583 --> 00:14:19.750
Thanks to the chaos five years ago, pretty much
all of their family records are spotty or missing.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:21.542
However...

00:14:21.542 --> 00:14:27.083
During the long-range scouting formation,
their unit was given false information.

00:14:27.083 --> 00:14:32.000
They were among those purposely told
that Eren was in the right wing.

00:14:34.333 --> 00:14:37.250
The Female Titan attacked from the right wing!

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:39.417
Huh? What does that mean?

00:14:39.417 --> 00:14:43.708
That it's possible they passed on
that information to Annie...

00:14:43.708 --> 00:14:45.708
Why? Why would they tell Annie?

00:14:45.708 --> 00:14:47.583
Hey, hold on a minute, Armin.

00:14:47.583 --> 00:14:48.500
You can't just--

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.333
I know that, Eren.

00:14:50.333 --> 00:14:53.542
By itself, that's not enough to prove anything.

00:14:54.708 --> 00:14:59.542
So just in case, I'd like to hear from you
how these three interacted during training.

00:14:59.542 --> 00:15:00.875
Know anything?

00:15:02.375 --> 00:15:05.792
I knew Reiner and Bertholdt
were from the same place, but...

00:15:05.792 --> 00:15:08.667
...they didn't seem close to Annie.

00:15:08.667 --> 00:15:09.750
I agree.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:14.708
I don't recall ever seeing the pair
talking to Annie that much.

00:15:14.708 --> 00:15:18.500
Well, Annie didn't talk much in the first place.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:23.583
When we ate, Annie would always sit alone
and munch on food by herself.

00:15:23.583 --> 00:15:25.542
Oh! I've got something!

00:15:25.542 --> 00:15:30.208
I heard a rumor she liked sweets,
even though she looks so grouchy!

00:15:30.208 --> 00:15:33.792
I... don't remember.

00:15:33.792 --> 00:15:35.083
But...

00:15:35.083 --> 00:15:39.167
As their comrade,
I'd find it hard to believe.

00:15:39.167 --> 00:15:41.417
Set aside Bertholdt, who doesn't say much.

00:15:41.417 --> 00:15:47.875
Reiner is like everyone's big brother,
and he's not devious enough to deceive all of us.

00:15:47.875 --> 00:15:50.042
I agree.

00:15:50.042 --> 00:15:54.000
Reiner gave everything he had
fighting the Female Titan with me.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.667
He would have gotten crushed
in her hand if he hadn't--

00:15:58.917 --> 00:16:00.167
What's wrong?

00:16:01.167 --> 00:16:04.417
Reiner managed to escape, but...

00:16:04.417 --> 00:16:07.292
...Annie suddenly changed her course...

00:16:07.292 --> 00:16:10.333
...and ran in the direction of Eren.

00:16:11.458 --> 00:16:12.917
I...

00:16:12.917 --> 00:16:17.542
I did mention that Eren might be
at the rear of the center rank.

00:16:17.542 --> 00:16:19.958
But Annie was too far away to hear...

00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:21.542
Seriously?

00:16:22.958 --> 00:16:27.250
Did Reiner seem overly interested
in Eren's location?

00:16:30.583 --> 00:16:34.250
Then... Where the hell is Eren?

00:16:35.625 --> 00:16:37.042
It can't be...

00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:44.167
I only started talking about Eren's position...

00:16:44.167 --> 00:16:47.333
...because Reiner was the one
who asked about it first.

00:16:48.625 --> 00:16:50.667
Furthermore...

00:16:50.667 --> 00:16:54.792
...when that happened, the Female
Titan was staring at her palm.

00:16:54.792 --> 00:16:58.750
He might have written a message
with his blades in her hand.

00:17:00.167 --> 00:17:02.000
Reiner could've...

00:17:10.708 --> 00:17:15.167
What the hell? Why are you
saying things like this?

00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:15.625
--You should--

00:17:15.625 --> 00:17:16.708
--Eren!
--You should--

00:17:17.667 --> 00:17:20.292
No... Everyone, listen up!

00:17:20.292 --> 00:17:26.083
Supposing that we find Reiner or Bertholdt,
act in such a way as to not reveal any suspicions.

00:17:26.083 --> 00:17:30.583
Of course, do not make any mention
of Annie Leonhart either.

00:17:30.583 --> 00:17:33.625
Regardless if they're Annie's accomplices or not,

00:17:33.625 --> 00:17:37.583
we need to lead them
deep underground and confine them.

00:17:37.583 --> 00:17:39.250
Does everyone understand?

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:40.500
Yes!

00:17:49.792 --> 00:17:52.875
You're just tired, aren't you?

00:17:52.875 --> 00:17:54.625
Right, Bertholdt?

00:17:54.625 --> 00:17:57.750
You've been through so much,
it's making you crazy.

00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:59.667
Y-Yeah.

00:17:59.667 --> 00:18:02.500
Reiner's just really tired.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:07.542
Besides, if you were really the Armored Titan
that wants to destroy humanity...

00:18:07.542 --> 00:18:11.417
...why would you be asking me
this in the first place?

00:18:11.417 --> 00:18:16.708
What did you think would happen?
That I'd nod and say "Sure, let's go"?

00:18:27.833 --> 00:18:30.000
Oh, right.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.750
That's right.

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:35.083
What the hell was I thinking?

00:18:36.792 --> 00:18:39.500
Have I really gone crazy?

00:18:42.333 --> 00:18:44.167
Come on, let's go.

00:19:15.333 --> 00:19:16.917
I see...

00:19:18.417 --> 00:19:19.958
That's it.

00:19:21.417 --> 00:19:24.875
I've been here too long for my own good.

00:19:26.667 --> 00:19:32.750
It's been three long years...
surrounded by nothing but idiots.

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:36.958
We were just kids... We didn't know anything.

00:19:38.792 --> 00:19:43.125
If only I never knew that
there were people like this...

00:19:43.125 --> 00:19:44.667
I...

00:19:45.667 --> 00:19:48.417
...wouldn't have become...

00:19:48.417 --> 00:19:51.333
...such a half-assed piece of shit!

00:19:53.458 --> 00:19:58.333
It's too late now...
I don't know what's right anymore.

00:19:58.333 --> 00:20:01.667
But the only choice for me now...

00:20:01.667 --> 00:20:04.917
...is to face the consequences of my actions...

00:20:06.208 --> 00:20:08.583
...and as a warrior...

00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:11.750
...fulfill my duty to the bitter end!

00:20:16.833 --> 00:20:17.875
Reiner!

00:20:17.875 --> 00:20:20.708
Are we doing it?! Now?! Right here?!

00:20:20.708 --> 00:20:22.083
Yeah.

00:20:22.083 --> 00:20:25.625
We settle this... right here, right now!

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.042
Eren!

00:20:39.042 --> 00:20:40.292
Run!

00:20:43.417 --> 00:20:44.875
Bertholdt!

00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:53.375
Eren! Get out of there!

00:21:32.542 --> 00:21:34.458
Ymir!

00:21:38.083 --> 00:21:39.208
Eren!

00:21:53.042 --> 00:21:55.917
I'm going to return to the hometown we lost.

00:21:55.917 --> 00:21:59.208
That's all I care about now.

00:22:05.792 --> 00:22:08.208
Bertholdt...

00:22:08.208 --> 00:22:09.833
Reiner...

00:22:14.458 --> 00:22:19.500
You damn traitors!

00:23:58.542 --> 00:24:01.167
The Colossal Titan...

00:24:01.167 --> 00:24:06.375
...as well as the Armored Titan,
engage the Scouts in battle.

00:24:06.375 --> 00:24:15.375
If their mission is to exterminate all of humanity,
there is no turning back for them now.

00:24:15.375 --> 00:24:19.208
Reiner and the others devote
their lives to the mission...

00:24:19.208 --> 00:24:22.417
...because they are warriors.

00:24:22.417 --> 00:24:27.094
