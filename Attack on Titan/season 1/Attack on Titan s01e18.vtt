WEBVTT

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.200
Now commencing the
57th Exterior Scouting Mission!

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.540
Move out!

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.370
We believe that the basement of
Eren Jaeger's home in Shiganshina

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.370
houses a secret of the Titans
that not even <i>he </i>is aware of.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.290
We are to head there.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.500
You rookies will be here,

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.370
between the wagon defense
squad and the scout support squad.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.000
Here, you will run alongside
spare horses and relay signals.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.080
Our special operations squad
will be positioned here,

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.120
on standby in the
rear of the center rank.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.120
This is the safest position

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.870
"Row 5, Center: Standby"
in the formation.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.540
Not even the supply wagons
get this level of treatment.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.290
This isn't an Abnormal...

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.700
--Cis!
--It has intelligence!

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.200
It's just like the Armored Titan,
the Colossal Titan, and Eren!

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.120
It's a human clad in a Titan body!

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.200
This one's <i>way </i>more
athletic than the other ones!

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.200
Damn! We were...

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.580
We were too naïve!

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.870
She's protecting her nape?!

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.870
Damn! There's no escape now!

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.830
Jean! Avenge that suicidal maniac!

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.330
She stopped?

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.080
It was her! She killed him!

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.910
That maniac finally got himself killed,
as part of the right wing!

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.700
She killed him!

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.620
I'd say we bought enough time!

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.950
Now let's get
away from her, quick!

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.250
Huh? Oh no...

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.700
Why?

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.540
Is she heading for Eren?!

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.580
<i>I won't let your deaths be meaningless</i>

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.700
<i>even if I'm the last one standing</i>

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.580
<i>In both hands, Gloria</i>

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.580
<i>What sings is Sieg</i>

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.790
<i>On my back, Flügel der Freiheit</i>

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.660
<i>Clenched determination to my left chest</i>

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.000
<i>What slashes across is Linie der Torheit</i>

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.250
<i>Soaring across the azure skies</i>

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.790
<i>Flügel der Freiheit</i>

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.290
"Forest of Giant Trees"
"The 57th Exterior Scouting Mission, Part 2"

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.500
How is your ODM gear, Armin?

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.830
It's all right. It unclasped properly,
so it doesn't seem to be broken.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.500
I see. That's good to hear.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.330
But now what?
We only have one horse.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.410
If Jean's horse comes back,
all three of us can get moving again, but...

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.290
Damn, what's the deal?

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.750
Reiner's horse came back;
why won't mine?

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.000
And we can't afford
to stay here any longer...

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.540
Worst case scenario,
we'll have to leave someone here...

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.370
How will we choose
who that someone should be?

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.910
Armin, because he's hurt?

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.700
Reiner, because he's big
and would be hard to ride with?

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.660
Or should I go look
for my horse on foot?

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.370
Damn!

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.950
It's screwed up that we
even have to consider that!

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.540
The three of us just
managed to escape death!

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.580
This is one hell of a raw deal!

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.450
Armin.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.330
Hey, Armin!

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.290
I take it you're
still a bit mixed-up?

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.580
Yeah.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.910
I'm still a little dazed...

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.290
I see.

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.830
Still, we need to decide now.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.250
It's a difficult choice, but it looks
like one of us has to stay behind.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.450
Wait!

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.250
Let's fire a smoke signal first.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.250
If the formation
kept moving forward,

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.580
Row 4, Squad 3
should be nearby now.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.330
That was an emergency
smoke signal.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.000
I doubt it's enough to
get our point across, though.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.830
Armin. We'll only
wait three minutes.

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.910
By then, we need
to choose who'll stay--

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.330
I'll stay.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:26.620
But, in exchange, I need
you to report about something.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.450
Only to Commander Erwin, if possible.

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:30.330
No, wait, Armin.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.250
You can report it yourself.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.200
Someone's coming!

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.160
And they've brought two horses!

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.500
That's...

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.910
Christa!

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:48.410
Guys! Are you okay?!

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.250
Huh? Hey, that's my horse!

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.540
Whoa, there.
Calm down, Buchwald!

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.910
He came racing my way;
something must've really spooked him.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.910
Did you guys fight a Titan?!

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.250
Armin!

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.910
You're hurt! Are you all right?!

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.910
Yes, more or less.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.370
I'm impressed you willingly came
here after seeing that smoke signal.

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:18.000
I happened to be nearby,
plus I'd found Jean's horse.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.500
You have a way with horses, not to
mention a remarkable sense of virtue.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.290
We owe you one.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.450
I'm just glad.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:33.080
So very glad that the worst
didn't happen to you guys...

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:39.750
She's a god...

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.160
A goddess...

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.410
I want to marry her...

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:47.000
Well, we better
hurry back into formation!

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Oh, yeah! There should
be orders to retreat soon!

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:57.000
Still, turning back not even
an hour after leaving the wall...

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.910
Things look way
grimmer than I thought.

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:04.540
Plus, she's headed <i>away </i>from the
lead command squad for some reason.

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:05.950
She?

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.500
Green smoke signals?!

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.910
It sounds like the plan is to change
course but otherwise continue the operation.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.580
Oh, no! They're not
ordering us to retreat?!

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.620
What the hell is
Commander Erwin thinking?!

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:26.750
All soldiers have the authority to
decide if the operation can't continue...

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.750
Have the signals not
reached the command squad?!

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:33.790
Whether or not they know, we only
have one option in this situation:

00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:35.870
defer to their judgment.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:45.750
Smoke signals. Green.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:47.910
Oruo. You fire it.

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:49.750
Understood, Sir!

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:53.160
It feels like we're making
smooth progress right now.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.330
But...

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:57.500
...I wonder how things <i>actually </i>are.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.620
I wonder if people have
already died on the front line...

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.250
Reporting, Sir!

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:03.950
It's an oral message!

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:06.250
Right wing spotters decimated!

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:08.500
Detection network partially out!

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:12.120
Please pass this
message on to the left!

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.910
You heard him, Petra. Go.

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:16.330
Yes, Sir!

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.620
The right wing?!

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.290
Isn't that where Armin is?

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:27.660
Still, he and the others
are positioned closer to the center.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.750
The Titans couldn't
have advanced that far in.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:33.620
Black signals?!

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.200
An Abnormal?!

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.330
Eren. You fire it.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.000
Y-Yes, Sir!

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.370
This is disgraceful.

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:45.040
We've let them get
pretty deep inside the formation.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:50.160
Just over there is a Titan...

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.120
Below that black smoke...

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.790
...someone is fighting?

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:08.500
Damn!

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.330
Look down here...

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.040
...you monster!

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.500
Now!

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.200
Three spots at once!

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.370
She seems pretty smart,
but she can't defend against them all!

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:37.700
Cut her spine, ligaments,
or anywhere else that can stop her!

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.540
Attack!

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.580
So many are dead 'cause of you!

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.120
We're gonna torture you to death!

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.910
She jumped?!

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:07.790
L-Let go!

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:38.700
Reporting takes priority!

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:43.410
I <i>have </i>to let
them know about that one!

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:51.950
An Abnormal?!

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:53.500
This far in?!

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.700
Let's take it out!

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.950
We can't let it get any further in!

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:15.950
The right wing's been wiped out?!

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:18.620
Then why aren't we retreating?!

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.200
"Row 3-1, Transport"
I don't know! Commander's orders!

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.160
"Row 3-1, Transport"
Just pass word on to the left!

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.540
What's the deal?

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:37.660
"Row 1-13: Spotting"
We've been going straight east for a while now.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.500
Yes, and our destination
is the old city to the south...

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:44.450
"Row 1-5: Spotting"
At this rate, the formation's going to run right into it!

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:45.750
Yeah.

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:47.750
There it is.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:50.120
A forest of giant trees!

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.910
It looks like Titans
have passed through here.

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:13.250
The path is devoid of vegetation.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.500
Even the wagons
could get through here.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.620
Inform those behind us

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:26.290
that only the center wagon
defense squad is to enter the forest.

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:27.700
Yes, Sir!

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:43.790
Excuse me, Sir...

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:47.290
It looks like the center rank
is taking that forest path.

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:50.660
That means we'll
run smack into the forest.

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:53.830
Then we go around.

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:55.660
Y-Yes, Sir!

00:13:58.410 --> 00:13:59.660
Hey, now.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:02.580
What are we doing at
this sightseeing attraction?!

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.330
Now we're <i>really </i>straying

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:07.660
from our original
destination and return point!

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.580
I don't know...

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:12.910
I don't know, but this is
what Commander Erwin decided.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:15.750
He seems to have
some plan in mind, but...

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:18.250
Plan? Are you kidding me?

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:22.500
What, is he gonna throw a welcome
party for us rookies at this tourist spot?

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.910
No, I don't think so.

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:26.870
That was a joke.

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:30.620
Either way, we got
that giant broad after us.

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:35.620
Regardless of what plan he has,
we can't afford to stop here.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:40.410
My guess is we're passing through
here on our way to somewhere else.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:42.410
All soldiers, halt!

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:48.750
All right! Listen up, rookies!

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:51.250
We're now going to
take up intercept positions!

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:53.620
Unsheathe and wait in the trees!

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:57.500
If any Titans try to enter the forest,
stop them with full force!

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:58.660
Huh?

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:00.580
Umm, Sir? Why would we need to--

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.790
Shut up and follow orders!

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:08.450
You gotta be kidding me...

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:11.040
What the hell's happening?!

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.290
H-Hey.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:19.200
It looks like only the
center rank went into the forest.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.290
What does that mean
for the formation?

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:23.700
There is no formation anymore.

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:29.000
The forest is blocking us side squads,
so our only choice is to go around.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.370
We've lost our spotting capabilities.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.500
Why didn't we change course
and avoid the forest altogether?

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.830
Did Commander Erwin
misread his map or something?

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:40.540
I don't know.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:45.790
It's possible we got pushed here trying
to avoid the threat on the right side.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:47.200
Maybe.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.750
This is insane...

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:02.830
First we abandon our original
plan of establishing a logistics base...

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:06.660
Then, instead of running home with
our tails between our legs like we should,

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:10.200
we go on a daring sightseeing tour...

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:13.040
And, if that wasn't enough,

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.540
now we're just supposed to stand here
and keep Titans out of the forest?

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:23.200
Him and his idiotic orders...

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.620
He's gonna hear you.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:28.500
And he doesn't even explain anything.
That's a new one to me.

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:32.700
But I doubt he's all that
calm on the inside either.

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.080
What do you mean?

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:38.870
Sometimes leaders get deemed incompetent
by their men in extreme situations

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:43.000
and end up dying from
mysterious stab wounds to the back.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.750
It's not that rare, is all I'm saying.

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:50.040
Jean... What are you thinking of doing?

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.250
Relax, will you?

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:55.660
I'm just a little irritated at
this whole situation.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:17:00.250
I'm gonna follow orders, of course.

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:02.830
Keeping Titans out of the forest...

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:07.750
You agree that's
what we should do too, right?

00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:11.410
You look like you know something.

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:12.830
Uhh...

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:16.120
5-meter Titan approaching!

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:26.660
Why did he bring the platoon here?

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:30.950
Just what is
Commander Erwin thinking?

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:35.290
No, that's not right.
That isn't what I should be asking.

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:38.120
What I should be asking is...

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.120
...what if the Female Titan
<i>is </i>pursuing Eren

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:45.330
and the commander is aware of that?

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:47.330
Captain!

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.120
Captain Levi!

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.500
What?

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:53.700
"What?" This is a forest, Sir!

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:56.580
We have no way of detecting
approaching Titans this far in

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.040
with only the center rank!

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.620
Something seems to be on our right too.

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:05.950
How are we supposed to avoid
the Titans or protect the wagons now?!

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:09.040
Quit whining about the obvious.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:12.120
We can't do any
of those things anymore.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.200
B-But why--?!

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:19.330
Take a good look around, Eren.
See all these absurdly huge trees?

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:25.790
This is <i>the </i>perfect environment
for using omni-directional mobility gear.

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:30.540
And use that middling
head of yours to think.

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.950
Use your brain for
once if you don't wanna die.

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:35.370
Yes, Sir!

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.750
I see...

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:41.910
I'm still new to this; <i>that's </i>why
I don't understand the situation.

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:44.200
And he won't give me a simple answer

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.160
because I still need to learn for myself.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:51.620
I bet that's how these
experts learned to fight, too.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:56.120
Dammit, what are we doing here?

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.750
Seriously...

00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:01.540
What the hell's going on?

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:02.790
Huh?!

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:04.500
Don't tell me...?!

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:10.790
Don't tell me <i>no one</i>
knows what's going on?!

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:15.200
Not even Captain Levi?!

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:21.200
If my theory that the Female
Titan is after Eren is correct,

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.540
then there's only one
reason why we've come here.

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:28.450
Commander Erwin
intends to confront her here!

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:29.870
Armin.

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:36.000
Our orders are to
"keep Titans out of the forest," right?

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:39.290
In other words...

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:43.580
We don't need to
actually <i>fight </i>them...

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:45.410
...right?

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:21.910
--A black smoke signal?!
--From right behind us!

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:25.080
Must be whatever's on the right!

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.700
Draw your swords.

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:35.160
If it shows itself,
we'll only have a moment.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:20:59.910
Move!

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:15.500
It's fast!

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:18.370
There's no way to
avoid it inside this forest!

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:19.620
It's catching up!

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.250
Captain! Let's switch to ODM!

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:23.660
Captain!

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:27.580
You're not going anywhere!

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.120
Reinforcements from the rear!

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:47.160
Captain! Give your orders!

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.950
Let's take it out! It's dangerous!

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:51.910
<i>We </i>should take care of it!

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:55.830
I'll cut it to shreds!

00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:00.660
Idiot! You walked
right into your own doom!

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:04.500
What you're chasing is
a team of expert Titan-killers!

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.830
Captain Levi!

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:10.830
Captain!

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:14.290
--Please give us orders!
--It's about to catch up to us!

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:15.870
Let's take it out here!

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:19.790
That's why we entered
this forest! Isn't it, Captain?!

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:22.120
Captain! Your orders!

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:27.620
Everyone, cover your ears.

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:57.750
<i>If, by chance, I'm not me</i>

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:03.000
<i>then who's to say that you're you?</i>

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.290
<i>Can you pick up the pieces of your heart</i>

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:13.410
<i>that fell apart like a broken sand castle?</i>

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:18.410
<i>The voice of someone calling out</i>

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:22.500
<i>changed into ringing in my ears</i>

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:27.660
<i>It's as if time has stopped</i>

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.450
<i>Now wake up</i>

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:35.750
<i>I made my way out of the deep darkness</i>

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:41.000
<i>I fled like a swift wind</i>

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:48.500
<i>We used to be like living corpses,</i>

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.540
<i>but now we head beyond the walls</i>

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.580
<i>Let's meet again</i>

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:57.410
<i>in a place not on any map</i>

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:14.290
The Female Titan makes chase,
leaving a bloodbath behind.

00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:19.330
Eren can only flee as he watches
his comrades die before his very eyes.

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:21.830
Amid this, he's forced to make a decision.

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:23.370
"Bite"
"The 57th Exterior Scouting Mission, Part 3"
