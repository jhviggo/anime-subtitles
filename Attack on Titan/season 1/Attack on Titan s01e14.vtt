00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.120
Hey. Answer the damn
question, you twit.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.540
What do you want to do?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.750
I want to join the Scouts...

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.700
...and slaughter every Titan I can!

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.830
Ah. Not bad.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.000
Erwin. I'll take
responsibility for him.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.500
Let the higher-ups know.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.620
I don't necessarily
trust him, though.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.040
If he betrays us
or goes out of control,

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.790
I'll kill him on the spot.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.000
The top brass won't complain.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.200
Because I'm the only
one cut out for this.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.160
You're in.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.120
I'll make you a
member of the Scouts.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.620
<i>I won't let your deaths be meaningless</i>

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.750
<i>even if I'm the last one standing</i>

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.620
<i>In both hands, Gloria</i>

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.620
<i>What sings is Sieg</i>

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.870
<i>On my back, Flügel der Freiheit</i>

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.700
<i>Clenched determination to my left chest</i>

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.040
<i>What slashes across is Linie der Torheit</i>

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.290
<i>Soaring across the azure skies</i>

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.830
<i>Flügel der Freiheit</i>

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.290
"Can't Look into His Eyes Yet"
"Eve of the Counterattack, Part 1"

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.080
Hey, is it true that a
Titan sided with humans?

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.330
That's obviously just a rumor.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.040
I bet the recapture plan failed

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.540
and loads of people from
Wall Rose are gonna flee here.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.500
"Interior of Wall Sina"

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.580
If that happens, we'll have
food shortages in no time flat.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.290
Man, please tell me
those Wall Rose people

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.750
aren't gonna show up here
with this Titan friend of theirs...

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.830
"Wall Sina"
"Wall Rose"

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.200
This is huge news!

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.330
"Interior of Wall Rose"
We have a Titan on our side now!

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.120
Who knows, maybe we
can even retake Wall Maria!

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.000
It's almost like it's... it's...

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.580
...our savior!

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.000
Oh!

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.160
Savior, huh?

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.790
Throughout history, commoners
have always been a rash lot.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.450
I can see this triggering a
revolt against the central powers...

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.870
Not if we, the Military Police,
dispose of Eren Jaeger first.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.790
I won't let those Scout
Regiment deviants have him.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.290
Fall in!

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.160
Hail to the Premier!

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.660
It's certainly hot.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.160
Commander Pyxis.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.660
You're the top commander
of the Garrison Regiment

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.620
and I'm a commanding officer
of the Scout Regiment.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.870
Won't some disapprove of
us meeting like this?

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.370
Oh, you're as straight-laced
as the rumors say.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.950
Still, this is just a morning walk.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.120
We only met by happenstance.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.040
So, let's chat during our little stroll.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.040
Have you heard that the Military Police

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.830
wants to take custody of Eren Jaeger?

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.160
Yes, I received word yesterday.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.660
They're going to hold
a deliberation on the matter.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.660
Mm.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.950
It falls entirely
to Zachary to decide

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.370
whether the Scouts get him
or the Military Police gets him.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.000
Zachary...

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.950
You mean Premier Dhalis Zachary?

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.660
He oversees the three regiments:

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.790
the Military Police, the Garrison
Regiment, and the Scouts.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.620
He will base his decision on one thing:

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.370
whether his existence is
beneficial or harmful for humanity.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.120
If he deems him a detriment, he won't
hesitate to have Eren executed.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.830
Right there, on the spot, even.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.120
I don't want them to kill Eren.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.790
But, unfortunately,
many in the Garrison Regiment

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.410
are fearful of Eren's ability.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:52.250
The most I can do is avoid
agreeing with the Military Police.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.830
Are the odds in your favor?

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.250
No.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.410
But we <i>do </i>have a proposal ready.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.040
Whether or not it'll work depends
on how the debate unfolds.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.870
You'll be playing it entirely
by ear, in other words?

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.200
Our line of work
takes us outside the walls.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.000
We always play things by ear.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.620
It seems you're
not so uptight after all.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.250
This has been a nice walk,
Commander Smith.

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.200
A debate over Eren?

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.200
What for?

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.700
I'm not really sure,

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.000
but I think it's about
what they plan to do with him.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.750
What do you mean?

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.540
My guess...

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.950
...is they're going to decide
if he should live or die...

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:53.080
Are Mikasa Ackermann
and Armin Arlelt here?!

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.700
Yes!

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:59.000
You are ordered to attend this
afternoon's deliberation as witnesses!

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.250
Excuse me! I need to use the toilet...

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:11.870
You just went!

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:14.410
Please give me some water!

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:15.830
Hey!

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.120
Know your place, monster.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.160
Monster...

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.370
Yeah, that might be the case...

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.500
But am I so terrifying that
I need to be restrained this much?

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.790
I guess I can't blame them, though.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.250
Even I don't understand any of this.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:43.580
At least they haven't killed me yet...

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.370
Come to think of it,

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:51.950
<i>they </i>weren't afraid of me at all.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.790
What are they doing now?

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:03.700
What happened to all the others?

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:10.450
Just hang on a little longer.

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:13.830
We'll try to arrange things somehow.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.580
How many days has it been since then?

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.200
What's going on on the outside?

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:24.410
I'm... not going to spend the
rest of my life in here, am I?

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.950
So you're Eren, huh?

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.370
You okay? How are things?

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.830
I'm sorry you've had to wait so long.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.410
But now you have a
chance to finally get out.

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:46.370
Except...

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.790
...you'll have to put these on.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:57.790
I'm Hange Zoë, a section
commander in the Scout Regiment.

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:00.950
And this is Miche Zacharius,
also a section commander.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:02.660
U-Umm...

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:08.540
Oh, he always sniffs people like
that when he first meets them.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.870
He has a habit of
laughing through his nose.

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:13.830
I doubt he means anything by it.

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:18.120
Oddness aside, he <i>is </i>skilled enough
to be a section commander.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.580
Oops!

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.200
Sorry! I just prattled on, didn't I?

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.160
We're already here, but...

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.160
No, it'll be okay!

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.620
It's actually better if I don't explain!

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.040
W-Wait...!

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:39.950
It's selfish of us, but all we
can do is put blind faith in you.

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:41.500
--Good luck!
--Huh?!

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:58.040
A courthouse?

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.870
I was in the basement of a courthouse?

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:03.290
Get moving!

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:15.700
Kneel down!

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:28.500
What's with all these people?

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.450
In fact, what is this trial even about?!

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.000
Guys!

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.040
Shall we begin?

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:52.410
You are Eren Jaeger,

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:57.290
a soldier who has sworn
to give his life for the people.

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:58.950
Is that correct?

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.410
Yes.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.290
Given the extraordinary circumstances,

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:04.370
this deliberation will be held
as a court-martial;

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.910
regular law will not apply,
in other words.

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:11.330
I have full decision-making
authority in this matter,

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:15.660
which includes determining
whether you should live or die.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.250
Just as I thought!

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:18.910
Any objections?

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:21.790
No, Sir.

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:24.200
Your astuteness is appreciated.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.540
I'll get right to the point.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:31.290
As expected, concealing your
existence has proved impossible.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:35.120
Unless we publicly disclose your
existence in one fashion or another

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.950
we risk the outbreak
of a new, non-Titan threat.

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:44.700
It falls to me to decide which
regiment should take charge of you.

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.950
The Military Police Regiment...

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:48.700
Or the Scout Regiment...

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:53.160
Now let's hear what the
Military Police Regiment proposes.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.160
Yes, Sir.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.160
I, Nile Dawk, Commander
of the Military Police,

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.790
offer the following proposal.

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:03.580
We believe that, after a thorough
examination of Eren's body,

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:06.450
he should be disposed of immediately.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.160
It's true that his Titan ability
helped thwart this latest incursion.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:19.040
However, his existence is now
stirring up rebellious ideas as well.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:23.370
As such, after he's provided us
with as much information as possible,

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:27.000
he will be made a
fallen warrior of humanity.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.120
There's no need!

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.580
He is vermin that
has defiled and infiltrated

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.790
--...the walls built by God's great wisdom!
--He's with the Wall cult!

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:37.040
--He should be killed at once!
--Everyone ignored them five years ago...

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.450
--Pastor Nick. Please remain quiet.
--...but they've really grown in power.

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:44.250
Next, let us hear the Scout Regiment's idea.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:45.830
Yes, Sir.

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:49.250
I, Erwin Smith, 13th Commander
of the Scout Regiment,

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:51.660
offer the following proposal.

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:56.250
We intend to accept Eren as an
official member of the Scout Regiment

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:59.790
and utilize his Titan
ability to retake Wall Maria.

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:03.410
That is all.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.120
Hmm? That's all?

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.450
Yes, Sir.

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:12.160
With his help, we <i>can </i>reclaim Wall Maria.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.700
I believe it is clear what
our utmost priority should be.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.370
I see.

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:22.580
Tell me, from where
would you launch this operation?

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:23.790
Pyxis.

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:27.870
The wall has been completely
sealed in Trost District, correct?

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.120
Yes.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.330
I doubt its gate will ever open again.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:35.500
We hope to depart from
Calaneth District, to the east.

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.160
From there we would
approach Shiganshina

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.620
by establishing a
new route from scratch.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.250
Just a damn minute!

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:45.500
Shouldn't we be
sealing <i>all </i>the gates now?!

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:49.160
The gates are the only part
the Colossal Titan can break!

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.910
If we can just reinforce them,
we'll never get attacked again!

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:55.200
Shut up, you merchant dog!

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.330
With a Titan's help
we can return to Wall Maria!

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:03.370
We can't put up with any more of
your childish heroics!

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:05.410
You have a big mouth on you, swine.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.290
What guarantee is there

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:11.700
that the Titans will kindly
wait while we bolster the gates?

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:15.660
When you say "we",
you mean the friends you're protecting

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.660
so you can fatten yourselves up.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.160
Are you pigs blind to the people

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.200
who struggle to survive
off what little land is left?

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:28.620
I'm just saying that all we have to
do is seal the gates if we want to live!

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.750
Hold your tongue, you miscreant!

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:33.620
You would suggest

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:37.080
that humans meddle with
Wall Rose, a gift from God?!

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:41.120
That wall is a divine miracle that
transcends human understanding!

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.120
--Do you still not realize...
--It's their fault...

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.410
--...that humanity must not touch it!
--...it took so long to arm the tops of the walls.

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:49.370
They have that much support and power now.

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.250
They're a bad sort.

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:52.450
Th-That's disrespectful!

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:54.750
Shut it, you lousy priest!

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:56.160
What?!

00:14:58.540 --> 00:14:59.790
Order!

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:04.160
I ask that you save your personal
sentiments for another venue.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.290
I wish to make certain
of something, Mr. Jaeger.

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:11.120
As a soldier, can you
continue to serve humanity

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.830
by controlling your Titan ability?

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:16.000
Yes, Sir! I can!

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.250
Oh?

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:22.500
But it says here in this
report about the Trost battle

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:27.620
that just after transforming, you swung
your fists at Mikasa Ackermann.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:33.450
He doesn't remember
that he wasn't in control...

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:37.160
What, you expect me to lie in a report?

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.910
Hiding this fact wouldn't do
humanity any good.

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:42.700
And who is Mikasa Ackermann?

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:45.000
I am, Sir.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.540
You, huh?

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:50.790
Is it true that Jaeger,
in Titan form, attacked you?

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:56.200
It's in Eren's best interest
that you answer honestly.

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:03.950
Yes. It's true.

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.620
I knew it! A Titan's a Titan!

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:11.580
I tried to kill Mikasa?!

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:13.000
<i>Me</i>?!

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:14.950
However...

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:21.040
He also saved my life on two
prior occasions while in Titan form.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.540
The first time,

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:25.540
just as I was about to
fall into the hands of a Titan,

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:30.040
he intervened and protected me.

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:37.000
The second time, he protected
Armin and me from a bombardment.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.410
I ask that you take these facts
into consideration as well.

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.500
Just a minute!

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.500
I believe that her testimony

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.450
is also very driven by personal feelings.

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:51.750
It should be noted that Mikasa Ackermann
lost her parents at a young age

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:54.830
and was taken in by the Jaeger family.

00:16:56.410 --> 00:17:00.040
What's more, our own
investigation into this matter

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.410
led us to a most surprising discovery.

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:08.370
Eren Jaeger and Mikasa Ackermann,
at the age of nine,

00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:11.950
stabbed and killed
three adult robber-kidnappers.

00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:15.660
Even if it <i>was </i>in self-defense,

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:19.830
we cannot help but
question his basic humanity.

00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:22.540
Should we <i>really </i>place
personnel and funds in his hands,

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:26.410
not to mention the very fate of humanity?!

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:27.580
Yeah!

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:31.120
He's clearly a Titan that's snuck
in by taking the form of a child!

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.540
Her too!

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:35.120
I bet she's not human at all!

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.120
Yeah! We should
dissect her just to be safe!

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.540
Hold on!

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:43.120
I might be a monster,
but she has nothing to do with this!

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.290
Nothing at all!

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:46.450
--Like we can believe you!
--It's the truth!

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:49.910
--She <i>is </i>one if you hafta protect her!
--No!

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.620
No... It's not like that.

00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:03.580
But you're all using speculation
to push your own selfish agendas!

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:06.000
Wh-What?!

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.580
In fact...

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:08.580
Is this bad?

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:13.000
...none of you have even <i>seen</i>
a Titan, so why are you so afraid?!

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Maybe I should stop talking...

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.200
No, I'm gonna tell 'em
<i>everything </i>I think!

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:25.330
What's the use of having power
if you're not going to fight?!

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:30.410
If you're afraid of fighting for
your lives, then help me!

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:33.000
You... cowards!

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:33.750
What?

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:35.700
Just shut up...

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:38.160
...and invest everything in me!

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:44.620
Take aim!

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:46.040
Yes, Sir!

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.450
Huh?

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:04.200
Wait, Mikasa!

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.580
My personal belief

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:15.910
is that <i>pain </i>is the best tool
for teaching discipline.

00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:18.410
What you need now

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:21.620
is to be taught a lesson,
not given a talking-to.

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:25.160
And you happen to be
in perfect kicking position.

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:37.410
Wait, Levi!

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:38.830
What?

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:41.830
That's dangerous.

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:45.250
What if he gets mad
and turns into a Titan?

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:49.910
Don't be silly.

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:53.450
<i>You </i>guys are gonna
dissect him, aren't you?

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:57.410
When he was transformed,

00:19:57.410 --> 00:20:00.790
he apparently managed to kill twenty
Titans before running out of strength.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.120
As an enemy, his intelligence
makes him all the more dangerous.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.450
Even so, I could handle him just fine.

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:12.040
But could you?

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:15.450
Whoever dares to torment
him had better think long and hard.

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:17.750
<i>Can </i>you actually kill him?

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:21.540
Sir. I have a proposition.

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:22.950
What is it?

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:28.500
Eren's Titan ability includes
too many uncertainties

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.290
which pose an ever-present danger.

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:34.950
As such, we will place Eren
under Captain Levi's supervision

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:36.870
and conduct a recon
mission outside the wall.

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:39.160
With Eren accompanying you?

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.250
Yes, Sir.

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:43.950
Based on the results of said mission,

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:47.580
you can decide if Eren
has control over his Titan ability

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.290
and if his existence
is of benefit to humankind.

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:53.790
Supervising Eren Jaeger, huh...

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:56.700
Can you do this, Levi?

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.580
Oh, I can most definitely kill him.

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:03.870
The <i>real </i>problem is
that there's no middle ground.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.290
I've reached my decision.

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:18.910
Man, talk about harsh...

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:21.330
--I bet it hurts.
--A little...

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:24.660
--So, how exactly does it hurt?
--Huh?

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.540
I'm sorry about that.

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:30.200
But it <i>did </i>get you placed in our custody.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.620
Yes...

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:33.200
The pain was worth it.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:37.370
It let us play our trump card
when it would be most effective.

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.950
You have my admiration.

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:45.080
Eren. I look forward to working with you.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.830
R-Right! Thank you, Sir!

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.290
Tell me, Eren.

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:53.160
Y-Yes?

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.790
Do you resent me?

00:21:54.790 --> 00:21:56.370
N-No.

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:59.200
I understand it was
a necessary performance.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.330
Good, then.

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:03.120
Still, you didn't have to go so far.

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.540
You knocked his tooth out!

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:08.250
--See?
--Don't pick that up. It's disgusting.

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:10.660
This is a precious sample of its own.

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:14.620
Eren. Be thankful you aren't
getting dissected by people like her.

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:17.160
Don't compare me with them.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.290
I would never kill Eren.

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:24.080
Hey, Eren. Let me
see inside your mouth.

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:33.700
The tooth...

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.370
...has already grown back...

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:57.700
<i>If, by chance, I'm not me</i>

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:02.950
<i>then who's to say that you're you?</i>

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:08.250
<i>Can you pick up the pieces of your heart</i>

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:13.370
<i>that fell apart like a broken sand castle?</i>

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:18.370
<i>The voice of someone calling out</i>

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:22.450
<i>changed into ringing in my ears</i>

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:27.620
<i>It's as if time has stopped</i>

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:30.410
<i>Now wake up</i>

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:35.700
<i>I made my way out of the deep darkness</i>

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:40.950
<i>I fled like a swift wind</i>

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:48.450
<i>We used to be like living corpses,</i>

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:50.500
<i>but now we head beyond the walls</i>

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:52.540
<i>Let's meet again</i>

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:57.370
<i>in a place not on any map</i>

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:14.120
After achieving his dream
of joining the Scout Regiment,

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.910
Eren discovers that the Scouts
are a band of people

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:21.000
who seek change, as well as a haven
of eccentrics and oddballs.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.410
"Special Operations Squad"
"Eve of the Counterattack, Part 2"
