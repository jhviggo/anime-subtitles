WEBVTT

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.000
You... cowards!

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.660
Just shut up...

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.200
...and invest everything in me!

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.250
What you need now

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.370
is to be taught a lesson,
not given a talking-to.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.540
I've reached my decision.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.410
Eren was placed in the
Scout Regiment's custody

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.120
in preparation for a scouting
mission beyond the wall.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.750
<i>I won't let your deaths be meaningless</i>

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.870
<i>even if I'm the last one standing</i>

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.750
<i>In both hands, Gloria</i>

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.750
<i>What sings is Sieg</i>

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.950
<i>On my back, Flügel der Freiheit</i>

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.790
<i>Clenched determination to my left chest</i>

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.120
<i>What slashes across is Linie der Torheit</i>

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.370
<i>Soaring across the azure skies</i>

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.950
<i>Flügel der Freiheit</i>

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.290
"Special Operations Squad"
"Eve of the Counterattack, Part 2"

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.370
"Trost District"

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.370
"Old Scout Regiment Headquarters"

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.250
The old Scout Regiment headquarters...

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.620
Just as you'd expect
from a renovated old castle,

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.250
it looks fancy and all.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.500
But being so far
from the wall and the river

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.500
it wound up being
totally useless for the Scouts.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.080
That was back in the early days,
when everyone had high hopes.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.910
Still, to think that
this oversized decoration

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.500
would end up as the
perfect holding place for you now...

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.080
Don't get cocky, rookie.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.540
Come again?!

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.700
I dunno if you're a Titan or what,

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.120
but don't assume Captain Levi's gonna stick
with some wet-behind-the-ears brat like--

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.580
Talking on a horse is a guaranteed
way to bite your tongue.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.870
First impressions are important.
I had that rookie scared stiff.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.620
Actually, I think he was
shocked at how dumb you are.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.500
Whatever the case,
it went exactly as I planned.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.910
Hey. You didn't used
to talk like that, you know.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.450
If, by some chance,
you're trying to imitate Captain Levi...

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.290
...could you cut it out?

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.790
You're nothing
like him at all, actually.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.540
Are you trying to nag me, Petra?

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.200
If you wanna act like you're my wife,
there's more you need to do first...

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.000
I wish you <i>had </i>bitten
your tongue off and died,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.950
bragging all about how
many Titans you've killed...

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.750
Don't worry.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.830
I bragged about you too,
while I was at it.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.370
They're the members of the
Scout Regiment's Special Operations Squad...

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.250
Also known as the "Levi Squad."

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.540
Sheesh, you're disgraceful!

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.870
Petra Rall.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.330
10 Titans killed, and 48 kill-assists.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.540
Oruo Bozad. 39 kills and 9 assists.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.790
They're as elite as they come.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.250
Eld Gin. 14 kills, 32 assists.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.790
Gunther Schultz. 7 kills, 40 assists.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.000
Each is an accomplished Scout
personally handpicked by Captain Levi.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.410
And...

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.330
They're the people who'll end up
killing me if I ever go out of control.

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.080
There are weeds everywhere.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.790
The place has really gone to hell...

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.290
It hasn't been used in a long time.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.330
I bet it's plenty dusty on the inside too.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.290
That's a serious problem.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.620
Let's get to work at once.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.870
I've finished cleaning upstairs!

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.160
Where in this facility am I to sleep, Sir?

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.120
Your room's in the basement.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.410
The basement... again?

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.080
Of course.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.500
You don't have full control of yourself.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.450
Should you turn
into a Titan in your sleep,

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.370
we can keep you restrained right
there in the basement.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.040
That was one of the conditions I was
given when I took custody of you.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.330
It's a rule we have to follow.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.910
I'll go check your work.

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.200
You take over here, Eren.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.620
Yes, Sir.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.370
You look disappointed, Eren.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:13.290
Huh?!

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:17.950
Oh, I hope you don't mind if
I call you "Eren" like Captain Levi does.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.450
He sets the rules here.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:21.450
I see.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:26.370
I don't mind, but did I really
look disappointed just now?

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.620
It's not an unusual reaction.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.870
He's not quite the great, perfect hero
society makes him out to be, huh?

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.250
The <i>real </i>Captain Levi
is shorter than you'd expect,

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.040
temperamental,
crude, and unsociable.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.040
No, what surprises
me is how serious he is

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.450
about adhering to the
higher-ups' arrangement.

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:49.450
You thought that because
he's strong and skilled

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.370
he didn't have to follow
the rules like everyone else?

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.120
Right.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.410
I thought that he didn't
take orders from anyone...

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.910
I don't really know the details myself,

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:02.830
but I think he might've
been like that at one time.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.040
They say before he joined the Scouts,

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.950
Captain Levi was an infamous rogue
in the capital's underground market.

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.910
So how did he...?

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.330
Beats me.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.660
I don't know what happened,

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.870
but I hear he wound up
being dragged into the Scouts

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.370
after giving in to Commander Erwin.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.200
The commander?

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:26.950
Hey, Eren!

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.040
Y-Yes?!

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.500
It's completely unacceptable.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.620
Do it all over again.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.500
An expedition thirty days from now

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.040
to establish a logistic base
outside the wall...

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.700
<i>...and </i>newly-graduated rookies
will be participating too?

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.120
Assuming any rookies <i>do </i>join us.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:52.160
Whatever the case, this all seems
a bit too hasty if you ask me.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.700
Eren's current treatment is only temporary.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:59.160
We need to demonstrate to the
central powers as quickly as possible

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.450
that his existence is
beneficial for humankind.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.950
Otherwise, the Military Police
or someone else will interfere again--

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:09.330
Are you using rhetoric on me too, Erwin?

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:18.080
I see your nose is
as sharp as ever, Miche.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:22.830
Not as sharp as yours, though.

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:25.450
I'll fill you in when the time is right.

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:36.540
I assume our orders to remain on
standby will last for a few more days,

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:39.120
but I hear they're planning a
major expedition beyond the wall

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.250
<i>thirty </i>days from now.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:45.330
And that fresh graduates are going
to participate right off the bat too.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.330
Is that true, Eld?

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.580
That seems pretty sudden to me,

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:54.870
especially since the rookies already
had to endure this latest Titan attack.

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:58.120
I bet those brats
were scared out of their wits.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.540
Is this true, Sir?

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:03.330
I'm not in charge of
coming up with missions.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.290
But, knowing Erwin,

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:08.410
he's put far more thought
into this than we have.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:12.410
Indeed, there's never
been a situation like this before.

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:16.200
So many lives were lost establishing
a route to reclaim Wall Maria.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.500
Just when it seemed
like it went up in smoke,

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:22.250
suddenly a completely
different hope has presented itself.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.000
It's <i>still </i>hard to believe,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.790
but how does this "changing into
a Titan" thing work anyway, Eren?

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:41.580
My memories of it aren't very clear,

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.910
but it's like being in a trance...

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:47.330
I set it off by inflicting self-harm, though.

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.290
I take my hand like so and...

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:50.290
Huh?

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:54.910
Come to think of it,
why is this the only thing I know?

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:57.750
You guys know you can't
get any more info out of him

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.910
than what's in the reports.

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:03.620
Not that <i>she </i>won't try, of course.

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:10.290
Better hope <i>you </i>don't end up
dead when she tinkers with you, Eren.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.290
Huh? Who's "she"?!

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:20.870
Good evening,
members of the Levi Squad!

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.330
How is castle life treating you?

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:24.660
You're early.

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.200
I just couldn't help myself!

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.950
Section Commander Hange...

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.080
Sorry for the wait, Eren!

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:36.410
I'm actually in charge of examining
two Titans we caught in town.

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:39.700
I'd like you to help with
my experiments tomorrow,

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.000
so I came to get your permission.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.620
Experiments?

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.370
--What would I have to do?
--Why...

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.700
...<i>the </i>most exhilarating thing of all, of course!

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:55.410
U-Umm, I'm not in a position
to give permission myself.

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:58.540
I don't have authority over
myself, you see...

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:01.660
Levi! What are Eren's
plans for tomorrow?

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:02.660
Cleaning the garden.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.370
Great! It's decided!

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.660
Eren! I look forward to tomorrow!

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:12.250
Uh... right.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:15.330
But what kind of Titan experiments
are we talking about here?

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:16.750
Hmm?

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:20.370
Err, as I said, what
kind of experiments are we...

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:22.450
Hey, stop! Don't ask that!

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:25.410
Ah... I knew it...

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:29.120
I <i>thought </i>you might
be curious enough to ask...

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.330
You want to know that badly, do you?

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.790
Well, if you insist,

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.790
then I guess I'd
better tell you allll about

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:52.120
the little ones we recently caught...

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:07.080
I began by repeating
the same experiment

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.540
that we've conducted
during five previous captures.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:13.290
Hello!

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:19.790
First was an attempt at communication.

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:21.660
How are you feeling?

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:22.830
What's your name?

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:24.370
Are you in pain?

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:27.330
S-Section Commander! You're too close!

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:31.450
Hello!

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:32.700
Nice weather, isn't it?

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:34.330
Are you hungry?

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:37.660
Whoa! That was close!

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.620
That's dangerous,
Section Commander!

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:41.700
Unfortunately, I had to conclude

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:45.950
that there's no hope of
communicating with these ones either.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.160
However, my time spent
interacting with the Titans

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.540
was fulfilling enough to make
me forget my daily exhaustion.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:01.910
Once upon a time, there existed
a clan that ate humans.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:07.830
And I don't mean you Titans.
I'm talking about a clan of people.

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:11.750
They would hide in
caves on mountainsides

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.410
and attack any
travelers who passed by.

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:19.700
They would steal their valuables,
kill them, and eat their flesh.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:23.120
Here we go again.
<i>Another </i>of her naming ceremonies.

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.830
Yeah. What'd she
call the last ones again?

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:28.120
Chikatiloni and Albert.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:33.500
Ultimately, they kept this
up for twenty-five years,

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:37.660
during which time they supposedly
preyed upon over 500 people.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:43.750
Probably more humans
than <i>you've </i>eaten, in fact.

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:48.120
They also tried eating them
in all sorts of ways.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.830
Making steaks out of rump meat...

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:54.080
Dicing up leg meat and adding it to a stew...

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.750
Grinding tough meat into patties and frying it...

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:01.790
Making sausages from
blood clots and innards...

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:05.910
Indeed, they possessed
the concept of "cooking"!

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:08.330
That's where they differ from you.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:12.500
However, this clan of cannibals
was caught and executed

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:15.830
after making one single mistake.

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:18.410
That's where you're just like them.

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:22.080
You guys made the
mistake of attacking humankind

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.160
and wound up caught.

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:27.870
So I'm going to name you two

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:32.200
after the man who
was the leader of this clan.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.200
You're "Sawney."

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.080
You're "Beane."

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.160
But don't worry.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.450
I'm not going to execute you.

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:44.750
Nice to meet you, Sawney.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:47.450
And you too, Beane.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:49.700
Let's all be friends!

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:53.790
And that's how I named the
7-meter Titan "Beane"

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:57.410
and the 4-meter Titan "Sawney."

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.950
Next, I tested blocking them from sunlight.

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:09.250
From the fact that Titans become
less active as the night progresses,

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:15.250
this experiment corroborates that
they somehow use sunlight for energy.

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:19.370
It was from this that I found a
substantial difference between the two.

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:23.000
Mm. You did great, Sawney.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.410
Good night. I'll see you tomorrow.

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:31.870
While Sawney became sluggish
only one hour out of sunlight...

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:36.200
You sure love to stay up late,
don't you, Beane?

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:40.790
That's okay. I'll hang out
with you as long as you'd like.

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:44.330
...Beane was still his
energetic self three hours later.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.410
It came as another shock to me.

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:51.910
They don't require food or water,

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:55.620
and even though they have vocal organs,
they don't need to breathe.

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:59.660
The only thing they need is sunlight.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:03.370
I'm curious to know what happens
after prolonged sunlight withdrawal,

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:06.500
but I can't risk having them die, y'know?

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:10.910
We've accidentally killed
previous ones we've caught.

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:12.620
We tried decapitating some as an experiment

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.540
but accidentally cut the
napes of their necks too...

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:19.830
Their names were Chikatiloni and Albert.

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.660
They had such cute smiles.

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:26.290
I did something truly terrible to them.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.700
I never want that to happen again...

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.910
Ms. Hange...

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:38.580
After that...!

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.870
The next step was
physical contact with the Titans!

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:45.000
I tested to see if they felt pain!

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:53.870
Section Commander!
There's no need for <i>you </i>to scream!

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:56.250
I can't do this and <i>not </i>scream!

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:59.750
Beane is in so much pain!

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:02.000
Beane! Hang in there!

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.830
Stay strong!

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:08.250
I needed to determine if
Titans have any weaknesses

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:11.580
besides their napes, you see.

00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:14.160
It was an agonizing task.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:17.540
Sawney...

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:20.410
Hey... I've stabbed you in the heart...

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:24.410
Does it not hurt?
How does it feel?

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:28.330
Compared to Beane,
Sawney seemed more introverted

00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:31.620
and didn't respond much at all.

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:33.580
Hmm? What?

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:35.200
What is it?!

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:40.120
Section Commander! Please step back!

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.580
Almost got me that time, Sawney!

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:45.660
You're seriously gonna die!

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:51.410
So Sawney's not very
good at expressing himself.

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:53.870
He just keeps trying to chomp my head off.

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:55.830
Umm... Ms. Hange.

00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:02.120
How can you be so lighthearted
when dealing with Titans?

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:05.790
I mean...

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:10.950
They're our natural enemy; they've driven
humanity to the verge of extinction.

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:15.620
Surely you experienced the threat
they pose countless times yourself...

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.080
I have.

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:23.580
I've watched Titans kill friend
after friend right before my very eyes.

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:28.620
When I first joined the Scouts,
I fought the Titans out of hate.

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:33.080
But, one day, I made a realization

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:38.080
after I kicked the severed
head of a 3-meter-tall Titan.

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:42.700
It was light. Unusually light.

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.830
The Titan's body, I mean.

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:46.040
Huh?

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:49.790
When you think about it,
it shouldn't even be possible

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:53.830
for such large creatures
to stand and walk on two legs.

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:56.000
Every Titan was the same.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:02.080
Severed limbs weren't nearly
as heavy as they should have been.

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.120
And when you transformed,

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:08.910
I'm told your Titan body
appeared out of nowhere.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.500
It's my belief

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:19.250
that how they appear to us is
nothing like what they really are.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:29.870
For decades we've tried an offensive
approach that feeds off of hate.

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:31.870
I want to try to view the Titans

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:35.620
from a different
angle than the existing one.

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:38.750
It might end as a waste of time...

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:42.500
...but I'm going to do it.

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:53.910
Joining the Scouts has been
nothing but surprise after surprise.

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:58.080
It's not just Ms. Hange.
<i>Everyone </i>is strange.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:01.580
It's practically a haven of oddballs.

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:03.450
Still...

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:06.200
A group of people that seeks change...

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.700
<i>That's </i>what the Scouts are all about!

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:11.120
Ms. Hange!

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:16.250
Would you mind telling me
even more about your experiments?!

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:17.870
Huh? Are you sure?!

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:19.000
Yes!

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.700
I think it would be good
to know as much as possible

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:23.910
before tomorrow's experiments!

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:26.120
G-Good point.

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:30.200
Mm. I did gloss over
a lot of things just now.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.580
I should go into further detail!

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.120
--This could take a while...
--That's okay!

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:41.120
I'll start off with the hypothesis
I had the first time we caught a Titan!

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.500
As such, that experiment
provided no new information!

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:52.500
I'm sure they teach everyone
this stuff during cadet training.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.700
You knew all this, right?

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.660
Yes... I already knew it all...

00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:00.080
So <i>now </i>I'll explain things further

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.790
by going over everything
again with my own theories!

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:03.910
Huh?!

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:04.910
Umm... I'm...

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:07.040
First is how Titans--

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.330
Is Section Commander Hange here?!

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.040
The test subjects...

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.700
Both of the Titans have been killed!

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:26.290
Sawney! Beane!

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:30.500
No... Tell me this isn't happening!

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:34.290
They were such valuable test subjects...

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:35.660
Did soldiers do this?

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:39.040
Yeah. They haven't yet
found who's responsible.

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.830
Apparently both were killed
at the same time just before dawn.

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:46.120
By the time the guards noticed,
whoever did it had used ODM to get away.

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:49.750
So a team of at least
two people planned this, huh?

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:51.250
Sawney!

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:52.700
Just look.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:55.500
Section Commander Hange is raving mad.

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.660
How did this happen...?

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:02.700
Let's go. The rest
is the Military Police's job.

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:04.660
Y-Yes, Sir...

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:09.870
What do <i>you </i>see here?

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:14.750
What do you think the enemy is?

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.160
Huh?

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:22.160
Sorry. That was a strange thing to ask.

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:57.660
<i>If, by chance, I'm not me</i>

00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:02.910
<i>then who's to say that you're you?</i>

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:08.200
<i>Can you pick up the pieces of your heart</i>

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:13.330
<i>that fell apart like a broken sand castle?</i>

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:18.330
<i>The voice of someone calling out</i>

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:22.410
<i>changed into ringing in my ears</i>

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:27.580
<i>It's as if time has stopped</i>

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:30.370
<i>Now wake up</i>

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:35.660
<i>I made my way out of the deep darkness</i>

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:40.910
<i>I fled like a swift wind</i>

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:48.410
<i>We used to be like living corpses,</i>

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:50.450
<i>but now we head beyond the walls</i>

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:52.500
<i>Let's meet again</i>

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:57.330
<i>in a place not on any map</i>

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:14.200
As the hunt for Sawney and
Beane's killers gets underway,

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:17.540
Mikasa, Armin, and the members
of the 104th Cadet Corps Class,

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:21.700
with hopes and dreams of their own,
must decide which regiment to join.
