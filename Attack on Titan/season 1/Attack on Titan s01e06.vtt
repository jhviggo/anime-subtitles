Hey!

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.080
Hey! What's wrong, Armin?!

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.250
Pull yourself together!

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.370
Hey!

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.950
Armin! Hey, Armin!

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.370
Hey!

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.790
You with me?! You okay?!

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.950
Are you all right? Where's your squad?

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.660
Squad...?

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.540
Oh, man. Pull yourself together.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.410
Why are you all by yourself?

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.410
Plus you're all wet and slimy...

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.540
What the hell happened?

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.830
You're so useless! Just die already!

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.120
--Whoa! Calm down, Armin!
--Damn it!

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.950
Where is everyone?!

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.700
Give it a rest, Conny.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.870
They've been wiped out. All but him.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.660
Shut up! Armin hasn't said anything!

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.750
Just look around. It's obvious.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.910
We don't got any
more time to waste on him.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.160
Why is he the only one who's okay?!

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.830
Beats me. Maybe they
thought he was a corpse?

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.120
It sucks that they
ran into multiple Titans

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.540
and that only this
underachiever made it out alive.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.700
Eren and the others
worked hard for nothing.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.910
You bitch...

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.370
Want me to make it
so you never talk again?!

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.950
Stop it, you two!

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.580
We're <i>all </i>shaken up here!

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.450
All our friends are suddenly
dying left and right!

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.910
It's natural we're upset!

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.660
That's my Christa!
Marry me when this is over!

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.080
Yeah...

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.120
She <i>is </i>clowning
around more than usual.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.910
Anyways, we can't stay here.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.950
Can you stand, Armin?!

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.410
I'm sorry for the trouble.

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.620
I'll rendezvous with the rearguard.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.540
Hey...

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.950
Armin!

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.410
Let's go, Conny!
We've been ordered to advance!

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.910
This is hell...

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.330
No, it hasn't <i>become </i>hell.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.830
I was just mistaken until now.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.000
This world has always been hell,
from the very start.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.200
The strong prey on the weak.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.370
It's such a simple,
straightforward world.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.370
It's just, my friends...

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.500
They <i>tried </i>to be strong in this world.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.120
They helped me, someone who was weak.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.700
I couldn't bear it...

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.250
They saw me as someone
who needed to be protected.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.620
I wanted to live
in this world like them...

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.790
I wanted to be strong and stand
shoulder-to-shoulder with them...

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.870
And <i>this </i>is the result.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.790
Because of me, Eren wound up...

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.950
Hanna...

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.200
What are you doing?

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.500
Armin! Help!

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.160
Franz isn't breathing!

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.700
I've tried resuscitating him
over and over and over...

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.500
...but it's not working!

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.000
It's dangerous down here, Hanna.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.080
--You need to get on a roof--
--I can't just leave Franz like this!

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.330
You don't understand, Hanna...

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.950
Franz is...

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.120
Please... stop this...

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.080
I...

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.660
I can't take this anymore...

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.370
I can't...

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.750
H-Hey, now! Don't you guys
realize how bad the situation is?!

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.410
Yeah! That's why we're doin' this!

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.870
And if you guys wanna live,
you'll give us some damn help!

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.870
--The hell with that!
--It's gonna get stuck!

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.080
--Letting people through comes first!
--We're all gonna get eaten standing here!

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.540
--What are you doing, soldier?!
--Go get 'em!

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.120
B-But...

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.700
Just try it, small fry! I'm the boss
of this town's merchant association!

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.830
Uhh, err...

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.160
Who do you think pays for
the meals you soldiers shit out?!

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.830
Do <i>you </i>have the money to
provide for the soldiers in this town?!

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.500
Push, all of you!

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:49.750
This cargo's worth more than you
can earn in your entire measly lives!

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.370
Help, and you'll be rewarded!

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.950
It'll be okay.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:58.290
Your dad's going to use his
cannons to make the Titans go away.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.200
Mom.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.830
Over there.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:13.950
Push!

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:16.040
Push if you don't wanna die!

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.660
Stop! The children--!

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.290
Damn! Why is it ignoring us?!

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.950
It's an Abnormal!
No point trying to figure it out!

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.370
It's fast! Not even we
elites can catch up to it!

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:33.200
At this rate...!

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.040
What... are you doing?

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.120
Oh, perfect timing!

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.950
Get these guys to help me!

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:03.370
I'll make it worth your while!

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:09.250
My comrades are dying as we speak.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:15.120
They're fighting and dying because
the citizens haven't finished evacuating.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.660
Of course they are!

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.000
It's your duty to give your hearts

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.040
to defend the lives
and property of the people!

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.950
Don't go gettin' a big head now
that you freeloaders have somethin' to do

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.790
after a century of uselessness!

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:39.330
If you feel people dying for
other people is a matter of course,

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:45.120
then I'm sure you'll understand
that a single, precious life

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.750
can sometimes save
the lives of many as well.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.370
Just you try it!

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:52.080
Your employer and I go way back!

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:57.080
One word from me and
he'll be all over your sorry ass!

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:02.870
How can a dead body talk?

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.120
Wait!

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:13.790
S-Sir!

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:15.620
Pull the cart out.

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.950
Thanks, lady!

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:31.120
You really saved the day.
You have our gratitude!

00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:00.200
Good work taking it down,
Ackermann. Very impressive.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.580
Thank you, Sir. However...

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:08.080
I'm afraid I inadvertently dulled
my blades during the attack.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.290
I will be more careful next time.

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:14.910
Just what have
you had to live through...?

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:16.910
No, never mind.

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:26.370
Why am I reminded
of it at a time like this?

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:46.700
Finished!

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.450
Look, Mom!

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:51.500
Oh, you did a great job, Mikasa!

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.330
It's very nice!

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:56.790
This style of embroidery has
been passed down in our clan

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.330
from generation to generation.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.660
When you have a child,
it'll be your turn to pass it on too!

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:06.040
How can I have a child?

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.700
Err, why don't you ask your father that?

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.200
Well, Dad?

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.370
Oh, uhh, I don't really know, either!

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:17.290
Oh, I know!
Dr. Jaeger will be here any minute!

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:19.620
Why don't we ask him?

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:25.200
Oh, that must be him!

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:29.160
Coming!

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:35.540
Mikasa?

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:39.370
Yes. She's about your age.

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:43.700
There aren't many children
in these parts, so try to get along.

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.450
That depends on how <i>she </i>acts...

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:47.950
Eren.

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:51.250
That attitude is why
you've only made one friend.

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:54.330
Are they not home?

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:56.700
Mr. Ackermann!

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.540
It's Jaeger!

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.700
Is anyone home?

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.500
What's wrong?

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:09.910
What is it, Dad?

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:19.870
Too late.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:21.160
Eren.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:25.660
Have you seen the girl--
Mikasa-- anywhere nearby?

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.250
No.

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:28.660
I see...

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:33.250
I'll get the Military Police
and have them conduct a search!

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.290
You'll wait at the foot of the mountain.

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:37.790
Is that clear, Eren?!

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:40.330
Eren!

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:51.450
Hey. Are you sure she'll actually sell?

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:54.580
We even went and killed her
parents before running off with her...

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:57.500
Take a look at her face.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:03.620
Looks nice, but she's
still just a kid. She ain't for me.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.410
I'm not asking about your tastes.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:08.700
She's an "Oriental."

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:12.080
There used to be different types
of humans, you see.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.620
Long ago, some people
fled a place called the Orient

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.620
and sought refuge inside the walls.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.370
She's the last descendant of that clan.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:22.120
We're gonna take her to the
underground market in the capital

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:25.120
and auction her off to those old perverts.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:29.450
All the other Orientals have died out,
so she'll go for a pretty hefty price.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:33.000
Her old man didn't
look like an Oriental to me.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.750
She ain't pureblooded.

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:39.330
That's right! The <i>mom</i>
was the really valuable one!

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.160
But you had to freak out and kill her!

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.200
I-I couldn't help it! She put up a fight!

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.950
That all you got
to say for yourself?! Huh?!

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:53.580
Dr. Jaeger!

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.410
We've been expecting--

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.200
Hello. Pardon the intrusion.

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:18.410
Just take it nice and easy,

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:21.790
unless you want
your head split open with this.

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.290
This broad's crazy!

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:27.000
Mikasa! Run!

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.660
Huh? M-Mom...

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.580
Hurry, Mikasa!

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.750
Uhh...

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.000
Dad...?

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.080
Damn it! I've had enough of your crap!

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:54.000
What the hell?!
I said only kill the dad!

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.370
Don't look at me!
She's the one who...!

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:58.790
Save your excuses! Go get the kid!

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:00.200
Huh?!

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:03.950
Hey.

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:06.250
<i>You </i>better behave yourself.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:10.330
Or else... this!

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:22.830
Cold...

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:35.830
Excuse me...

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.290
Hold it, kid!

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:40.620
How did you find this place?!

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.410
Err, uhh...

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:47.660
I got lost in the forest,
and then, umm, I saw a cabin, so...

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:57.160
You know kids shouldn't
wander around the forest all alone.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.910
Scary wolves live
in the forest, you know.

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:03.540
But there's nothing to
worry about now.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.040
We'll be happy to take you--

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:10.040
Thanks, Mister.

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.330
I already know the score.

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:16.290
So die, you asshole!

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:22.410
Huh?! What the hell?!

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:25.450
G-Get back here, kid!

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:34.160
You damn animal...!

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.700
Die! Die!

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:41.500
This is what you get!
This is what you deserve!

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.870
Never get up again!

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:04.200
You're safe now...
You can relax.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.620
I take it you're Mikasa?

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:11.120
I'm Eren.

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:16.450
I'm Dr. Jaeger's son.
I'm sure you've met my dad before.

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:19.870
I was tagging along when he
visited your house for a checkup.

00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:21.500
But then...

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:26.330
There were three of them.

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:37.950
Was it you?

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.750
Was it you who killed 'em?!

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:44.540
Was it?!

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:48.450
I'm gonna kill you!
I'm gonna kill you!

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:51.370
F-Fight!

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:53.410
Fight!

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:57.200
Fight... or die...!

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.620
Win... and live!

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.870
What the hell are you thinking, brat?!

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:06.410
The only way to win...
is to fight!

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:14.200
No... I can't do it!

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:27.000
Just then... I remembered.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.870
I had seen this same thing...

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:33.000
...over and over...

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.870
...all my life.

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:40.950
I'd seen it everywhere I went...

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:42.410
But...

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:45.950
I always looked the other way.

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:49.830
"That's right...

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:53.370
We live...

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.200
...in a cruel world."

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:09.950
At that moment,
my body stopped shaking.

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:14.870
I was in full control of
myself after that.

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:19.330
I thought I could do anything...

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:20.750
"Fight."

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.000
"Fight!"

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:29.290
"Fight!"

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:43.290
Stabbed through the heart from behind.

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:46.000
Those <i>kids </i>did this?

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:54.870
Eren. I told you to wait
at the foot of the mountain.

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:58.330
Do you have any idea what you've done?!

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:00.830
I got rid of some dangerous animals!

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:03.790
They just happened to look like people!

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:05.290
Eren!

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:09.540
They would've been long gone
by the time the Military Police arrived!

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:11.160
It would've been too late!

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:16.120
Even so, you were just lucky, Eren!

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:21.450
The way you casually threw
your life away is what I'm angry about!

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:23.540
But...

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:26.750
I wanted to save her as fast as I could...

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:34.120
Mikasa. Do you remember me?

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:37.540
We've met several times before,
when you were little.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.290
Dr. Jaeger...

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:47.540
How do I get home from here?

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.700
I'm cold...

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:56.500
I have nowhere to go now...

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.160
You can keep this.

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:14.700
Warm, isn't it?

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:23.200
It is...

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.540
Mikasa.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:26.870
Come live with us.

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:28.660
Huh?

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:32.040
You've been through a lot.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:35.500
You need plenty of rest.

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:39.330
What is it?

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:42.790
C'mon. Let's go already.

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:44.750
To our home.

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:50.790
Yeah. Let's go...

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:10.660
A cruel world in which only
the victors are allowed to live...

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:16.700
Time to withdraw, Ackermann!

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:18.250
Let's scale the wall!

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:20.500
I'll go assist the vanguard's retreat!

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.790
H-Hey, Ackermann!

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:27.370
But I do have a place to
call home in this world now.

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:30.790
Eren.

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:34.790
As long as I have you,
I can do anything.

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:58.000
<i>Your dreams are where your heart is</i>

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:04.250
<i>They're more fragile than life itself</i>

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:08.910
<i>Over and over you cast them aside,</i>
<i>only to find more</i>

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:15.580
<i>Now, rest in peace</i>

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:26.910
<i>Pounding impulses defile the things we wish for</i>

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:37.200
<i>and the more we forget</i>
<i>the more we remember again</i>

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:43.160
<i>In this beautiful, cruel world</i>

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:48.330
<i>all I can do is ask why we're still alive</i>

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:54.040
<i>Oh, with our strength--and our weakness--</i>

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:59.700
<i>what are we going to protect if there's no sense</i>

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:03.120
<i>to anything anymore?</i>

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:14.040
"I have a place to call home."

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:18.540
After finishing her rearguard duties,
Mikasa hurries to see Eren,

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:21.620
only to learn of his death.

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:23.330
"Small Blade"
"The Struggle for Trost, Part 3"
