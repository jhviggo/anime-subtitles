WEBVTT

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.750
Go, Eren!

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.950
In the year 850,

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.370
humanity successfully took back land
from the Titans for the very first time.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.000
At great cost.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.790
All of you here are hereby accepted

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.080
as new members
of the Scout Regiment!

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.450
<i>This </i>is a genuine salute!

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.330
Give your hearts!

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.160
Yes, Sir!

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.830
You've done well to endure your fear.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.660
You're all brave soldiers.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.830
I respect you from the bottom of my heart.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.410
One month later,
the Scout Regiment, led by Erwin Smith,

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.450
left Calaneth District to
establish a route to Shiganshina,

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.540
which is believed to
house a secret of the Titans.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.910
Now commencing the
57th Exterior Scouting Mission!

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.040
Move out!

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.500
<i>I won't let your deaths be meaningless</i>

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.620
<i>even if I'm the last one standing</i>

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.500
<i>In both hands, Gloria</i>

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.500
<i>What sings is Sieg</i>

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.700
<i>On my back, Flügel der Freiheit</i>

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.540
<i>Clenched determination to my left chest</i>

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.910
<i>What slashes across is Linie der Torheit</i>

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.160
<i>Soaring across the azure skies</i>

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.700
<i>Flügel der Freiheit</i>

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.330
"Female Titan"
"The 57th Exterior Scouting Mission, Part 1"

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.120
10-meter Titan ahead,
approaching from the left!

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.700
I'm extremely curious to
know what's inside its stomach!

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.500
But I'll let the support squad handle it!

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.620
Damn! Not deep enough!

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.450
Defend the ranks!

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.000
Don't falter!

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.790
Leave it to the support squad!
Keep moving!

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.870
Forward!

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.540
Forward!

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.620
The support squad will only
cover us until we're through the old city.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.250
Everything beyond
that is wholly Titan territory.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.870
From then on,

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.330
we'll have to rely on Commander
Erwin's long-range scouting formation.

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.500
Our special operations
squad will be positioned here.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.950
Mr. Oruo!

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.950
Do you think they--my classmates--
can beat the Titans in a fight?

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.000
Huh? What the hell did you just
spend this last month doing?!

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.330
Listen, kid!

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.330
Outside scouting missions
are about fighting Titans

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.750
as little as possi--

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.120
Assume long-range scouting formation!

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.910
See you later, Armin.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.080
Don't wet your pants
if you run into a Titan!

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.450
Right! Likewise to you!

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.160
"Row 3-3: Signaling"
This formation is a forward-facing semicircle,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.200
with soldiers positioned

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.040
"Row 5, Center: Standby"
far from each other at equal intervals

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.870
"Row 2-5: Signaling"
yet still within clear sight on all sides.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:20.870
Extend the spotting

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.580
"Row 3-4: Signaling"
and signaling range as far as possible!

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.910
"Row 2-4: Signaling"

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.410
It's okay. Stay calm.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.620
The soldiers in the front-row spotting
squads will encounter most of the Titans.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.830
"Row 1-8: Spotting"

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.290
As soon as they spot a Titan

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.580
they'll fire a red smoke signal.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.790
Soldiers who see this signal
will then signal others similarly.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.700
"Row 2, Center: Command"

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.950
Once the commander has
learned of the Titan's position,

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.370
he'll fire a green signal

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.700
and reroute the
entire platoon around it.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.000
This will allow the platoon
to proceed toward its destination

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.660
while avoiding the Titans entirely.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.500
"Row 2-3: Signaling"

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:49.410
However, as the terrain and other
obstacles could delay their detection,

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:52.700
we <i>may </i>encounter
Titans inside the formation.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.120
R-Red... Red signal...!

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.160
Braus! Over here!

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.120
Damn! The spotters missed one!

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.950
Let's lure it this way!

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.500
Braus! Run toward us!

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.500
Break away! I'll handle this!

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:30.910
Yes, Sir!

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:50.250
Sir!

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.660
It's conked out!
Return to your position!

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:00.370
Something's not right...

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:04.910
It's been a while since the last red signal,
yet the formation's in disarray.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:06.750
Could it be...?

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:11.540
Keep in mind, this strategy
will only work with "Normals,"

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.040
Titans with predictable behavior.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.750
A black smoke signal?!

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.540
It's ignoring everyone nearby

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.870
and heading straight for
the center of the formation?!

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:27.330
No doubt about it! It's...

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:28.950
...an Abnormal!

00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:35.000
Only when dealing with unpredictable
Abnormals is combat necessary!

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.410
Damn! No choice but to fight!

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:39.870
Cis! You go for its nape!

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:41.290
I'll stop it in its tracks!

00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:42.700
Understood!

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.750
An ODM battle on level ground
puts us at a clear disadvantage.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.080
Our chances of success are incredibly low,

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.750
but we can't afford to
let it wreck our formation!

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:56.410
Arlelt's that way, as I recall.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:59.410
I can't let a rookie face this thing!

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:01.660
I'm taking it out here!

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.080
Now, Cis!

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:20.250
Way to go, Section Commander Ness!

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:23.830
Got it!

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.660
You came! You're my horse, all right!

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.410
I love ya, Charrette!

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:44.370
Another one?! What are
the right wing spotters doing?!

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:48.910
It must be an Abnormal too.
It's ignoring everyone on its way here.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:50.750
Ugh, all right...

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.410
Let's do it again, Cis!

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:54.830
Yes, Sir!

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:59.290
Man, two in a row...
Talk about unlucky.

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:02.040
Plus, this one looks
to be 14-meters high.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.500
This is gonna be tough.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:15.870
What the...! It's way too fast!

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:17.830
Don't let it go for Arlelt!

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:19.080
Cis!

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.500
Yes, Sir!

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:57.120
No! This one's different!

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.410
This isn't an Abnormal...
It has intelligence!

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.910
It's just like the Armored Titan,
the Colossal Titan, and Eren!

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:07.000
It's a human clad in a Titan body!

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.750
B-But who?! Why?!

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:11.290
This is bad! What do I do?!

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:13.790
It's going to kill me too!

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.580
Go! Run for it!

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:26.080
What is its--

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:30.250
No, what is <i>their</i>...

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.370
...goal?!

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:52.580
S-Someone, let the others know...

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:57.330
The right wing spotting squads...
are almost entirely wiped out...

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:02.660
A female-looking Titan...
brought a horde of Titans with her...

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:06.450
Is... anyone left...?

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:07.040
It... didn't kill me?

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.910
What just happened?

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:11.750
It pinched my hood and...

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.870
My face?

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:16.790
It checked my face?

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:18.200
Armin!

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.450
Reiner!

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.330
Hey, can you stand?!

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:27.790
There's no surviving outside
the wall without a horse, you know!

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:28.790
Hurry!

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:30.200
Mm!

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.700
I saw the Abnormal smoke signal.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.160
Is it that one with the nice butt?

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.200
It's not an Abnormal!
It's a person clad in a Titan body!

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.620
What?!

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:46.450
Hold on! We need to
fire a smoke signal first!

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:50.080
H-Hurry. We have to let them know...

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.580
...there's an emergency--

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:53.830
Wait.

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:55.750
It looks like Jean fired for us.

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:00.660
From the right wing?!

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.950
They've suffered too severe of
an attack to continue the operation?!

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:06.790
Apparently part of the
right wing's been wiped out!

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:10.870
A whole horde of Titans showed up!
I dunno how it happened, though!

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:13.120
A bunch of 'em are fast, too!

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:17.410
We're holding them off for now,
but no one's on spotting duty now!

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:21.330
This is a serious setback; if we're
not careful we could <i>all </i>get wiped out!

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.950
That's the direction she came from...

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:25.370
Could it be?

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:27.910
Did <i>she </i>lead the Titans here?!

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:29.870
She?

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:32.620
What's a Titan doing <i>there</i>?!

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:33.950
Is it an Abnormal?!

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:39.790
No, it's a human clad in a Titan body.

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:42.290
A human who can
do the same thing as Eren.

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:43.910
What?!

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:46.580
What makes you think that, Armin?

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:50.450
"Eating" is all that Titans do.

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:55.410
This results in death of course,
but "killing" isn't their actual goal.

00:14:55.410 --> 00:15:00.790
But as soon as more experienced
soldiers went for her vital spot,

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:03.160
she crushed and swatted them down.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:06.950
And she didn't do it to eat them...
she did it to kill them.

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:10.000
She's unlike any other Titan in that regard.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.750
<i>She </i>must've been the one
who brought the hordes of Titans

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:18.000
when the Colossal and Armored
Titans destroyed the walls.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.200
Meaning she's had the consistent
goal of attacking humankind.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.410
Or, actually...

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:28.540
I think she might be searching for someone.

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:32.160
If so, who?

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.250
Could it be Eren?!

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:36.000
Eren?

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.250
Eren's with the Levi Squad.
They're in charge of the right wing.

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:43.200
Right wing?

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:48.160
My copy of the plan had
them in the rear of the left wing.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:53.500
My copy placed them
at the front of the right wing...

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.910
Wait, there's no way they'd
be put on the front lines like that.

00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:59.790
Then where <i>are </i>they?

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:04.040
The safest place in
this formation, I'd assume.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.540
Which would be...

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:08.500
...the rear of the center rank.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:09.870
Armin!

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:12.540
This is no time to get lost in thought!

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:16.330
Smoke signals aren't enough to
explain how much of a threat she poses!

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:18.700
At this rate, she'll take
out the command squad too.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.910
And if that happens, the formation
falls apart and we <i>all </i>die!

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:23.660
What are you suggesting?

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:28.540
I'm suggesting that from this distance
we might still be able to distract her.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:32.250
We can buy some time
for everyone to retreat.

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:35.790
Maybe, anyway...

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.580
She really does have intelligence.

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:44.080
From her point of view,
we're literally just like insects.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.540
All it takes is one swipe to kill us.

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:48.160
You don't say...

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.080
That's some scary stuff.

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.080
Are you really Jean?

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:58.790
The Jean I know only
ever cares about himself.

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:00.620
That's rude.

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:05.910
I just don't want to
meet a disappointing end

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:10.700
as a bunch of burnt bones
that you can't even tell are mine.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:16.410
I... I know what needs to be done now!

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.540
Plus, we <i>chose </i>to take this job!

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:20.950
Help me!

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:31.290
Put your hoods on! All the way,
so she can't see your face!

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:36.080
Because she can't risk killing
us if she can't tell who we are!

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.620
I get it.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:41.410
She can't risk killing
anyone who might be Eren.

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:43.450
Now <i>that's </i>a relief to know.

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:47.450
Here's hoping she's
got bad eyesight too!

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:48.660
Armin...

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:53.290
The way you always clung so
close to Eren used to creep me out,

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:55.120
but I always knew I could count on you.

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:58.290
Huh? Oh, thanks.

00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:01.290
But that's mean, thinking I'm creepy...

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:18.870
She's a lot slower than
when she came from that way.

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:20.790
Is she tired?

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:23.620
If she takes off at that
speed again we'll be too late!

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:27.080
We have to do it now!
We have to act now, or else...!

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:36.080
All right, guys.
Do it like we just discussed.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.450
Distract her for as long as possible

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:40.870
so the platoon can retreat!

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:44.040
We hafta keep her here as long as we can!

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.500
Cutting her heel tendons
should be more than enough.

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:51.910
But don't do anything crazy.
We don't need to kill her!

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:55.040
She's aware of the
vital spot on her nape.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.500
She's completely different
from the other Titans.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.450
Killing her is probably out of the question.

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:04.080
At least for ordinary people, anyway.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.700
But maybe those two could...!

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:53.540
Armin!

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:58.950
This one's <i>way </i>more athletic
than the other ones!

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:01.160
Damn! We were...

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.250
We were too naïve!

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.290
She's protecting her nape?!

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:11.700
Jean!

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.200
Damn! There's no escape now!

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:19.080
I'm dead! She's gonna
grab my wire and finish me!

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:26.580
Jean! Avenge that suicidal maniac!

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:29.160
Armin?

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:31.830
She stopped?

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:34.620
It was her! She killed him!

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.290
That maniac finally got himself killed,
as part of the right wing!

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:39.870
She killed him!

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:47.160
What's going on?!

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:52.290
Did he hit his head and get confused?!
This is the worst possible time...!

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.500
Reiner...

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.750
<i>She </i>crushed my friend!

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:02.040
I saw him stuck to the bottom of her foot!

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.330
He's going straight for the nape?!

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:11.000
No, he can do it! Now's his chance,
while she's focused on Armin!

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:20.330
H-Hey...

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:34.870
H-Hey!

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:37.330
Reiner... You...

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:56.290
Ol' Reiner actually did it...!

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:58.660
Mikasa stole so much
of the spotlight that I forgot

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:02.660
that he's extremely skilled
and dependable too!

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:07.000
I'd say we bought enough time!
Now let's get away from her, quick!

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.040
She doesn't eat people!
I don't think she'll follow us!

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:24.450
Look! The giant wench is running
home with her tail between her legs!

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:26.790
Huh? Oh no...

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:28.000
Why?

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.580
The rear of the center rank is that way...

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:34.450
Is she heading for Eren?!

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:57.790
<i>If, by chance, I'm not me</i>

00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:03.040
<i>then who's to say that you're you?</i>

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:08.330
<i>Can you pick up the pieces of your heart</i>

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:13.450
<i>that fell apart like a broken sand castle?</i>

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:18.450
<i>The voice of someone calling out</i>

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:22.540
<i>changed into ringing in my ears</i>

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:27.700
<i>It's as if time has stopped</i>

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:30.500
<i>Now wake up</i>

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:35.790
<i>I made my way out of the deep darkness</i>

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:41.040
<i>I fled like a swift wind</i>

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:48.540
<i>We used to be like living corpses,</i>

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:50.580
<i>but now we head beyond the walls</i>

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:52.620
<i>Let's meet again</i>

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:57.450
<i>in a place not on any map</i>

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:12.040
"You monster!"

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:17.540
Not even the highly trained Scout
Regiment can stop the Female Titan.

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:20.290
Eventually, inside a forest of giant trees,

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:21.910
the monster finally catches sight of Eren.

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:23.450
"Forest of Giant Trees"
"The 57th Exterior Scouting Mission, Part 2"
