00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.200
<i>In the year 845...</i>

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.040
<i>the Colossal and Armored 
Titans suddenly appeared,</i>

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.560
<i>destroying the wall, 
along with the life we'd known.</i>

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.930
<i>Humanity abandoned Wall Maria,</i>

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.850
<i>losing twenty percent of its population 
and a third of its territory,</i>

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.330
<i>to retreat within Wall Rose.</i>

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.610
<i>And in the year 850...</i>

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.990
<i>The Colossal Titan reappeared 
and breached the wall.</i>

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.820
<i>And once again, humanity could 
not stop a Titan invasion.</i>

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.550
<i>Soldiers fell, one after the 
next, before the Titan assault.</i>

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.580
<i>And then...</i>

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.000
Eren! Hurry!

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.300
<i>Eren Jaeger had been 
devoured by a Titan,</i>

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.400
but reappeared, emerging 
from a mysterious Titan.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.310
Attention!

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.440
<i>Dot Pixis, the high commander 
of the southern territories,</i>

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.040
<i>recognized the combat potential 
of Eren's ability to become a Titan,</i>

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.390
<i>and decided to execute 
an audacious plan.</i>

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.620
He will become a Titan, 
pick up the giant boulder

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.620
by the shattered gate, carry it over,

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.780
and seal the hole.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.400
When this mission succeeds,

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.150
humanity will have retaken

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.510
its territory from them 
for the very first time.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.470
But for humanity, that step will be

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.180
a great advance in our 
attack on the Titans!

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.350
<i>However, as soon as it has begun, the mission 
already seems to be on the brink of failure...</i>

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.700
<i>Unknown are the names</i>
<i>of the flowers that have been trampled</i>

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.160
<i>Birds have fallen to the earth</i>
<i>and long for the wind</i>

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.290
<i>Prayers won't solve anything</i>

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.620
<i>Only the will to fight</i>
<i>can change the here and now!</i>

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.910
<i>O pigs who laugh at the resolve</i>
<i>to walk over corpses to move forward</i>

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.450
<i>Livestock complacency? False prosperity?</i>

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.330
<i>Give us the freedom of dying,</i>
<i>starving wolves!</i>

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.700
<i>The humiliation of being caged</i>
<i>is what triggers us to fight back</i>

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.000
<i>We hunters slaughter prey</i>
<i>beyond the castle walls,</i>

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.200
<i>consumed with surging bloodlust,</i>

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.120
<i>as our crimson bows and arrows</i>
<i>pierce scarlet holes into the twilight</i>

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.330
<b>Wound 
The Battle for Trost (8)</b>

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.670
We've somehow managed

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.380
to lure most of the Titans 
to the town's edge...

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.380
But despite our best 
efforts to avoid combat,

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.880
we've lost around twenty 
percent of our troops.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.020
We didn't lose them.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.140
Those soldiers didn't die on their own.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.310
They died due to my orders.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.710
This battle will decide 
humanity's survival.

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:25.140
And to win, I am willing 
to be called a murderer.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:43.590
Ackerman!

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.580
Hey! Ackerman, stop!

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.110
Get away from him!

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.640
Eren, don't you know who I am?

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.860
It's me, Mikasa!

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.630
Your family!

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.080
You must use that boulder 
to seal the hole!

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.580
The mission has failed.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.600
I knew there wasn't any secret weapon.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.740
Eren, you're human!

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:25.420
You're...

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.760
Move, Ackerman!

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.980
What the?

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.650
He's just like any other stupid Titan!

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:47.310
Eren!

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.610
Captain Ian!

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.950
Two Titans approaching from the front!

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.040
A 10-meter and a 6-meter class.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.910
Another from the rear, as well!

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.330
One 12-meter class coming this way!

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.420
Ian, we must retreat!

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.000
Look at him!

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.840
No way is that hole getting sealed!

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:05.920
Yeah...

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.800
We have no choice but to leave him here.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.520
Red smoke round from the 
elite force sighted.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.320
A serious problem has happened 
during the mission.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.190
We're dying for no reason.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.390
My friends died for nothing!

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.030
Hey! Look at that!

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.630
What? What is that?

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.060
It... failed?

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:39.670
Why?

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.670
Hey, Armin! 
Where are you going?

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.670
Commander Pixis,

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.870
we should recall them 
to defend the gate.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.300
Shall I do it?

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.220
No.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.190
Shouldn't we order the 
elite force to retreat?

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:58.140
No.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.810
Continue drawing the Titans 
to the edge of town.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.690
The elite force has full 
tactical discretion.

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:09.460
They are not simply excellent soldiers.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.190
They're the best of the best, 
entrusted with humanity's fate.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.750
For them to give up so easily 
would be unimaginable.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.440
They'll fight to the end...

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.710
So the deaths of the fallen will 
not have been in vain.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.690
Hey, what's wrong?

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:29.970
Give the order!

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:31.890
Ian, it wasn't your fault!

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.220
The plan was always a long shot.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.160
Everyone knew that.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.640
It was worth trying, and we 
took our best shot!

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.020
Come on! Our squads will climb the walls.

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:46.970
Wait!

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:48.830
Wait...

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:50.100
Calm down, Ackerman.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.440
Riko, your squad will handle the 
12-meter Titan behind us.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.480
Mitabi's squad and mine will 
take the two in front.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.650
What?

00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.870
I'm the one they left in charge!

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.590
Shut up and follow your orders!

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.330
We can't leave Jaeger defenseless.

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:08.070
I'm changing the plan.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:11.400
We protect Jaeger from the Titans 
until we can retrieve him.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:14.300
He's still valuable as one 
of humanity's last hopes.

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:17.020
We cannot just abandon him like this.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.310
We can be replaced, but he can't be.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.430
The failure of that 
dysfunctional human weapon

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.330
has already cost several hundred lives!

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:31.160
You're saying we should bring him 
back, so this can happen again?

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.520
That's right.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.360
We must try as many times as necessary, 
regardless of the cost in lives!

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.390
What happened to Eren?

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:46.670
Armin's headed there by himself.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.190
He's probably all right.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.610
Probably?

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:51.710
He's fine.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:52.470
I'm sure of it.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.380
Eren can do this.

00:08:56.110 --> 00:09:00.370
I think luring the Titans to the 
town's edge is useless.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:04.040
Any fight with Titans 
is a war of attrition.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.980
At this stage, they want to avoid 
the needless loss of troops.

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:12.810
Then anyone who doesn't make it now 
will have died for nothing?

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.040
Eventually, it will become an all-out war.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.710
But until then, we must 
preserve our forces.

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:20.010
It's obvious that we should 
minimize casualties.

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:21.910
The brass made the right call.

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:23.490
Is that so, huh?

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:24.750
It is!

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:26.540
Anyway...

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:30.390
Let's both ensure that we 
don't end up as casualties.

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.080
Ian, are you serious?

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.970
How else should humanity 
defeat the Titans?

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:37.640
Riko, tell me!

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.730
Is there any other way to get 
ourselves out of this mess?

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.060
Some way to maintain our human dignity,

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:44.140
without more deaths?!

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:48.350
How can we counter the Titans' 
overwhelming advantage over us?

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.680
As if I'd know of a way to defeat them!

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:54.640
That's right...

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.660
So for the moment, this is 
all we can and should do.

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:02.160
We must be willing to sacrifice our lives

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.460
and do our best for that 
incomprehensible human weapon.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.000
Pathetic, isn't it?

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:12.870
But as humans, it's all we can do.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.160
Now, what will you do?

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.220
This is the only battle we can fight.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.050
This is the struggle we've 
been allowed to engage.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.030
I can't accept that.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.420
Riko!

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:38.780
I'll obey the order.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.240
I think what you're saying is right.

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:45.990
But as we struggle our hardest, 
we'll also show them

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:47.390
how terrifying humans can be.

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:50.250
I refuse to die for nothing.

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:54.390
Leave the 12-meter class 
behind us to my squad.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:58.970
Let's go.

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:00.930
Our target will be the two in the front.

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:01.760
Yeah.

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:07.390
Thank you, Captain Ian.

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:10.000
Ackerman, there's no need to thank me.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.320
I was terrified because there's 
no telling what you'll do.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.520
Do as you like, just as 
in the original plan.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.890
That will be a more efficient 
use of your abilities.

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:21.320
Yes, sir.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.030
You have to protect your boyfriend.

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:25.870
We're family.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.420
<i>What?</i>

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.420
<i>The damaged parts aren't regenerating?</i>

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:38.510
<i>Is it due to the earlier damage he took?</i>

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.000
<i>What will that do to Eren?</i>

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.260
<i>And is there any guarantee 
he can regain human form?</i>

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.950
<i>No, stop this.</i>

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:51.990
<i>I will not be able to find 
answers to these questions.</i>

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.610
<i>For now, I'll just do what I can.</i>

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.200
<i>Eren...</i>

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:07.920
<i>Mikasa! What happened?</i>

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:27.300

<i>What... am I doing now?</i>

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:45.740
<i>Am I sitting?</i>

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.130
<i>I can't see a thing.</i>

<i>What day is it?</i>

<i>Where am I?</i>

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:00.760
Hmm?

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.110
I'm at home?

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.450
I'll go back to sleep.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.110
Eren!

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.200
What are you doing, Eren?

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:26.960
Listen up.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.680
You just need to keep the Titans 
in the corner of the city.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:33.860
Stay focused on that, 
and draw them there.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.660
Got it?

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:37.840
You don't need to fight.

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:41.170
Trainees, form groups of three 
and run along the ground.

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:43.500
When you reach the wall, jump up.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:44.830
Don't get killed.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:48.030
If any Titans break away, 
we'll take care of them.

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:50.480
"If"?

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.050
Isn't it more of a "when" than an "if"?

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:57.680
If we think we're in danger, 
can we deviate from our orders?

00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:59.980
If you believe it'll help.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.090
Kirschstein squad, go!

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:04.940
Right!

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:25.770
This is bad! Behind us!

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.470
One 13-meter class!

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:30.300
It's approaching Jaeger!

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:33.560
More Titans coming through the hole!

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.460
Four Titans, approximately 
10-meter class!

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:38.760
Ackerman, take the one behind us!

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:39.660
Got it.

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.670
Don't let it near Jaeger!

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:43.540
We'll stop them here!

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:44.320
Right!

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:48.060
<i>Even if they are elite, two squads 
can't handle four at once...</i>

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:04.900
<i>No...</i>

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:07.050
<i>Why are there so many Titans?</i>

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.730
<i>There aren't too many people there.</i>

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:13.590
<i>Could Eren be drawing them?</i>

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.880
Mikasa!

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.030
What happened to the plan?

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:18.160
Armin!

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.890
What happened to Eren?

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:22.160
It's dangerous! Move back!

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.240
Eren is completely unable to enact 
his will through that Titan!

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.650
I spoke to it, but it 
didn't recognize me!

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:29.980
There's no point in anyone else trying!

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:31.050
What about the plan?

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:32.550
It failed.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:35.570
Everyone's fighting because 
we can't leave Eren.

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:37.410
But there are too many...

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.310
Before long, they'll wipe us out.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.610
The spot on the back of the neck,

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:57.410
ten centimeters across and a meter high.

00:15:58.070 --> 00:15:59.060
Armin!

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:01.230
I'll get Eren out of here!

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:03.940
You protect us from any Titans!

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.230
What are you saying?

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:10.270
Eren came out of the 
Titan's vital point.

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:16.570
It's probably related to the 
mystery behind them.

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:18.090
Don't worry.

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:20.490
As long as I avoid striking 
it in the center,

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:23.680
he won't die.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.070
It'll just hurt...

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.170
a tiny bit!

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:29.050
Armin...

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:41.230
Armin, that's insane! Stop!

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:44.400
Mikasa, do what you can!

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.730
If you go, some lives might be saved!

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.330
Leave Eren to me!

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.620
Eren, can you hear me?

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:00.930
Come to your senses!

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:03.540
If we don't get out of 
here, we'll all die!

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.510
Don't let the Titan's body take over!

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:10.550
Just come out of that 
lump of flesh, now!

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:13.080
<i>Come out?</i>

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:14.990
<i>Why?</i>

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:18.550
<i>I'm tired...</i>

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:21.070
Eren! Get out of there!

00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:22.280
Hurry!

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:24.890
Eren! Eren!

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.690
What happened to avenging your mother?

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.560
Aren't you going to wipe out the Titans?

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:38.010
Don't you hate the things 
that killed your mother?

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.480
What are you talking about, Armin?

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:45.600
Mom's right here...

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.430
Eren! Eren!

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:50.270
Wake up, Eren!

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:52.710
You're still in there, aren't you?

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:55.860
If we stay here, the 
Titans will kill us!

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.220
Everything will end here!

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:01.630
Like I said...

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:04.310
I don't understand you, Armin.

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:09.740
Why do I have to leave?

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:11.230
<i>Yeah...</i>

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.750
<i>Why would I want to leave?</i>

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.910
<i>Why would I want to 
join the Survey Corps?</i>

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:32.670
Looks like we have to deviate 
from the plan, like it or not.

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:44.690
Gotcha!

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.660
So you're finally down, bastard?

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:00.680
Fall back for now!

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.240
I'm here.

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:04.210
I'll join up with Mitabi's squad.

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:15.220
What?!

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.090
Jean!

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:23.760
Hurry! Go!

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.190
<i>I won't let anyone else 
die because of me!</i>

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.700
Damn it... A malfunction, 
at a time like this?

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:07.390
Jean!

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:13.980
What's wrong?

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:17.160
Why isn't he using his Maneuver Gear?

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:21.460
No way... Is it broken?

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.280
I'll come up with something!

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:37.660
Damn it.

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.820
Why am I the one slowing us down?

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:56.420
Can I really come up with something?

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:00.920
Eren...

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:02.880
Eren!

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:04.770
Eren!

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:07.680
Eren!

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:13.960
One day, we're going to explore 
the outside world, right?

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:19.650
Far beyond these walls

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.130
is flaming water! Frozen earth!

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.800
The world my mom and dad tried to see...

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.960
I thought maybe you'd forgotten.

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:41.210
But the reason you stopped mentioning it

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:44.550
was because you didn't want me 
to join the Survey Corps, right?

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:48.260
The outside world?

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.260
Eren... Answer me!

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:59.100
You knew that hell was one 
step beyond the walls.

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:04.380
You might die horribly, 
like my mom and dad did.

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:09.660
So why did you want to go?

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:14.390
Why?

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:18.690
You know why.

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:24.940
Because I was born into this world!

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:58.040
<i>Your dreams are where your heart is</i>

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:04.290
<i>They're more fragile than life itself</i>

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:08.950
<i>Over and over you cast them aside,</i>
<i>only to find more</i>

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:15.620
<i>Now, rest in peace</i>

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:26.950
<i>Pounding impulses defile the things we wish for</i>

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:37.250
<i>and the more we forget</i>
<i>the more we remember again</i>

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:43.200
<i>In this beautiful, cruel world</i>

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:48.370
<i>all I can do is ask why we're still alive</i>

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:54.080
<i>Oh, with our strength--and our weakness--</i>

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:59.750
<i>what are we going to protect if there's no sense</i>

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:03.160
<i>to anything anymore?</i>

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:12.400
Go. Run. Live.

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:15.620
Those words fill the air,

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:18.020
as many lives are lost 
on the battlefield.

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:22.410
Eren heads for the gate, 
carrying hope with him.

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:24.310
<b>Primal Desires
The Battle for Trost (9)</b>
