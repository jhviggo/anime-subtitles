00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.450
When did you last replace your shaft?

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.200
Six days ago, after the mop-up operation.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.910
Records confirm.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.160
All right. You're next.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.500
Christa Lenz of Squad 42!

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.370
Equipment check.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.370
So killing Titans can actually
get you in trouble, huh?

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.000
Yeah, it's crazy, but they <i>were</i>
valuable test subjects.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.370
Even so, why are they searching for
the culprits among us cadets?

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.540
Yeah, we're worn out enough as it is,
cleaning up the battlefield all this time...

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.790
Whoever it was really hates Titans.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.790
Mm...

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.870
But they pretty much
<i>helped </i>the Titans, if anything.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.160
Maybe it helped quench their
thirst for revenge,

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.040
but it was also a
big setback for humanity.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.700
I'm not too bright,
so I think I can relate.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.660
Before I actually saw a Titan,
I seriously planned on joining the Scouts.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.290
Now I never want
to see another one again.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.080
But today's the day we
hafta pick a regiment to join...

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.330
Is Jean seriously going to...?

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.450
Everyone's having regrets...

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.700
They never would've
chosen to be soldiers

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.000
if they knew this
hell awaited them...

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.290
Now that they're utterly drained,

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.330
that's the only thing
they can think about...

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.790
Marco...

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.580
I don't know which
bones are yours anymore...

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.540
If I hadn't become a soldier,

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.620
I never would've had
to worry about who's next...

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.450
Are we just going to throw away
all the advances in fighting techniques

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.700
that cost us tens of thousands
of lives so we can be Titan fodder?!

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.910
I <i>know </i>I have to fight.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.370
But not everyone can
be a suicidal maniac like you...

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.830
I don't mean any offense by this,

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.370
but I think the fact you <i>aren't </i>strong

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.250
really lets you understand how the weak feel.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.950
And your skill at recognizing
a situation as it unfolds

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.950
gives you a clear grasp of what
needs to be done <i>now</i>, you know?

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.700
What needs to be done now...

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.200
Hey, guys.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:08.040
Have you decided which
regiment you're going to join?

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.450
I have.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.950
I'm...

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.410
I'm...

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.040
...going to join the Scouts!

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.910
Damn...

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.750
Hey, Annie. What do you think?

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.290
Jean says he's gonna join the Scouts.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.200
Huh? <i>Jean </i>is?

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.660
Don't really care.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.000
Yeah, you're joining the Military Police.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Maybe I should too after all?

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.080
Tell me, if someone
told you to die, would you?

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.870
What? No.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.000
Then do what matters most to <i>you</i>.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.580
What about you, Armin?

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.580
Huh? I...

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:07.290
I think I might, if the situation called
for it and I understood the reason why.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:08.870
Not that I'd <i>want </i>to.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.160
I see. So you've decided.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.620
Mm.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.330
Although it was always my plan anyway.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.040
Oh, man. Not you too, Armin?

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.120
For as weak as you are, you've got guts.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.870
Th-Thanks.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.370
You know, you're actually pretty nice, Annie.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:30.620
Huh?

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.330
I mean, you seem apprehensive
about us joining the Scouts,

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:40.120
plus I assume you have a reason
for joining the Military Police, right?

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.750
Not really.

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.830
I just want to stay alive.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.870
In the end, it seems they never found

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.660
whoever used the ODM gear
without permission.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.450
--Who could it have been?
--Beats me.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:07.290
Right now, I'm more worried about
the upcoming rookie solicitation.

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:11.950
How many rookies will be willing
to join us just for the hell of it?

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:13.410
Hey, Eren.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.790
Is there anyone in your
class who's thinking of joining us?

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:18.290
There are.

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:22.500
Well, there <i>were</i>.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.660
I'm not sure about now.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.910
Assemble!

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.750
Make ready at once!
We're going on patrol!

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.000
Yes, Sir!

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.410
Good morning, Captain Levi!

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:39.540
Listen, Eren. Don't fall
more than two lengths behind.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.870
You're only allowed to wander
around because <i>I'm </i>watching you.

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.290
Don't forget that.

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:45.290
Yes, Sir!

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:46.700
Let's go!

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.160
Jean!

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.750
Are you really joining the Scouts?

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:21.750
Yeah.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.290
Why the sudden change of heart?

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:26.500
I mean... aren't you afraid?

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.830
Huh? Of course
I don't like the lousy Scouts.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.000
Huh? Then, why are you...?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.250
It's not 'cause I'm not scared
of the Titans or anything like that.

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:42.950
Nor am I gonna say that capable
people <i>should </i>join the Scouts.

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.620
I'm not like that suicidal maniac.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.540
Eren, huh?

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.870
He's already been a Scout for a while now.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:51.830
Cadets!

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:53.290
Fall in!

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:56.250
Face the platform!
Face the platform!

00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:02.500
No one's persuaded
me into risking my life, either.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:07.370
This is one time where
the decision has to be all mine.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:19.580
I am Commander Erwin Smith
of the Scout Regiment.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:23.290
Today, you choose a regiment to join.

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:28.450
To put it bluntly, this is my
invitation for you to join the Scouts.

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:31.080
I am sure that,
after this recent Titan attack,

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.290
you've already come
to know their horror,

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:37.910
as well as the limits of your own abilities.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.370
However!

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.290
Through this battle,

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:44.830
humanity has gained an unprecedented
advancement toward victory.

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:47.410
I'm referring to Eren Jaeger.

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:51.660
He has proven,
by risking life and limb,

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:55.000
that he is unquestionably on our side.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:02.660
What's more, he has helped
us not only foil the Titans' invasion,

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:06.540
but given us a way to learn
the truth behind the Titans as well!

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.620
We have reason to believe that the
basement of his home in Shiganshina

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:18.160
houses a secret of the
Titans that not even <i>he </i>is aware of.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:23.450
If we can just reach this basement,
we may be able to obtain information

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:28.290
that will help us break free
from the Titans' century-long tyranny.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.080
Basement?

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.540
Things have already progressed this far?

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.870
If we can figure out what the Titans are,
we can turn the tables on them!

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:44.410
However badly he wants new recruits,
going public with this is too much...

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:47.910
Or is this part of some sort of plan?

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:52.540
Just what is the commander looking for?!

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.450
We will head for the basement
in Shiganshina District.

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:14.500
However, doing so will require
taking back Wall Maria.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:18.250
In other words, our goal is the
same as it's always been...

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.660
...but now that Trost's gate is unusable,

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:27.080
we've no choice but to depart from
Calaneth District, further to the east.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:33.660
The entire battalion route we spent
four years establishing is now useless.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:39.290
During those four years,
over 60% of the Scouts died.

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:41.910
60% in four years.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:44.540
Truly unbelievable numbers.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.700
In one month there will
be an outside scouting mission.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.500
New recruits from
your class <i>will </i>take part in it,

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:55.330
of which I estimate 30% will die.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.950
And in four years, most will be dead.

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:01.000
However, whoever prevails

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.870
will have become a highly skilled
soldier who can survive anything.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:11.450
Knowing this dismal state of affairs,

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:16.700
whoever still wishes to put
their life on the line, remain here.

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:18.830
Ask yourself...

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:24.080
...if you can give your heart for
the sake of humankind!

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.500
That is all.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.580
Those who wish to join
other regiments may leave.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:36.830
Sir!

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:39.830
Don't you think that was overly intimidating?!

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:42.500
No one's going to stay behind now!

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.580
Damn...

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.870
Please... I've already decided!

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:16.160
Don't make me hate
myself any more than this...!

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:20.910
If I don't walk away now,
I'll have to go through that again!

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:26.410
I originally left my village to
join the Military Police...

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:28.160
Mom will be so happy...

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:32.870
And if I join the Military Police,
everyone will finally respect me too...

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:35.790
But now we know it...

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:38.410
Now we've seen it...

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:41.080
How the Titans...

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.910
...eat people!

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:12.500
If you cadets were
told to die, could you?

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.870
We don't wish to die, Sir!

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:19.950
I see. You each have
an outstanding look about you.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.870
All of you here are hereby accepted

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:26.830
as new members of the Scout Regiment!

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:29.120
<i>This </i>is a genuine salute!

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.120
Give your hearts!

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.000
Yes, Sir!

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:39.120
Everyone...

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:42.080
Joining the Scouts... Man, this sucks...

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:45.790
I'm scared! I wanna go home!

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.000
I don't care anymore...

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.580
If you're gonna cry, then don't stay.

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.330
You've done well to endure your fear.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.450
You're all brave soldiers.

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:05.000
I respect you from the bottom of my heart.

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.040
Salute!

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:17.580
I'm Section Commander Ness.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.910
And this is my horse, Charrette.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:24.750
Charrette likes to pull hair,
so watch out if you don't wanna go bald.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:27.000
It's nice to meet you.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.700
You idiot! Stop that, Charrette!

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.750
Someone do something! Hey!

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:34.040
Our training began the next day.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.500
However, it was focused
less on actual combat

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:40.120
and more on having Commander Erwin's
long-range scouting formation

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.370
drummed into our heads.

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:46.250
Oddly enough, although it
was a precise, calculated formation,

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:51.000
Eren Jaeger's position
was nowhere to be found.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.950
You rookies will be here,

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:56.910
between the wagon defense
squad and the scout support squad.

00:15:56.910 --> 00:16:01.620
Here, you will run alongside
spare horses and relay signals.

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:04.660
Our special operations
squad will be positioned here,

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:06.620
on standby in the rear of the center rank.

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:09.040
That's pretty far back.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.830
This is the safest position in the formation.

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:15.540
Not even the supply
wagons get this level of treatment.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:19.250
Our goal this time is simply
to leave and come back, though.

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:22.330
This expedition is meant to
be short, as it's also a test run

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:26.910
to see if we can get you all
the way to Shiganshina or not.

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:28.200
Umm...

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:33.410
I still don't really know what
to do with this ability of mine...

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:37.080
Do you understand what the
commander asked you back then?

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.500
Huh?

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.910
What do you think the enemy is?

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:43.330
Do any of you know what he meant?

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:44.750
Nope.

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.750
I'd be lying if I said I understood it all.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:51.450
--But I--
--It's possible...

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:53.750
...there's another goal to this operation.

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:58.500
But the commander decided it doesn't
need to be explained to the soldiers.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:03.910
In which case, leaving and
coming back is all we should focus on.

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:05.250
Have faith in the commander.

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:06.660
Yes, Sir.

00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:10.330
That's all for today's training.
Prepare to head back.

00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:26.910
Oh, it's them!

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:28.000
Mr. Oruo!

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.120
May I go talk with
my classmates for a minute?!

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.410
Tch. Go on.

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:34.870
Hey! Mikasa! Armin!

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:36.870
Eren!

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:39.120
It feels like it's been forever!

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.620
Eren...

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.700
Have they mistreated you in any way?!

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.120
Like studying and
examining every bit of you

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.120
or putting you through mental anguish?!

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.910
N-No, not at all...

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:52.410
That pipsqueak went way too far.

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:54.330
Someday I <i>will </i>make him pay.

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:57.830
Are you talking about Captain Levi?

00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:59.000
Hey, Eren!

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.500
Long time, no see!

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.040
Oh!

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.040
You're all here?!

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.200
But...

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:10.750
If you're here... does that
mean you joined the Scouts?

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:13.200
Why else <i>would </i>we be here?

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:18.410
Then just Jean, Annie,
and Marco joined the Military Police?

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.410
Wait, you too?!

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:25.620
Marco's dead.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:26.750
Huh?

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.450
What did you just say?

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:34.500
Did you say Marco's dead?

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:38.500
Apparently not everyone can
die in a dramatic way.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:42.000
I don't even know how he went out.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.410
He died all alone,
without anyone knowing or seeing.

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:48.040
<i>Marco </i>did...?

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:52.830
Hey! Gather 'round, rookies!

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:56.620
Your uniforms are here!

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.910
Are you guys really...?

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:40.870
Yes. We're taking part
in the upcoming operation too.

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:42.160
Hey, Eren.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:46.540
I heard you tried to kill
Mikasa when you turned into a Titan.

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:48.910
What's all that about?

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:51.410
It's not like that.
He was swatting at a fly.

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:53.290
I'm not asking you.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.950
Actually, Mikasa.

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:59.200
That cut on your cheek looks pretty deep.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.200
When did you get it?

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:08.620
Apparently it's true. I tried to
kill Mikasa when I was in Titan form.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:11.870
Apparently? Meaning you don't remember?

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:16.040
So, basically, you never knew
about this Titan ability of yours until now

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:19.290
<i>and </i>you don't have full control over it?

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:21.250
Yeah. That's right.

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:29.120
Hear that, guys? Sounds like
<i>this </i>is the current situation.

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:32.450
Our lives and the lives of all
humankind rest on his shoulders.

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:37.160
We'll probably end up just like
Marco too: dead before Eren knows it.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:41.950
Jean. What's the point in
chastising Eren now?

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:44.040
Y'know, Mikasa...

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:49.540
Not everyone is willing to
needlessly die for Eren like you.

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:56.750
We should know what
we're laying down our lives for.

00:20:56.750 --> 00:21:00.540
Otherwise we'll end up
hesitating when the time comes.

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:04.500
We're asking Eren for a guarantee.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.120
Show us what you're worth...

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.410
...so we can see if our
lives are worth as much.

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:17.950
So, Eren!

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:23.040
We're really counting on you, you hear?!

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.950
Y-Yeah...

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:35.160
Commander. It's almost time.

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:39.330
We've lured the nearby Titans away!

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:41.950
Thirty seconds to gate opening!

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.250
It's the Scouts!

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:53.790
The marks on their backs
are called the Wings of Freedom!

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:55.290
So cool!

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.790
This is it!

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:02.660
Humanity is now about
to take another step forward!

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:06.080
Show us what you're made of!

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:09.750
Open the gate!

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:23.750
Forward!

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:32.660
Now commencing the
57th Exterior Scouting Mission!

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:35.000
Move out!

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:57.790
<i>If, by chance, I'm not me</i>

00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:03.040
<i>then who's to say that you're you?</i>

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:08.330
<i>Can you pick up the pieces of your heart</i>

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:13.450
<i>that fell apart like a broken sand castle?</i>

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:18.450
<i>The voice of someone calling out</i>

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:22.540
<i>changed into ringing in my ears</i>

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:27.700
<i>It's as if time has stopped</i>

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:30.500
<i>Now wake up</i>

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:35.790
<i>I made my way out of the deep darkness</i>

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:41.040
<i>I fled like a swift wind</i>

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:48.540
<i>We used to be like living corpses,</i>

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:50.580
<i>but now we head beyond the walls</i>

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:52.620
<i>Let's meet again</i>

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:57.450
<i>in a place not on any map</i>

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:13.580
The Scout Regiment takes up
its long-range scouting formation

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:15.830
and makes progress beyond the wall.

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:21.830
Suddenly, they encounter
a mysterious, intelligent Titan.

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:23.410
"Female Titan"
"The 57th Exterior Scouting Mission, Part 1"
