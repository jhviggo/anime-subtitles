00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.160
Armin...

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.950
It's nice I could be a "good person" for you.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.250
For now, you've won your bet.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.120
But...

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.830
...<i>my </i>bet...

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.540
...begins now!

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.500
We believe we've found out who the Female Titan is.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.750
Her name is...

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.540
Annie!

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.500
<i>I won't let your deaths be meaningless</i>

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.620
<i>even if I'm the last one standing</i>

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.500
<i>In both hands, Gloria</i>

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.500
<i>What sings is Sieg</i>

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.750
<i>On my back, Flügel der Freiheit</i>

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.580
<i>Clenched determination to my left chest</i>

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.910
<i>What slashes across is Linie der Torheit</i>

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.160
<i>Soaring across the azure skies</i>

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.700
<i>Flügel der Freiheit</i>

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.370
"Mercy"
"Assault on Stohess, Part 2"

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.410
"Several days earlier"

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.330
What's takin' so long?

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.330
Where the hell are Erwin's men?

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.870
At this rate, the Military Police
escort's gonna show up before them.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.290
Must be having a hell of
a hard time taking a shit.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.950
You're very talkative today, Captain.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.790
Don't be stupid.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.290
I talk plenty.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.910
I'm sorry.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.870
If only I hadn't made the wrong choice then,

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.790
none of this would've happened...

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.000
I told you. No one knows
how things will turn out.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.700
--Sorry I'm late.
--Not at all...

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.790
Guys!

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.700
U-Umm...

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.410
We believe we've found
out who the Female Titan is.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.910
Huh?!

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.540
We <i>will </i>capture her this time.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.040
We do it the day after tomorrow,

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.410
while passing through Stohess
District on our way to the capital.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.450
This will be our first and last chance at her.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.450
Once on the other side,
the government will take custody of Eren

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.080
and we'll have difficulty investigating
those bent on destroying the walls.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.410
Both of which will foster
humankind's destruction.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.200
We'll have to bet everything on this operation.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.120
The plan is this...

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.410
While passing through Stohess,
we use Eren as bait

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.250
to lure the target into
this underground passage.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.250
Given the target's size and strength,

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.410
if we can get her as far down as possible

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.750
we should be able to
immobilize her in her Titan form.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.870
But, in the event that
she transforms before then...

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.120
...it'll be up to you, Eren.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.250
Yes, Sir!

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.910
Are we certain the target will
actually be in Stohess, then?

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.250
Yes. The target is a
member of the Military Police.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.500
The Military Police?

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.660
It was Armin who identified her.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:08.370
We believe that <i>she </i>killed
the two Titans we caught alive...

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:13.410
...and that she might have trained
with you in the 104th Cadet Corps.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.120
H-Hold on a minute!

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.000
The 104th Cadet Corps...

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.200
The name of the girl we
believe to be the Female Titan...

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.620
Y-You can't be serious...

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.000
...is Annie Leonhart.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.500
O-Oh, no...

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.080
Damn! That ring...

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.410
She knew I was lying from the very start!

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.330
She saw the ambush coming from a mile away!

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.540
Surely there must've been a better way!

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.040
Save the regrets for later!

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.330
What should we do now?!

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.290
First, we rendezvous with
Squad 3 and get above ground.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:18.580
Then we fight Annie--the
Female Titan--as per Plan B!

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.040
Eren, you'll help catch her in
your Titan form, just as we planned.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.250
All right?!

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.870
Yeah!

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.950
Hey!

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.500
It's Squad 3!

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.830
Capture Plan A failed?!

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.410
It did!

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.790
Please switch to the backup plan!

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.120
She stomped through it?!

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.540
--We have to help them!
--Eren!

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:53.620
Get back!

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.370
Whoa! Hey! Mikasa!

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.370
Does she not care if she kills Eren?!

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.040
She took a gamble.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.370
She gambled on Eren surviving
when she made that hole.

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.040
This makes her all the more formidable!

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.700
Annie's <i>that </i>desperate to catch Eren now!

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.660
Now what? Our escape route's been cut off.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.910
And she'll be ready and waiting for
us if we make a run for it with ODM.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.580
That said...

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:38.370
If we stay here, there's no
telling when she'll stomp on us.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.040
I'll manage somehow!

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.620
Just like when I stopped that cannonball!

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.290
--Come here!
--Hey--!

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:50.000
Here goes! Stay close!

00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:59.790
Huh?

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.580
Again?!

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.500
Dammit!

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.290
Of all the times...!

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:12.000
Damn, that hurts!

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.370
You can't transform without a clear goal, right?

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.580
Try to focus again! Hard!

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:21.750
I'm trying to!

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.330
But it's not--

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.160
Are you sure?

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:37.410
Could it be you still have
qualms about fighting Annie?

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.700
Eren?

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:45.750
After all this, don't tell me you <i>still </i>think

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:48.950
that Annie can't possibly be the Female Titan...

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.700
What did you see just now?

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.580
<i>She </i>killed our comrades, you know.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.790
Do you still think it's not her?

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:02.450
G-Give me a break!

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.700
I'm trying here!

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.370
Annie's the Female Titan?!

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:11.830
What makes...

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:15.250
What makes you think that, Armin?

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:19.370
The Female Titan knew what
you looked like from the start.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:23.160
Plus, she reacted to your
nickname of "suicidal maniac,"

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.200
something only our classmates would know.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.750
The biggest reason, though,

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:33.950
is that I believe <i>she </i>killed the
test subjects Sawney and Beane.

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:36.250
How do you know that?

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:40.200
Killing them would've required real skill,

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.950
so she would've used the ODM
gear she'd become accustomed to.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:47.500
Yeah, but they held that equipment inspection.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.290
Annie's was fine.

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:53.540
Because she presented Marco's gear.

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:57.000
That's how she avoided being caught.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.500
Huh?!

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.830
What are you saying?

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:04.040
What's Marco got to do with this?

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.040
I'm not sure.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.580
Maybe you just saw wrong?

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:10.000
No, I definitely recognized--

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.410
Hey, kid.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:13.250
We get it.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:15.200
Any other evidence to share?

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.790
No, Sir.

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:20.250
Personally, I think Annie
and the Female Titan look alike.

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:22.790
Huh?! Are you crazy?!

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.160
What kind of evidence is--?!

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.370
So, basically, we're
going after her <i>without </i>proof.

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:29.250
Without proof?

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:30.580
You can't be serious.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.120
Why?

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.120
What if it <i>isn't </i>Annie?

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:38.250
If it isn't Annie, then she'll
be cleared of suspicion.

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:41.330
I'll feel bad for causing
her trouble if that happens.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:42.580
But...

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:48.250
If we do nothing, the government
will make a sacrificial victim out of you.

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:51.160
You guys are crazy, distrusting Annie...

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.160
Eren.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.950
Does this talk about Annie ring any bells?

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:07.750
You fought hand-to-hand with the Female Titan;

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:11.330
did you see her use any
techniques only Annie uses?

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.910
You know, don't you?

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.290
You know the Female Titan is Annie.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:45.160
Then you know you have to fight.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:49.910
Or are there certain,
special feelings stopping you?

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:51.540
Huh?!

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:59.080
I have a plan!

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:03.250
Mikasa and I will exit that hole
and that entrance at the same time.

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:06.330
At that point, Annie will go for one of us.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:09.660
When she does, run the opposite way, Eren!

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.080
Wait!

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.910
That means one of you will get killed!

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:16.870
If we stay here, all three of us will die!

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:18.660
Mikasa! Get in position!

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.910
Right! I'll take this way!

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:24.080
Mikasa!

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.160
Armin!

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.870
How...?

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:30.700
How are you guys able to fight?!

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.160
How?!

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.250
We don't have a choice.

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:41.870
We live in a cruel world.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.790
Eren!

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.580
Annie! I won't let you have Eren!

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.830
Eren!

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:41.000
Eren!

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.500
I'm coming!

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:47.580
Open your eyes...!

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:14.790
Don't let the Female Titan escape!

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:17.830
We <i>can't </i>let her get away!

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:25.250
What's going on?!

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:27.080
Escort Squad! I'll hold this position!

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.330
See what's happening!

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.200
Understood!

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.080
Something's up...

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.790
First there was that big boom, and now...

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:37.330
Nile.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.750
Deploy all troops immediately.

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:41.870
We should assume a Titan has appeared.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:44.000
A-Are you crazy?!

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.830
This is Wall Sina, you know!

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:49.500
No Titan would show up here!

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.580
Halt! Stop right there, Jaeger!

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:55.450
I'm through playing dress-up!

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:58.580
Never call me that name again, you halfwit!

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:01.290
Commander! I want to help, too!

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:03.370
Ask Squad 4 for equipment.

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:04.620
Understood!

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:08.620
Bravado is nice and all,
but just remember to stay alive.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.080
Yes, Sir!

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:12.410
Wha...?!

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:14.500
Erwin! What the hell was that?!

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:16.620
Commander! I brought it!

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:20.450
--Good work.
--Thank you, Sir!

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.500
Hold on, Erwin!

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.870
All able-bodied soldiers, follow me!

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:28.950
We're going to rendezvous
with the Capture Squad!

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:31.410
Erwin!

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:33.120
Stop!

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:40.040
You're committing a clear act of
treason against the royal government!

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:45.410
Nile. Are you as rubbish-brained as you look?

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:48.580
You don't seem to understand
what's happening here.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.160
Remove your gear, Erwin!

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.950
A Titan! There's a Titan!

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:57.410
--What's it doing here?!
--What about the wall?!

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:00.910
Hey... That's a Titan, right?

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:02.540
Yeah? Why?

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:04.200
Outta the way!

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.200
Just look at 'em, not givin' a crap!

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.790
And to think that could've
been me up there too...

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:15.500
Man, what got into me?

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.870
Damn!

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.830
Don't try to kill her! We just need to stop her!

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:37.290
It's no use! She's familiar with ODM maneuvers!

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.370
I won't make this easy for you!

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.500
Eren! Say something!

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.830
Eren!

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:56.500
Hey! What the hell are you doing?!

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.750
Jean! Eren's stuck under here!

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:02.200
Huh?! Wasn't he supposed to turn into a Titan?!

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.700
He couldn't!

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:07.700
I think the fact the Female Titan
is Annie is holding him back...

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.200
What?

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.500
For now, we gotta help him!

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.200
Jean! Give me a hand!

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.200
He couldn't do it?

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.790
Damn it, Eren! Quit screwing around!

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:23.870
I told you we'd need to count on you someday!

00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:28.870
We're forced to put the world, humankind,
and our own lives in <i>your </i>hands,

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.950
and this is all you have to show for it?!

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:34.700
Marco didn't... Marco <i>can't </i>have...

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.580
Damn it!

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:47.450
Eren...!

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:51.290
It's no use! We gotta do
something about<i> her </i>first!

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.410
Eren...

00:17:56.410 --> 00:18:00.000
There's something I told Jean once.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.120
Those who can't abandon anything...

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.120
...can't change anything.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:11.290
The ability to give up your humanity
when forced to rise above monsters...

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:14.910
I think that's something Annie can do.

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:17.580
Although I don't know <i>why </i>she does it.

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:18.950
But...

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:21.950
Whoever can do that will prevail!

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:36.870
Annie!

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:39.200
If you don't kill me this time,

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:43.370
your sore excuses about "your real
bet starting now" will be worthless!

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:49.700
Armin! This way!

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:51.500
Understood!

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:04.500
--She's coming... She's coming!
--Section Commander...

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:07.450
You have that crazy look in your eyes.

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.580
All right!

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:43.950
Personally, I thought having a
Plan C seemed like overkill.

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:46.700
But Commander Erwin really does know his stuff.

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:50.910
Now, then...

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:58.410
I suggest you be a
good girl and behave yourself.

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:08.160
You can't call any Titans to eat you <i>this </i>time.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.620
But don't you worry.

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:20.160
<i>I'll </i>savor the information I pry from you instead.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.040
She broke free?!

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:30.080
Looks like we didn't set enough traps!

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.000
Don't let her escape! After her!

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:42.410
Those who can't abandon anything...

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:45.120
...can't change anything!

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:48.040
I know.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.620
I failed before...

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:54.910
...when I clung to my friends
and the bond we shared...

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:58.160
Think back...

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:14.080
I'm going... to drive them out...!

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.660
No...

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.410
Kill them!

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:25.370
There's no time to think
whether it's right or wrong!

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:27.370
Just act!

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:30.540
Don't try to end things all nice and neat!

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.160
Yes...

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.910
Mikasa!

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:36.830
We live in a cruel world!

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:48.000
Now what?!

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:25.160
Eren!

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.830
Eren...

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:57.750
<i>If, by chance, I'm not me</i>

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:03.000
<i>then who's to say that you're you?</i>

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.290
<i>Can you pick up the pieces of your heart</i>

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:13.410
<i>that fell apart like a broken sand castle?</i>

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:18.410
<i>The voice of someone calling out</i>

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:22.500
<i>changed into ringing in my ears</i>

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:27.660
<i>It's as if time has stopped</i>

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.450
<i>Now wake up</i>

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:35.750
<i>I made my way out of the deep darkness</i>

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:41.000
<i>I fled like a swift wind</i>

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:48.500
<i>We used to be like living corpses,</i>

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.540
<i>but now we head beyond the walls</i>

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.580
<i>Let's meet again</i>

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:57.410
<i>in a place not on any map</i>

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:14.500
"I'm going to drive out
every last Titan from this world."

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:18.080
The anger that drove young
Eren to make that vow that day

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:21.370
now drives him to destroy everything.

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:23.370
"Wall"
"Assault on Stohess, Part 3"
