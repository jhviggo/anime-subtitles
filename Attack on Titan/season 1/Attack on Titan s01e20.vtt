00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.580
After setting out to establish
a route to Shiganshina,

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.080
the Scout Regiment encountered
an intelligent, female Titan.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.250
As soldier after soldier fell,

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.700
the regiment rushed
into a forest of giant trees,

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.290
much to everyone's puzzlement.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.540
Who can possibly stop it,
if not the Levi Squad?!

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.040
Another one's dead!

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.330
We could've saved him, too!

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.000
Choose.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Will you trust yourself,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.540
or me, these guys,
and the entire Scout Regiment?

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.000
I'll go with you!

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.330
Fire!

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.160
You don't mean...?!

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.620
They're going to take that Titan alive?!

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.540
What do you think of that, Eren?!
We caught that Titan!

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.660
This is the might of the Scout Regiment!
Don't underrate us, you idiot!

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.500
Now do you see?!

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.200
Yes!

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.620
It looks like she's stopped.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.660
We can't drop our guard yet.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.830
I'm just impressed you
managed to lead her to this spot.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.330
The credit goes to the rear squad
members who gave their lives fighting her.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.700
They bought us time.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.160
It would've been impossible otherwise.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.750
Is that so?

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.160
Yes.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.120
Thanks to them...

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.500
...we get to see who's
inside this one's nape.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.080
Let's just hope they're not
wetting themself inside there...

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.580
<i>I won't let your deaths be meaningless</i>

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.700
<i>even if I'm the last one standing</i>

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.580
<i>In both hands, Gloria</i>

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.580
<i>What sings is Sieg</i>

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.790
<i>On my back, Flügel der Freiheit</i>

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.620
<i>Clenched determination to my left chest</i>

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.000
<i>What slashes across is Linie der Torheit</i>

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.250
<i>Soaring across the azure skies</i>

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.790
<i>Flügel der Freiheit</i>

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.290
"Erwin Smith"
"The 57th Exterior Scouting Mission, Part 4"

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.750
An Abnormal...

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.250
Or is it like the Colossal Titan?

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.330
Wait, did Commander Erwin actually--?

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.910
Hey! Quit spacin' out!

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:10.910
Eren!

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.500
You can think later!
We need to get further ahead!

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.910
Right!

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.500
Wait, Levi.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.330
We need to be extra cautious.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.910
Waves 2 and 3!

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.950
Fire!

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.200
Use the reserves too!

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.580
Umm, they're starting to climb up...

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.790
Indeed.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.910
If they make it up this far,
perhaps I'll step out of the way.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.120
Although...

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.120
I suspect we'll soon be given
orders to withdraw anyway.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.160
Does it have something to do
with those explosions inside the forest?

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.790
I don't know.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.750
Mikasa...

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.200
What do you think those sounds are?

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.450
Are cannons being
fired inside the forest?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.410
I didn't <i>see </i>them bring
any cannons in, though...

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.370
What's with all this damn noise?

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.870
Hey, Mr. Bertholdt.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.250
Do you know which way Christa went?

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.580
Sorry. I don't.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.000
Nothing makes sense anymore.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.410
What are we even doing now, and why?

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.000
I wanna go home...

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.000
--Let's move away, Armin!
--Right!

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.910
Looks like the bastard's
gotten the hang of it.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.410
It's gotten better and
better at tree-climbing!

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.080
The scary thing is that
this means they can learn.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.790
Although I'm sure it's
different for each Titan too.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.200
Armin.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.040
They seem to be up to
something inside the forest,

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.080
and I think I've
figured out what it is.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.750
They lured that female Titan here

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.370
to capture her.

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:22.620
Or, more precisely,
to capture the human inside.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.080
That was Commander Erwin's goal...

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.750
...from the very start.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.080
Wasn't it?!

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:35.040
Still, I can understand keeping
it from us rookies, but you guys too?!

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.250
You've been Scouts a long time!

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.620
Man, you're annoying!

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.620
Are you suggesting the commander
and the captain don't trust us?!

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.290
N-No, but that's what
this means, doesn't it?!

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.500
Petra! Knock out his teeth!

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.290
Switch his front teeth with his back ones!

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.160
No, Eren's right.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:58.500
The captain must've had a
reason for not trusting us implicitly.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.700
Like what?

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:03.200
There's only one reason
he couldn't trust his comrades.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.290
There's someone in the regiment
who can either turn into a Titan

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:10.000
or is working as a sort of spy for them.

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.910
You think so too, right?
That there's someone in the regiment...

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:18.410
Mm. I think there is.

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.500
A spy?

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.410
Are you really sure?

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:30.000
At the very least,
the commander must believe so.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.080
I assume the only soldiers
informed of this operation

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.450
were the ones who survived five years ago.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:36.580
I see.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:37.950
So that's why...

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:40.040
Yep, that's gotta be it.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.540
Get it, Eren?
That's what's goin' on.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.160
Mm. In that case, it couldn't be helped.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.450
Yeah...

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:50.250
Five years ago
was when the wall first fell...

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:52.700
Could they be using that
fact to narrow down suspects

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.540
on the assumption
that's when the spy got inside?

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:59.580
Does that mean this person
killed Sawney and Bean too?

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:05.410
The commander asked me
something after that happened...

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.580
What do <i>you </i>see here?

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.080
What do you think the enemy is?

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.540
Is <i>that </i>what that meant?

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.870
We might've been allowed
to join the operation

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:20.500
if we'd known the answer to that question.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.580
I doubt any of us could have, though.

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.750
Well, I knew.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:30.830
But I decided not to say anything.
Do you guys know why?

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.620
Why?

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:35.250
What, you mean you don't know?

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:38.200
I guess guys like
you wouldn't know, huh?

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.620
You're nowhere near my
level yet, after all.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:45.040
Seriously, are you still
trying to imitate Captain Levi?

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.750
He doesn't talk like that.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:51.750
If this succeeds, we might actually
learn the truth about this world.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:55.830
Still, even for that...

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.950
...way too many people have died.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.200
Do you think the commander
was wrong to do this?

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.870
He wasn't in the right,
I'll tell you that.

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:15.080
If we'd actually been told
that a Titan had inside info,

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.450
we would've handled things differently.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:20.450
Your own squad members, for example...

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.540
--No, it wasn't wrong.
--Huh?

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.410
How can you say that?

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:32.790
Do you know how many
soldiers have needlessly died?!

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:34.040
Jean.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.330
In hindsight, it's easy to
say what should've been done.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.080
But...

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.580
No one can tell how things will turn out.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.910
Yet, at some point
you <i>have </i>to make a choice.

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:49.120
The lives of a hundred comrades...

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.040
...or the lives of
everyone inside the walls.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.160
The commander chose.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.410
He chose to throw away
the lives of a hundred comrades.

00:09:58.410 --> 00:09:59.660
Eren.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:03.620
If you didn't know already,
you'll soon learn why

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:10.160
Erwin Smith was put in charge
of the Scouts, of humanity's hope...

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.200
It's why he even
has Captain Levi's trust!

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.040
That's assuming you
survive long enough, of course.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:20.500
I don't have much
life experience yet...

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.000
...but I <i>do </i>know one thing.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.250
If there's anyone who
can bring about change,

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:31.080
it's someone capable of
giving up what matters most.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.870
In particular, people who are capable
of abandoning their humanity

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:38.500
when forced to rise above monsters.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.330
Those who can't abandon anything...

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:44.200
...can't change anything.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.540
Fire!

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:03.910
How do you like that?

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:08.040
Now you can't scratch a
single itch or move a single muscle.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.950
And you probably never will again.

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:17.200
The more your wounds heal,
the stiffer your joints will get!

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:22.950
Still, why haven't they
extracted our esteemed guest yet?

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:26.830
What are Levi and Miche doing?!

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:56.580
So she has the ability to cover portions
of her body with hardened skin...

00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:01.410
Much like the Armored Titan I've heard about.

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:06.790
Will it weaken if we continue
an ODM sword assault?

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:08.700
There's no time to try.

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.540
In which case...

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:12.620
Sir!

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:14.580
Prepare to blast it.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.370
Blow off the target's hands.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:17.660
Yes, Sir!

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.660
However, there's a
risk our standard artillery

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:24.200
could take out everything
on the inside as well.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:29.080
Then let's attempt to
sever the wrists instead.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.370
Fire an all-out salvo on my signal.

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:33.000
Understood!

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:46.080
Hey. Just come out already, will you?

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.450
We don't got time for this.

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:53.410
Say, what do you think's
gonna happen to you now?

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:58.790
Do you really think you
can get out of this situation?

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:03.200
I wish you'd pay some thought
to the trouble you've caused us.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.870
You killed our men in
all sorts of different ways.

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:10.580
Was it fun?

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.620
Well, <i>I'm </i>having fun now.

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:17.500
I take it you're the same way.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:22.450
If there's anyone who
knows how I feel, it's you.

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:24.870
Oh, right.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:27.870
There's one thing I need to ask.

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:32.080
Will you be fine if
your limbs get cut off?

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.540
They'll go grow back, right?

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.790
I'm talking about your <i>actual </i>body.

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:42.200
Can't afford to have
you die on us, after all...

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:17.120
Damn. You startled me there.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.580
Were those her death throes?

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:25.200
Erwin. I smell them.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.410
Which direction?

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:29.370
All directions, all at once!
Lots of them!

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:37.290
What the...?!
They're rushing into the forest all at once!

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:39.620
Why are they suddenly ignoring us?!

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.120
What?!

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.000
Does this mean they're <i>all </i>Abnormals?!

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.790
Doesn't matter! Don't let 'em through!

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:52.910
Commence combat!

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.790
What was that all of a sudden?!

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:58.620
Please, wait!

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.410
I've heard screams like that before!

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:04.450
In the forest where I'm from!

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:08.200
It's the sound a cornered animal makes
when it's ready to give up everything!

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:12.540
I was taught the end of a hunt
is when you have to be most careful!

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.620
So you want me to be careful?

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.910
Please be a hundred times
more careful than normal!

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:19.500
You <i>will </i>die if you
don't take the forest seriously!

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.000
I'm from the mountains too, actually...

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.620
You're a vegetable farmer!
You wouldn't understand!

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.040
I see.

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:29.910
Sasha's hunches <i>are </i>often right.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:33.950
And it's usually only before
something bad happens...

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:38.620
Armin said Eren might be in the
rear of the center rank, as I recall...

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.500
Hurry with artillery!

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:47.500
Erwin!

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.700
The first wave is coming
from the east! They're close!

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:54.750
Wagon defense squad! Intercept them!

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.080
They're ignoring us?!
Are they Abnormals?!

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.910
Three Titans have broken through!

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:08.040
Captain Levi!

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.750
Hey, you...

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:12.660
You just did something, didn't you?

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:25.500
It went for the female one?

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:30.750
Titans coming from all directions!

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:33.200
All soldiers, commence combat!

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.000
Defend the Female Titan at all costs!

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:53.040
No!

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:09.040
All soldiers, withdraw!

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.200
Redeploy the formation!

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:15.290
Return to Calaneth District!

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:35.330
We've been bested.

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:40.040
What's with that pathetic look of yours?

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:46.120
This goes to show that the enemy
was prepared to throw away everything.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:49.700
I never imagined our target
would resort to Titan cannibalization

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:52.250
to dispose of information...

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:57.620
After all that blustering we did
in the courtroom, this is how it turns out...

00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:59.700
If we waltz back there now,

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.370
who knows what'll happen to Eren or us...

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:04.790
We can think about that once we've returned.

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:09.540
For now, we need to focus on returning
without sustaining any further losses.

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:10.950
For now.

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:15.160
The steam is impairing visibility.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.700
It could hinder smoke signal communications.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.000
I'm going to get my squad.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.830
Wait, Levi.

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.080
Replenish your gas and blades first.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:33.410
We're low on time and
I have enough to last already.

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:34.620
Why?

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:38.370
That's an order. Do as you're told.

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.370
Whatever you say, Erwin.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.200
I'll trust your judgment.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.790
The withdrawal signal.

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:02.080
We're all to withdraw and
return to base on horseback.

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.370
Right!

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:06.620
What? Is it all over?

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:12.370
All right! We can go home!

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:14.700
Just what's going on?

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.700
Is Eren all right?

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:19.790
Looks like it's over.

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:22.500
Let's get back to the
horses! Prepare to withdraw!

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:23.660
You heard the man.

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:28.790
Let's go see what the
bastard riding inside it looks like.

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:32.790
Did they really find out who it is?

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:34.830
All thanks to you!

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:36.620
Huh? But I didn't do anything.

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:39.290
You trusted us, remember?

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:43.410
Things turned out this way
because you chose to stick with us.

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:47.660
Making the right call is a pretty
hard thing to do, you know!

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.410
Hey, now. Quit pamperin' him, Petra.

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:53.540
How was <i>he </i>any help?

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:57.040
All he did was whine
like a pathetic little brat.

00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:00.450
I guess making it back alive <i>might</i>
be considered praiseworthy,

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:04.410
but only after the
mission's done and over with.

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:08.870
Just so you know, twerp, an expedition
ain't over 'til you're back home.

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:11.950
Yes, I get it already!

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:15.290
Oruo! Petra!

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:18.750
For a couple of soldiers who cried and
pissed their pants during their first battle,

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.620
you've really grown!

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:22.790
Don't mention that!

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:25.290
Are you <i>trying </i>to make
him lose respect for me, Eld?!

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:26.790
Whoa, she really did?!

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:28.040
It's the truth.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.580
And, just so you know,
I never pissed myself, Eren.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:34.330
You idiot! I'll have you know
I have the highest kill count!

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:35.870
I'm the best, you moron!

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:38.700
There's more to a soldier's
merits than just kill counts!

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:40.500
Shut up, you idiot!

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.200
Ms. Petra! Does that mean
it sprayed everywhere in midair?!

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.580
Knock it off!

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:46.290
Are you on a picnic or something?!

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:48.290
We're outside the walls, you know!

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:51.330
Also, I never wet myself either, Eren!

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.660
Oh. That must be a
message from Captain Levi.

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:08.500
We're rendezvousing with the captain!
Stow the chatter until we're home!

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.410
Erwin.

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:32.330
Why did you have
Levi replenish his supplies

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:34.200
when there's no time to waste?

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.160
The female was eaten.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.750
But did you see the
person inside get eaten?

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:41.160
I didn't.

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:42.910
Are you saying...?!

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:43.950
Yes.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:46.540
If, as you deduced earlier,

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:51.200
we're dealing with a type that remains
able-bodied after de-transformation...

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:56.200
And, if said person had equipped
themselves with ODM gear in advance...

00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:02.370
...that means they're now
wearing one of our uniforms...

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:04.450
Captain Levi?

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:07.080
No... It's not!

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.580
Who are you?!

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:18.330
M-Mr. Gunther!

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:19.950
Hey! Why...?!

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:22.330
Mr. Gunther!

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:35.290
...and have blended in
with the rest of us soldiers.

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:57.750
<i>If, by chance, I'm not me</i>

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:03.000
<i>then who's to say that you're you?</i>

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.290
<i>Can you pick up the pieces of your heart</i>

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:13.410
<i>that fell apart like a broken sand castle?</i>

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:18.410
<i>The voice of someone calling out</i>

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:22.500
<i>changed into ringing in my ears</i>

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:27.660
<i>It's as if time has stopped</i>

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.450
<i>Now wake up</i>

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:35.750
<i>I made my way out of the deep darkness</i>

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:41.000
<i>I fled like a swift wind</i>

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:48.500
<i>We used to be like living corpses,</i>

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.540
<i>but now we head beyond the walls</i>

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.580
<i>Let's meet again</i>

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:57.410
<i>in a place not on any map</i>

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:12.330
The capture operation has failed.

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:16.120
The Female Titan appears
before Eren once more.

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:18.450
Standing in the way is a
team of Titan-killing experts...

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:20.750
...the Special Operations Squad.

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:23.410
"Crushing Blow"
"The 57th Exterior Scouting Mission, Part 5"
