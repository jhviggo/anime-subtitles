00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:24.790
In the year 850, the Colossal Titan
reappeared and demolished another wall.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.450
Once again, humanity allowed
the Titans to further their advance.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.620
One after another,
soldiers fell to the Titans.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.250
And then...

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.410
Eren!

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.870
Hurry!

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.080
Eren fell prey to a Titan too.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.450
Man, Mikasa's incredible...

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.700
How can she move so fast?!

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.790
No! She's not her usual,
composed self at all!

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.870
I'll do whatever it takes to win!

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.120
Whatever it takes to live!

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.000
Mikasa found herself in
dire straits as well

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.700
when a mysterious Titan
appeared and attacked another Titan.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.830
<i>Unknown are the names</i>
<i>of the flowers that have been trampled</i>

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.290
<i>Birds have fallen to the earth</i>
<i>and long for the wind</i>

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.370
<i>Prayers won't solve anything</i>

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.700
<i>Only the will to fight</i>
<i>can change the here and now!</i>

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.000
<i>O pigs who laugh at the resolve</i>
<i>to walk over corpses to move forward</i>

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.540
<i>Livestock complacency? False prosperity?</i>

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.450
<i>Give us the freedom of dying,</i>
<i>starving wolves!</i>

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.830
<i>The humiliation of being caged</i>
<i>is what triggers us to fight back</i>

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.120
<i>We hunters slaughter prey</i>
<i>beyond the castle walls,</i>

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.330
<i>consumed with surging bloodlust,</i>

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:26.250
<i>as our crimson bows and arrows</i>
<i>pierce scarlet holes into the twilight</i>

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.330
"I Can Hear His Heartbeat"
"The Struggle for Trost, Part 4"

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.250
There!

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.910
Your mobility gear still works,
and I've given you all my blades.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.500
All I ask is that you
leave me with this one...

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.660
I'd rather not get
eaten alive, if I can help it.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.660
N-No way...

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.120
Armin.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.910
I'm not leaving you here.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.660
B-But the place is swarming with Titans;

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.870
you can't possibly
carry someone while jumping--

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.290
Let's go!

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.750
No...

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.370
Please don't...

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.830
I'll only...

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.040
I'll only get more of my friends killed!

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.500
Wait!

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.000
Listen! I have a suggestion!

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.620
A suggestion?

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.160
Only you two can do it,
so I leave the choice to you...

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.500
I know it sounds crazy,

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.620
but could we use
that Titan to our advantage?

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.120
That Titan?!

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.250
It attacks other Titans and
doesn't show any interest in us.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.120
So I'm wondering if we
could lead it to the supply building...

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.250
If it takes out the other Titans
for us, we just might all survive!

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.250
<i>Lead </i>it?! How do you
hope to lead that thing?!

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.250
My guess is it's fighting on instinct.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.290
If you two take out the Titans around it,

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.120
it'll go and look for other Titans.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.410
That'll naturally lead
it toward Headquarters.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.040
W-We can't risk our
necks for some hopeful guess!

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.080
But if it works, we could eliminate
all the Titans attacking HQ

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.040
in one fell swoop!

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.040
--It seems worth trying.
--Huh?!

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.620
Are you serious?!

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.040
It's better to take a gamble than
wait for our inevitable deaths.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.620
Let's go with Armin's suggestion.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.620
You want us to
fight Titans <i>with </i>a Titan?!

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.620
Yes. I do.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.250
If we fail, we'll be laughingstocks.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.750
But if we succeed, everyone survives.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.750
It all comes down to resolve.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.660
All right! Fine!

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.080
Am I really cut out for this?

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.000
Am I really fit to have
a position of responsibility?

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.500
No!

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.120
No... <i>now </i>is the time.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.540
Now is our chance, while the
Titans are preoccupied over there!

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.250
Now!

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.750
Make for HQ while we have the chance!

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:14.950
Now is our only chance!

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.290
If we run out of gas,
it's all over anyway!

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.120
Everyone, charge!

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.870
--Jean!
--Huh?

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.870
Thanks! You helped us get away!

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.080
Huh?!

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.330
It's all thanks to you!

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:19.000
It's like I said before!
You make a good leader!

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.700
I'm not so sure about that!

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.120
Damn!

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.620
How many made it?

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.580
How many comrades' deaths did I use?!

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:01.790
How many people
died because of my orders?

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:15.080
You're with the
supply team, aren't you?

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.540
Yeah...

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:20.950
Stop, Jean!

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.080
<i>These </i>are the ones who abandoned us!

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.000
People are dead because of you guys!

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.830
The Titans overran the supply room!

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:31.410
There was nothing we could do!

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.750
It's <i>your </i>job to deal with it anyway!

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.370
Hit the deck!

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:46.120
Crap...!

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.750
There are too many people!

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:51.120
--Hurry!
--Get further inside!

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.000
Stop! We can't <i>all </i>go at once!

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.580
Where'd Mikasa go?!

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:58.080
She ran out of gas!
She's long gone by now!

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:00.250
<i>This </i>is normal...

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:03.580
<i>This </i>must be what the real world is like...

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:08.290
Was I trying to
delude myself up until now?

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:13.410
Surely I knew what
the real world was like...

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:17.250
It's so obvious when you think about it...

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:22.830
There's no way we stand a
chance against these monstrosities...

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.080
What?!

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:45.410
Huh?

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:47.330
What the hell...?

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:52.540
Mikasa!

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.790
Man, that was close.
It's completely empty.

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:59.200
We did it! We managed to make it!

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.450
Wh-Whoa, you're alive!

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:04.000
--We did it, Armin!
--O-Ouch!

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.830
Your plan worked!

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:07.830
Guys!

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:11.000
That Titan's an Abnormal!
It's killin' all the other Titans!

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.330
<i>And </i>it has no interest in us!

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:18.160
We can use it to our
advantage to escape from here!

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.500
Use a Titan?!

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.080
A Titan, helping us?!

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.750
--What kind of nonsensical dream--
--It's no dream.

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:30.290
Whether it's an Abnormal
or not, I don't care.

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:34.580
We're going to let it rampage
here for as long as possible.

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:45.330
Because, realistically, that's our
best strategy for survival now.

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:08.410
It's okay.

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:11.700
That Titan's tougher than ordinary ones.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.120
I doubt they'll take down this building

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:22.410
while that one's rampaging like crazy.

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:26.620
How much do you know about that Titan?

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.910
We can worry about that <i>after </i>we're safe.

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:34.290
Yeah. Let's survive first.

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:36.040
We found some!

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.660
They belong to the Military Police!

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.450
Damn things are all covered in dust...

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:46.040
Are you sure buckshot
is what we want to use?!

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.750
I mean, seriously...

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:52.830
Will guns even work against Titans?

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.410
They're far better than nothing, I feel.

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:01.540
If there are still seven Titans in the supply
room that are three or four meters tall,

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:06.790
this much firepower should be capable
of blinding them all simultaneously.

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:11.410
First, we'll use the lift to lower a
group of people from the center ceiling.

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:15.950
They'll then simultaneously fire
at the faces of each of the seven Titans,

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:17.750
thereby blinding them.

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:22.750
Then comes the moment of truth...

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:24.700
Seven people hiding up top

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:29.040
will strike the Titans'
vitals just after the guns fire.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:34.120
In other words, this plan
will put everything on the line--

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.250
everyone's lives on the line--

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:37.870
for a single attack.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.330
Seven people will have to slay seven
Titans at the same time in a single blow.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:51.040
It'll be up to the seven most physically
fit and adept soldiers we have here.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:56.830
So, umm, I'm sorry for placing
everyone's lives on your shoulders...

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:58.290
It's no problem.

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:02.620
If we fail, we die. The risk's
the same regardless of who goes.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:09.540
Still, is this shabby idea of
mine really our best strategy?

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:15.290
We got no other choice.
We're out of time and options.

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:17.450
All we can do now is give it our all!

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:21.200
It'll be fine. Be confident.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.750
You have a knack for
figuring out correct solutions.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:24.790
Huh?

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:28.790
You even used it to save
my life and Eren's life before.

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:32.410
It did...? When?

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.540
The lift's ready!

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.370
The guns too! They're all loaded!

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:40.290
You just don't realize it.

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:42.450
--We can talk about it later.
--Yeah.

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:50.330
Still, can we really take out all
the Titans without our ODM gear?

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:51.660
Of course we can!

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.910
These Titans are only three or four meters tall.

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:56.160
Targeting their vitals will be a cinch.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.250
Yeah.

00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:01.290
Regardless of size, their vitals go
from the head to the nape of the neck...

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:04.290
...one meter high and ten centimeters across!

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.410
You can also shove
one of these up their asses!

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.500
Those are their only two weak spots!

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.290
I never knew about that one!

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:15.080
This is the first I've heard of it, too.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.580
Reiner.

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:20.290
Those <i>could </i>end up
being your last words, you know.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.500
Good. Their numbers haven't increased.

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:44.500
Proceeding with operation!

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:57.040
Stay clam! We need
to lure them all the way in!

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:02.790
Steady...

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:08.120
Avoid a disadvantageous fight...

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.830
If you don't want <i>anyone </i>to die...

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:13.750
...then make this attack count!

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:16.500
Steady...

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.450
Ready...

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.620
Fire!

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:42.790
I got mine!

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:44.910
How about you guys?!

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.200
U-Umm...

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.250
--I'm sorry for suddenly sneaking up and...
--C-Crap...

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:00.950
I'm very sorry...!

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:02.330
Sasha and Conny!

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.450
Hurry! Lend them backup!

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:10.080
I'm... umm...

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.080
I'm very sorry!

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:26.200
Mikasa!

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.540
You saved me!

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:29.660
Are you all right?

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:30.790
Thanks to you!

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:32.370
Then get up.

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:33.950
I owe you one...

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:35.000
No problem.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Oh, man.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.120
That was a close call, Annie.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.870
I'm really glad you didn't end up hurt.

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:44.000
They've all been slain!

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.580
Switch to resupply work!

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.410
We did it!

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:56.580
--All right! We're gonna survive!
--And no more Titans are coming inside!

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:59.700
All thanks to that
berserk Titan out there!

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.000
I caved in to that Titan...

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.120
I'm too ashamed to face the others...!

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.120
There'll be plenty of
time to sneer at you later!

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:09.700
For now, we gotta escape!

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:14.330
I can't see myself as much of a leader.

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:16.620
Don't talk like that anymore.

00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:23.580
I don't mean any offense by this,

00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:26.580
but I think the fact you <i>aren't </i>strong

00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:29.410
really lets you understand
how the weak feel.

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:33.910
And your skill at recognizing
a situation as it unfolds

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:37.870
gives you a clear grasp of what
needs to be done <i>now</i>, you know?

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:41.370
You made the right call.

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:45.200
It's what got me moving.
It's why I'm alive now.

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:53.580
Everyone ready?! It's time to scram!

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.620
--Let's move!
--Scale the wall!

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:58.620
Rendezvous with the main forces!

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:01.950
Mikasa?!

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.370
Mikasa!

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:09.330
We have to get out of here!

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:11.040
That Titan...

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:16.870
They're cannibalizing it?!

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:22.080
I guess it can't regenerate its body?

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.000
I thought that if we could somehow
figure out what's up with that Titan,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.410
it could've helped us break
free from this hopeless situation...

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:34.330
I agree.

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:38.200
We'll learn nothing at all
if it ends up getting eaten!

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:42.370
For now, we have to get
rid of the ones clinging to it

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:43.950
and help keep it alive!

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:45.370
Are you insane, Reiner?!

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:48.200
We can finally get our asses out of here!

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:53.540
And what if there's a chance
that Titan could become our ally?

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:56.410
It'd be a more powerful weapon
than any cannon, wouldn't you agree?

00:18:57.540 --> 00:18:59.200
Ally...?

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.040
Are you actually serious?!

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.950
That one...!

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:08.040
That's the Abnormal that ate Thomas!

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:43.040
Oh, man...

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.870
What was it you wanted to save again?

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:01.540
Looks like it's finished for good.

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.080
All right, that's enough! Let's get going!

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.950
As if that monster would ever be our ally...

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:09.000
A Titan's a Titan.

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.580
What's with you guys?

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:40.870
Mikasa!

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.040
It's Eren...

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:59.200
His severed arm and leg are back...

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:04.410
He'd been swallowed by a Titan back then...

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:05.830
Back then...

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:18.450
How is this possible?

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:33.250
Does this mean <i>Eren </i>did all this...?

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:58.040
<i>Your dreams are where your heart is</i>

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:04.290
<i>They're more fragile than life itself</i>

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:08.950
<i>Over and over you cast them aside,</i>
<i>only to find more</i>

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:15.620
<i>Now, rest in peace</i>

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:26.950
<i>Pounding impulses defile the things we wish for</i>

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:37.250
<i>and the more we forget</i>
<i>the more we remember again</i>

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:43.200
<i>In this beautiful, cruel world</i>

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:48.370
<i>all I can do is ask why we're still alive</i>

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:54.080
<i>Oh, with our strength--and our weakness--</i>

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:59.750
<i>what are we going to protect if there's no sense</i>

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:03.160
<i>to anything anymore?</i>

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.910
"I'm going to drive out the Titans."

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:16.540
That strong emotion
transformed Eren into a Titan.

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:19.500
However, the Garrison Regiment
deems him a threat to humanity

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.410
and turns its swords at him.

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:23.370
"Whereabouts of His Left Arm"
"The Struggle for Trost, Part 5"
