WEBVTT

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.290
The year 850. Trost District.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.910
The sight of Eren Jaeger triggering
his mysterious Titan ability

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.870
was more than enough to strike terror
into the hearts of his fellow soldiers.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.620
I-I'm...

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.040
...human!

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.870
He is <i>not </i>an enemy of humanity!

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.080
For humanity's glory,

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.950
in what little time I have left to live,

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.000
I will continue to advocate
his strategic value!

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.830
As Eren and friends desperately pleaded,
only one man spoke up for them:

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:04.750
Dot Pyxis, the top officer in charge
of the entire southern territory.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.870
Something tells me we ought
to hear these people out, you see...

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.790
<i>Unknown are the names</i>
<i>of the flowers that have been trampled</i>

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.250
<i>Birds have fallen to the earth</i>
<i>and long for the wind</i>

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.330
<i>Prayers won't solve anything</i>

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.660
<i>Only the will to fight</i>
<i>can change the here and now!</i>

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.950
<i>O pigs who laugh at the resolve</i>
<i>to walk over corpses to move forward</i>

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.500
<i>Livestock complacency? False prosperity?</i>

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.370
<i>Give us the freedom of dying,</i>
<i>starving wolves!</i>

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.790
<i>The humiliation of being caged</i>
<i>is what triggers us to fight back</i>

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.080
<i>We hunters slaughter prey</i>
<i>beyond the castle walls,</i>

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.290
<i>consumed with surging bloodlust,</i>

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:22.200
<i>as our crimson bows and arrows</i>
<i>pierce scarlet holes into the twilight</i>

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.330
"Idol"
"The Struggle for Trost, Part 7"

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.250
I'll do it!

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.040
I don't know if
I can plug the hole or not!

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.700
But...

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.540
I'll do it!

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.580
Well said! You're a real man!

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.290
Calling all staff officers!
We have a plan to put together!

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.200
Huh?! You can't be serious!

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.410
It was just some half-baked
plan I came up with on the spot!

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.660
We're actually going through with it?!

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.660
That's what I thought too,

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.450
but there's no point
in doubting his decision.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.950
Commander Pyxis must be envisioning
something that we can't yet see.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.540
Something we can't see?

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.540
Plus, I think there's a bigger
issue that needs to be addressed

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.540
before we can carry out the plan.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.950
And the commander is
keenly aware of it.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.870
Which would be...?

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.540
That the Titans aren't the only enemy.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.870
Time is of the essence.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.370
We're counting on you, young soldiers.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.290
An operation to retake Trost?!

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.950
They can't be serious! We have
no way to plug that hole in the gate!

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.910
What is the top brass thinking?!

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.750
Setting foot in Trost
means a pointless death!

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.500
Since we can't block the hole,

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.950
defending Wall Rose's gate is
our only real option now!

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.040
Damn it! They want glory <i>that </i>badly?!

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.040
Back into that hell again...?

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.080
No! I don't wanna die!

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.910
Let me see my family!

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.620
Hey, Daz! Not so loud!

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.330
You, there! I heard that!

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.500
Do you intend to abandon your duty?!

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.830
Yes, I do!

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.410
There's nothing to be had or gained
by this pointless act of mass suicide!

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.750
What do you take humanity for?! Rules for?!

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.830
It's within my authority to execute
you on the spot, you know!

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.410
That's fine by me!

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.700
It's a hundred times better
than getting eaten by Titans!

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.080
Stop, Daz!

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.370
Stop! Let go!

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.910
I refuse to go back to that hellhole!

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.540
Whoa, did you hear that?

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.370
Can't say I blame him...

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.750
Hey, do you think any
of us will be traitors too?

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.540
I wish I could choose how I die...

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.080
You two!

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.120
I-I was only joking!

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.910
--Do it!
--Huh?

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.330
Make all sorts of noise!
With as many of you as possible!

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.830
Lots of us in the Garrison Regiment
are unhappy about this too!

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.830
I'll use the commotion
to get out of here!

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.950
To get out of here and go where?

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.450
To see my daughter!

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.580
They're gonna break
through this wall anyway!

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
It's said that before
the Titans ruled the land,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.950
humankind consisted of people of
different races and creeds,

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.830
and that they perpetually
fought with and killed each other.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.790
Supposedly someone back then said

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.580
that if a powerful enemy
that wasn't human ever appeared,

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.700
humanity would likely cease its
fighting and come together as one.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.830
What is your opinion?

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.750
I'd never heard that story before.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.750
I'd say... it's a pretty laid-back attitude.
It's enough to make me yawn.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.040
You have a twisted mind, just like me.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.160
Even now, when a powerful
enemy <i>has </i>driven us into a corner,

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.080
I would hardly say that we've "come together."

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.080
Indeed.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:38.950
If we don't get our act together soon,
even fighting will be tough.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.120
Eren?!

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.040
He's all right...

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.660
Focus on my work?

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.160
Who does that punk think he is,
bossing a superior officer around?

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.750
Judging from his attitude,
Mikasa and Armin must be okay, too.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.410
Still...

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.290
Why is he at the commander's side?

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.330
Would you like some?

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.200
Thank you, Sir!

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.120
Kill me! If you're gonna
execute me, just do it already!

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.500
All right! Let's do it!

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.000
Attention!

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:52.830
I will now explain to you the details
of the Trost Recovery Operation!

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:55.120
The objective of this operation

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.660
is to seal the hole
in the demolished gate!

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.540
Huh?

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:08.540
Seal it? How?

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.700
As for how we'll accomplish this,

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.500
let me start by introducing this fellow!

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.450
This is Eren Jaeger,
a member of the Cadets!

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:21.580
E-Eren?!

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.580
He is the successful result

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:27.750
of our top-secret Titan
transformation experiments!

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:34.500
He is able to fabricate a
Titan's body and control it at will!

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.500
Uhh, the commander
isn't making much sense.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.790
It's not just 'cause I'm stupid, right?!

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:44.540
Just be quiet. You idiot.

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:50.370
In Titan form, he will lift that
giant rock near the front gate,

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:54.200
carry it to the wrecked gate,
and seal the hole!

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.790
As for <i>you</i>,

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:03.870
you're to defend him from the other
Titans while he carries the rock!

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:06.250
There's no need to <i>fight </i>the Titans?!

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:09.120
I-I'm sorry!
I didn't mean to interrupt!

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.910
I know I'm just a Cadet...

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:13.540
That's okay. Continue.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:14.790
Right.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:19.450
Normally, Titans respond to large
groups of people by pursuing them.

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:24.200
So if we were to use a large group
to lure them to the edge of the wall,

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:29.620
I believe we could draw the Titans away
from Eren without having to fight.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.290
Additionally, once these
Titans have been lured away,

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:36.040
we could take them out with
cannons without incurring any casualties.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:40.080
However, we can't afford
to leave Eren defenseless,

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.660
so a small squad of elite soldiers
would need to go and protect him.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:48.120
Plus, there's no avoiding any
Titans that come through the hole.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.120
The elite squad will need to
be able to handle them.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.830
All right, then.
We'll rethink the plan around that.

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:57.830
However, this is all
based on the assumption

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:01.450
that Eren <i>can </i>pick up
the rock and seal the hole.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:05.450
I must admit I have my
doubts about carrying out this plan

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:08.040
with so little assurance to go on...

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:13.330
Indeed, I have misgivings about
sending so many people to their deaths

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.910
based entirely on one big "if,"

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:18.910
but I understand
Commander Pyxis' assessment too.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:22.290
Yes. One of the issues is time.

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:26.200
As we speak,
Titans continue to pour into the town.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.450
The more filled the town gets,

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:31.620
the worse our chances of
successfully retaking it become.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:37.120
<i>And </i>the chances of them breaking
through Wall Rose go up, too.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.950
And there's one other issue...

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:45.660
People can only be
driven by fear for so long.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.120
He's going to pick up
that humongous rock?!

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.200
Is that really possible...?

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.000
Has humankind finally
surmounted the Titans?!

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.290
You're lying!

00:10:56.290 --> 00:11:00.160
I refuse to give my life
for this ridiculous nonsense!

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.620
What do you take us for?!

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:06.580
We're <i>not </i>disposable blades, you know!

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:09.660
--He says he's a human weapon!
--He's obviously just lying!

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:10.660
Treatin' us like fools...!

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:14.330
I ain't gonna die here today!
I'm outta here!

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:18.910
M-Me too!

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:20.120
Me too!

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.500
Count me out, too!

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:25.250
Wait! Don't make me execute you!

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:29.120
I'm going to spend humanity's
final moments with my family!

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.580
This isn't good.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:34.620
Indeed. We'll lose all order if
we don't do something.

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:37.540
Prepare yourselves, lousy traitors!

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.910
I'll cut you down where you stand!

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.660
By my order...

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:47.040
...all who leave now
are absolved of their crime!

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:51.540
Those who've succumbed
to the Titans' terror once before

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.450
can never face them again!

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:59.040
Anyone who has already
experienced their horror may leave!

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:04.450
And, those who want
their family and loved ones

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:07.580
to experience that same horror

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.410
may leave as well!

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.790
Daddy!

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:23.500
Anything but that...

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.620
My daughter is...

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.870
...all the hope I have left!

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:35.660
Let's discuss four years ago!

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:38.870
Namely, the operation to
retake Wall Maria!

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:42.200
I'm sure none of this needs saying!

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.200
Calling it a "recovery operation"
gave it a nice ring,

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.200
but it was essentially a way to
dispose of the unemployed masses

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.330
that the government couldn't support!

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:56.870
The reason no one has spoken out about it

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:59.580
is because sending them outside

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:04.660
is what has allowed <i>us </i>to survive
inside these cramped walls!

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:12.290
All of humanity--myself included--is guilty!

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.290
Conflict never arose

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:18.250
simply because Wall Maria's
citizens were in the minority!

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:20.870
But what about now?!

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:23.160
If Wall Rose falls,

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:27.080
humanity will lose much
more than 20% of its population!

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:33.750
Wall Sina wouldn't be able to support
even half of the people still alive!

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:40.040
If we humans go extinct, it won't be
because we were eaten by Titans!

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:44.450
It'll be because we killed ourselves off!

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:48.410
We cannot afford to
die any further inside.

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:51.370
I kindly ask of you!

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:53.370
Please die here!

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:06.830
I don't know if I can lift that rock
with my Titan ability or not.

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:10.950
But I understand what my role is.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:17.200
Even if it's false, I <i>have </i>to succeed.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.080
I have to serve...

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:26.160
...as everyone's hope!

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:42.330
Looks like you're all here.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.870
You have but one mission:

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:47.370
to protect Eren Jaeger

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:51.450
and eliminate any risks
that arise during the operation.

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:54.120
It will probably be the most
dangerous and difficult mission

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.370
of the entire operation.

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:59.950
It's no exaggeration to
say that how you fare out there

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:02.790
will decide the fate of all humankind.

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:05.500
Sir. May I ask a question?

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:06.950
What is it?

00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:10.750
Are you really sure about
this "human weapon" of yours?

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:12.120
Quit it, Rico.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.910
You have your doubts too, don't you?

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:15.910
Sir.

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:21.250
This plan is based entirely on the
incredible uncertainty that is Eren Jaeger.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:26.080
If he doesn't do as planned,
many soldiers will die for nothing!

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.700
Troubling, indeed.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.450
Are you <i>that </i>fond of losing to the Titans?

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.450
Personally, I hate it.

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:39.200
I hate losing more than anything else.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:44.250
But, astonishingly enough, I've been
on the losing side for all my life.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:49.410
I want to win against the Titans.

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:54.000
I want to prevail over those oafs,
no matter what it takes.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.910
N-No, we feel the same way, Sir!

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:00.790
Then the only option is
to take a gamble on him.

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:05.080
Because what you call
"an incredible uncertainty"

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:09.000
is our one and only chance of
achieving victory over the Titans.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:13.410
Sir. It's time for the
decoy operation to begin.

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:14.830
Mm.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Ian Dietrich.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.580
Rico Brzenska.

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.330
Mitabi Jarnach.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:25.620
You are the very best of the
best of the Garrison Regiment.

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:29.450
The fate of humanity is in your hands.

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:30.830
Sir!

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:34.080
Ian. You'll lead the squad.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.660
I leave all on-site
decision-making to you.

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:40.000
Huh? Me, Sir?

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.620
--I have no objections.
--Neither do I.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.000
But, Sir, I don't feel competent enough--!

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.410
Never fear.

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:49.290
You have an understanding of alcohol.

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:50.830
Sir...?

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:54.330
You can discern when
a drink is good, bad, or both.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.040
So I leave it to you.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.500
Yes, Sir!

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:02.750
Eren. I'm sorry.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:07.750
I didn't mean to force all the responsibility
onto your shoulders like this.

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:09.580
I told you before, remember?

00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:12.910
You have the ability to make the right call.

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:14.700
I have faith in that.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.790
--Eren. I really think I should--
--Don't even think of coming with me.

00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:21.660
They assigned you to the decoy squad.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.370
But I can't leave you all alone!

00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:25.450
It'll happen again if--

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:27.410
Enough, already!

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:31.870
I told you before! I'm not your
little brother or your kid!

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:35.790
Ackermann.

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:39.580
Join the elite squad that'll protect Jaeger.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.750
We'll need your skills.

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:45.660
Let's go. It's time to begin!

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.200
See you, Armin. Don't die, you hear?

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.200
Mm. You too, Eren.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.540
He called you a top-secret human weapon,

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:10.660
but as long as you can
seal that hole, I don't care!

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:12.660
We'll protect you at all costs!

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:13.870
We're counting on you!

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:15.290
Right!

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.000
Eren. Are you all right?

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.410
Yeah!

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.410
--Eren.
--Seriously, I'm fine!

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:26.000
I'm much better than
when we were surrounded!

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.500
Quit playing house, Jaeger!

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.450
It isn't like that!

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:32.750
I can't believe the fate of mankind

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:35.790
rests in the hands of
a coddled brat like you...

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:38.540
That's enough, all of you!

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:40.790
We're almost to the
shortest route to the rock.

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:44.620
I don't see any Titans in the area.

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:46.910
Their decoy tactic must be working.

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:54.200
Listen! All we have to do is
lure them into a corner of town!

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.200
Avoid any unnecessary fighting!

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:00.870
Just so you're aware, Jaeger...

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.200
More than just a few soldiers
will likely die during this operation.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.830
All for you.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:15.830
Our colleagues,
our seniors, and our juniors.

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:19.750
They're prepared to die,
of course. They're soldiers.

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:23.620
But, they aren't faceless pawns.

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:28.330
Steady!

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:33.200
Not yet!

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:35.830
Almost...!

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.620
Break away!

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:47.250
They have names, families,
and hopes and dreams of their own.

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:50.250
Alyosha. Dominic. Fine.

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:53.410
Isabel. Ludwig. Martina.

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:55.250
Guido. Hans.

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:59.250
They're all real people,
flesh and blood.

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:03.540
Some have been living under
the same roof since their cadet days.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:09.830
And many of these people
could end up dying for you today.

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:15.660
It's your duty to make
sure their deaths aren't in vain.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:17.580
Regardless of what happens.

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:21.290
Keep that in your pampered mind

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:24.830
and fulfill your duty
with dead seriousness.

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:26.250
I will!

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.870
I'm gonna do this!
I absolutely <i>will </i>succeed!

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:37.750
Not once has humanity ever
achieved victory over the Titans

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:39.950
since they first appeared!

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.200
For every step the
Titans have taken forward,

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:48.540
humanity has continually been forced
to draw back and give up its territory!

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:52.790
However, should this operation succeed,

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:57.950
humanity will have taken back land
from the Titans for the very first time!

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.000
This is the spot! Let's go!

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:08.660
It will be the first time humankind
has achieved victory over the Titans!

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.290
Green smoke shell sighted!

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:24.120
Elite Squad has commenced operation!

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.910
Indeed, it may seem extraordinarily small

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:34.370
when compared to what
humanity has given up this far!

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:35.950
However!

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:39.660
For humankind, that single, small step...

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.200
...will be a great leap forward!

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:15.700
In terms of body proportion,

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.910
it's hard to believe he'll
be able to pick up that rock.

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:23.910
But I'm sure Eren has the
great strength to lead us forward.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:32.750
Eren?

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:58.000
<i>Your dreams are where your heart is</i>

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:04.250
<i>They're more fragile than life itself</i>

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:08.910
<i>Over and over you cast them aside,</i>
<i>only to find more</i>

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:15.580
<i>Now, rest in peace</i>

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:26.910
<i>Pounding impulses defile the things we wish for</i>

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:37.200
<i>and the more we forget</i>
<i>the more we remember again</i>

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:43.160
<i>In this beautiful, cruel world</i>

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:48.330
<i>all I can do is ask why we're still alive</i>

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:54.040
<i>Oh, with our strength--and our weakness--</i>

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:59.700
<i>what are we going to protect if there's no sense</i>

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:03.120
<i>to anything anymore?</i>

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:13.080
The Trost Recovery Operation has begun.

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.450
As countless soldiers meet their deaths,

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:17.700
Eren goes on a rampage in Titan form

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:19.830
and destroys his own head.

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:22.410
But, just when it seems the
operation has ended in failure...

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:23.370
"Wound"
"The Struggle for Trost, Part 8"
