00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:25.540
In the year 845, the Colossal Titan
and the Armored Titan suddenly appeared

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.000
and destroyed one of humanity's
walls-- and everyday life with it.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.200
Humanity abandoned Wall Maria,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.870
lost 20% of its population
and one-third of its territory,

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.200
and was forced to
retreat behind Wall Rose.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.200
And then, in the year 850...

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.660
Humanity's fight back...

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.250
...is just beginning!

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.750
The target is the
Colossal Titan dead ahead!

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.370
This is our chance!
<i>Don't </i>let it get away!

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.500
Hey, there.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.500
It's been five years since we met.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.830
<i>Unknown are the names</i>
<i>of the flowers that have been trampled</i>

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.290
<i>Birds have fallen to the earth</i>
<i>and long for the wind</i>

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.370
<i>Prayers won't solve anything</i>

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.700
<i>Only the will to fight</i>
<i>can change the here and now!</i>

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.000
<i>O pigs who laugh at the resolve</i>
<i>to walk over corpses to move forward</i>

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.540
<i>Livestock complacency? False prosperity?</i>

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.410
<i>Give us the freedom of dying,</i>
<i>starving wolves!</i>

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.830
<i>The humiliation of being caged</i>
<i>is what triggers us to fight back</i>

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:06.120
<i>We hunters slaughter prey</i>
<i>beyond the castle walls,</i>

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.330
<i>consumed with surging bloodlust,</i>

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:18.250
<i>as our crimson bows and arrows</i>
<i>pierce scarlet holes into the twilight</i>

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.330
"First Battle"
"The Struggle for Trost, Part 1"

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.080
He went for the cannons!

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.790
And he didn't take out
the gate by accident, either!

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.540
He <i>does </i>have intelligence...!

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.250
Still, this is the perfect chance!

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.870
He's the only one
who can destroy the wall!

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.790
If I can just take him out...!

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.580
Too slow!

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.500
Got you!

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.000
Wha...?!

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.450
Hot!

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.040
Go!

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.910
I missed?!

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.160
No...

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.750
The Colossal Titan disappeared!

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.580
Eren! Did you beat it?!

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.700
No!

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.700
It's just like five years ago!

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.330
He suddenly appeared,
then suddenly disappeared!

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.080
I'm sorry. I let him get away.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.040
What are you apologizing for?
<i>We </i>were scared stiff--

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.700
Hey! This is no time for that!

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.580
The wall's been broken!

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.040
We have to hurry and seal
it before the Titans get in again!

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.750
What are you doing?!

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.580
The Colossal Titan Response
Operation is already underway!

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.250
Return to HQ at once!

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.040
Anyone who's come into contact
with it, remember to give a report!

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.750
Yes, Sir!

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.330
We pray for the
advance team's success!

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.790
Take only the
absolute bare necessities!

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.790
Please evacuate
in a calm manner!

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.500
If they break through here,

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.660
we'll have another tragedy just
like five years ago on our hands!

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.040
We <i>must </i>hold the Titans off here!

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.120
Prepare to intercept!

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.370
Fire!

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.620
Charge!

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.700
You cadets have successfully graduated!
You are now proper soldiers!

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.450
I have high hopes
for you in this operation!

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.580
Don't worry, Hanna.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.580
I promise I'll keep you safe.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.000
Franz...

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.950
Are you okay, Armin?!

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.160
I-I'm fine!

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.790
I'll calm down soon enough!

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.620
Still, this is bad!

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.700
We don't have the technology to
quickly seal an 8-meter-high hole!

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:29.330
And we never did manage to unearth
that big rock near the front gate!

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.500
Unless we seal the hole,
this city's as good as lost!

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.620
It's only a matter of time
until Wall Rose is breached!

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.870
In fact, if they ever feel like it,

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.540
they can pretty much wipe
out humanity anytime they want!

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:49.950
Armin!

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.580
Calm down! This isn't like last time!

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.910
Humanity <i>won't </i>give in
to the Titans anymore!

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.580
I'm sorry...

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.040
I'm all right...

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:24.790
Come, now.
Are you playing seriously?

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:29.410
There. I win again.

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:37.040
We square off once a month, yet you
never seem to improve at all, Pyxis.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:42.120
Oh, no, I am just no
match for you, Lord Wald.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:50.830
You're the top officer in charge
of the entire southern territory.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:56.200
How do you hope
to triumph over the Titans

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.330
with such paltry skill and intellect?

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.080
Commander Pyxis!

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.620
I bring a message!

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.620
How uncouth! Who are you--?!

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.620
The Colossal Titan has appeared in Trost!

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.660
The gate has been destroyed!

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:25.160
Mm. This is a fine drink, indeed.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:30.370
As a fellow warrior on the field
of battle, I will humbly accept it.

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:33.660
H-Hey! Wait, Pyxis!

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:38.040
Pyxis! Hey! Wait just a minute!

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:41.250
I forbid you to leave!

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:46.250
Assemble your troops
immediately and defend my domain!

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.290
That <i>is </i>your duty!

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:53.200
Lord Wald.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.200
As we speak, soldiers in Trost
are literally risking their lives in battle.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.500
Commander.
I will ready the horses.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:05.660
I presume many lives are
being lost as well.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.750
Right now, at this very moment.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:11.410
Hmph. Insignificant lives, I'm sure.

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:13.290
Forget about them.

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:16.290
Your presence there
won't change anything anyway;

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:20.540
you <i>continually </i>lose
to me in our tabletop skirmishes!

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:23.250
Fear not, Your Lordship.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.790
Should he face the
Titans on a real battlefield,

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:29.700
the commander will not
need to be as lenient with them.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.910
Enough.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.750
Lord Wald.

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:41.160
Please have another pleasant and
peaceful day as always.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.580
H-Hey!

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:46.870
Pyxis!

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:49.750
Come back! Pyxis!

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:52.040
Pyxis!

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:07.410
As practiced,
you will now split into your squads

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:11.580
and perform resupply, message
relay, and Titan-clearing duties

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:14.580
under the command
of the Garrison Regiment!

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.160
The Garrison Regiment's
intercept squad will take the vanguard!

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.200
"Vanguard"
The Cadets, led by

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.580
"Middle Guard"
the support squad, will take the middle guard!

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.580
"Rearguard"
And the Garrison Regiment's elite squads

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.540
"Rearguard"
will take the rearguard!

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.410
Additionally, I've received word

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:29.870
that the advance team
has been wiped out!

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:33.950
The outer gate has been breached,
and the Titans have been allowed inside!

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:38.500
In other words, the Armored Titan
<i>could </i>very well appear again

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.500
and demolish the inner gate at any time!

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:45.700
--You can't be serious...
--You gotta be kidding me...

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.200
If they end up breaching Rose too...!

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.250
Quiet!

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:53.200
The vanguard is currently
engaged with the enemy!

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.540
This defense operation
has but one objective:

00:10:55.540 --> 00:11:00.790
to defend Wall Rose until the
citizens have finished evacuating!

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:06.000
Also, as I'm sure you're well aware,
desertion is punishable by death!

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.410
Be prepared to lay down your lives!

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:09.750
Dismissed!

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:11.160
Sir!

00:11:16.410 --> 00:11:18.700
Why today?

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.660
I would've been on my
way to the interior tomorrow...

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:25.160
Are you okay?!

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:34.410
No, no, no, no...

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:42.540
Move!

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.540
Hey, Jean! What's wrong?!

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.330
"What's wrong?!"

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.700
That's easy for you to say,
you suicidal maniac!

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.410
You <i>want </i>to join the Scouts!

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:56.200
You're ready to
be Titan chow anytime!

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.200
--But I was headed for the interior tomorrow!
--Calm down!

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.200
You expect me to calm
down and accept death?!

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.450
No!

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:03.870
Think back!

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:07.250
Think back to the three years
of sweat and blood we endured!

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:12.080
So many times we came close
to dying during those three years!

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.250
Some people <i>did </i>die.

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:17.580
Some ran off. Others were kicked out.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.700
But <i>we </i>survived!

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:21.120
Right?!

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.370
I'm sure we can survive today, too!

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:30.500
You can just survive today
and leave for the interior tomorrow!

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:36.370
Damn!

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.250
Let's go, Daz! Quit your damn cryin'!

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:43.620
R-Right...

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.040
Eren.

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:48.620
If the battle gets chaotic,
come find me.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:52.120
Huh? We're in different squads!

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.620
If the situation falls apart,
things won't go according to plan.

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:57.160
I'll protect you!

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.330
What the hell are you--

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.750
Cadet Ackermann.

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:02.700
You're in the rearguard. Special orders.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:03.700
Come with me.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.580
I-I'm not skilled enough!
I'll only be a burden!

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:10.580
I am not asking for your opinion.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:12.500
The citizens' evacuation
is behind schedule.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.620
We need as many elite
soldiers near them as possible.

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.330
--B-But...!
--Hey!

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.620
Cut the crap, Mikasa!

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.160
Quit freaking out like everyone else!

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.370
Humanity's on the
verge of extinction here!

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:28.700
This is no time to go and
impose your own selfish rules!

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:37.040
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking clearly.

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:41.040
I do have one thing to ask.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.540
Please don't die.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:57.040
I ain't gonna die.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.330
I <i>can't </i>die yet!

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.620
Because I still don't know
what this world is <i>really </i>like!

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:15.200
Surviving historical documents
say nothing about the origin of the Titans.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.080
Most everything remains unknown.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.290
The things we <i>do </i>know about now,
including Titan ecology,

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:25.290
are based entirely on the latest
reports from the Scout Regiment.

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:29.450
We've been unable to determine if
the Titans possess human-like intelligence.

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:35.040
As such, there've been <i>no </i>cases
to date of mutual communication.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:40.120
Titan physiology is fundamentally
different from that of other living beings.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:44.580
They lack reproductive organs,
and it is unclear how they reproduce,

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:48.080
but they primarily possess male-like physiques.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.950
They have extremely
high body temperatures,

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:56.040
and, perplexingly enough, they show
no interest in anything but humans.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:01.290
Consuming people is the
Titans' sole principle of behavior,

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:07.830
but given that they've existed for over
a century in a human-less environment,

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:12.790
we can surmise that the very act
of feeding is unnecessary for them.

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:17.040
In other words, it's believed that
they are not motivated by predation,

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.700
but by bloodlust.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.870
And, most of all, the Titans'
tremendous vitality is the primary reason

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:28.700
that humankind has been
so greatly overwhelmed.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.080
Humanity has long
possessed cannon technology,

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.120
but that alone wasn't
enough to combat them.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.500
Even when their heads are
blown off, the Titans don't die.

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.500
Additionally, although
there is some variability,

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:44.120
their heads will fully regenerate
in only a minute or two.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.660
You can't be serious...

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:47.700
Their size is bad enough as it is...

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.790
Sir! Does that mean
the Titans are immortal?!

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.120
They are not immortal.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.500
There is <i>one </i>way to defeat a Titan.

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.620
You target here.

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:05.790
When severely damaged here,
a Titan will die without regenerating.

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:10.540
That's where these two
flesh-paring blades come in.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:13.580
A successful strike to a
Titan's weak spot with these

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:18.910
will cause its immediate death,
with no time to regenerate whatsoever.

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:27.750
Hey, Armin.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:30.330
This is the perfect chance, don't you think?

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:36.290
If we take care of business in this first
battle before we've even joined the Scouts,

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:40.700
we rookies will shoot up
the ranks for sure!

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:50.040
Yeah. No question about it.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:53.290
Just so you know,
you aren't the only ones in our class

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:55.290
who wanna join the Scouts.

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:59.370
You beat us to the punch earlier,
but you won't outdo us <i>this </i>time!

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:01.330
Sounds like a challenge, Thomas!

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.580
Whoever takes out the most Titans wins!

00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:07.700
--Don't go messin' with the scores!
--Squad 34, move out!

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.660
Bolster the vanguard!

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.910
All right! Let's go!

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:38.500
<i>That </i>many Titans?!

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.000
The vanguard's been totally routed!

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.160
What are they doing?!
Those hot shots usually act all tough!

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:49.540
I figured things would
be bad, but not like <i>this</i>!

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:52.620
An Abnormal!

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.040
Stop!

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:12.160
Huh...?

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:39.330
What the hell are you doing?!

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:42.080
--Eren!
--Don't go off on your own!

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:48.290
Get back here, damn it!

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:50.500
You're gonna pay for killing Thomas!

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:54.540
I won't let you get away! I <i>won't</i>!

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:06.040
Eren!

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:07.790
Eren!

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:27.500
Stop! Please don't!

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:36.950
Why...?

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:41.200
Why am I watching
as my friends get eaten?

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:52.620
Why... can't I move...?

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:05.620
A-Armin...

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:10.500
Eren! Eren!

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:11.910
Eren!

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:14.910
What is it, Armin?

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:18.370
My grandpa secretly had this!

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:21.790
It's a book about the outside world!

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:24.330
A book about the outside world?!

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:28.370
Isn't it illegal to have those?
You're gonna get arrested!

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:31.370
This is no time to be saying that!

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:32.540
According to this book,

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:36.700
most of the world is covered
in water called a "sea"!

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:39.540
And this "sea" is entirely saltwater!

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:40.830
Salt?!

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:44.410
Y-You're lying!
Salt is a treasure trove!

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:47.000
I'm sure merchants
would've snatched it all up!

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.870
You <i>can't</i>, though! The sea is that big!

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:52.080
Yeah, right--

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.830
There's a lot more than loads of salt, too!

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:59.330
Fiery water! Lands of ice!
Sandy snowfields!

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:01.620
The outside world
must be <i>many </i>times larger

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:04.410
than the inside of these walls!

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:06.950
The outside world...

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:10.330
And, this is still a secret,

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:15.330
but my mom and dad are planning
to venture into the outside world!

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:17.700
The outside world, huh...

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:19.660
Hey, Eren.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:24.750
I hope we can explore
the outside world too someday!

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:44.750
Eren!

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:49.790
I <i>refuse </i>to die here...

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.790
Listen, Armin...

00:21:55.790 --> 00:22:00.290
You told me about it...

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:04.080
So I have... to see it...

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.080
The outside world...!

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:09.790
Eren!

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:11.250
Hurry!

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:57.950
<i>Your dreams are where your heart is</i>

00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:04.200
<i>They're more fragile than life itself</i>

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:08.870
<i>Over and over you cast them aside,</i>
<i>only to find more</i>

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:15.540
<i>Now, rest in peace</i>

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:26.870
<i>Pounding impulses defile the things we wish for</i>

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:37.160
<i>and the more we forget</i>
<i>the more we remember again</i>

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:43.120
<i>In this beautiful, cruel world</i>

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:48.290
<i>all I can do is ask why we're still alive</i>

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:54.000
<i>Oh, with our strength--and our weakness--</i>

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.660
<i>what are we going to protect if there's no sense</i>

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:03.080
<i>to anything anymore?</i>

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.330
Suddenly, it begins to rain.

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:14.370
The quiet sound of the rainfall...

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:19.250
The damp air...
The faintly sweet smell of rain...

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:21.370
They remind Mikasa of
a ghastly incident in her past.

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:23.330
"The World the Girl Saw"
"The Struggle for Trost, Part 2"
