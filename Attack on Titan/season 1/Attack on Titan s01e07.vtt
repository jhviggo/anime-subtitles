00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.950
Over a century ago, beings that
prey on humans suddenly appeared.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:36.160
Their absolutely overwhelming strength

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.450
quickly pushed humanity to
the brink of extinction.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:51.080
The surviving humans constructed
three walls: Maria, Rose, and Sina,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.370
which brought them a century of peace.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.790
However...

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:05.120
In the year 845, the Colossal Titan
and the Armored Titan suddenly appeared

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.700
and destroyed one of humanity's
walls-- and everyday life with it.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.750
Humanity abandoned Wall Maria,

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.700
lost twenty percent of its population
and one-third of its territory,

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.450
and was forced to
retreat behind Wall Rose.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:34.160
In the year 850, the Colossal
Titan demolished another wall

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.580
and allowed the Titans inside once again.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.000
Eren!

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.410
Hurry!

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.580
The entire populace was
evacuated two hours later.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.750
Not a single person was eaten by a Titan...

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.750
...except for the soldiers who fended
them off and died in the line of duty.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.120
Eren.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.540
As long as I have you,
I can do anything.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.700
<i>Unknown are the names</i>
<i>of the flowers that have been trampled</i>

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.160
<i>Birds have fallen to the earth</i>
<i>and long for the wind</i>

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.250
<i>Prayers won't solve anything</i>

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.620
<i>Only the will to fight</i>
<i>can change the here and now!</i>

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.910
<i>O pigs who laugh at the resolve</i>
<i>to walk over corpses to move forward</i>

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.450
<i>Livestock complacency? False prosperity?</i>

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.330
<i>Give us the freedom of dying,</i>
<i>starving wolves!</i>

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.700
<i>The humiliation of being caged</i>
<i>is what triggers us to fight back</i>

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.000
<i>We hunters slaughter prey</i>
<i>beyond the castle walls,</i>

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.200
<i>consumed with surging bloodlust,</i>

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:19.120
<i>as our crimson bows and arrows</i>
<i>pierce scarlet holes into the twilight</i>

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.290
"Small Blade"
"The Struggle for Trost, Part 3"

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.540
Please wait, Captain!

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.540
Should the Titans attack,

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.790
we supply soldiers won't be able
to hold this position on our own!

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.500
Please, Sir! You have to stay here!

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.370
Step aside.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.250
I <i>must </i>reorganize the
reinforcements now.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.330
Behind the safety of
the inner gate, you mean?

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.870
What the hell are you trying to say?

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.910
I'll have you know I'm following regulations!

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.540
Obeying established
regulations is a soldier's duty!

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.700
B-But, Sir!
If we lose this position...!

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.580
Enough of your talk!

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.500
Open your mouth again

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.620
and I'll be forced to punish
you for treason where you stand!

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.290
Why isn't anyone going over the wall?

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.790
I'm sure they heard the
bell signaling us to withdraw...

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.790
It's all over...

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.410
We're done for...

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:21.790
There!

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.660
What good is <i>that </i>going to do?

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.700
C'mon, Jean! What are we gonna do?!

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.330
Ain't anything we <i>can </i>do...

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.790
They <i>finally </i>gave the order to withdraw,

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.750
but we don't have enough
gas to scale the wall...

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.450
We're all gonna die now...

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.330
All 'cause of those cowards...

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.330
You mean the supply soldiers?!

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.580
What's happened to them?!
Were they wiped out?!

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.410
Apparently they lost the will to fight.

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.790
I can understand the feeling,

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:02.870
but abandoning
their duty to supply us

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.660
so they can barricade
themselves inside Headquarters?

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.120
And sure enough,
Titans have swarmed the place,

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.250
meaning we can't even
get gas for ourselves.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.290
In that case, it's sink or swim!

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.000
We'll just have to
take out the Titans there!

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.120
Hanging around here's no different!
The Titans will just gather here too!

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.290
We'll only use up what little gas we
have left if we keep running aimlessly!

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.290
Once we lose our mobility,
we're <i>really </i>done for!

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.080
You're actually using
your head for once, Conny.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.250
But do you really think we
have the manpower to pull that off?

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.580
Most of the veteran members of
the vanguard have been wiped out.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:40.870
We're just cadets;

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.080
who can possibly take charge of
a suicide mission like that?

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.200
Even if someone could,

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.290
it's not like we'd stand a chance
against the Titans anyway.

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:56.120
And the supply room's probably got
some that are three or four meters high.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.410
There's no way we could
get anything done in there.

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.120
It's hopeless?

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.830
What a dull life this was.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.370
If I'd known this would happen,
I would've said something sooner.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.750
Come on, guys! Let's do it!

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.080
Get up!

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.580
If we all work together,
we're sure to succeed!

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.620
I'll take the lead!

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.620
Armin! Let's go--!

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:40.910
Reiner.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:42.000
What now?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.500
Not yet. We have to let them gather first.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.120
It's no use...

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.830
However you look at it,
we're <i>not </i>getting out of this city.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.330
We're all dead.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.830
I mean, I'm ready
to die and everything...

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:01.200
It's just... what am I dying <i>for</i>?

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.200
Mikasa!

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.370
Weren't you with the rearguard?!

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:05.790
Annie!

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:08.500
I understand the gist of the situation.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.660
So I'm sorry for letting
my personal matters interfere...

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.000
...but have you seen Eren's squad?

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.290
I haven't, but some squads <i>did</i>
make it over the wall...

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:19.950
Actually, we <i>did </i>find Armin over there.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.120
Armin!

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.830
Mikasa...

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:30.160
No! I can't bring myself to face her!

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.290
All I did was survive for
no good reason...

00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:35.700
If I'd known this would happen...

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.700
...I would rather have
died with him then instead!

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:41.410
Armin.

00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:45.040
You're not hurt, are you?
Are you all right?

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:52.540
Where's Eren?

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:56.290
Armin?

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.120
We...

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.000
The cadets of Squad 34...

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.790
Thomas Wagner...

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:17.910
Nack Tierce...

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.450
Milieus Zeremski...

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.620
Mina Carolina...

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.330
Eren Jaeger...

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.120
These five members...

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.000
...fulfilled their duties...

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.620
...and died valiantly
on the field of battle!

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.290
You can't be serious...

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:42.040
So Squad 34 is basically gone...

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.370
The same thing'll happen to
us if we try to take the Titans on...

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:49.000
I'm sorry, Mikasa...

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.620
It should've been me, not Eren...

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.290
I...

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:56.620
...wasn't able to do anything...!

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.620
I'm sorry...

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.080
Armin.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.000
Calm down.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.080
Now isn't the time to be emotional.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.370
Now get up.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:18.120
Marco.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.870
If we eliminate the Titans
swarming around HQ,

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:24.620
we can replenish our gas
supplies and get over the wall.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:25.950
Correct?

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:28.200
Well, yeah...

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.040
But even with your help,
there's just too many...

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.330
I can handle them.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:33.750
Huh?!

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.750
I'm strong.

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.500
Stronger than all of you.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.410
I'm very strong.

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:46.500
As such, I <i>am </i>capable of
annihilating the Titans there!

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.160
Even if I have to go it alone.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.750
As for all of you,
you're not only unskilled,

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:55.500
you're also cowards and wimps.

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:58.290
You're a real disappointment.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:01.040
You can just stay here
and twiddle your thumbs.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.700
Twiddle and watch.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.080
Whoa, Mikasa!
What's gotten into you?!

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.080
You're seriously gonna take
on all those Titans by yourself?!

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.790
There's no way you can beat them!

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:13.580
If I can't, then I'll die.
It's that simple.

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:14.580
But...

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.040
If I win, I'll live.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.000
And the only way to win is to fight!

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.080
Hey!

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:28.790
Your way with words
is the real disappointment.

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:32.040
You actually considered
that motivational...

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.290
I blame you for this, Eren...!

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:39.660
Hey! Since when were we taught
to let our comrades fight alone?!

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.330
Or do you guys <i>want</i>
to end up as actual cowards?!

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.830
Never thought I'd hear him say that.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.700
Come on, you cowards,
weaklings, and morons!

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.040
Those guys...

00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.620
Damn it...

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:02.450
All right, let's do it!

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.410
Hurry!

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:13.250
Follow Mikasa!

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:14.790
Fight as little as possible!

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:17.370
Get to HQ before you run out of gas!

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.080
Man, Mikasa's incredible...

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.700
How can she move so fast?!

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.870
No! She's using up too much gas!

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:29.250
She's going to run out right away!

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.700
Regardless of our skill,

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.580
once we lose our mobility
we're completely helpless!

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:43.700
She's not her usual,
composed self at all!

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.540
She's trying to distract
herself from her anguish!

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:49.120
It's only a matter of time until she...!

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:55.450
Mikasa!

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:56.540
Damn!

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:57.750
Jean!

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.450
You take the lead!

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:01.080
I'll help Armin!

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.790
--No, I will too!
--Don't be stupid!

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:04.540
There are still Titans everywhere!

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.870
Your skills are needed!

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:21.580
Again...

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.120
It's this again...

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:28.160
I've lost my family again...

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:38.580
Do I have to revisit this pain...

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:42.620
...and start all over from here again?

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:07.290
It's no use. We can't
even get <i>near </i>Headquarters.

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:10.290
Unless we're prepared to die...

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:17.870
Crap! He's out of gas!

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.910
Stay back!

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.830
--Tom! I'll save you!
--No!

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:25.250
It's too late!

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:28.330
Stop!

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.830
Why couldn't I stop them...?

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:47.410
Why <i>didn't </i>I stop them?

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:51.080
If I'd made them stop,
this wouldn't have happened...

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.620
Am I really cut out for this?

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:03.000
Am I really fit to have
a position of responsibility?!

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:10.410
No!

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:27.000
This world is cruel.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.290
And...

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.700
...very beautiful.

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:40.160
It's been a nice life.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.500
Huh?

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:11.660
Why?

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.700
I was sure I'd given up...

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:27.160
Why... am I standing up?

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:30.120
Why... am I struggling?

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:40.450
What for?

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.540
After all...

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:48.410
There's no point
in living anymore...

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:50.200
So what's driving me?

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:56.950
Fight!

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.660
Fight! Fight!

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.120
Eren...

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:04.290
Fight!

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:06.950
You have to fight!

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:07.950
Fight!

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:10.040
Fight!

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:15.410
I'm sorry, Eren...

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:17.660
I won't give up anymore...

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:23.000
I'll never give up again...

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.620
If I die...

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:30.580
...I'll lose my memories of
you too, on top of everything else.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:32.000
So...

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
...I'll do whatever it takes to win!

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.040
Whatever it takes to live!

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.000
What just happened?!

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:17.200
A Titan...

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:19.910
...is killing...

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:23.620
...another Titan...

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.120
Please, Mikasa!

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.540
Be all right!

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:56.080
Mikasa!

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:09.290
Mikasa! Are you all right?!

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:11.540
--You two okay?!
--Yeah!

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.580
We gotta get out of here!

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:19.200
Crap! Two 15-meter ones!

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.160
No, that Titan is...

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:26.580
Huh?!

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:11.950
I-It finished it off?!

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:14.450
It was actually aware of
its weak spot?!

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:16.000
We gotta get out of here!

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.450
Before it comes this way!

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:20.580
No, it's not reacting to us.

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:23.200
Any other one
would attack us for sure...

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.450
It seemed to grasp the concept
of hand-to-hand combat too.

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:29.160
Just what is it...?

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.660
All we can do is chalk it
up as an Abnormal!

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:34.370
We barely know
anything about 'em, after all.

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:36.290
Now let's just hurry to HQ!

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:39.790
Wait! Mikasa's completely out of gas!

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:40.700
Huh?!

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:41.830
Whoa, are you serious?!

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:44.790
Now what are we gonna do?!
We <i>need </i>you!

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:46.660
The answer's obvious!

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.290
I don't have much left...

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:51.290
...but hurry and
switch yours with mine!

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:52.450
Armin!

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:54.290
This is our only option!

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.450
It'll amount to nothing if I keep it.

00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:58.870
Just...

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:02.160
Use it carefully this time.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.500
Everyone's lives are riding on it.

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:12.200
I took charge without any sense
of responsibility for their lives...

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:17.160
For a short time, I had
even thrown away my own life...

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.330
All for my own personal reasons.

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:23.910
I'm...

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:25.580
There!

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:29.620
Your mobility gear still works,
and I've given you all my blades.

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:34.290
All I ask is that you
leave me with this one...

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:39.160
I'd rather not get
eaten alive, if I can help it.

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.250
N-No way...

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:48.950
Armin.

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:54.000
I'm not leaving you here.

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:05.370
Back there...

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.330
...I was completely confused.

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:15.700
I'd never heard of a
Titan killing another Titan before.

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.580
But I also felt a
faint glimmer of elation.

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:23.870
Because what I saw...

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:30.120
...looked like the manifestation
of humankind's anger.

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:58.000
<i>Your dreams are where your heart is</i>

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:04.250
<i>They're more fragile than life itself</i>

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:08.910
<i>Over and over you cast them aside,</i>
<i>only to find more</i>

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:15.580
<i>Now, rest in peace</i>

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:26.910
<i>Pounding impulses defile the things we wish for</i>

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:37.200
<i>and the more we forget</i>
<i>the more we remember again</i>

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:43.160
<i>In this beautiful, cruel world</i>

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:48.330
<i>all I can do is ask why we're still alive</i>

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:54.040
<i>Oh, with our strength--and our weakness--</i>

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:59.700
<i>what are we going to protect if there's no sense</i>

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:03.120
<i>to anything anymore?</i>

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:12.660
A Titan that kills other Titans.

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:18.910
The sight of it leaves the 104th Cadet
Corps Class awestruck and breathless.

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:21.410
What ultimately appears
before them, though, is...
