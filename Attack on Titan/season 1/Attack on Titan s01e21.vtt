WEBVTT

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.730
We will now begin the 57th 
expedition beyond the walls!

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.670
Onward!

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.220
<i>The Survey Corps left to 
find a route to Zhiganshina,</i>

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.400
<i>but encountered a Female Titan,</i>

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.590
<i>a transformed human like Eren.</i>

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.720
That's no Aberrant.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.440
It's a human in the body of a Titan!

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.480
<i>As soldiers died, one after the next,</i>

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.250
<i>they headed into a 
forest of giant trees,</i>

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.710
<i>none of them knowing why.</i>

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.880
If Squad Levi doesn't 
defeat it, who will?

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.510
Choose.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.760
Believe in yourself.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.840
Or believe in the Survey Corps and me.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.890
I'll go forward!

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.100
Fire!

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.230
Oh, right...

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.670
I wanted to ask you something.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.200
Is it okay if we cut off 
your hands and legs?

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.800
They'll grow back, right?

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.000
I'm talking about <i>your </i>
limbs, not the Titan's.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.300
We need you alive, after all...

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.440
The enemy was willing 
to sacrifice everything.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.440
I didn't expect the enemy to destroy 
itself along with the evidence

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.380
by making Titans devour itself.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.550
Retreat, men!

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.010
Back into formation!

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.080
Return to Karanes!

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.830
Erwin...

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.830
Why did you order Levi to resupply?

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:33.920
There's no time to waste.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.120
The Female Titan was eaten.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.820
But did you see the 
person inside get eaten?

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:40.960
I didn't.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:42.990
You can't mean...

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.760
Yes...

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.600
If your original hypothesis was correct,

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.620
and they can still move to a degree 
after regaining human form...

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.860
And if they'd equipped 
Maneuver Gear in advance...

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.660
The one within the Female Titan 
is wearing our uniform right now.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.370
Captain Levi?

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.900
No, it's not!

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:06.580
Who are you?!

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.790
Gunther!

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.550
The enemy is now camouflaged 
as one of our men.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.450
<i>I won't let your deaths be meaningless</i>

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:08.620
<i>even if I'm the last one standing</i>

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.500
<i>In both hands, Gloria</i>

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.500
<i>What sings is Sieg</i>

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.700
<i>On my back, Flügel der Freiheit</i>

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.540
<i>Clenched determination to my left chest</i>

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.870
<i>What slashes across is Linie der Torheit</i>

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.120
<i>Soaring across the azure skies</i>

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.660
<i>Flügel der Freiheit</i>

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.360
<b>Crushing Blow 
57th Expedition Beyond the Walls (5)</b>

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.330
"Crushing Blow"
"The 57th Exterior Scouting Mission, Part 5"

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.530
When the Colossal Titan vanished,

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.040
whoever was inside had been 
wearing Maneuver Gear,

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.620
so that they could escape in the steam.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.000
Don't you think the same 
possibility applies here?

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:20.750
But at the time...

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.960
Based on what we saw when Eren 
emerged from the Titan,

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.550
we concluded it would be impossible.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.640
His equipment was destroyed, 
and his uniform was gone.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.600
Above all, Eren was so weak, 
he couldn't even stand unassisted.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.890
The Female Titan was able to 
attract other Titans with its cry.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.950
We failed to predict this, 
and the operation failed.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.450
If Titan abilities vary 
depending on skill,

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.360
it was a mistake to use Eren, a total novice, 
as the basis for our assumptions.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.110
If we are to outwit our enemy, 
we'll need to think outside the box.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.510
If we're withdrawing, does that 
mean the mission succeeded?

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:14.620
If so, then we may already know who 
was inside the Female Titan.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.350
I'd like to see who it is...

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.210
But why was the Commander so sure

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.730
that the enemy would come after 
Eren if he left the walls?

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.780
I think it's because, for some reason,

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.390
they suddenly stopped their advance 
in the midst of the last assault.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.450
Even though they managed 
to break through Trost's gate,

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.120
they didn't even try for the inner gate.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.290
And when Eren sealed 
the gate, they let him.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.940
It could mean that they now 
have bigger concerns...

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.930
Bigger concerns?

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.970
Something more important to 
them than breaching the walls.

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.720
Something unexpected that happened.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.810
Eren's transformation into a Titan?!

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.520
I think it's the only answer.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:01.280
Then... That means...

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.440
Wait... So...

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:09.610
Someone who was there, 
who saw Eren transform,

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.990
is the Titan.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:16.080
Gunther!

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.200
Eren, don't stop!

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.460
Onward!

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:23.460
But Gunther...

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:25.750
Who's there?

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:26.800
Protect Eren!

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:28.630
Damn it, what do we do?

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.590
Eldo, where should we go?

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.550
There isn't time to reach the horses!

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.510
Head for HQ, as fast as you can!

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.860
Is it from the Female Titan? 
Or is there more than one?

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:45.650
Damn you...

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:46.730
How dare you?!

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.570
Come at me!

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.110
I'll defeat you, even if it kills me!

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:51.820
<i>The Female Titan?</i>

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.700
<i>Impossible... Why?</i>

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:56.120
<i>Didn't we catch it?!</i>

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:08.710
If the enemy has some way 
to retain its strength,

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:13.430
it may be able to transform once more.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:19.140
I knew it...

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.140
It's coming!

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:22.270
The Female Titan!

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:31.570
Damn you...

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:32.570
How dare you!

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.990
This time, I will defeat it!

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:35.780
No!

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.910
The three of us will 
kill the Female Titan.

00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:43.040
You will continue to head 
straight for HQ at top speed!

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:47.840
Here's what I have gleaned 
from this battle...

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.150
If we only focus on 
making the best moves,

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:53.800
we will never get the 
better of our opponent.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:57.090
When necessary, we must be 
willing to take big risks,

00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:59.970
and be prepared to lose everything.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.730
I'll fight, too!

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:02.480
No!

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:04.560
This is the best move...

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.730
Your power is too risky!

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:10.270
What? Do you doubt us?

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:12.090
Do you, Eren?

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:15.820
Do you find it that hard to trust us?

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.120
Unless we change how we fight,

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.270
humanity cannot win!

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.390
I believe my squad will be victorious.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.130
Good luck!

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:03.660
<i>We took its sight.</i>

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:06.330
<i>For at least a minute, 
it'll be in total darkness!</i>

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:07.580
<i>Kill it during this time!</i>

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:08.920
<i>Screw capturing it...</i>

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:09.710
<i>Kill it now!</i>

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:11.000
<i>Die here without honor!</i>

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.750
<i>Make that bitch of a Titan pay!</i>

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.680
<i>We won't let your eyes regenerate!</i>

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:35.320
<i>We'll shear off so much muscle 
around your shoulders,</i>

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.900
<i>you won't be able to keep your arms up!</i>

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:44.330
<i>Shear it off...</i>

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:45.750
<i>Make its arms...</i>

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:46.910
<i>...fall!</i>

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:51.080
They're down!

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:54.750
Now the neck!

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.470
Shear off the muscles 
that support its neck!

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:59.130
And we can strike its weak point!

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.430
<i>They're so strong.</i>

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:08.640
<i>The Female Titan is 
totally on the defensive.</i>

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.310
<i>How can they launch co-op attacks like that
without even speaking to each other?</i>

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:16.930
<i>I bet it's only possible because 
they believe in one another.</i>

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.970
<i>They've overcome many 
hardships that way.</i>

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.820
<i>That's why they're so strong, 
even right after losing Gunther.</i>

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:28.450
<i>I'll go forward...</i>

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:32.440
<i>If I go forward and believe in them, 
without turning back, then...</i>

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.150
<i>I'm sure that's the right answer.</i>

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:36.220
<i>I finally understand!</i>

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:39.590
<i>I don't know...</i>

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:42.940
<i>I never have.</i>

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.350
<i>I can believe in my own abilities</i>

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.520
<i>or the choices of companions I trust.</i>

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.480
<i>But no one ever knows 
how it will turn out.</i>

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:58.610
Strike the neck, now!

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.710
Eldo!

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:12.960
H-How?

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:15.920
It can't possibly see!

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.090
It hasn't even been thirty seconds...

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.140
Only one eye?

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:23.090
It prioritized one eye 
to accelerate the healing...

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:25.430
Is that even possible?

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.180
Petra!

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.640
We need to regroup!

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.480
Petra, now!

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:43.200
Hey...

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:44.780
Die!

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.000
How?

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.000
My blade can't pierce it...

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:13.770
I...

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.020
I will...

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:22.490
I'll kill it!

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:39.260
Eren?

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:42.340
Wait, what? Mikasa?

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.670
<i>That voice... Don't tell me...</i>

00:13:56.370 --> 00:14:01.360
<b>Information We Can Share So Far:</b>

00:13:56.370 --> 00:14:01.360
<b>Survey Corps Horses (1)

<i>I made the wrong choice...</i>

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:08.740
<i>I wanted to believe in my companions...</i>

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:10.960
<i>Because of that, everyone died!</i>

<i>If I had believed in myself 
from the start and fought...</i>

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.050
<i>If I'd only killed it at the beginning!</i>

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.570
<i>Back then,</i>

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:51.640

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:05.050
<i>Captain Levi was there, too.</i>

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:07.080
<i>We would have won.</i>

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:09.840
<i>Maybe we could've captured it.</i>

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:11.960
<i>You aren't wrong.</i>

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:14.180
<i>If you want to, do it.</i>

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:18.630
<i>I...</i>

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:20.850
<i>I made a choice.</i>

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:26.320
<i>And it killed everyone.</i>

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.480
<i>It's my fault they died.</i>

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.070
<i>But despite all that...</i>

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:38.370
<i>It's still your fault!</i>

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:52.590
<i>I'll tear you apart...</i>

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.630
<i>Once my hand heals,</i>

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:59.890
<i>I'll rip you apart... 
Tear you to shreds...</i>

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.430
<i>Rip you into tiny pieces...</i>

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:05.640
<i>And eat you!</i>

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:07.470
Eren!

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:32.680
W-Wait... Eren...

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.060
Don't go...

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:48.020
Give...

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:53.850
Give...

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:55.810
Give Eren back!

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:15.670
Give him back!

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:25.980
Give him back!

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.310
Why won't my blade penetrate?

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:35.960
I know that

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:37.310
he's alive...

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:41.110
I know that Eren's alive!

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:46.280
No matter where she goes, I'll kill her,

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.700
rip her apart,

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:52.040
and get you out of that filth.

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:54.330
I'm sorry, Eren...

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:58.630
Just wait a little longer...

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:07.090
Wait!

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:09.010
Wh-What are you...

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:12.820
Fall back for now.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.460
Maintain this distance.

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:22.670
It may be tired.

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:24.930
It does not appear to 
be going very fast.

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:29.200
He seems to have been bit 
right out of the neck.

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.200
Is Eren dead?

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:57.750
<i>If, by chance, I'm not me</i>

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:03.000
<i>then who's to say that you're you?</i>

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.290
<i>Can you pick up the pieces of your heart</i>

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:13.410
<i>that fell apart like a broken sand castle?</i>

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:18.410
<i>The voice of someone calling out</i>

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:22.500
<i>changed into ringing in my ears</i>

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:27.660
<i>It's as if time has stopped</i>

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.450
<i>Now wake up</i>

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:35.750
<i>I made my way out of the deep darkness</i>

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:41.000
<i>I fled like a swift wind</i>

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:48.500
<i>We used to be like living corpses,</i>

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.540
<i>but now we head beyond the walls</i>

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.580
<i>Let's meet again</i>

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:57.410
<i>in a place not on any map</i>

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:10.840
"Eren is alive."

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:12.590
"Give Eren back."

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:16.790
The Female Titan took Eren from 
Mikasa before her very eyes.

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:20.070
Mikasa joins forces with humanity's 
strongest fighter, Levi,

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:22.160
to challenge the Female Titan to battle.

00:24:21.330 --> 00:25:16.350
