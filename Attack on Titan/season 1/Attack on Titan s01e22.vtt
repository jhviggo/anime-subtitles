WEBVTT

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.250
I knew it!

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.540
It's coming!

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.370
The Female Titan!

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.700
After making a comeback,

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.040
the Female Titan took out the elite members
of the Levi Squad one after another.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.040
I'm going to kill her!

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.950
Blaming himself for trusting his comrades,
Eren made a resolute decision.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.700
He fought in his transformed state...

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.450
...but the Female Titan
defeated him and took him away.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.750
Give Eren...

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.660
...back!

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.450
Wherever you are,

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.700
I'm going to slaughter
this girl, butcher her body,

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.120
and get you out of that foul place...

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.330
Sorry, Eren...

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.790
Just hang on a little longer...

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.580
Wait!

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.410
Wh-What...?!

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.870
Stay back for now.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.500
<i>I won't let your deaths be meaningless</i>

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.620
<i>even if I'm the last one standing</i>

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.540
<i>In both hands, Gloria</i>

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.540
<i>What sings is Sieg</i>

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.750
<i>On my back, Flügel der Freiheit</i>

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.580
<i>Clenched determination to my left chest</i>

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.910
<i>What slashes across is Linie der Torheit</i>

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.160
<i>Soaring across the azure skies</i>

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.700
<i>Flügel der Freiheit</i>

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.290
"The Defeated"
"The 57th Exterior Scouting Mission, Part 6"

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.700
Maintain this distance.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.290
She must be worn out, too.
She's not so fast anymore.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.200
It looked like she
bit the entire nape off.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.830
Is Eren dead?

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.290
He's alive.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.620
The target seems intelligent

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.750
and intent on taking Eren away.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.370
It'd crush him if it wanted to kill him.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.540
Instead, it's fighting and running
away with him in its mouth.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.290
Eating Eren could be her goal.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.040
If so, he's in her stomach.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.200
Which means he's probably dead.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.620
He's alive.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.790
Let's hope so.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.120
This never would've
happened in the first place

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.750
had you actually protected Eren!

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.040
Ah. You're that one who...

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.370
You're Eren's childhood friend.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.000
Let's narrow our
goals down to one.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.040
First, forget about taking her down.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.830
She's killed so many of our comrades!

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.290
It's impossible. She has
the ability to harden her skin.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.540
Do as I say.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.950
We're going to set all
our hopes on Eren being alive

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.660
and rescue him before
she leaves the forest.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.200
I'll do the cutting.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.200
You distract her.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.450
He's fast!

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.660
She can't even
harden her skin in time!

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:18.790
Her nape...

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.200
It's wide open!

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.450
She's worn-down!
I doubt she can move now!

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.080
I can kill her!

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:29.330
Stop!

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.160
Eren!

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.290
Hey!

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.500
Time to go!

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.910
Eren!

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:02.500
He seems fine.
He's filthy, but alive.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.370
Forget about her now.
We need to withdraw.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.160
Don't lose sight of
what this operation is about.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.950
Is wallowing in self-indulgence
more important?

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:16.450
He's a dear friend to you, isn't he?

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.120
No... I'm...

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.830
They're coming back already?

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:43.950
What happened?

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:45.790
Dunno.

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:49.660
But I bet they'll be bringing back
another load of corpses with 'em.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:08.290
It sounds like Eld is on his way back.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.410
Oh...

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:19.790
Think ol' Oruo will have
time to stop by home?

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:23.330
I'll set a plate for him just in case!

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:30.200
Gunther is coming back, you know.

00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:35.200
I see...

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.700
This is the one thing
I'll never get used to...

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.830
I doubt <i>anyone </i>could.

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:46.160
How my comrades are gonna die...

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.000
How <i>I'm </i>gonna die...

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.580
That's all I start to think about...

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:56.160
I try not to think about it at all.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.160
Because if I started
picturing my own death,

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.700
I'd probably lose the ability to fight...

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.120
Yeah.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.290
You're exactly right.

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:16.250
How long do you
think we can survive?

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:20.000
We've managed
to survive so far, at least.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.040
Yeah, so far.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:26.910
We should be glad. We're still alive.

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:30.660
Can you say that to the
bodies of the guys who died?

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:41.750
We might never get to
see our hometowns again.

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:46.580
We're nearly finished, Sir.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:50.200
Five bodies or so
were unrecoverable, however.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.120
Not even pieces of them?

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:55.450
The Titans didn't
leave much to recover.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:01.700
I feel it'd be better for the families
if we <i>didn't </i>bring back what's left.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.500
Put them down as "missing."

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.910
Yes, Sir.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:09.500
We've spotted several
Titans in the vicinity of the forest,

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.500
but none are yet headed this way.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.750
We move at once. Inform the squads.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:16.750
Yes, Sir!

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:19.410
I refuse to accept this, Commander Erwin!

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:21.500
H-Hey, you!

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.080
We <i>should </i>recover them!

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.200
Ivan's body was
right there in front of us!

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.620
There were Titans there too!

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.790
We could end up
as casualties ourselves!

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:34.330
Then we can just
take 'em out if they attack!

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:37.040
Ivan and I grew up in the same town!

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.910
I know his parents, too!

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:41.160
I'd at least like to take him home!

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.450
Quit being selfish!

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.950
A bunch of brats arguing...

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:46.830
Captain Levi!

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:50.500
If you've confirmed his death,
then that's enough.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:56.500
He's dead. Whether or not we
have his body makes no difference.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.450
You can't be serious...

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:01.250
Ivan and the others
will be put down as "missing."

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:04.700
That decision is final. Just let it go.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.790
D-Do neither of you...

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:12.250
...have any human feelings at all?!

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:15.700
Hey, Dieter! Watch what you're saying!

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:01.290
Titans!

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:10.200
That's...

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.000
...Dieter!

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:18.620
That idiot!

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.410
Titan spotted by the rear!

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:26.040
Full speed!

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.830
I don't see any large trees <i>or </i>buildings.

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.200
We can't fight freely out here.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.200
Fleeing to the wall will be quicker.

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:02.950
It's about to catch up to us!

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:05.410
We're gonna have to fight!

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:08.330
ODM can't accomplish much on flat ground.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.160
Plus, look.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.790
They just keep coming!

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:15.540
Then what do <i>you </i>suggest we do?!

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:19.160
We need to...

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:56.660
It's no use! It's catching up!

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.250
I'll get behind it and distract it!

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:01.580
--Use that chance--
--Don't bother.

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:05.120
Dump the bodies. Before it catches up.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.910
B-But, Sir...!

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:10.910
There've been countless people
before whose bodies were left behind.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.540
These ones aren't somehow special.

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:16.500
Are we going to do it?!

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.870
Are we really going to do it?!

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:23.950
Damn...

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:28.620
We got no other choice!

00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:59.040
That's it!

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.870
Keep moving!

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:15.540
We leave as soon as
we've confirmed our positions!

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.410
Stay sharp!

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:21.160
We need to make a slight
course correction to the east.

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:31.080
Captain Levi...

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.500
I...

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:39.580
This is proof that they once lived.

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:42.040
That's how I see it, anyway.

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:47.620
It's Ivan's.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.500
Captain...

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:13.080
Let's move out!

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:36.620
Eren. I'd forget about the
Scout Regiment if I were you.

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:40.120
What?! You think the
Scout Regiment is a joke too?!

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:43.200
It's not about what I think.

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.950
The Scout Regiment is back!

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:53.830
They're gonna open the front gate!

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:56.580
Let's go see the heroes return, Mikasa!

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.000
Oh...!

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:18.910
They're the only ones who made it back?

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:21.700
Everyone else must've gotten eaten.

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:25.160
This is what they get
for going outside the walls.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:30.160
Our taxes are basically going to feeding
and fattening those things up now.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.580
Eren.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.500
What's wrong?

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:47.330
Eren...

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.080
Eren!

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:04.200
Eren?

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.160
You shouldn't get up yet.

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:14.540
You need to rest.

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:18.080
Where's the Female Titan?!

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.120
She got away.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.700
Why?

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:25.250
Why did everyone...?

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:27.500
What about the operation?

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.580
It failed.

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:31.950
You need to rest for now.

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:35.620
How did I get this?

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.870
Did you save me again?

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.330
We're almost to the wall now.

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:07.120
Is it me, or are there
fewer than this morning?

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:10.080
A <i>lot </i>fewer.

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.330
Another bad one...

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:17.580
They left this morning shouting and
roaring, and now they're already back?

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:19.750
What did they even leave for?

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:21.700
Beats me.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:26.200
But from the brooding
looks on their faces...

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:30.500
...I'd say they succeeded in
pouring our tax money down the drain.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.700
Eren. Endure it.

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:47.830
So cool!

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:50.330
The Scout Regiment's awesome!

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:54.250
Even when they're so
beat-up they keep on fighting!

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.080
Captain Levi, Sir!

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.290
Thanks for looking after my daughter!

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:19.910
I'm Petra's father!

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:23.660
I'd like to discuss something
before she spots me...

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:26.580
She sent me a letter, you see...

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:30.540
She said she was assigned to serve
you because you recognized her skill.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:33.410
She said she wants to devote her all to you...

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:35.410
Basically, the girl's so starry-eyed

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:39.160
that she has no idea how worried her parents are!

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:44.040
So, well, as her father, you see...

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:47.330
I feel it's a bit too early
to let her get married.

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:51.540
She's still young and
has so much to experience...

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:52.790
Commander Erwin!

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:54.540
Please answer us!

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:58.370
Were the gains from this expedition
worth the number of lives lost?!

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:02.160
Do you honestly believe the
soldiers died without regrets?!

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:10.120
The costs and casualties incurred
by this latest exterior expedition

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:15.160
dealt a blow heavy enough to
destroy the Scout Regiment's support.

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:29.870
Erwin and the others in charge found
themselves summoned to the capital

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:33.660
and ordered to hand over Eren.

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:57.750
<i>If, by chance, I'm not me</i>

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:03.000
<i>then who's to say that you're you?</i>

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.290
<i>Can you pick up the pieces of your heart</i>

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:13.410
<i>that fell apart like a broken sand castle?</i>

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:18.410
<i>The voice of someone calling out</i>

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:22.500
<i>changed into ringing in my ears</i>

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:27.660
<i>It's as if time has stopped</i>

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.450
<i>Now wake up</i>

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:35.750
<i>I made my way out of the deep darkness</i>

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:41.000
<i>I fled like a swift wind</i>

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:48.500
<i>We used to be like living corpses,</i>

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.540
<i>but now we head beyond the walls</i>

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.580
<i>Let's meet again</i>

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:57.410
<i>in a place not on any map</i>

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:12.410
Annie is assigned to
the security escort team

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:15.450
the day Eren and the others
are summoned to the royal capital.

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:18.540
From out of nowhere, Armin appears

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:21.410
and asks for her help
in a top-secret operation.

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:23.370
"Smile"
"Assault on Stohess, Part 1"
