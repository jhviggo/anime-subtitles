00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.750
Attention!

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.540
I will now explain to you the details
of the Trost Recovery Operation!

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.500
Let me start by introducing this fellow!

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.330
This is Eren Jaeger,
a member of the Cadets!

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.000
He is the successful result

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.700
of our top-secret Titan
transformation experiments!

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.620
In Titan form, he will lift that
giant rock near the front gate,

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.790
carry it to the wrecked gate,

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.830
and seal the hole!

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.000
As for <i>you</i>,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.700
you're to defend him from the
other Titans while he carries the rock!

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.500
Should this operation succeed,

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.500
humanity will have taken back land
from the Titans for the very first time!

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.370
Indeed, it may
seem extraordinarily small

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.410
when compared to what
humanity has given up this far!

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.000
However...!

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.750
For humankind,
that single, small step...

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.830
...will be a great leap forward!

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.620
Eren! Don't you recognize me?!

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.450
I'm Mikasa!

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.910
Part of your family!

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.830
Dodge, Ackermann!

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.750
What the hell?!

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.750
He's just a regular, dumb Titan!

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.330
Change of plans!

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.200
We're to defend Jaeger from the
other Titans until we can recover him!

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.160
He holds a precious chance for humanity.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.700
We can't abandon him just like that!

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.950
Where am I?

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.120
I'm home...

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.370
Jean!

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.910
Why isn't he using his ODM gear?!

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.040
Oh no!

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.250
Don't tell me it's malfunctioning?!

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.830
I'll manage somehow!

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.410
Mikasa!

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.790
What happened to the plan?!

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.200
It's failed!

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.660
We're fighting because
we can't leave Eren behind!

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.000
But there are too many Titans...

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.410
At this rate, we'll be wiped out!

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.830
From the back of the head
to the nape of the neck...

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.750
...1 meter high and
10 centimeters across!

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.790
Eren... Answer me...

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.080
Even though just one step outside
the wall lies a hellish world...

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.410
Why did you want to
venture into the outside world?!

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.660
Why?

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.500
Because...

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.950
...I was born in this world!

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.000
Eren!

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.700
<i>Unknown are the names</i>
<i>of the flowers that have been trampled</i>

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.160
<i>Birds have fallen to the earth</i>
<i>and long for the wind</i>

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.250
<i>Prayers won't solve anything</i>

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.580
<i>Only the will to fight</i>
<i>can change the here and now!</i>

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.910
<i>O pigs who laugh at the resolve</i>
<i>to walk over corpses to move forward</i>

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.450
<i>Livestock complacency? False prosperity?</i>

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.330
<i>Give us the freedom of dying,</i>
<i>starving wolves!</i>

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.700
<i>The humiliation of being caged</i>
<i>is what triggers us to fight back</i>

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:22.000
<i>We hunters slaughter prey</i>
<i>beyond the castle walls,</i>

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.200
<i>consumed with surging bloodlust,</i>

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:34.120
<i>as our crimson bows and arrows</i>
<i>pierce scarlet holes into the twilight</i>

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.330
"Primal Desire"
"The Struggle for Trost, Part 9"

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.660
Damn... I can't believe <i>I'm</i>
draggin' everyone down...

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.620
Will this really work out somehow?

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.830
We can't go on, Captain!

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.250
It's just us now!

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.950
Let's fall back to the rock for now!

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.870
Situation report!

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.620
Five Titans coming from the gate!

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.870
There's no way I can just sit
around and wait until the coast is clear!

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.330
Jean!

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.950
So his gear <i>is </i>busted!

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.580
What's going on?!

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:18.750
Crap!

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.250
What the hell?!

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.330
Damn it! Of all the times...!

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.700
Jean! Stay calm!

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.160
Marco!

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.000
What are you doing?!

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:46.500
Man!

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.410
Don't go causin' trouble for us!

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.120
Damn! Why is the trigger so stiff?!

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.120
Jean!

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.290
Oww!

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.790
What are you doing?!

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:18.540
Same to you! Now get outta there!

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.500
You guys are damn reckless!

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:54.040
No, <i>you </i>are!

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.080
That scared the hell out of me!

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.410
Look!

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.500
Eren...

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:36.910
Mikasa!

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.120
Armin!

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.950
Eren prevailed!

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:45.500
He's trying to fulfill
his responsibility now!

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.870
Now if we just cover
him until he reaches the gate...

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.250
...victory will be ours!

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:57.410
Defend him!

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.660
Even if it costs us our lives...

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.120
...we <i>must </i>let Eren reach the gate!

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.870
Do <i>not </i>let the Titans get near him!

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:10.540
We gotta give Eren backup! Keep 'em off him!

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:16.160
You two head to Eren!

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.040
That's an order! Is that clear?!

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.450
Yes, Sir!

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.540
The Mitabi team!

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:27.250
What are you doing?!

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.580
The Titans are ignoring us now!

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:33.040
Our only choice is to get close
enough to grab their attention!

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.000
Look this way, damn it!

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.120
Or else we'll shove our blades
up your smelly asses and kill you!

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:45.580
--Here they come!
--We got two of 'em!

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.660
Run! Run for the buildings!

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.040
That's insane!

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.660
Setting foot down there is suicide!

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.040
And they have no way to
fight without horses or buildings!

00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:01.040
No... That's the only option now.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.290
Follow Mitabi Team!

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.750
Armin. We need to go, too.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:12.370
This way!

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:14.330
Come get me!

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.950
My body feels...

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:27.080
...like it's about to be crushed into a pulp...

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.000
Mikasa... Armin...

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.450
What are you doing?

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:37.870
You'll end up Titan food if
you walk around down there...!

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:41.040
C'mon! Hurry this way, you slowpoke!

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.450
Come get me!

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.540
H-Hey!

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.500
Mitabi!

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:57.000
Why did you want

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.870
to venture into
the outside world?

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.910
From the moment
we're born, we're all...

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:09.330
...free...

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:17.700
Some might try to deny that,
but it doesn't matter how strong they are!

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:24.450
Fiery waters... Lands of ice...
Or whatever else!

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:26.910
Whoever gets to see those things

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:31.000
will have the greatest
freedom this world has to offer!

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.660
Fight!

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:37.410
If anything is worth
giving your life, it's that!

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:43.830
It doesn't matter how
terrifying the world may be!

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:50.830
It doesn't matter
how cruel the world may be!

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.040
Fight!

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.080
Fight!

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.200
Fight!

00:11:57.830 --> 00:11:59.250
Fight!

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:04.750
There's still a Titan ahead!

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:08.370
I'll handle this!

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:13.540
Out of the way!

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:38.750
Go, Eren!

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:41.160
Fight!

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:08.580
Everyone...

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:12.080
Your deaths <i>weren't </i>in vain...

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:21.410
Today, for the first time in history...

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:24.290
...humanity has beaten the Titans!

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:26.540
Yellow smoke shell spotted!

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:30.040
It seems the operation...
was a success!

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.910
Send in additional reinforcements!

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:36.660
Rescue the Elite Squad!

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:55.870
The remaining Titans are coming!

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:57.660
Head up the wall!

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:00.160
I'll withdraw after I've recovered Eren!

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:04.160
Armin! How's Eren?!

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.080
He's unbelievably hot to the touch!

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.870
We need to hurry...
and get him up the wall...!

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:16.620
Part of his body is fused to it!

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.540
--I can't pull him free!
--Then we'll have to cut!

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:21.950
W-Wait! Please!

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.160
Eren! Armin!

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:57.700
Mikasa...

00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:58.910
Huh?!

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:00.410
Those are...

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:05.370
The wings...

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.200
...of freedom...

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:16.200
Hey. You kids.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.290
What exactly is going on here?

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:27.410
Afterward, thanks to the actions

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:31.950
of the Scout Regiment and the
Garrison Regiment's Corps of Engineers,

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:36.250
Wall Rose once
again held the Titans at bay.

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:45.160
Taking out the rest of the Titans
trapped inside Trost took a full day,

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:49.370
during which the wall-mounted
cannons fired nonstop.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.870
Most of the Titans that
had gathered by the wall

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.200
were wiped out by explosive shells.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:02.000
The few that remained were
mostly mopped up by the Scouts.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:08.830
During this, one 4-meter
Titan and one 7-meter Titan

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:12.410
were successfully captured alive.

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:14.370
However...

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:18.000
207 people were dead or missing,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.200
and 897 were injured.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.580
Although this was the first time
humanity had stopped a Titan invasion,

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:32.080
far too many people had been lost
to celebrate this historic achievement.

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:53.950
Hey...

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.870
Are you...

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:03.950
...Marco?

00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:10.290
Do you know his name, cadet?

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:11.910
I <i>wondered </i>where he was...

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:17.080
But... he's the last person who would ever...

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.040
Marco...

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.620
What happened?

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:26.910
D-Did someone--anyone--see
how he went out?

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:28.620
What is his name?

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:31.410
Tell me if you know. Quickly.

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:36.830
Do you understand, cadet?

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.120
Two days have passed since
we sealed the hole with the rock.

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:43.830
Yet we <i>still </i>haven't
rounded up all the bodies.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:47.750
At this rate,
an epidemic could break out.

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:50.910
We <i>must </i>prevent a secondary disaster.

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:54.330
There's no time to lament our
comrades' deaths yet.

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:55.950
Understand?

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:06.160
Member of the 104th Cadet Corps
and Captain of Squad 19...

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.830
...Marco Bodt.

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:10.160
Marco.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.660
I'm glad you knew his name.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:14.620
Let's continue.

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:27.250
What <i>is </i>this...?

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:31.830
Leftover Titan vomit.

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:34.080
Apparently they don't
have digestive systems,

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:38.450
so they puke people out like
that once they've had their fill.

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:40.500
You can't be serious...

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:45.080
Damn... There's no way of
telling who's who in there!

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:50.250
I'm sorry...

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:56.160
I'm sorry...

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.540
It's no use apologizing.

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.750
We need to hurry and give them a funeral.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.450
Have any questions?

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:34.870
Commander Erwin, the head of
the Scouts Regiment's Task Force...

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.040
...and Captain Levi!

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:40.370
U-Umm...

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:46.000
Where... am I?

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:55.290
It should be obvious.
Let's just say it's a dungeon.

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:59.120
You're currently in the
custody of the Military Police.

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:03.580
Only just now were
we permitted to see you.

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:07.450
That key...!

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:10.120
Yes. It's yours.

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.040
I'll return it later.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:17.160
Dr. Jaeger's basement,
in your home in Shiganshina...

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.910
A secret surrounding
the Titans is there, correct?

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.290
Yes. I think so.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.700
That's what my father said.

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:30.000
And you've lost your memory,
<i>and </i>your old man's gone missing...

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.870
Pretty convenient story, if you ask me.

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:34.450
Levi.

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:38.580
We've already concluded he
has no reason to lie. You know that.

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.790
There is still so little we know,

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:45.290
but for now, I feel the most important
thing is to ask about your intentions.

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:48.080
My intentions?

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:51.370
If we want to check out your home,

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:55.540
we'll need to take back
Shiganshina District along Wall Maria.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:01.950
Sealing the damaged gate there would
be the best way to accomplish that.

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:04.790
Which means we'll need your Titan ability.

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:10.410
Naturally, it's a Titan
that will determine our fate.

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:13.870
The Colossal Titan
and the Armored Titan

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:16.660
most likely work the same way as you.

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:20.910
Your intentions are the key.

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:25.160
The key to saving humankind from this despair.

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:29.410
I'm...

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:35.950
I'm going to drive out...

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:40.540
...every last one from this world!

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:44.040
Hey. Answer the damn question, you twit.

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.660
What do you want to do?

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.660
I want to join the Scouts...

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:57.040
...and slaughter every Titan I can!

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:01.580
Ah. Not bad.

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:09.870
Erwin. I'll take responsibility for him.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:12.410
Let the higher-ups know.

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:15.580
I don't necessarily trust him, though.

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:18.000
If he betrays us or goes out of control,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.700
I'll kill him on the spot.

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.870
The top brass won't complain.

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:26.000
Because I'm the only one cut out for this.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.080
You're in.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.410
I'll make you a member of the Scouts.

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:57.870
<i>Your dreams are where your heart is</i>

00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:04.120
<i>They're more fragile than life itself</i>

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:08.790
<i>Over and over you cast them aside,</i>
<i>only to find more</i>

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:15.450
<i>Now, rest in peace</i>

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:26.790
<i>Pounding impulses defile the things we wish for</i>

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:37.080
<i>and the more we forget</i>
<i>the more we remember again</i>

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:43.040
<i>In this beautiful, cruel world</i>

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:48.200
<i>all I can do is ask why we're still alive</i>

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:53.910
<i>Oh, with our strength--and our weakness--</i>

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:59.580
<i>what are we going to protect if there's no sense</i>

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:03.000
<i>to anything anymore?</i>

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:12.290
A special court-martial.

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:15.080
After being held in an underground cell,

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:18.750
Eren is dragged into a courthouse
filled with the heads of each regiment.

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:21.830
What happens there will
determine whether he lives or dies.

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:23.370
"Can't Look into His Eyes Yet
Eve of the Counterattack, Part 1"
