WEBVTT

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.200
Draw your swords.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.700
If it shows itself,
we'll only have a moment.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.120
Move!

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:49.830
It's fast!

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.700
There's no way to
avoid it inside this forest!

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.910
It's catching up!

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.580
Captain! Let's switch to ODM!

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.000
Captain!

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.790
You're not going anywhere!

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.080
Reinforcements from the rear!

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.120
Captain! Give your orders!

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.870
Let's take it out! It's dangerous!

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.370
<i>We </i>should take care of it!

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.700
--It's about to catch up to us!
--Let's take it out here!

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.660
That's why we entered this forest!
Isn't it, Captain?!

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.000
Captain! Your orders!

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.410
Everyone, cover your ears.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.500
<i>I won't let your deaths be meaningless</i>

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.620
<i>even if I'm the last one standing</i>

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.540
<i>In both hands, Gloria</i>

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.540
<i>What sings is Sieg</i>

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.750
<i>On my back, Flügel der Freiheit</i>

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.580
<i>Clenched determination to my left chest</i>

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.910
<i>What slashes across is Linie der Torheit</i>

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.160
<i>Soaring across the azure skies</i>

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.700
<i>Flügel der Freiheit</i>

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.330
"Bite"
"The 57th Exterior Scouting Mission, Part 3"

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.410
An acoustic shell?!

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.910
Tell me, what is your job again?

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.450
Is it simply to surrender to
your emotions of the moment?

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.660
No, it's not.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.330
This squad's mission

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.040
is to do everything possible
to keep this brat unharmed.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.200
Down to our last breath.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.910
It's not to keep an eye on me?!

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.330
We're going to keep pushing
ahead on horseback. Got it?

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.660
Understood, Sir!

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.040
Push ahead?! But for how long?!

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.700
Not to mention it's
almost on top of us now!

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:20.750
More...

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.330
More reinforcements!

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.040
They'll get killed too if
we don't hurry and help them!

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.120
Eren! Face forward!

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.540
Mr. Gunther?!

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.540
Don't fall out of step!
Maintain top speed!

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.250
Mr. Eld?!

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.370
Why?!

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.500
Who can possibly stop it,
if not the Levi Squad?!

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.290
Another one's dead!

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.000
We could've saved him, too!

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.580
One person's still fighting!
There's still time to save him!

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.080
Eren! Focus ahead and keep moving!

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.750
Are you telling me to
ignore the fighting behind us?!

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.620
To just run away and
abandon my comrades?!

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.250
Yes! I am! Do as the captain says!

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.660
I don't understand
why we're letting them die!

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.000
And I don't understand
why he won't explain!

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.330
Why?!

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.370
Because the captain
doesn't feel the need to explain!

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.540
But you don't understand that
'cause you're still wet behind the ears!

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.540
Now shut up and follow orders!

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.790
No...

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.540
I can fight on my own, actually.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:38.160
Why should I always
have to rely on others?

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.830
I can just fight on my own!

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.080
What are you doing, Eren?!

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.580
You're <i>only </i>permitted to do
that when your life is in danger!

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.330
That was our agreement, remember?!

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.290
Eren!

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.330
You're not in the wrong.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.000
If you wanna do it, do it.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.330
I can tell.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:14.790
He's a real monster,
and not because of his Titan ability.

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.830
No matter how hard he's restrained,
no matter what cage he's put inside,

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.250
no one can ever tame him.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.370
I want to slaughter every Titan I can!

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:29.660
Eren.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.790
Our difference in experience
is why we don't see eye-to-eye.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:39.160
But you don't need to rely on that.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.000
Choose.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.410
Will you trust yourself,

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.450
or me, these guys,
and the entire Scout Regiment?

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.120
I don't know the answer
to that. I never have.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.290
Whether I trusted myself

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.540
or the choices of
my dependable comrades,

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.830
there was no telling
how things would turn out.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.040
So, just do the best you can

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.620
and choose whichever
you'll regret the least.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.910
Eren!

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.700
Trust us.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:41.870
I've come up with a way to
stop you without completely killing you.

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.290
Sir?

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:49.830
Before, I said the only way to
stop you in Titan form is to kill you.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.700
But this method will
only leave you mutilated.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.540
It depends entirely
on individual skill, though.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:01.500
Basically, it involves cutting the nape--
with you in it --off of the body.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:05.790
The ends of your limbs
will get severed in the process,

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.750
but I assume they'll just
grow back anyway, like a lizard.

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:10.540
It creeps me out.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.540
W-Wait.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.540
I'm not sure how
to make them grow back.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.870
Isn't there some other way?

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:24.450
So you want to do it without taking
any risks or making any sacrifices?

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:27.620
--N-No...
--Then prepare for the worst.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:32.120
We're in the same boat.
<i>You </i>could kill <i>us</i>.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.290
So just relax.

00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:37.000
Yes, Sir... I understand.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.410
S-So, I can start experimenting, right?

00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:46.910
It's risky, but we can't
risk <i>not </i>testing him, either.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:50.500
I'll take charge of the planning, then.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:51.750
Eren...

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:55.410
If you're unsure about anything,
then just learn as you go.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:09:00.200
Anything we learn is
easily worth risking our lives for.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.500
You ready down there, Eren?

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.120
I'll fire a smoke signal
when we're ready to begin.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.200
Everything after that is up to you!

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.910
Understood!

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:21.200
Mm! Even if he becomes a mindless Titan,
this dry well will hold him!

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.700
I think!

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.700
There's the signal.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:32.120
I haven't used my Titan form
since I sealed the hole in the wall...

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.580
If I go out of control <i>this </i>time...

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:39.200
...the Levi Squad might end up killing me.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.500
Did he not see the signal or something?

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.200
No...

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.410
I doubt we can expect this
to work so reliably.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:01.620
Hey! Eren! The test's off for now!

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.290
Did something happen?

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.870
Ms. Hange...

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.500
I can't turn into a Titan...

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:25.290
Not even the bite wounds
on your hands have gone away?

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.500
No, Sir.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.370
If you can't turn into a Titan,

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:35.080
our big plans for sealing
Wall Maria go up in smoke.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.080
Figure it out. That's an order.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.500
Yes, Sir...

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.660
Don't lose heart, Eren.

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:48.120
B-But...

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:53.040
This just means you're
more human than we thought.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.620
It's a lot better than ending up
dead because you were too hasty.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.450
It wasn't a waste of time.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:04.120
Yeah. There's no such
thing as being <i>too </i>careful.

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:10.330
Why are they all so calm?

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.700
Is it actually <i>okay</i>
that I can't turn into a Titan?

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:24.000
You okay?

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.410
Yes...

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.160
--Hey!
--What the...?!

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.540
What was that explosion?!

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:55.950
Wh-Why now?!

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:57.330
Calm down.

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.910
Captain Levi! I--
I don't know what--!

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.330
I said calm down...

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:05.830
...all of you.

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:35.450
What?! What was that sound?!

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:50.580
Eren!

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.120
What is the meaning of this?!

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.700
S-Sir?!

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:56.540
Why did you do it without
permission?! Answer me!

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:59.660
--Wait, Eld.
--Answer him, Eren! Explain yourself!

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:03.620
No! That can come later!

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:08.330
First, you need to prove you aren't
hostile toward us--no, toward humanity!

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:10.870
--Huh?
--Prove it! Now!

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:12.580
You bear that responsibility!

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:15.250
If you so much as
<i>twitch </i>that arm of yours

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:17.700
your head's comin' right off!

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.580
I'll do it, too! I really will! Just try me!

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.660
Oruo! I told you to calm down!

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.870
Captain! Please get away
from Eren! You're too close!

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:28.660
No, <i>you're </i>the ones
who need to get away.

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:30.040
--Step back.
--Why, Sir?!

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.040
A gut feeling.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.250
What's the deal, Eren?!
Say something!

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:34.870
--Seriously, I--
--Don't try anything funny!

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:35.870
Prove to us!

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:37.250
--Eren!
--Seriously, I don't--

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.120
--Answer the question!
--Do you think we can't kill you?!

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.290
I'm serious here!

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:43.040
--Answer this instant!
--Did you not hear me?!

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.410
--Okay! Let's do it!
--You're a threat to humanity--

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:47.950
Will you guys please be quiet?!

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.620
Eren!

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.910
Can I touch that arm?!

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.450
Please?! Can I?! Pretty please?!

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:05.080
--I just wanna touch it!
--M-Ms. Hange!

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.620
Wait, don't--!

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:09.750
Oww...

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:11.250
...hot!

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.950
Damn, it's hot when there's no skin!

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:15.910
I'm talking <i>crazy </i>hot!

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:17.250
Section Commander!

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:19.370
You live like a maniac!

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:21.910
Say! Is it not hot for you, Eren?!

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:24.830
How is it connected to your right hand?!

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:26.830
I <i>really </i>wanna see!

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:27.910
Oh, right!

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:31.080
If I just pull my hand out...

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.160
Come on!

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:39.120
H-Hey, Eren! Don't try anything funny!

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:44.250
Wha...?!

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:46.750
Hold on, Eren! That was too soon!

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:49.750
I still wanted to study it!

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.620
Captain...

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:05.910
How are you feeling?

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:16.290
Not... very... good...

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:25.660
Until they actually turned hostile,

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:31.540
I never realized how little they trust me...

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:36.200
Of course they don't.
That's why I picked them.

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:40.250
The common belief is that
the first time you come back alive

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:43.160
makes you a bonafide Scout.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:47.160
But up against Titans,
there's never enough information.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:52.540
There are always too
many unknowns and uncertainties.

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:55.580
In which case,
you need to be able to act quickly

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:59.250
and make tough decisions
based on the worst case scenario.

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:03.540
But that doesn't mean
they're cold and heartless.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:09.040
Pointing their blades at you like that,
they couldn't have felt nothing.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.540
Captain Levi.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.870
Section Commander Hange
wishes to see you.

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:18.500
Were you taking a long crap?

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.200
Nope. A pleasant one.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.580
I got stuck explaining
things to the top brass.

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:27.620
But, anyway...

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.620
...take a look at this.

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:32.830
A tea spoon?

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:34.450
Yep.

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:38.120
That right Titan hand
you created was holding this.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:42.120
Between the index finger
and thumb, like so.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.120
Huh?

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:47.120
It's hard to imagine it
was through sheer dumb luck.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:51.790
And, somehow, it hasn't been
warped by the heat <i>or </i>pressure.

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:53.910
Any thoughts on this?

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:57.410
As I recall, I went to pick it up...

00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:00.870
I transformed right after that.

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:03.080
I see...

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:07.830
This <i>might </i>explain why
you couldn't turn into a Titan earlier.

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:10.580
Killing Titans...

00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:12.120
Blocking a cannonball...

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:14.410
Lifting a boulder...

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:20.330
In each instance, you had a
clear goal prior to transforming.

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:25.040
It's possible self-inflicted
harm isn't the only trigger;

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:29.330
you might need to have
a goal of some sort as well.

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:31.500
It's true that this latest transformation

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.620
is similar to when
I stopped that cannon shot.

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:36.330
But...

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:39.660
Transforming into a
Titan to pick up a spoon...

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:43.040
This is crazy...

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:49.790
In other words,
you <i>didn't </i>break the rules on purpose?

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:51.290
That's right.

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:06.750
Huh?

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:08.120
Huh?!

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.830
Wait...! What are you doing?!

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:12.250
Oww...

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.160
This really hurts...

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:19.160
Eren. I'm impressed
you can bite so deep like this.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.000
We made an error in judgment.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.330
This is our small way of paying for that.

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.910
So it's no big deal.

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:28.080
Huh?

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.040
Our job is to keep you in check.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.580
And <i>that </i>isn't in the wrong!

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.830
So don't get cocky, kid!

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:38.040
I'm sorry, Eren.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.790
We were so scared...

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:43.580
You must be disappointed
in our stupidity.

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:46.250
But... Even so...

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:50.870
We'll be relying on you,
and we'd like you to rely on us.

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:57.750
So...

00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:59.370
Please...

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:00.660
Trust us.

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:12.200
Eren!

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.040
Hurry! Decide already!

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:19.200
I'll go with you!

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:27.540
Let go!

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:34.580
I'm sorry!

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:44.080
Target is speeding up!

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:47.500
Keep moving!
We're going to outrun it!

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:53.200
Outrun it? There's no way...!

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:57.750
If we keep riding with our backs to it,
we'll all get squashed flat!

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:01.870
But...

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:04.040
We're on the verge of death...

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.330
And we're letting our comrades die...

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:09.540
Yet, everyone's chosen to
keep moving forward.

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:13.750
Captain Levi is staring straight ahead.

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:18.750
And the others trust him fully!

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:21.500
I...

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:24.000
...need to trust them, too.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:27.750
Just as they...

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:29.700
...trusted me!

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.290
Fire!

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:12.580
Hitch your horses a little
further ahead, then switch to ODM.

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:14.830
I have to leave for now.

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:17.330
Eld's in charge of the squad.

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:21.330
Hide Eren a suitable
distance away from that Titan.

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:23.040
Look after my horse!

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:29.250
You don't mean...?!

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:33.620
They're going to take that Titan alive?!

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:42.540
What do you think of that, Eren?!
We caught that Titan!

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:46.370
This is the might of the Scout Regiment!
Don't underrate us, you idiot!

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:48.750
Now do you see?!

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.500
Yes!

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:58.080
It looks like she's stopped.

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.160
We can't drop our guard yet.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:03.660
I'm just impressed you
managed to lead her to this spot.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.370
The credit goes to the rear squad
members who gave their lives fighting her.

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:11.000
They bought us time.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.660
It would've been impossible otherwise.

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.200
Is that so?

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.620
Yes.

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.040
Thanks to them...

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:23.910
...we get to see
who's inside this one's nape.

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:29.330
Let's just hope they're not
wetting themself inside there...

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:57.750
<i>If, by chance, I'm not me</i>

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:03.000
<i>then who's to say that you're you?</i>

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.290
<i>Can you pick up the pieces of your heart</i>

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:13.410
<i>that fell apart like a broken sand castle?</i>

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:18.410
<i>The voice of someone calling out</i>

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:22.500
<i>changed into ringing in my ears</i>

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:27.660
<i>It's as if time has stopped</i>

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.450
<i>Now wake up</i>

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:35.750
<i>I made my way out of the deep darkness</i>

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:41.000
<i>I fled like a swift wind</i>

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:48.500
<i>We used to be like living corpses,</i>

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.540
<i>but now we head beyond the walls</i>

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.580
<i>Let's meet again</i>

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:57.410
<i>in a place not on any map</i>

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:17.160
Erwin Smith's top-secret plan
was to capture the Female Titan.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:20.750
Elite members of the Scout Regiment
attempt to reveal its true identity.

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:21.830
But...

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:23.370
"Erwin Smith"
"The 57th Exterior Scouting Mission, Part 4"
