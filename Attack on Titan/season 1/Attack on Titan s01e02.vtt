00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:27.660
Over a century ago, beings that
prey on humans suddenly appeared.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.790
Their absolutely overwhelming strength

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.620
quickly pushed humanity to
the brink of extinction.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.910
The surviving humans constructed
three walls: Maria, Rose, and Sina,

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.450
which brought them a century of peace.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.870
However...

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.750
<i>Unknown are the names</i>
<i>of the flowers that have been trampled</i>

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.200
<i>Birds have fallen to the earth</i>
<i>and long for the wind</i>

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.290
<i>Prayers won't solve anything</i>

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.620
<i>Only the will to fight</i>
<i>can change the here and now!</i>

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.910
<i>O pigs who laugh at the resolve</i>
<i>to walk over corpses to move forward</i>

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.450
<i>Livestock complacency? False prosperity?</i>

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.330
<i>Give us the freedom of dying,</i>
<i>starving wolves!</i>

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.700
<i>The humiliation of being caged</i>
<i>is what triggers us to fight back</i>

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.000
<i>We hunters slaughter prey</i>
<i>beyond the castle walls,</i>

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.250
<i>consumed with surging bloodlust,</i>

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:09.160
<i>as our crimson bows and arrows</i>
<i>pierce scarlet holes into the twilight</i>

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.290
"That Day"
"The Fall of Shiganshina, Part 2"

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:57.830
Till that time I had been a wretched soul,
and wholly giv'n to greed!

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.500
Now, as thou see'st,
I'm punished for it here!

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.290
What avarice doth

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.580
is here made manifest,
in this purgation of converted souls!

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.700
Nor hath this Mount a penalty more bitter!

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.700
Stop!

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.200
Let me go!

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.000
O Avarice!

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.620
Thou hast to thyself so drawn my race,

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.790
that ev'n for its own flesh it careth not!

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.330
What more canst thou do with us?!

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.950
O Avarice! Thou hast to thyself--

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.370
Eren! What are you doing?!

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.370
We were so close to saving Mom!

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.580
Why couldn't you mind your own business?!

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.790
--We were so close to saving her!
--Knock it off, dammit!

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.830
Eren!

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.330
Eren.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.410
You couldn't save your mother

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.580
because you lacked the strength.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.040
And I...

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.500
I couldn't stand up to the Titan...

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.410
...because I lacked the courage!

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.700
I'm sorry.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.040
It's happened again...

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.870
Hurry! To the inner gate!

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.700
Escape aboard the boats there!

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.040
Hurry! Before you get eaten!

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.500
City districts like Shiganshina that
stick out in vital spots along the wall

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:11.660
serve to attract the Titans and streamline
security costs and troop numbers.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.250
Performing true to its role as a Titan target,

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:21.910
Shiganshina had but one inner gate
through which its citizens could flee.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.700
Discard your belongings!

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.330
Let as many people on as possible!

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.000
Sit, Armin.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.250
But Eren and Mikasa still aren't here.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.080
There they are!

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.370
Eren?

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.120
Just let him be for now.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.830
The poor thing.
How very traumatized he must be...

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.250
Huh?

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.000
What are you dawdling for?!
Hurry the hell up!

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.950
Get those cannons loaded!

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:10.830
Hurry!

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.750
They're closing in!

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:30.120
This can't be for real...!

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.830
Please, God...
Please, God... Please, God...

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.500
Hey!

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.080
Hey! What are you doing?!

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.370
It's at full capacity! It has to leave!

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.910
No! Please! At least let our children on!

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:45.830
I'm sorry, but we can't!

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:47.450
Get going!

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.540
--Let us on!
--Let us on!

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.540
You idiot! What are you aiming at?!

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.870
B-But, Sir, these aren't
accurate enough to aim with!

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:20.370
I don't give a crap!
Get 'em reloaded at once!

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:21.870
It's no use!

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.450
The gate's closing...!

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:31.870
Retreat! We're gonna get left behind!

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:33.290
Hey!

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:37.290
Don't shut it! Hold on a little longer!

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:40.080
There are still lots of people in there!

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.080
If the Titans get through,

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.620
the town being overrun
will be the least of our worries!

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:49.540
All of humankind will be forced
to withdraw behind the next wall!

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:54.410
But that's no reason to
leave <i>these </i>people to die!

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:55.450
Shut it! Hurry!

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.000
The Titans are coming!

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:00.000
Close the gate at once!

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.120
Stop!

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.080
Hey!

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.620
What the...?

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.040
It's...!

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.450
Fire!

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:00.330
--What?!
--No effect?!

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.410
It's...!

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:09.580
It's coming! Retreat!

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.620
A Titan's coming! It's charging this way!

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.450
Hurry! Shut the gate!

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:51.910
The gate...

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:25.790
Within hours of the fall of Shiganshina
on the south side of Wall Maria,

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:32.370
news of the incident had reached
every city inside human territory.

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:33.620
Is it true the Titans

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:37.250
"South side of Wall Rose" "Trost District"
have overrun Shiganshina?!

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:38.870
I can't believe this!

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:42.040
The walls have held strong
for a century! Why now?!

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.120
Whether we believe it or not,

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.370
the fact is that refugees <i>have</i>
fled here by boat!

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:50.370
Reports say there are five hundred on board.

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:54.370
The question is if Shiganshina
is all that was affected...

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:59.700
But, surely they couldn't have
gotten through Wall Maria as well?

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:03.700
In any event,

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.250
we must contact the central
government and request instructions.

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:11.450
This crisis is far too much
for us to handle on our own.

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:13.160
I'm sorry to interrupt!

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.250
A courier horse has just arrived!

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:19.870
Titans have breached
Wall Maria and entered its interior!

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:29.080
It's over...

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:32.660
It's all over...

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:37.000
The Titans are going
to devour humanity again...

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.660
This is the end...?

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:45.910
I'll... never see
that house... ever again...

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:50.120
Why...?!

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:55.540
Why'd I argue for no reason like that?!
Why was that all I could do?!

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.750
And now Mom's gone!

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:01.200
She's never coming back!

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.500
Why...?!

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:09.040
Because you lacked the strength.

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.830
It's because I'm weak...
Because humans are weak...

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:18.290
Is crying the only
thing the weak can do?!

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:35.790
I'm... going to...

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:36.830
Eren.

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:38.790
What's gotten into you, Eren?

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:41.160
Eren...

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:44.040
...drive them out!

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.700
I'm going to drive out...

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.620
...every last one from this world!

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:52.830
Eren...

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:03.120
The same year, the central
government made the decision

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:07.200
to withdraw all of humanity's
domain behind Wall Rose.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:12.750
An estimated 10,000 people
were eaten by Titans during this time.

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:15.540
Eren...

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:16.750
Carla...

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.450
Mikasa...

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:20.450
Please be all right!

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:24.370
Eren!

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.120
Eren!

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:27.660
Eren!

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:29.700
Eren!

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:30.700
Dad!

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.160
Stop, Dad!

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:35.700
What are you trying to do?!

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.290
Just give me your arm!

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:38.790
No!

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:41.660
Mom's death has made you go crazy!

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:42.700
Eren!

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.200
Let go, Dad!

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.410
It's for...

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:47.500
...your own sake!

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.120
What are you talking about?!

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.950
Listen! <i>Don't </i>forget the key!

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:54.660
You <i>must </i>reach it!

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:58.660
Until... you learn...
the truth someday...!

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:09.410
Eren, are you okay?

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:11.250
You were having a nightmare.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.500
I feel like I just saw Dad...

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.120
No, you were dreaming.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.450
Oh...

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:26.290
Let's go.

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:29.040
They said they're going to hand out food.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:37.200
Apparently this was their food storehouse.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:41.120
They've gathered all the boat refugees here.

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:54.120
--Hey! Get in line, will ya?!
--Shut up!

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.330
I ain't eaten anything since last night!

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:01.330
We can't say we've survived just yet.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:02.330
Eren!

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:03.950
Mikasa!

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:05.370
Armin...

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.950
Here! Just in time!

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:12.870
My grandpa got us some
by saying it was for children!

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:14.500
Thank you.

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.200
What's his problem?

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.870
You can't blame him.

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:27.250
There's probably not
enough food to go around.

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:29.790
And that's an entire day's worth.

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:31.830
There are just too many refugees.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:34.000
There was already
a food shortage going on,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.580
plus the people here aren't treated
as well as citizens on the outer wall.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:38.910
--This is mine!
--Shut up!

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:42.370
Why should we hafta give <i>our</i>
food to some lousy outsiders?

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:45.910
If the Titans got through the wall,

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:49.370
they could've at least eaten
some more people, if you ask me!

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:53.870
Eren!

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:57.830
This is just gonna make
the food shortage even worse.

00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:59.250
Oww!

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:03.000
What the hell?! You damn kid!

00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:07.250
You don't know what it's like!

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:09.540
You've never even seen it!

00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:14.450
You've never seen
what the Titans do to people!

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.500
Shut up!

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.830
I apologize!

00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:20.540
He's just hungry and irritable!

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:24.450
That's why he so rudely
lashed out at an adult...

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:27.750
I'm very sorry!

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:31.580
Man...

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:36.910
It's 'cause of <i>us </i>that you guys
aren't starving to death, you know!

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:40.330
Even you kids oughta be thankful to us!

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:41.910
Of course!

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:43.540
Damn...

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:46.870
I refuse to let <i>them </i>take care of me.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:51.370
I'm going back--to Wall Maria!

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:54.290
I'm going to destroy every last Titan!

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:55.410
Eren...

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:57.660
You're not being serious, are you?

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.410
I'm serious!

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:03.250
I'm not like those guys who do
nothing but act tough inside the walls!

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.160
I don't need this crap!

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:10.120
Eren! You'll starve to death!

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.370
Doesn't it bother you at all?!

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:15.450
It's because we take everyone's
charity that we can't beat the Titans!

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:17.870
It's impossible!
There <i>is </i>no beating them!

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:20.750
All we can do is live inside the walls!

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.910
If we try anything, we'll die!
Just like my mom and dad!

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:27.660
So you're just gonna grovel to them then?!
That's not shameful to you?!

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.040
There's... There's nothing
we can do for now!

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.870
That's just an excuse!

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:35.160
If you wanna live like
livestock forever, go ahead!

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.000
You wimp!

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.160
Mikasa...

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:54.870
If Armin's a wimp, then so are we.

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:58.790
Whether it was running
from the Titans or fleeing the town,

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:02.580
we didn't manage anything on our own.

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.620
We even had help finding food today.

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:08.040
There's no way such powerless people

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.540
can defeat even a
single one of those Titans.

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.750
Staying alive is what matters most.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:18.000
Just like your mother said.

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:25.250
Mikasa!

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:28.200
You have to eat and stay alive.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.950
I <i>won't </i>let you starve to death.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.370
Several days later,
the throngs of refugees

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:49.950
were tasked with cultivating
the wastelands to secure food.

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:54.910
However, a food shortage was unavoidable.

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:57.330
So, in the following year of 846,

00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:00.580
the central government sent a
multitude of refugees on a mission

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:04.160
in the name of retaking Wall Maria.

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:15.870
Of the 250,000 sent--

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:18.370
nearly 20% of the population--

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:22.120
not even 200 survived.

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:26.080
Although it wasn't much,
their sacrifices did improve

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:30.410
the food shortage situation
for the rest of the population.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.870
It's all the Titans' fault.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:49.330
If we could just subdue them,

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:53.160
our place in the world could be ours again.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:56.330
Armin.

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:59.330
I'm going to apply for the Cadets next year.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.250
I'm going to gain the
strength to fight the Titans!

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:09.790
Me too...

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:11.000
Armin?!

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.410
Me too!

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:15.160
I will, too.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.290
Mikasa...!

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:20.830
You don't need to! You said yourself
staying alive is what's important!

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:25.660
Yes. That's why I'm doing it;
so <i>you </i>won't die.

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:32.700
All right. The three of us, then.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:45.120
The 104th Cadet Corps Class
entrance ceremony will now begin!

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:50.200
You have the misfortune of having me,
Keith Sadies, as your commandant!

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.870
I do <i>not </i>welcome you warmly!

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:56.160
In your current state, you'd
be nothing but food for the Titans!

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.790
You're mere livestock!
You're <i>less </i>than livestock!

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:05.370
Over the next three years,
we're going to train you worthless nothings

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:08.370
and teach you how to fight Titans!

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:12.040
Three years from now, when you
come face-to-face with the Titans,

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.080
will you still be fodder for them?!

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.790
Will you serve as an honorable
barrier that protects the king?!

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:22.120
Or will you be a glorious soldier
for humanity that drives the Titans out!

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.830
It's up to <i>you </i>to decide!

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.950
Yes. I'll be one.

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:33.000
I'll drive out every last Titan!

00:22:55.950 --> 00:23:00.870
<i>Your dreams are where your heart is</i>

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:07.120
<i>They're more fragile than life itself</i>

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:11.830
<i>Over and over you cast them aside,</i>
<i>only to find more</i>

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:18.540
<i>Now, rest in peace</i>

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:29.620
<i>Pounding impulses defile the things we wish for</i>

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:40.160
<i>and the more we forget</i>
<i>the more we remember again</i>

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:46.120
<i>In this beautiful, cruel world</i>

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:51.410
<i>all I can do is ask why we're still alive</i>

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:57.040
<i>Oh, with our strength--and our weakness--</i>

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:02.580
<i>what are we going to protect if there's no sense</i>

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:07.160
<i>to anything anymore?</i>

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.500
He fails as a soldier.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:20.000
Eren joins the Cadets,
vowing revenge against the Titans,

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.950
but his failure at basic training
comes as a harsh reality.

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:26.370
"A Dim Light Amid Despair"
"Humanity's Comeback, Part 1"
