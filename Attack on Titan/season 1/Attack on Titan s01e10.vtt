00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.830
In the year 845,

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.620
the Colossal Titan and the
Armored Titan suddenly appeared

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.000
and destroyed one of humanity's
walls--and everyday life with it.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.580
Humanity abandoned Wall Maria,

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.370
lost 20% of its population
and one-third of its territory,

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.160
and was forced to
retreat behind Wall Rose.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.370
Then, in the year 850, in Trost District...

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.290
Once again, humanity allowed the
Titans to further their advance.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.500
And Eren Jaeger,
who had fallen prey to one,

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.290
reappeared from inside
a mysterious Titan...

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.750
<i>Unknown are the names</i>
<i>of the flowers that have been trampled</i>

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.200
<i>Birds have fallen to the earth</i>
<i>and long for the wind</i>

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.290
<i>Prayers won't solve anything</i>

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.620
<i>Only the will to fight</i>
<i>can change the here and now!</i>

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.910
<i>O pigs who laugh at the resolve</i>
<i>to walk over corpses to move forward</i>

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.450
<i>Livestock complacency? False prosperity?</i>

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.330
<i>Give us the freedom of dying,</i>
<i>starving wolves!</i>

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.700
<i>The humiliation of being caged</i>
<i>is what triggers us to fight back</i>

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.040
<i>We hunters slaughter prey</i>
<i>beyond the castle walls,</i>

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.250
<i>consumed with surging bloodlust,</i>

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:15.160
<i>as our crimson bows and arrows</i>
<i>pierce scarlet holes into the twilight</i>

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.290
"Response"
"The Struggle for Trost, Part 6"

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.620
I'll ask one more time!

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.500
What are you really?!

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.910
I'm human!

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.950
I see...

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.620
Don't take this personally.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.580
Marco...

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.870
I can't do this anymore...

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.370
I can't fight Titans anymore!

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.830
What's gotten into you?!

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.870
My friends got
eaten right in front of me!

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.040
My friends got killed, yet I didn't
feel any sadness or hate at all!

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.620
Deep down,
I just felt glad it wasn't me...!

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.410
But it's my turn next.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.250
I've realized what our job is...

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.950
It's basically fighting and fighting
until we eventually get eaten!

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.620
Well, screw that! I'd rather end things now...!

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.080
Stop! Pull yourself together!

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.700
You aren't the only one, you know!

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.450
We're <i>all </i>fighting back fear!

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.790
Just look at Sasha!

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.200
Even after what she went through,
she's still an upstanding soldier!

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.250
Umm... My stomach hurts...

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.700
Could you please consider
me one of the wounded?

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.450
--I can't go on!
--Stop!

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.870
Stop it!

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.160
That gag order is
definitely warranted.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.040
The situation's bad enough as it is.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.330
If they found out about Eren...

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.910
Cannon fire?!

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.450
Why only one shot?!

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.450
Look! Smoke!

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.040
It's <i>inside </i>the wall!

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.200
--Hey!
--What's happening?!

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.580
What's going on?!

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.870
Did they break through the water gate?!

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.290
Impossible!
That's the sturdiest place of all!

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.580
They must've just
set off a shell by accident!

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.950
Still...

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.750
Why's there so much smoke?!

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.080
No way... Is it Titan steam?!

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.500
Hey!

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.290
H-Hey!

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.000
What the hell...?!

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.540
It's alive!

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.120
Captain Woermann!

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.330
W-Wait and see what it does!
We can't risk getting near it!

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.830
Stay on alert, everyone!
Remain on standby!

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.290
Artillerymen, reload the cannon!

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.660
What is <i>this</i>...?

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.330
I-I remember hearing the cannon go off...

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.040
After that came a tremendous
sound, shock, and heat!

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.830
And now we're inside a giant skeleton--

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.450
Eren protected us.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:41.200
That's all we need to understand for now.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.290
Flowers, only on the inside...?

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.700
Hey!

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.910
You guys okay?!

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.870
Eren! What is this?!

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.040
I don't know!

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.040
But it's already starting to vaporize,
just like a Titan's corpse!

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.120
Let's get away from it!

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:06.250
Can't tell if they're watching
and waiting or if they're in a daze...

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.950
The Garrison Regiment isn't
showing any signs of activity for now...

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.450
...but I'm sure they'll start
attacking again soon enough.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:20.580
I doubt there's <i>any </i>chance of reasoning
with them now, after seeing this.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.950
But there <i>is </i>one
thing I remember now.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.370
The basement.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.000
The basement of my house!

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:31.410
My dad said it'd all
make sense if I go there!

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:34.750
He's also the reason
this has happened to me...

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:41.000
If I go to the basement, I might
figure out what the Titans are too!

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:45.620
Damn it!

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.910
Then why did he keep it a secret?!

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:53.040
Thousands of Scouts have
died trying to get that information!

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.290
It's the only hope humanity has!

00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:01.200
And he just kept it tucked away
in our basement all this time?!

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.200
What the hell was he thinking?!

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.870
And where the hell has
he been these last five years--

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.660
Eren.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.330
We have other things to attend to right now.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.660
Yeah...

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:18.660
The smoke's clearing!

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.750
Attack on sight!

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:20.830
Let's finish it off quick!

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.660
Hold your positions!

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:37.750
I'm getting out of here.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.160
--And going where? How?!
--Anywhere will do for now.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.330
Then I'll go over the wall and
make for the basement.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.540
After I've changed into a Titan again.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.000
Can you really do that?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.250
I don't know how I'm doing it, either.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:54.700
But I know I can do it!

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:59.450
It's just like how I can't really
explain how I'm moving my arm.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.750
Just now, my mind unconsciously
focused on stopping the cannonball.

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:09.120
That's why it decayed; it only had
the capabilities and endurance for that.

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.410
Next time I'm gonna
be an even stronger one...

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:19.410
I'm gonna be a 15 meter-high one
that can slaughter other Titans, like before!

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:20.830
Eren!

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:23.160
Your nose is bleeding...

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.290
You look really pale,
and your breathing is rough.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.870
Something's clearly wrong!
You're not well!

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:35.500
My health doesn't matter right now!

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.790
I have two ideas in mind.

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:42.950
You guys can get through this
alive if you stop trying to protect me.

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:46.910
I've already caused
you enough trouble as it is,

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:49.870
so I'm gonna go
it alone from here on out.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.160
You can't be serious...

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.790
--I--
--Eren.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:55.580
I'm coming with you.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:56.950
No!

00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:00.250
If I don't keep up,
you won't have to worry about me.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:03.370
But I won't have to
do what you say, either.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:06.000
I'm serious here!
Just forget about it!

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.330
I'm not your little brother or your kid!

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.620
What the hell?!

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:25.660
Sir. The cannon is almost reloaded.

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:29.000
What are your next attack orders?

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.580
You will wait for my signal!

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.500
Yes, Sir!

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.660
For now, the Garrison Regiment
isn't showing any signs

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.910
of launching a close-quarters assault.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:45.200
If they were, Mikasa would've
sensed it faster than a stray cat.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.370
Assuming they reload in
the shortest time possible...

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:51.040
...it'll take them about twenty more seconds.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.790
I figure Eren will spring into
action and be gone before then...

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:04.450
Why am I reminded
of that at a time like this?

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:08.750
Is it... because
this is the end for us?

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:12.870
In the very end,

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:17.450
I never amounted to
anything more than a coward...

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:22.120
They were there to
help me so many times...

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:27.200
...but not once did
I ever manage to help them.

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:35.290
How can I possibly
call myself an equal friend?

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:39.660
How can I possibly
offer to go with them?

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.500
I'm not even confident
I can keep up...

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:55.700
I guess this is the last time...

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.160
...the three of us will ever be together...

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:04.410
Eren. I <i>am</i>--

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:06.450
Wait, Mikasa!

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:09.950
I said I had <i>two </i>ideas, remember?

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:13.950
Armin. I leave the decision to you.

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:15.790
Huh?

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:20.540
Even I know how unrealistic this plan is.

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:23.540
The best option would
be to use this Titan ability

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:27.500
in a systematic way,
under the military's direction.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.000
I know this sounds crazy,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.950
but if you think you can convince the
Garrison Regiment that I'm not a threat,

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:41.040
I'll trust in you and go with that option.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.950
That's my second idea.

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:48.250
If you don't think you can do it,
I'll go with the other idea as a last resort.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:52.950
Decide in fifteen seconds.

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:54.950
Can you do it or not?

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:57.750
I'll respect your opinion,
whichever it is.

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.330
Eren...

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:08.160
Why are you entrusting such an
important decision to me?

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:13.790
Even when things get ugly,
you always make the right call, y'know?

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:17.120
I figure that's worth relying on.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.000
When did I ever do that...?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.750
All the time.
Like that time five years ago...

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:26.000
If you hadn't gone and
gotten Mr. Hannes for us,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.200
Mikasa and I would've been Titan food.

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:42.370
It was all in my head... I convinced
myself that's how I was...

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:48.910
I convinced myself
I was helpless and a burden...

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:55.500
But they never felt that way at all...!

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.200
Armin! We're out of time!

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.790
They've finished reloading, Sir!

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:04.830
We can fire at any time!

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:08.500
These two who are willing
to place their lives in my hands...

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:13.870
...are the people I trust
more than anyone in this world.

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:18.410
What more convincing
do I need than that?!

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.910
I <i>will </i>persuade them, without fail.

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:28.160
I'll need you to act as
nonaggressive as possible.

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:39.580
Something's been bugging me ever
since Eren started fighting as a Titan.

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.370
I haven't collected my
thoughts yet, but I'll do this!

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:45.250
I'll have to think as I talk!

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:50.700
Halt!

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:58.250
You've finally revealed your true form, monster!

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:01.580
I'll do it! I'll give the signal to fire!

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:04.080
He is <i>not </i>an enemy of humanity!

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:08.580
We're willing to disclose
everything we've learned!

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:10.830
Begging for your lives won't help you!

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:14.750
He's revealed his true form for
all to see! What more is there to say?!

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.660
If you insist he's not our enemy,
then show me proof!

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:21.160
If you can't, then we'll simply
eliminate the threat he poses!

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.660
There's no need for proof!

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:26.580
That's right... There <i>is </i>no need!

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:31.000
In fact, this isn't about
what <i>we </i>perceive him to be!

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.160
What?!

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.160
I hear that countless people saw him!

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.450
In which case, they surely
saw him fighting Titans as well!

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:42.370
And they must've seen the
Titans swarming around him too!

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:49.370
In other words, the Titans saw
him as prey--just like they see us!

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:54.540
That's an irrefutable fact,
however hard you look at it!

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:00.160
He has a point...

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.370
--A Titan, on our side?
--That's crazy...!

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.950
Prepare to attack!

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:17.450
Don't be taken in
by their clever ruses!

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:22.290
Their behavior has always
been beyond our understanding!

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:27.080
It's entirely possible they'd take on
human form and use human language

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.080
to deceive us all!

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.410
We can't let them have their way anymore!

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:37.870
It's no use...

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:41.330
He's abandoned all logic...

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:44.200
He's afraid to think...

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.500
Eren! Mikasa!

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.040
As a soldier, I have
long sworn to give my heart

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.000
for the restoration of humankind!

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.580
Nothing would make me
happier than to die for that cause!

00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:12.290
If we combine his Titan ability
with our own remaining manpower,

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:15.620
we <i>can </i>retake this city!

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:17.830
For humanity's glory,

00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:20.750
in what little time I have left to live,

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:24.200
I will continue to
advocate his strategic value!

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:30.000
Captain Woermann.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.750
I believe his words are worth consid--

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:33.250
Silence!

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:38.410
However much they beg
for their lives, they're still traitors...

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:40.790
To dispose of those who violate the rules...

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:43.950
That is the duty of a soldier!

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:49.250
That's enough.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:55.500
I see you're still as delicate
as a young deer despite your size.

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:58.580
Commander Pyxis...!

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.660
Can you not see that
soldier's splendid salute?

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:11.500
I've only just arrived, but I've
been filled in on the situation.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:14.120
You're in charge of
the reinforcements now.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:19.160
Something tells me we ought
to hear these people out, you see...

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:28.330
According to the
Scout Regiment's reports,

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:31.790
it was believed that the
Titans would appear from the south.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:36.410
Indeed, it was Shiganshina District,
on the south side of Wall Maria,

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:39.410
that the Titans attacked.

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:44.950
As a result, the fortified city of Trost
on the south side of Wall Rose

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:49.450
was deemed their next most likely target.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.700
"Trost District, Inner Gate"

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.330
Dot Pyxis...

00:18:56.330 --> 00:19:02.080
The top officer in charge of Trost
and the entire southern territory,

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:06.500
and the man given full authority for the
defense of humanity's most vital region.

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:11.830
Nope, none at all...

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:15.790
I certainly wouldn't mind being
gobbled up by a beautiful girl Titan...

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:21.580
And he's also known for
being a full-blown eccentric.

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:24.370
What is the commander thinking?!

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:28.200
Taking those freaks up
there without a single bodyguard...!

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:33.830
I don't know. He's never
been one to make much sense.

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:35.250
Sir.

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:38.120
We've finished reassembling the troops.

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.290
Right.

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:40.790
Good work.

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.250
I see.

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:49.950
And visiting this basement will
make everything clear?

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:53.250
Yes... Do you believe me?

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:55.830
Seeing as you, yourself,
are unable to provide validation,

00:19:55.830 --> 00:20:00.120
for now I'm simply
keeping it all in mind.

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:05.660
But I do believe I can tell when
someone is being sincere or not.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:09.500
I will personally guarantee your safety.

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:14.410
Cadet Arlelt, was it?

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:15.660
Yes, Sir!

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:19.250
Earlier, you mentioned that
with this so-called "Titan ability"

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:22.750
it would be possible to retake this city.

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:24.790
Do you truly believe that?

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:28.870
Or was that just a
desperate plea for your life?

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:30.290
Well...

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:33.500
Both.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:39.540
I was going to suggest that Eren,
in Titan form, could take that giant rock

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:43.410
and use it to block the wrecked entrance.

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:47.200
It was just an idea
I came up with on the spot...

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.450
I just wanted them to see
the possibilities of Eren's ability

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:54.160
and how it could help
solve the situation we're in...

00:20:56.950 --> 00:21:00.160
Of course, I was
desperate to survive, too!

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:04.120
"Desperate to survive..."

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.330
There's nothing more
credible than those words.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:18.910
What do you say, Cadet Jaeger?

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:20.500
Sir?

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.200
Can you plug the hole?

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:28.450
Well... Uhh...

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:30.040
I'm not sure.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:35.790
Right now, I don't really understand
any more than the rest of you.

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:38.750
Maybe I can. Maybe I can't. I don't know.

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:42.040
I don't feel I can risk
giving an irresponsible answer...

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.910
Ah, yes. My apologies.

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:47.580
I asked the wrong question.

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:53.040
<i>Will </i>you do it or not?

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.660
I'll do it.

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:26.330
I'll do it!

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:29.200
I don't know if
I can plug the hole or not.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.660
But...

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:32.290
I'll do it!

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:57.910
<i>Your dreams are where your heart is</i>

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:04.160
<i>They're more fragile than life itself</i>

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:08.830
<i>Over and over you cast them aside,</i>
<i>only to find more</i>

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:15.500
<i>Now, rest in peace</i>

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:26.830
<i>Pounding impulses defile the things we wish for</i>

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:37.120
<i>and the more we forget</i>
<i>the more we remember again</i>

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:43.080
<i>In this beautiful, cruel world</i>

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:48.250
<i>all I can do is ask why we're still alive</i>

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:53.950
<i>Oh, with our strength--and our weakness--</i>

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:59.620
<i>what are we going to protect if there's no sense</i>

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:03.040
<i>to anything anymore?</i>

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:13.250
Despite having fled
out of fear once before,

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:17.660
the soldiers choose to
stand on the battlefield again.

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:20.160
Eren makes up his mind:

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.040
"I'll be everyone's hope."
