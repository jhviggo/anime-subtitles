00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:24.700
In the year 845, the Colossal Titan
and the Armored Titan suddenly appeared

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.120
and destroyed one of humanity's walls--
and everyday life with it.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.910
And then, finally freed
from their century-long hunger,

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.250
the Titans overran humankind once again.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.330
Stop!

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.660
Humanity abandoned Wall Maria,

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.370
lost 20% of its population
and one-third of its territory,

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.580
and was forced to retreat behind Wall Rose.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.660
<i>Unknown are the names</i>
<i>of the flowers that have been trampled</i>

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:20.160
<i>Birds have fallen to the earth</i>
<i>and long for the wind</i>

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.250
<i>Prayers won't solve anything</i>

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.580
<i>Only the will to fight</i>
<i>can change the here and now!</i>

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.870
<i>O pigs who laugh at the resolve</i>
<i>to walk over corpses to move forward</i>

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.410
<i>Livestock complacency? False prosperity?</i>

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.290
<i>Give us the freedom of dying,</i>
<i>starving wolves!</i>

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.660
<i>The humiliation of being caged</i>
<i>is what triggers us to fight back</i>

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.950
<i>We hunters slaughter prey</i>
<i>beyond the castle walls,</i>

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.160
<i>consumed with surging bloodlust,</i>

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:04.120
<i>as our crimson bows and arrows</i>
<i>pierce scarlet holes into the twilight</i>

"Two years after joining the Cadets"

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.870
Pick up the pace! Run, you lead-footed laggards!

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.580
What's your problem, Arlelt?!

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.120
You're dragging your feet!

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.200
Too heavy for you?!
Maybe you'd prefer I let you drop your gear?!

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.450
If this were a real mission,
you'd be Titan food by now!

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.160
Damn...

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.620
Give it here!

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.500
You're gonna fail out at this rate!
We're being graded today!

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.580
But you'll get points marked off too if you do that...

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.870
Then make the grade without
getting found out! Before I change my mind!

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.750
Reiner Braun...

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.450
Stalwart in both mind and body,

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.250
and well-respected by his comrades.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.700
I refuse to be a burden! Even if it costs me my life!

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.330
Armin Arlelt.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.950
Although lacking in physical strength,

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.790
his aptitude in the classroom is extraordinary.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.910
Annie Leonhart.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.000
Her slice attacks are absolutely flawless,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.120
but her reclusive tendencies make her
a poor fit for coordinated efforts.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.790
Bertholdt Hoover.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.250
He possesses remarkable potential,
but lacks aggressiveness.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.950
Jean Kirschtein.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.000
Top-class omni-directional mobility.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.790
But his volatile personality
tends to cause friction with others.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.370
I can't slice as good as those two!

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.870
I'll just have to find the Titans before them!

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.580
If <i>anyone </i>gets into the Military Police...

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.000
...it'll be me!

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.830
Thanks for the help, Jean!

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.410
Following you was a good idea!

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.790
Hooray!

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.620
Sasha Braus.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.790
She has unconventionally good intuition,

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.080
but also demonstrates poor teamwork as a result.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.950
Conny Springer.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.120
He excels at executing quick turns,
but is also a bit dim-witted.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.700
Here they come.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.540
Damn! Shallower than Mikasa again!

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.540
Mikasa Ackermann.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.000
Completely proficient in every area.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.080
It's apt to say she's an unmatched,
unprecedented genius.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.700
Eren Jaeger.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.000
He has no real specialties,
but he's improved his grades

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.580
with his unparalleled effort.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.200
And he possesses twice
the sense of purpose than anyone else.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.450
Oww!

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.750
Sorry. I'm not good at holding back.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.290
Now it's your turn to be the rogue.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.120
What's the matter?

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.370
I don't get this training.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.410
Why would soldiers fight other people?

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.290
Only an idiot would take on a target barehanded.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.540
That's irresponsible thinking.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.500
We're soldiers.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.830
There are times we can't run away,
no matter how bad the situation is.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.500
No matter what the enemy is,
we have to be ready for it,

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.120
whether it means
using cannons or combat techniques.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.620
I believe that's the responsibility of a strong soldier.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.080
Anyway, look there.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.500
Oh, that's Annie.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.750
She's slacking off without
the commandant noticing again.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.660
All right, Eren. That slouch needs a talking-to.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.080
Let's teach her how a soldier's <i>supposed </i>to act.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.540
Huh?

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.330
Not fond of the commandant's head-butts?

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.950
If you don't wanna end up any shorter,

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.080
think back to when you first came here
and start taking things seriously.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.410
Hey, why are you being so rude?

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.330
Man, she's mad.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.000
I thought she looked scary enough as it is,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.620
but that's nothing compared to when she's pissed.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.540
All right! Get started, Eren!

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:25.950
Me?!

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.660
You know the drill, right, Annie?

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:35.910
Here I come!

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.290
Wh-What the...?!

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:44.250
She kicked my leg?!

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.790
Can I go now?

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:50.410
No! The drill's not over until you take the dagger!

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:52.950
Wait, Annie!

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:55.250
You're supposed to do this a certain way!

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.250
There.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:08.500
Now it's <i>your </i>turn to attack me.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.370
N-No... I'm not...

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.620
Do it, Reiner.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:16.700
I thought you wanted to teach her
about a soldier's responsibility?

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:24.870
Yeah. Sometimes a soldier <i>can't </i>back down.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.910
This is one of those times!

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.700
That's an amazing technique.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.160
Who did you learn it from?

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.450
My father.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:41.290
--Your <i>dad </i>came up with that move?
--What does it matter?

00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:44.540
There's no point to any of this.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.040
You mean this training?

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.500
We aren't graded on our hand-to-hand combat skills.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.540
Most people brush it off, like them.

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:57.410
Because only the top ten cadets
are allowed to join the Military Police

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:00.410
and serve in the interior.

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:05.040
The only ones who take it seriously
are naÃ¯ve idiots like you...

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.500
...or just ordinary idiots.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.330
Crap! The commandant!

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:16.370
For some reason, in this world,
the better you are at fighting Titans

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:18.950
the further you can get from them.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:21.540
How do you think this farce came about?

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.370
I don't know... That's a good question!

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:32.870
Maybe because it's human nature?

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.290
Anyway, I refuse to be stupid enough

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:46.830
to play "Soldier" in this inane world.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:53.080
Looks like you're not much of a warrior at all.

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:58.290
I was so caught up in getting stronger
that I never realized it.

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:01.120
It's such a clear contradiction...

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.160
They're honing their Titan-killing skills

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.120
just to get <i>away </i>from the Titans!

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.580
It can't be helped.

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:17.660
Before Wall Maria fell, only the Scouts
needed omni-directional mobility,

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.250
and they're a small regiment.

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:23.080
--That put ODM expertise at risk...
--Give it a strong blast for just a second.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:27.750
--...so this was a way to prevent its decline.
--Relying on inertia will save you gas.

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.580
Easier said than done.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:33.330
Yeah, maybe not <i>everyone </i>can pull it off...

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.830
...but there's no harm in knowing about it,

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:39.160
if you wanna join the Military Police.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.000
Yeah! I'd love to get in!

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.120
Working near the king...
There's no greater honor than that!

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.450
Hold on, Marco!

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:51.910
Quit talkin' like a goody-two-shoes
and say what you <i>really </i>think!

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:53.660
You wanna join the Military Police

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:57.200
'cause it means a safe, comfy life in the interior!

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.410
No! I really do want to--

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:01.370
It's comfy in the interior?

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:06.620
Until five years ago, <i>this </i>used to be the interior too.

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.580
What's your point, Eren?

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:14.080
Jean. You don't need to go to the interior.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.040
I'd say your head is nice
and spacious enough as it is.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:21.000
You little...

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.120
Honing your Titan-killing skills
to get <i>away </i>from the Titans...

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.160
Doesn't that seem like a weird system to you?

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.000
You only say that <i>now</i>?

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.830
I <i>want </i>that stupid system
to stay in place, for my sake.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:35.120
You piece of scum!

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.000
Shut up! This is the real world!

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.540
Eren! Quit it!

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.250
Stop that.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:46.450
--Screw you!
--Huh?!

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.120
Let go! You're gonna rip it!

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.200
I don't give a damn about your clothes! I'm jealous!

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.410
Huh?! What are you talking about?!

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:01.200
I see now...

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:06.040
He always has to take his feelings out on others...

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.660
Just like I always do.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.620
But not this time!

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.830
I'm going to use that move
to take control of the situation!

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.370
What the hell was that?!

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:30.700
A combat technique I learned the hard way

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.370
while <i>you </i>were screwing around.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.080
A carefree, capricious life
is your idea of the real world?

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:43.000
And you honestly call yourself a soldier?!

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.950
I heard a loud sound just now...

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:58.000
Would anyone care to explain?

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:06.040
--It was Sasha. She passed gas.
--Huh?!

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:08.250
<i>You </i>again?

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.250
Learn some decency, will you?!

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:26.700
218 cadets went on to reach graduation.

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.790
Give your hearts!

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.580
Yes, Sir!

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:38.620
You have three options
after you graduate from the Cadets today!

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:42.790
The Garrison Regiment,
which reinforces the walls and protects each city!

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:44.830
The Scout Regiment, which risks life and limb

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:47.250
to venture into Titan territory outside the walls!

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:50.330
And the Military Police Regiment,
which serves under the king

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:52.540
by policing the people and preserving order!

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:55.660
Of course, the only ones
allowed to join the Military Police

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.790
are the top ten cadets who were previously named!

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.580
We've finally made it here...

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.910
Now it's <i>our </i>turn

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:13.200
to devour the Titans!

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:30.700
Yes!

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.410
Now I'm gonna be in the Military Police!

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:35.450
No more worrying about food!

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:38.540
How'd I get ranked under Eren?!

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.450
Damn!

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:43.450
Are you seriously not gonna join
the Military Police Regiment, Eren?!

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:46.370
Even after you got into the top ten and all?!

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:49.080
My mind was set from the very start.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:53.000
I didn't train all this time to live in the interior.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.160
I did it to fight the Titans.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.830
We can't beat them!

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:05.080
You know how many tens of thousands
of people have been eaten so far...

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:09.660
The answer was clear
after we lost 20% of our population.

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:13.910
Humanity <i>can't </i>beat the Titans.

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:20.870
So?

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.790
You're gonna give up
because you think we can't win?!

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:30.040
--Well...
--Yes, humanity<i> has </i>lost so far.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:33.500
That's because we were clueless about the Titans!

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.580
Material warfare is useless against them.

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:42.040
We lost, but the information we gained
in battle will lead to further hope!

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:45.040
Are we just going to throw away
all the advances in fighting techniques

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:49.040
that cost us tens of thousands of lives
so we can be Titan fodder?!

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.040
The hell with that!

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.750
I'm going to drive out every last Titan

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:57.160
and leave these cramped walls!

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.370
That's my dream!

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:03.250
Humanity hasn't <i>truly </i>been defeated yet!

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:13.160
Wait, Eren!

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.830
If you wanna go outside the walls, be my guest!

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:19.830
<i>I'm </i>gonna join the Military Police!

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:32.870
Eren. That stuff about your dream just now...

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:35.540
Yeah, I borrowed those ideas of yours

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.200
about going outside instead of staying inside.

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.580
I'm going to join the Scout Regiment!

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:45.120
Are you serious, Armin?!

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.450
You were the top in classroom studies!
You should put that to use!

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:52.200
I <i>won't </i>be a burden. Even if it costs me my life.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.620
I'll join the Scouts too.

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:58.580
Hey! You graduated top of the class!
You should join the Military Police!

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:03.660
If you join the Military Police, then I will too.

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:08.450
If you join the Garrison Regiment, then I will too.

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:13.120
Because you'll die an early death unless I'm around.

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:16.370
I never asked for your help.

00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:19.500
I don't want to lose any more of my family.

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:45.200
It's here! The main unit of the Scout Regiment!

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.870
Commander Erwin! Give those Titans a real thrashing!

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:53.160
Look! It's Captain Levi!

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.250
They say he's as mighty as an entire brigade!

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:58.700
Ugh. Talk about annoying...

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.000
This is nothing like five years ago!

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.450
People actually feel hopeful about the Scout members!

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:07.410
Yeah, everyone's cheered up since then.

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:09.660
Nothing's happened in five years.

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.040
They've upgraded the mounted cannons too.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.620
I doubt the Colossal Titan will show up anymore.

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:15.950
Yeah!

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:18.580
That's a load of crap, you idiotic couple!

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:21.250
Wh-What? <i>Us</i>, a married couple?

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:23.160
You're getting ahead of yourself, Eren!

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.620
Hey, guys!

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.160
Mr. Hannes!

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.040
Heard you graduated yesterday.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.540
Man, you brats have really matured.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.080
You too, Mr. Hannes!

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.790
You used to be a drunk, but now
you're chief of the Corps of Engineers.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:40.410
Oh, you!

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:46.950
I'm sorry I couldn't save your mom.

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:51.450
It wasn't your fault.

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:54.080
We're not ignorant anymore.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.750
We won't let another tragedy like that happen.

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:59.910
We <i>will </i>defeat the Titans!

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:08.620
I don't know if I should be happy
that you've grown up or not...

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:10.540
Don't go dyin', now.

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:13.540
Huh?!

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:15.620
You're joining the Scouts?!

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:18.290
Conny! You were so set on the Military Police!

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:21.410
Yeah, I was! But...

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:24.290
Sounds like your speech yesterday won him over!

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:25.500
Huh?!

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.910
M-Mind your own business!

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:29.830
I decided it on my own!

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:32.410
Don't be so embarrassed.

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:34.040
You're not the only one.

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:37.080
Thomas...

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.370
You don't mean...?

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:41.160
Umm, everyone?

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:44.870
I brought some meat from the officers' storehouse!

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:48.580
Sasha! Do you <i>want </i>to end up
in solitary confinement?!

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:50.120
You really <i>are </i>crazy!

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:51.950
So much it's scary...

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:54.540
We can all share it later...

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.950
All sliced up, and between some bread...

00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:00.160
--Go put it back!
--Yeah!

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:03.830
After we lost all that land,
meat's become really valuable.

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:05.660
It'll be fine!

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:13.870
We can just raise more cattle and sheep
once we retake our land!

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:20.200
I'll have some of the meat too!

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.870
M-Me too! Save me some!

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:26.160
I'll have some too, of course!

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.120
Guys...

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.250
Why are you just standing there, Eren?

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:33.160
We'll get found out if we don't get back to work!

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.000
Lunch isn't for a while!

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:44.660
Five years have passed since then...

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:50.000
Humanity is finally regaining its dignity.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.750
We can win!

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:57.000
Humanity's fight back...

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.660
...is just beginning!

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.160
Oww! Hot!

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.290
Wh-What the...?!

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:31.080
Samuel!

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.620
Sasha!

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:41.620
Samuel!

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:44.330
Stay still!

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:46.000
That was close!

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:50.120
The wall...

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.750
It's broken!

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:55.250
It's happening again!

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:57.620
The Titans are going to get in!

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:02.750
I'm going to drive out...

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:06.250
...every last one!

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:09.910
Every... last one...

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.040
Mounted Cannon Maintenance Squad 4!

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.910
Prepare for battle!

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:19.790
The target is the Colossal Titan dead ahead!

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:23.120
This is our chance! <i>Don't </i>let it get away!

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:34.080
Hey, there.

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.250
It's been five years since we met.

00:22:55.830 --> 00:23:00.950
<i>Your dreams are where your heart is</i>

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:07.200
<i>They're more fragile than life itself</i>

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:11.870
<i>Over and over you cast them aside,</i>
<i>only to find more</i>

00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:18.540
<i>Now, rest in peace</i>

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:29.870
<i>Pounding impulses defile the things we wish for</i>

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:40.160
<i>and the more we forget</i>
<i>the more we remember again</i>

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:46.120
<i>In this beautiful, cruel world</i>

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:51.290
<i>all I can do is ask why we're still alive</i>

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:57.000
<i>Oh, with our strength--and our weakness--</i>

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.660
<i>what are we going to protect if there's no sense</i>

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:06.080
<i>to anything anymore?</i>

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:16.410
Hell opens its mouth once more.

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:20.910
Titans devour the soldiers
before they can even catch their breaths.

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:24.750
Amid this, Eren saves Armin
from the brink of death, but...

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:26.410
"First Battle"
"The Struggle for Trost, Part 1"
