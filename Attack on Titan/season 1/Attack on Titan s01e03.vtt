<i>O pigs who laugh at the resolve</i>

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.450
<i>Livestock complacency? False prosperity?</i>

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.330
<i>Give us the freedom of dying,</i>

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.700

"A Dim Light Amid Despair"

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.370
Hey, you!

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.450
Sir!

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.080
Who the hell are you?!

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.290
Armin Arlelt, from Shiganshina District!

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.540
I see! That's a ridiculous name!
Did your parents give it to you?!

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.450
My grandfather did, Sir!

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.290
Arlelt! Why are you here?!

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.330
To help humanity achieve victory!

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.500
That's wonderful to hear!
We can feed you to the Titans!

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.410
Third row, about face!

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.120
Who the hell are you?!

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.080
Sir! Thomas Wagner, from Trost District!

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.410
I can't hear you!

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.000
--Thomas Wagner--
--Can't hear you!

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
--Look at them go.
--Go practice in a barn!

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.080
You went through the same thing
when you started as a cadet, didn't you?

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.540
It takes me back.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.790
No! You're from a pigsty!
You're less than livestock!

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.000
Yes, Sir! I am less than livestock!

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.040
--No!
--But what's all that intimidation for?

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.700
It's a rite of passage.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.000
We revert them to a blank slate
through the use of self-denial,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.700
after which we mold them into proper soldiers.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.580
--Change it at once! Why are you here?!
--This is one step in that process.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.870
To devote myself to humankind!

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.830
Fourth row, about face!

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.250
There are some he's not talking to...

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.200
It's unnecessary for those who've
already been through their rites of passage.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.290
They most likely witnessed the hell
that took place two years ago.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.540
They have a different look on their faces.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.080
Okay. Let's go.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.450
Who the hell are you?!

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.750
Jean Kirschtein, from Trost District!

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.500
Why are you here?!

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.700
To join the Military Police Regiment
and live in the interior!

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.000
Oh. You wanna live in the interior, do you?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.500
Yes!

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.700
Who said you could sit?!

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.700
If you can't handle <i>this</i>,
you can forget about the Military Police!

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.290
Who the hell are you?! Why are you here?!

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.620
Marco Bodt of Jinae, on the south side of Wall Rose!

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.870
I want to join the Military Police Regiment
and give life and limb to the king!

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.660
I see.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.540
That's a fine goal, indeed. Go ahead and strive for it.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.410
But, just so you know...

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.160
The king doesn't <i>want </i>your lousy life or limbs.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.870
You're next! Who the hell are you?!

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.000
Conny Springer!

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.160
I'm from Ragako Village
on the south side of Wall Rose!

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.200
You have it backwards, Conny Springer!

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.200
It was the first thing you were taught!

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.290
This salute expresses your resolve
to give your heart to the people!

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.370
Is your heart on your right side?!

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.870
Hey, you.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.790
What do you think you're doing?

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.500
I'm talking to <i>you</i>! Who the hell are you?!

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.540
Sasha Braus from Dauper Village,
on the south side of Wall Rose!

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.700
Sasha Braus...

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.870
What is that you're holding in your right hand?

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.580
A steamed potato, Sir!

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.290
I found one in the cookhouse
that was ready to eat, so I couldn't help myself!

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.660
You <i>stole </i>it?

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.080
Why?

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.750
Why did you decide to eat it <i>now</i>?

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.950
I felt it would be a waste to let it get cold,

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.000
so I elected to eat it now.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.950
No, I don't understand.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.700
<i>Why </i>did you eat the potato?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.080
Are you asking me why people eat potatoes, Sir?

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.500
Here's half of it for you.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.330
Half...?

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.950
Whoa. He <i>still </i>has Potato Girl running.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.200
Man, she's been at it for five solid hours.
She's really something.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.790
Still, being told to run
until she's on the verge of death

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:05.330
didn't seem to bother her quite as much
as being told she has to skip meals.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:11.620
Dauper's a small hunting village
in the mountains, isn't it?

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:12.910
What's that?

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:17.000
They're dropouts. They asked
to work in the fields instead.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.120
Whoa. It's only the first day, too...

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.830
That's just how it is. If you
can't cut it here, you have to leave.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.330
I can't believe anyone would <i>want</i>
to pick up rocks and pull plants again...

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.250
Come to think of it, we haven't heard
anything about where you're from.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.580
I'm from Shiganshina, same as him.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.870
Oh. That means...

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.870
You were there that day, weren't you?

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.080
H-Hey!

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.870
Did you see the Colossal Titan?!

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.950
Y-Yeah...

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:54.450
<i>Yes</i>, I saw it.

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:55.660
Really?!

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.580
How big is it?!

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.620
Enough to look over the wall.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.540
What?! I heard it stepped <i>over </i>the wall!

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:03.540
Me too!

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.370
That's what they said in my village too!

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.250
No, it wasn't that big.

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.290
What did it look like?!

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:14.290
It had a huge mouth, and almost no skin.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.250
What about the Armored Titan
that broke Wall Maria?!

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:21.790
That's what people call it, but it
looked like an ordinary Titan to me.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.580
Th-Then, what are ordinary Titans like?!

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.290
Let's spare him the questions, everyone.

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.620
I'm sure there are things
he doesn't want to remember.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:39.790
Sorry for asking--

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:41.660
It's not like that!

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.830
Titans aren't actually that big of a deal!

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:53.080
Once we've mastered omni-directional mobility gear,

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.120
they'll be nothing to us!

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.120
We <i>finally </i>get to train as soldiers.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.080
I was just overcome with emotion, that's all.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:05.330
I'm going to join the Scout Regiment
and drive the Titans out of this world!

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:06.790
I'm gonna slaughter them!

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:09.330
Whoa, what are you, crazy?

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:13.330
Did you just say you're gonna join
the Scout Regiment?

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.660
Yeah, that's right.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.370
Aren't you the one
who wants to join the Military Police

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.290
and live the easy life?

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:22.700
I'm all about being honest, you see.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.330
It's much nicer than being,
say, a loser who acts tough

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.790
but is actually scared shitless.

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:31.450
Are you talking about me?!

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:33.410
S-Stop...!

00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:34.750
Come on, now.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.450
It makes no difference to me.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.250
Look, I'm sorry.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.700
I don't mean to dismiss your ideas.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.620
Let's be friends.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.410
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.040
H-Hey, you!

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.250
Uhh, err, umm...

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:22.660
I've just never seen anyone
who looks like you before...

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:24.950
S-Sorry!

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:27.620
You have very pretty black hair.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.080
Thanks.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.330
It's no big deal. Get off my back.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.290
You never think things through
when you get worked up.

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.200
That again?

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.080
Anyway, don't you think your hair's too long?

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.700
It could cause an accident
during ODM training, you know.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.660
All right. I'll cut it.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.620
But how short should I make it?

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:06.040
H-Hey! Don't mess with other people's clothes!

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.830
What did you wipe on me?!

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.950
My trust in others...

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:18.450
Finally... done...

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:40.540
This is...!

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:41.370
Bread!

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:45.620
It's not much, but I saved it for you.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:47.330
Oh, but...

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.580
You really ought to drink some water first.

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:54.500
--Are you God?!
--Huh?!

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.870
--Are you?!
--Uhh--!

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:57.160
God!

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.450
Hey. What are you two doing?

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:06.040
Umm, she's been running
non-stop all this time, so...

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.330
So you're trying to do something "nice," huh?

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:10.620
Huh?!

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:18.700
Did you do it for Potato Girl's sake?

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:22.200
Was what you gained worth the effort it took?

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:28.200
Well, whatever.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.250
Let's just get her to her bed now.

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.370
Are you trying to be nice, too?

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:38.750
I'm doing this so that she'll owe me.

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:41.330
Her stupidity will come in very handy.

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:48.370
We'll begin by determining your aptitude!

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:51.660
If you can't do this, you're not even fit to be bait!

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.700
You'll be sent off to the fields!

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.660
These are only just the bare fundamentals.

00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:00.910
Still, you can determine a person's knack
for omni-mobility at this stage.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.830
Observe.

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:06.080
Completely steady.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.870
She knows exactly what to do and how to do it.

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:13.160
That's what aptitude is all about.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.080
It looks like we have many talented cadets this year.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.870
Umm, what about him?

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:21.910
Now <i>that's </i>the very definition of aptitude.

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:24.250
Some people might have plenty of motivation...

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:27.500
...yet turn out to be less-than-capable.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.450
What are you doing, Eren Jaeger?!

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:31.250
Straighten yourself up!

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:34.000
What the...?!

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.870
How do I work this thing?!

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.410
This can't be for real...

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.000
Just follow the basics and you'll be able to do it.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.500
Don't think about being fancy or anything.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.950
Focus on your front and back balance,

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:02.580
then slowly place your weight
into the belts on your waist and feet.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:06.620
You can do it if you stay calm.
Even I did it, after all.

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.580
All right. I feel like I've got it this time.

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.370
Lift me up, Armin.

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:27.830
Hey, Daz.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:32.870
Isn't he the one who said he was
gonna slaughter all the Titans yesterday?

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:35.910
I guess it's off to the fields for him tomorrow.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:38.500
Yeah, we can't afford to feed the useless.

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:41.000
Eren!

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.250
There's no point worrying about it.

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:46.080
You can just learn to do it tomorrow.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.000
I'm pathetic...

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.660
There's no way I can wipe them out like this...

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.790
You should just forget about that altogether.

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:56.450
What?!

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:59.540
I'm saying you should give up trying to be a soldier.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:03.450
Fighting isn't about simply throwing your life away.

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:07.750
Hey, now! I saw what happened that day!

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.750
Do you really think
you can just convince me to quit?!

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:13.750
Still, it doesn't matter <i>how </i>determined you are.

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:16.250
Huh? Why not?!

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:20.540
Because <i>you </i>don't get to decide
if you're fit to be a soldier or not.

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.160
--I'm not saying you should return...
--Let's go, Armin.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.370
--...to the fields by yourself.
--Y-Yeah.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:34.540
You don't need to worry.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:38.540
Because when you go, I'll go with you.

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:46.120
So, umm... What you're saying is...

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:49.330
...that I can have that?

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:09.950
The trick to posture control?

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:14.000
Sorry, but I'm gifted. All I can tell you is to "feel" it.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.250
If anything, I'd like to hear <i>your </i>trick

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:21.450
for staying sane after
putting on such a pathetic spectacle.

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:25.200
C'mon, guys! I'm begging you here!

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:31.200
But didn't you say yesterday,
"If you can't cut it here, you have to leave"?

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:35.830
Or, wait. Was it, "If you don't got talent,
you have to leave"?

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:37.700
Which was it again?

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:41.660
Please! I heard you're both really good at it!

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.450
Bertholdt! Reiner!

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:48.290
Sorry, but I don't think there <i>are</i>
any tricks to just hanging there.

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:51.700
I can't think of any especially helpful advice, either.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:52.870
Oh...

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:55.200
I guess we'll just have to hope for the best tomorrow.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.790
You two are, umm, from Shiganshina, aren't you?

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:02.330
Yeah...

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:05.540
Then you <i>know </i>how terrifying the Titans are.

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.870
So why do you want to be soldiers?

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:16.450
Unlike Eren, I didn't witness
the Titan threat firsthand.

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:17.700
It's just...

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.830
I decided I couldn't sit there
and do nothing after the royal government

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:24.660
forced people into
that absolutely awful retrieval operation.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.200
Oh.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.870
Where are you two from?

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:31.500
Reiner and I are from a mountain village

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.910
on the southeast side of Wall Maria.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.000
Huh?! Wasn't that...?

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.330
Yeah.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.620
Unlike the prosperous towns along the river,

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:42.290
we didn't receive word right away.

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:47.120
The Titans showed up
well before the information did.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.580
It happened at dawn.

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:52.160
The livestock were acting up,

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:56.450
and these strange rumblings
kept getting louder and louder.

00:16:56.450 --> 00:17:01.290
At some point, I realized
they were footfalls of some sort...

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:04.870
And then, when I hurriedly opened the window...

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.410
After that... I, umm, don't really remember.

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:20.120
Everyone was in such a panic...

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:23.830
Hey, now. What are you
suddenly bringin' that up for?

00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:25.370
Sorry.

00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:28.290
Basically, what I was trying to say

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:32.370
is that you guys probably aren't like them.

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:33.450
"Them"?

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:36.950
The others here who don't know
the horror of the Titans.

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:38.200
Hey!

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:50.500
They're mostly here for show;
to live up to society's expectations.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:54.370
You're seen as a coward if you choose
production work when you turn twelve.

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:57.160
Society has pushed them into becoming cadets.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:03.000
That said, I'm no different than them.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.500
I chose to be a soldier
in the hopes of joining the Military Police

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.910
so I could work in the safety of the interior.

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:12.120
If that doesn't work out, I might give up entirely.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:16.080
I don't have any will to call my own, you see.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:20.790
Cherishing your life <i>is </i>admirable too, you know.

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:25.290
As for me...

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:27.870
I'm going to return to the hometown we lost.

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:30.120
That's all I care about now.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.580
I <i>will </i>do it, no matter what.

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:38.870
What about you?

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.830
Why do <i>you </i>want to be a soldier?

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.370
I...

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:52.700
I decided I have to kill them.

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:56.620
I decided I have to slaughter all the Titans

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.450
with my own two hands.

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:08.000
So, your encounter with the Titans
<i>didn't </i>break your will?

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.080
That's right...

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.080
But <i>now </i>it's a question of whether or not

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.790
I'm actually cut out to be a soldier.

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:36.080
Start over from scratch,
starting with your belt adjustment.

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.950
You'll do just fine tomorrow.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:41.250
I'm certain of it.

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:44.290
Eren Jaeger, was it?

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:46.910
Yeah. Thanks.

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:49.450
Reiner Braun, right?

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:02.330
Eren Jaeger. Are you ready?

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:03.540
Yes, Sir!

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:06.750
I'm going to do it! I am!

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:09.790
I might not have raw aptitude,

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:13.370
but no one has more guts than I do!

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:14.870
Begin!

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:24.250
The hell with logic!

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:26.120
I know it's completely baseless!

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:29.160
But guts are all I got!

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.250
They're...

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:33.160
...my weapon!

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:39.080
I did it!

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.660
I'm doing it!

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:51.750
N-Not yet!

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.410
I can still do it!

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:57.370
Let him down.

00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:04.790
I-I'm...!

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:08.870
Wagner. Switch belts with Jaeger.

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:10.290
Y-Yes, Sir!

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.660
Your equipment was defective.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:24.910
The belt you were using had a broken clasp.

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:28.250
I've never heard of this part breaking before;

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:31.500
I guess we'll have to add it
to the maintenance checklist.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:35.250
Then, even with broken equipment,
he still managed to...?!

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:36.950
Whoa!

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:40.700
Th-Then, am I fit to be a soldier?!

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:43.870
You pass muster. Train hard!

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:47.580
I did it! I did it!

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:50.830
Whadya think of that, Mikasa?! I can do it!

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:53.330
I can fight the Titans!

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:56.540
You can finally stop mollycoddling me!

00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:00.040
Looks like things worked out for him.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.410
His eyes say, "What do you think of that?!"

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:03.580
No.

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:10.160
He feels relieved that
he doesn't have to leave me now.

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:15.000
Grisha...

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.830
Today, your son has become a soldier.

00:22:55.910 --> 00:23:00.830
<i>Your dreams are where your heart is</i>

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:07.080
<i>They're more fragile than life itself</i>

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:11.790
<i>Over and over you cast them aside,</i>
<i>only to find more</i>

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:18.500
<i>Now, rest in peace</i>

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:29.580
<i>Pounding impulses defile the things we wish for</i>

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:40.120
<i>and the more we forget</i>
<i>the more we remember again</i>

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:46.080
<i>In this beautiful, cruel world</i>

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:51.370
<i>all I can do is ask why we're still alive</i>

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:57.000
<i>Oh, with our strength--and our weakness--</i>

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.540
<i>what are we going to protect if there's no sense</i>

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:07.120
<i>to anything anymore?</i>

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:15.450
After graduating from the Cadets,

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:19.370
Eren sees humanity and its regained dignity.

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:21.200
"We can beat the Titans."

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.200
The moment he feels certain of this,
humanity is reminded yet again...

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:26.370
"The Night of the Closing Ceremony"
"Humanity's Comeback, Part 2"
