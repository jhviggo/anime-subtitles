00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.200
That's it, Annie!

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.250
I'd expect no less
from my daughter!

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.660
What are you doing, Annie?!
No resting!

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.160
"Wall Sina" "Eastern fortified city"
You mean you haven't heard?

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.160
The Titan boy and the
big shots in charge of him

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.790
"Stohess District"
are apparently being called to the capital.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.700
And they're passing
through this city today.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.950
I see.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.160
Sounds like he'll get dissection
for sure this time around.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.000
Whatever the case, I just hope
he passes through without a hitch

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.250
and has the gate
shut firmly behind him.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.660
Did you just
mention sealing the gate?!

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.620
You would suggest that we
defile the walls even further?!

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.540
Maria! Rose! Sina!

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.410
To defile the three goddesses is to
commit an unpardonable transgression!

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.040
They love and worship
the walls as gods.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.040
Don't get involved.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.120
Man. They're still around, huh?

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.410
Damn...

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.290
Our only protectors are the walls!

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.660
"Stohess District"
"Military Police Branch"

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.750
You're <i>finally </i>up.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.040
You look so totally scary when you're
asleep that I couldn't wake you up.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.950
Sorry, Annie.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.540
You've been slacking a lot lately.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.290
What's this? Are you mad already?

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.290
She's antisocial, all right.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.790
Just leave her be.
She came here from Trost.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.950
She's the only one
here who's seen real action.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.160
It'll take time for her to recuperate.
She's just been through hell.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.750
Ah, I get it!

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.370
You have a thing for her!

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.870
What can you possibly
like about this girl?

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.200
Hitch.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.450
There's only one way a ditz like
you could get into the Military Police.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.790
Oh? Whatever do you mean by that?

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:02.660
--Say it to my face.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.500
--Enough, you two!
--Say it to my face.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.660
Oh, take it easy, guys.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.330
I have actual work for you today,
instead of the usual odd jobs.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.540
That's why I called you here.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.910
It's to do with the Scout Regiment
group being summoned to the capital.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.250
They're passing through
this town's main street today.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.950
Military Police HQ will be
serving as their security escorts,

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.540
so we need only assist
while they pass through.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.910
Omni-directional mobility within
city limits is temporarily authorized.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.620
You'll follow beside the
convoy and help bolster security.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.370
You'll also head to
the starting point by barge.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.910
That is all.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.660
May I ask something, Sir?

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.790
Hmm? What is it?

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.200
What are we supposed
to protect the convoy from?

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.540
I've never heard of <i>anyone </i>inside
this wall defying the royal government.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.540
There may be petty criminals,

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.040
but I can't imagine actual
organizations trying anything

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.250
unless they're based
outside the wall...

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.160
I'm not even sure
what motive they'd have.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.410
Oh, you're a serious one!

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.410
You're in charge now.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.000
The details are all in here.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.410
Huh?

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.910
We officers are busy enough as it is.

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.750
Prove that you can handle this yourselves.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.870
But no screw-ups. Got it?

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.250
Sorry to keep you waiting!
Shall we continue?

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.870
Whose turn is it again?

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.000
Damn! This is messed up!

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.290
Yeah, this organization's
way more rotten than I'd imagined.

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:48.330
Well, that <i>is </i>why I chose it,

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.790
but you get stuck doing all the
work when you're a rookie here...

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.120
Man, why didn't anyone tell me?

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.580
Bastard...

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.250
All he can think about is himself!

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.120
Huh? What are you talking about, Marlo?

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.160
Choosing to join the Military Police
makes you no different from him.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.080
No. I'm nothing like you degenerates.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.580
I came here to <i>fix </i>the Military Police!

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.750
Wow, Marlo!

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.120
I never took you for that sorta guy!

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.450
How are you gonna fix it?

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.870
By getting to the top, of course.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.290
Once I'm at the top, I'll fix the rules

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:34.160
and make the dishonest
pay fairly for their injustices.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.830
It's that simple!

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.120
I'll simply turn them back
into normal people. That's all.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.950
Back into the people
they're supposed to be.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.250
Oh, man! You're the real deal!

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.500
Sorry! I originally took
you for a stick-in-the-mud!

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.330
That's quite the noble goal.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.910
Good luck with that.

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.330
I wonder.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.660
If a do-gooder like you took charge,

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.080
I think <i>that </i>would spell the end for us.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.040
Oh, so you <i>can </i>talk?

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.200
I think you're an honest person.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.540
Because you say honest things.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.120
I know there <i>are </i>people like that.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.500
It takes a lot of courage
to go against the flow.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.120
I respect that.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.540
It could just be that
you're all fools, though.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
No, maybe <i>they </i>are,
but don't lump me in with them!

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:39.040
Enough of this chit-chat. Let's go!

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:48.250
The escort wagons will pass through
the outer gate in forty-five minutes.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:52.040
When we get there, find your positions.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.040
--Understood?
--Yeah, yeah...

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.950
Hey, now!

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:03.410
What's that?

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:05.330
That's <i>our </i>equipment!

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.040
Must be taking it into the interior.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:11.700
Still, it's strange for the merchant
association to be involved.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.330
Just what are they...?

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:24.830
They're illegally selling
government-issued equipment?!

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.790
Hey, now! What about
our assignment?!

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:32.120
Oh, man! He's the genuine article!

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.750
Well, for better or worse, we <i>do </i>have time.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.290
This'll make for some nice entertainment.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.950
So, how about a drink?

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.450
Yeah? What do you want, rookie?

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:57.370
I-It's against the law to
sell government property.

00:08:57.950 --> 00:08:59.370
So?

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:05.120
Government property is paid for
by the citizens' hard-earned tax money.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.540
Therefore--!

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:12.000
Wow, a rookie blackmailing
his superior officers...

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.450
You got a bright future in store, you do.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:20.830
Go get yourself a girl or
somethin' and refresh yourself.

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:22.620
Wha...?!

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.040
W-Wait!

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.910
It's against the law to sell--

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.620
Hey!

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:58.290
You're under arrest for a treasonable
offense against a superior.

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:00.620
D-Don't be stupid...
Such disrespect for the law...

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.250
...is perfectly acceptable.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.500
Here, anyway!

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.120
I think that's enough, don't you?

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.160
So sorry about that!

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.290
It seems our idiot has caused you trouble...

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:20.620
We'll teach him a lesson, don't you worry!

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.080
Or...

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.830
...would you prefer to have an
even bigger problem on your hands?

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.870
Just this once.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:33.290
Yes, Sir!

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:41.500
--Now, let's get that drink.
--Yeah. I'd say we earned it.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:53.910
Go on.

00:10:55.290 --> 00:11:00.950
You're going to make the dishonest
pay for their injustices, right?

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:04.750
I'm not against helping
you out with that...

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.450
Damn it!

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.750
You're certainly a hard worker, Missy!

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:26.620
Oh, no, you're too kind!

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.950
Those people you know...

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:37.330
Those fools you mentioned earlier...
Would they have done it?

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.330
They might have.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:48.750
You mentioned going against the flow...

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:55.330
I guess I'm just another piece
of scum being swept away by it.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:56.950
I don't know.

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:03.330
But maybe that's just
the way ordinary people are?

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.120
Personally...

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:10.410
Even if it means being a
weakling swept up in the flow,

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:13.290
being seen as a person is all I want.

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:38.160
Annie.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.580
Hi.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.870
Looks like you're
a full-fledged MP now.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:57.790
Armin...

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.750
Why are you dressed like that?

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:15.830
I'm a cargo carrier.

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:20.410
I'm hiding ODM equipment
under this rain gear.

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:21.830
See?

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:24.290
What is this about?

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:26.120
Annie.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.620
Could you help us let Eren escape?

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.580
Escape to where?

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.870
Defying the government's orders...

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.040
Where <i>is </i>there to run inside these walls?

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.580
We just need to hide him for a while.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:41.830
We won't be explicitly
rebelling against the government;

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:45.750
it'll basically be an act of defiance
by part of the Scout Regiment.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:49.250
We're going to buy enough time
to gather some things

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:53.700
that will unquestionably overturn
the council's say in the matter.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.910
Overturn it?

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:59.910
There's really something that handy?
How are you so sure?

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.580
I'm sorry. I can't say.

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.620
Sorry, but I can't accept.

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.910
I won't tell anyone, though.
Good luck.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:16.080
Annie!

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.330
Please!

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:20.120
They're going to kill Eren!

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:23.120
A bunch of people who know nothing

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.290
are unwittingly pushing humanity
toward the brink of self-extinction

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:29.370
simply to save their own necks!

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:32.700
I realize it sounds less than convincing.

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:37.330
But, even so, we have no
choice but to bet everything now!

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:41.950
Of course, we'll try
hard not to cause you trouble.

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:45.950
But we absolutely need the
Military Police's help

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:49.250
to sneak him through
Wall Sina's security checkpoint.

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:51.950
This is our only option left.

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:54.910
Tell me.

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:58.370
Do I look like that
good of a person to you?

00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:59.910
A good person...

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:01.910
Actually...

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:05.950
I've never been fond
of phrasing it that way.

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:08.410
Because, to me,
it feels like it's only used

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:13.500
to refer to people you
use for your own convenience.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:18.000
And I don't think there's
anyone who's convenient to everyone.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.450
Which is why, if you do say no to this...

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:27.950
...that'd make you a bad person in my eyes.

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.000
Okay.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.580
I'll do it.

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:07.700
We got through surprisingly easily...

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:08.870
Shh!

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:10.950
That's the mighty Military Police for you.

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:13.040
Goes to show what kind of work they do...

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.200
Don't look around at everything.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.330
Let's just hope they haven't
realized Jean took my place.

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:21.250
That definitely won't last for long.

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:24.790
He and I look nothing alike.

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:26.290
It'll be fine.

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:30.500
You both have the same
sort of mean, nasty look to you.

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.500
I don't have his horseface!

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:33.540
Say...

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:35.910
How were you planning to get over the wall

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:38.660
if I hadn't agreed to help?

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:41.790
We were going to barge through using ODM.

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:43.120
That's crazy.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.450
Couldn't you have just
escaped before reaching Stohess

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:49.620
to avoid all this trouble in the first place?

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:52.080
Why'd it have to be here and now?

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.290
I felt this town's complex layout

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:58.250
would make our body double
ploy more likely to succeed.

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:01.790
Plus, acting dutifully and
keeping their defenses down

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:06.790
will buy us far more time to escape
than head-on opposition would.

00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:11.500
I see. Good point.

00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:16.700
Oh! Over there!

00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:26.950
Here?

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:29.790
Yeah. We're going through here.

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:34.750
It's what's left of an underground
city they were planning to make.

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:40.040
It leads to the vicinity of the outer gate.

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.870
Really? That's amazing.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.540
Annie?

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.330
Oh, man.

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:50.620
Don't tell me you're afraid of dark,
cramped places or something...

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:54.870
Yes. I am.

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:58.500
I doubt a brave, suicidal maniac like you

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:02.830
would understand how a delicate damsel feels.

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:10.160
Any damsel who can flip a grown man
upside down isn't weak at all.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.790
Cut the crap! Let's hurry!

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:15.080
No. I'm not going.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.160
I'm afraid to go down there.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.750
I'm not helping unless we
stay above ground.

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:34.620
Quit being stupid! Just get down here!

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:35.660
Stop screwing around!

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.160
Eren! Don't shout!

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.540
I'm sure it's fine, Mikasa.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:45.000
Because, for some reason,
this whole area...

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.910
...has been completely
deserted for a while.

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:58.450
Man... That really hurts.

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:06.830
At what point did you
start looking at me that way...

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:08.290
...Armin?

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:10.790
Annie...

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:15.700
Why did you have Marco's ODM gear?

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:23.120
It had all the same scrapes and bumps...

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:28.660
I could tell, because I'd
helped him do maintenance on it.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:30.080
Yes...

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:34.450
I found it and took it.

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:40.160
Then, those two Titans we captured alive...

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.750
Was it <i>you </i>who killed them?

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:43.830
Who knows.

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:46.450
But if that's what you
suspected one month ago,

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:48.750
why didn't you do anything then?

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:51.500
Even now I can hardly believe it...

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:55.200
I just... wanted to believe
I had it all wrong...

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.200
That's why I didn't...

00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:02.120
Still... Back then...

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:06.500
The fact you didn't kill me back then...

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:10.540
...<i>is </i>why we're in this situation now.

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:22.620
Yeah... I agree with all my heart.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:27.200
I never imagined you'd
end up cornering me like this.

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:35.290
Why <i>didn't </i>I do anything then...?

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:37.040
Hold on, Annie!

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.750
There's still a chance
you're going along with all this

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:44.290
as part of some horrible, idiotic joke!

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:46.200
Just get down here!

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:50.500
There's something you can
prove just by coming down here!

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.370
Come down here and prove it!

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:55.200
I can't go down there.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.040
I'm a failed warrior.

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:01.000
I'm being serious here!
This isn't funny!

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.250
Talk to us, Annie!

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:04.580
We can still discuss this as--

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.000
Enough.

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:08.700
I can't listen to any more of this.

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:11.080
It's pointless.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:15.580
I'm going to carve you up again...

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.580
...Female Titan!

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.290
Armin...

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:49.160
It's nice I could be
a "good person" for you.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.790
For now, you've won your bet.

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:56.700
But...

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:58.790
...<i>my </i>bet...

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:00.250
...begins now!

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:14.830
Eren!

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.200
Mikasa?!

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.830
It's too late...

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:57.750
<i>If, by chance, I'm not me</i>

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:03.000
<i>then who's to say that you're you?</i>

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.290
<i>Can you pick up the pieces of your heart</i>

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:13.410
<i>that fell apart like a broken sand castle?</i>

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:18.410
<i>The voice of someone calling out</i>

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:22.500
<i>changed into ringing in my ears</i>

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:27.660
<i>It's as if time has stopped</i>

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.450
<i>Now wake up</i>

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:35.750
<i>I made my way out of the deep darkness</i>

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:41.000
<i>I fled like a swift wind</i>

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:48.500
<i>We used to be like living corpses,</i>

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.540
<i>but now we head beyond the walls</i>

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.580
<i>Let's meet again</i>

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:57.410
<i>in a place not on any map</i>

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:14.500
The Female Titan was actually
Annie Leonhart all along.

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:19.500
However, even when faced with her,
Eren is unable to transform.

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.620
Because she's Annie.

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:23.370
"Mercy"
"Assault on Stohess, Part 2"
