00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.860
<i>Over a hundred years ago,</i>

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.080
<i>humanity suddenly found itself 
faced with a new predator.</i>

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.340
<i>They were far more powerful than humans.</i>

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.590
<i>Humanity was immediately pushed 
to the brink of extinction.</i>

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:43.730
<i>The survivors built three walls: 
Maria, Rose, and Sina.</i>

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.560
<i>There, they enjoyed a century of peace.</i>

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.320
<i>However...</i>

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.750
<i>Unknown are the names</i>
<i>of the flowers that have been trampled</i>

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.200
<i>Birds have fallen to the earth</i>
<i>and long for the wind</i>

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.330
<i>Prayers won't solve anything</i>

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.660
<i>Only the will to fight</i>
<i>can change the here and now!</i>

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.950
<i>O pigs who laugh at the resolve</i>
<i>to walk over corpses to move forward</i>

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.500
<i>Livestock complacency? False prosperity?</i>

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.370
<i>Give us the freedom of dying,</i>
<i>starving wolves!</i>

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.750
<i>The humiliation of being caged</i>
<i>is what triggers us to fight back</i>

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.040
<i>We hunters slaughter prey</i>
<i>beyond the castle walls,</i>

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.250
<i>consumed with surging bloodlust,</i>

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:59.160
<i>as our crimson bows and arrows</i>
<i>pierce scarlet holes into the twilight</i>

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.330
<b>Where the Left Arm Went 
The Battle for Trost (5)</b>

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.670
<i>One reason so many soldiers died</i>

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.210
<i>in the Titans' attack on Trost</i>

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.380
<i>was the absence of the elite Survey Corps.</i>

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.840
<i>Only that morning,</i>

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.720
<i>they had embarked on 
a reconnaissance mission beyond the walls.</i>

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.930
They're here!

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.900
The main force of the Survey Corps!

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.360
Commander Erwin, kill the Titans for us!

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.490
Look, it's Captain Levi!

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.160
They say he's as strong as an entire brigade.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.450
Shut up.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.660
If they knew how fussy you are,

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.330
they wouldn't look at you 
with such admiration.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.350
The Titans are right outside...

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.300
What kind of Titan will we see this time?

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.140
It'd be so great if we saw an Aberrant!

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.520
We have one right here.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.980
Huh? Where?

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.230
Right here.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:37.830
Forward!

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.990
<i>Survey outlying areas</i>

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.030
<i>and establish supply points 
that would support a human advance.</i>

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.160
<i>Being entrusted with these missions, 
the Survey Corps</i>

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.690
<i>receives the best 
humanity has to offer.</i>

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.420
<i>The military genius of a select few</i>

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.390
<i>within their ranks has greatly 
boosted their survival rate.</i>

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.140
<i>But even so, every excursion into Titan territory</i>

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.540
<i>costs over thirty percent of their troops.</i>

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.180
<i>The difference in strength 
between humans and Titans is that great.</i>

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.310
Just you wait...

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.190
It won't be long

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.360
before humanity wipes you out!

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.520
We'll be the ones to survive in the end!

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.830
Captain Levi will...

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.750
kill you all!

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.810
One to the right...

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.230
Two to the left.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.270
Captain, I've brought reinforcements.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.980
Petra, tend to the wounded soldiers below.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.230
The rest of you, support the right flank.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.610
I'll take care of the left.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.320
Captain!

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.210
It's okay!

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.550
I won't hurt you.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.220
So close!

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.720
Now it's my turn.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.970
There!

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.140
See?

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.560
That didn't hurt, did it?

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.060
You all have...

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.100
the stupidest expressions.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.380
Whoa.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.840
Stay put.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.840
Otherwise, it will get messy...

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.760
when I slice you.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.890
Damn.

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.190
Filthy...

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:32.120
Captain,

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.790
the bleeding won't stop...

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.570
Captain...

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.100
What is it?

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:52.110
W-Was I able...

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.140
to help humanity?

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.850
Or will I die,

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:03.150
never having been of any use at all?

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.860
You have done a great deal.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.960
And you will continue to do so.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:18.120
The resolve you leave behind 
will give me strength.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.330
I promise you...

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.750
I will obliterate the Titans!

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.260
Captain...

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.150
He's gone.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.520
Did he hear me to the very end?

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.020
Yes.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.070
I'm sure he did.

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:44.520
Look.

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.800
He seems so at peace...

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:51.530
Very well, then.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:54.570
Levi!

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.080
We're pulling back.

00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:59.790
Pulling back?

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:01.790
We have yet to push ourselves to the limit.

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:03.920
Are my men dying for nothing?

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.710
The Titans are heading north, toward town.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:12.720
Just like five years ago...

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.220
Something is happening in town.

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:15.850
The wall...

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:18.210
may have fallen.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:22.310
<i>Damn it!</i>

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:27.360
<i>Damn it...</i>

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.730
<i>It wasn't...</i>

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:00.310
<i>It wasn't supposed to be this way.</i>

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.770
<i>We had changed over the past five years...</i>

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.560
<i>We trained as hard as we could.</i>

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:08.770
<i>We thought long and hard.</i>

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.900
<i>It was all to defeat them...</i>

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.530
<i>So that they wouldn't take 
anything else from us.</i>

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.320
It's hot.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:20.700
It's so hot...

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:25.120
Save me, Mother.

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:27.580
Mother?

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:31.840
<i>Mother...</i>

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.340
<i>Mother?</i>

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:41.470
Save...

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:44.730
<i>Why did this happen?</i>

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.320
<i>Why do they take everything from us?</i>

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:50.520
<i>Our lives.</i>

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.110
<i>Our dreams...</i>

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.360
Why?

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.080
Damn it all! Damn it! Damn it!

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.710
I won't give up!

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:10.840
I'll eliminate them all...

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.000
Every single Titan!

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:17.860
I'll kill them myself!

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:15.070
<i>I'll wipe them off the face</i>

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.650
<i>of the earth.</i>

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.160
<i>Every single one!</i>

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:32.750
<i>More...</i>

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:34.670
<i>More...</i>

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:36.750
<i>Kill more!</i>

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.550
<i>I want to kill...</i>

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.970
<i>Kill...</i>

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.350
<i>more...</i>

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.850
I'll kill them all.

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:52.810
Eren?

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:07.330
Eren!

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.330
Eren, can you move?

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:13.120
Can you understand what I'm saying?

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.580
Tell them everything you know.

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:17.250
I'm sure they'll understand!

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.630
Armin?

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:20.550
Hear that?

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:22.220
He said, "I'll kill them all!"

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.930
Yes, I heard him.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:27.470
He's going to devour us.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.910
<i>What are they all talking about?</i>

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:35.400
<i>Are those blades pointed at us?</i>

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.820
<i>Those blades are for fighting Titans.</i>

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.110
<i>Why are they looking at me like that?</i>

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.080
<i>What is this?</i>

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:54.330
<b>Information We Can Share So Far:</b>

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:54.330
<b>The Survey Corps (1)

<b>Information We Can Share So Far:</b>

<b>Wall Rose Interior</b>

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:07.760
Trainees, keep your equipment 
at hand, and stand by!

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.770
And then...

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:15.560
We managed to get some gas, 
and retreat from Trost.

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:18.520
So that's what happened...

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:20.320
I'm sorry.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.320
I requested supplies 
for everyone many times, but...

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:28.020
And we finally managed 
to get some gas, too.

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:33.250
Th-Then does that mean that 
everyone who isn't here...

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:34.830
Yeah.

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:38.210
Even Mikasa?

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:39.880
N-No...

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.650
I thought Mikasa came back 
later with Jean and the rest.

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:47.510
Jean, don't tell me Mikasa was injured.

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:51.600
Hey, what's wrong?

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:00.630
We've been ordered to keep it a secret.

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:02.190
I can't discuss it.

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:03.230
Keep it a secret?

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:04.360
What?

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:08.450
Of course, it won't stay secret for long...

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.960
Before long, all humanity 
will know about it.

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:16.970
Assuming humanity lasts that long....

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:23.000
A fortification of flesh, made from Titans.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.840
The engineers are pretty smart.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.760
But we can't lower our guard.

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:33.310
We stand at the front lines of the war 
between humanity and the Titans...

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:35.140
at the precipice.

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:36.770
What's wrong?

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:38.810
Nothing.

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:40.690
It won't interfere with the mission.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:45.240
But I'm worried about my 
friends in the vanguard.

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:48.780
The messenger I just saw on 
his way to HQ looked pale.

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:50.700
Yeah,

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:55.330
but we simply need to fend off 
the Titans, just as we trained.

00:14:56.790 --> 00:15:00.870
Captain Hannes, I heard that the three 
children who escaped with you

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:03.500
five years ago are trainees now.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.300
Were they in the vanguard?

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:06.880
Yes.

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:09.470
I'm sorry.

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:11.180
I shouldn't have said anything.

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:12.050
They're safe.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:14.850
They're tough.

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:17.640
Each possesses a means of survival.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.150
One excels in combat.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.110
One has formidable resolve.

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:26.780
And one has a brilliant mind.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.490
They're safe.

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:30.070
I know they've survived.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.740
Trainee Jaeger!

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:36.080
As well as Trainees Ackerman and Arlert...

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:39.750
What you're doing right now 
is an act of treason!

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:43.080
We may decide to kill you on the spot!

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:48.340
If you attempt to lie to us, 
or make a single move,

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:50.840
we will fire an HE Projectile at you immediately.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.640
We will not hesitate!

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:54.100
Huh?

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.640
Answer me at once!

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.140
What are you?!

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.640
Are you a man? Or a Titan?

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:05.690
<i>What kind of question is that?</i>

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.440
<i>Why look at me like that?</i>

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.450
<i>Looking at me 
as if I'm a monster...</i>

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.450
<i>Is that what they think I am?</i>

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:19.450
I d-don't understand the question!

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:22.370
He's pretending to know nothing?

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:23.580
Monster!

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:27.340
Try that again, and I'll blow you to pieces.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:28.500
It just takes an instant!

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.970
You won't have time to reveal your true form!

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:32.470
True form?

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:34.970
Plenty of people saw you,

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:39.770
as you emerged from within a Titan!

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:47.480
Humanity has permitted an unknown 
creature like you to infiltrate Wall Rose!

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:52.650
Even if you are trainees 
given to us by the King,

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:55.490
the safest course is to 
eliminate the risk immediately!

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:57.990
My thinking is correct!

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:04.850
The Armored Titan that destroyed Wall 
Maria could appear at any minute.

00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:09.590
Right now, humanity is at risk of annihilation!

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.050
Do you understand?

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:15.720
We can't waste more time or troops on you!

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:21.100
I will fire an HE Projectile 
at you without hesitation!

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:25.480
It's true that they aren't being cooperative.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.020
We aren't likely to get 
any useful information out of them.

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:33.240
You're right, Sir. 
We're wasting time and troops.

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:35.990
Captain, this is our chance!

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:39.410
If we dismember him while he 
pretends to be human...

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.870
My specialty is

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:45.370
tearing through flesh.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.590
If necessary, I am willing to 
demonstrate at any time.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:52.760
If anyone would like to experience it firsthand,

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:57.130
I invite them to be the first to approach.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:04.280
Captain, Mikasa Ackerman was 
in the rearguard with us.

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:08.480
She is worth a hundred other soldiers.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:11.440
Her loss would be a critical blow to humanity.

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:12.580
Hey...

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:15.740
Mikasa... Armin! 
What's going on here?

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:16.450
Mikasa!

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:18.660
You can't fight another human!

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:22.330
Where could we run 
within these cramped walls?

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.120
It doesn't matter who I must fight.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.660
I won't let anyone kill Eren.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.130
I don't need any other reason.

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:31.590
Let's talk this through!

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:34.590
No one knows what's going on,

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.100
so they're ruled by fear!

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:41.600
<i>Am I the only one who thinks I'm not a Titan?</i>

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:43.060
<i>Damn it.</i>

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.140
<i>I don't remember how I got here!</i>

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:48.640
<i>I'm too exhausted to move,</i>

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.310
<i>and if I say anything, they'll probably kill me.</i>

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.150
<i>Killed by a human?</i>

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:55.690
<i>That's ridiculous!</i>

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.490
<i>What is this about, anyway?</i>

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:02.580
<i>I came out of a Titan?</i>

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:05.580
<i>What are they talking about?! 
What the hell is going on?!</i>

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.080
<i>Wasn't that a dream?</i>

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.380
<i>If it wasn't...</i>

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:15.170
<i>Then my arm regrew where 
my clothes are missing...</i>

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:18.720
<i>That'd make me just like a Titan!</i>

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.840
<i>That's impossible...</i>

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:22.640
<i>Why would I...</i>

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.310
<i>Why?</i>

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:25.720
I'll ask you once more!

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.230
What are you?!

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:33.650
<i>I can't screw up my answer...</i>

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:36.780
<i>I wouldn't be the only one to die.</i>

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:38.900
<i>That's right.</i>

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.360
<i>I've always been</i>

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:43.630
<i>just like everyone else...</i>

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.450
A human!

00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:58.590
I see...

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:00.970
Then don't hate me for this.

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:05.600
There's no avoiding it.

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.930
No one can prove

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.850
that they are not the devil.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.440
Eren! Armin!

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:19.240
We're going up!

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:20.400
Stop!

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:28.240
<i>Eren...</i>

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.080
<i>When I get back,</i>

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.880
<i>I'll show you what I've kept secret 
in the basement all this time.</i>

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:42.060
<i>Never let go of this key.</i>

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.970
<i>And every time you see it,</i>

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:50.020
<i>remember that you must 
go to the basement!</i>

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:57.030
<i>This shot will impair your memory.</i>

00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:01.110
<i>That's why I can't explain now...</i>

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:02.750
<i>Listen to me.</i>

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:06.990
<i>Take back Wall Maria and reach the basement.</i>

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:12.020
<i>This power will help you then!</i>

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:16.830
<i>Their memories will tell you how to use it.</i>

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:18.630
<i>Eren!</i>

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:24.180
<i>If you get to the basement someday, 
you'll learn the truth...</i>

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:30.250
<i>The path will be harsh and cruel, 
but you must make it there!</i>

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:37.940
<i>If you want to save Mikasa, 
Armin, and everyone else,</i>

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.820
<i>you must master this power!</i>

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:09.970
Did we get him?

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.840
No...

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:57.910
<i>Your dreams are where your heart is</i>

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:04.160
<i>They're more fragile than life itself</i>

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:08.830
<i>Over and over you cast them aside,</i>
<i>only to find more</i>

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:15.500
<i>Now, rest in peace</i>

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:26.830
<i>Pounding impulses defile the things we wish for</i>

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:37.120
<i>and the more we forget</i>
<i>the more we remember again</i>

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:43.080
<i>In this beautiful, cruel world</i>

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:48.250
<i>all I can do is ask why we're still alive</i>

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:53.950
<i>Oh, with our strength--and our weakness--</i>

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:59.620
<i>what are we going to protect if there's no sense</i>

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:03.040
<i>to anything anymore?</i>

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:12.680
"Eren is not an enemy of humanity."

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.870
Armin puts his life on the line 
to plead for Eren.

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:20.140
However, consumed by terror, 
the Garrison is incapable of rational thought

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.410
and orders Eren's execution.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:26:51.070
<b>Response 
The Battle for Trost (6)</b>
