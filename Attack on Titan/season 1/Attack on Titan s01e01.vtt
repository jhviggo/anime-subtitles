00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.620
Humanity was suddenly reminded that day...

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.580
...of the terror of being at their mercy...

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.950
...of the humiliation
of being trapped inside a cage...

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.620
All soldiers, prepare for battle!

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.290
We have one target!

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.290
We <i>will </i>slay it and claim this spot

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.580
as humanity's first stronghold
beyond the walls!

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.750
Target approaching!

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.000
Split into five groups just as we practiced!

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.500
We'll act as the bait!

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.120
All assault squads,
switch to omni-directional gear!

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.000
Strike from all directions at once!

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.000
Taste the power...

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.540
...of humanity!

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.620
<i>Unknown are the names</i>
<i>of the flowers that have been trampled</i>

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.120
<i>Birds have fallen to the earth</i>
<i>and long for the wind</i>

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.200
<i>Prayers won't solve anything</i>

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.540
<i>Only the will to fight</i>
<i>can change the here and now!</i>

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.830
<i>O pigs who laugh at the resolve</i>
<i>to walk over corpses to move forward</i>

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.370
<i>Livestock complacency? False prosperity?</i>

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.250
<i>Give us the freedom of dying,</i>
<i>starving wolves!</i>

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.620
<i>The humiliation of being caged</i>
<i>is what triggers us to fight back</i>

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.910
<i>We hunters slaughter prey</i>
<i>beyond the castle walls,</i>

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.120
<i>consumed with surging bloodlust,</i>

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:29.080
<i>as our crimson bows and arrows</i>
<i>pierce scarlet holes into the twilight</i>

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.330
"To You, in 2000 Years"
"The Fall of Shiganshina, Part 1"

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.370
Huh? Mikasa...

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.250
We should be getting back.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.450
What are we doing here...?

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.620
You were <i>that </i>deep asleep
that you're still only half-awake?

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.000
No...

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.830
It just feels like I had this
<i>really </i>long dream or something...

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.080
What was it about?

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.000
I can't remember...

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.620
Eren, why are you crying?

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.790
Huh?

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.700
"Year 845 Shiganshina District"

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.830
Listen!

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.160
It was by God's great wisdom
that the walls were built!

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.660
The walls are His divine work!

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.410
<i>No one </i>must be allowed to defile the walls!

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.750
Don't you dare tell anyone I was crying.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.660
I won't.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.370
Still, crying for no real reason...

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.660
You should have your dad give you a checkup.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.370
Don't be stupid! I can't tell him!

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.200
What are you cryin' about, Eren?

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.160
Mr. Hannes...

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.620
Did Mikasa get on your case about somethin'?

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.330
Huh?! What makes you think I was crying?!

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.120
Whoa, you reek of alcohol!

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.660
It's like, come on, y'know?

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.120
Oh.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.870
You're drinking again...

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.700
You guys wanna join in?

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.330
Actually, uhh... Don't you have work?

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.040
Yup! We're guardin' the gate today!

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.370
We're stuck here all day,
so we end up getting hungry and thirsty.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:12.120
If some booze happens to get into our drinks,
so what? It's no big deal.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.000
What if something happens?!
Can you fight like that?!

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.290
--Whadya mean, "If something happens"?
--You know what I mean!

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.330
I'm talking about if
<i>they </i>break the walls and get into the city!

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.500
Oww...

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.750
Geez, Eren. Don't go yellin' like that.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.120
You've got spunk, doctor's son!

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.410
If they <i>do </i>bust down the walls,
we'll take care of business, don't you worry.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:44.700
But that ain't happened once
in the last one hundred years.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:50.250
Still, my dad says there's nothing
more dangerous than being complacent like that!

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.370
Dr. Jaeger, huh?

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.080
Yeah, he's got a point.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.790
He once saved this town from an epidemic.

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:01.330
I can't argue with him.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.200
Still, they're another story altogether.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.620
When you're a soldier, you get to see
those things roaming around outside

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.370
while you're on
wall reinforcement duty and stuff.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:17.410
These walls are fifty meters tall, though.
I can't see 'em getting through.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:22.410
Then... you're not actually
prepared to fight them at all?!

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:23.500
Nope!

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.870
Wh-What?!

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.620
Then drop the "Garrison Regiment" name

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.620
for "Wall Construction Squad" instead!

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.290
Not a bad idea!

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.290
But you gotta understand, Eren.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:39.660
If a soldier's doing his job,
things have seriously gone to hell.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:44.330
It's better when everyone's
calling us useless freeloaders;

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.580
it means peaceful times for us all.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.410
Sure, we <i>can </i>stay
inside the walls our entire lives

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:56.370
and do nothing but eat and sleep!

00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:00.410
But... that basically...

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:02.580
That basically makes us cattle!

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:08.120
Man, you're one plucky kid, all right!

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.750
For someone who's totally helpless!
Right, Hannes?!

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.450
Huh? Y-Yeah.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.950
Hey! Eren!

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:20.870
What a weirdo!

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:25.120
Wait... Don't tell me
he wants to join the Scout Regiment?

00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:38.330
Eren, I'd forget about
the Scout Regiment if I were you.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.910
What?! You think the Scout Regiment
is a joke too?!

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:44.410
It's not about what I think.

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:53.790
The Scout Regiment is back!

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.540
They're gonna open the front gate!

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.500
Let's go see the heroes return, Mikasa!

00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.450
Oh...!

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.080
Damn! I can't see!

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:44.950
They're the only ones who made it back?

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:47.620
Everyone else must've gotten eaten.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.950
This is what they get
for going outside the walls.

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:53.290
Moses! Moses!

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.250
Excuse me...

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.950
I don't see my son Moses anywhere...

00:09:57.950 --> 00:09:59.950
Do you know where he is?

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.700
This is Moses' mother.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.040
Go get it.

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.870
It's all we could retrieve.

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:52.450
But... my son...

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:54.750
He was helpful, yes?

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:59.700
Even if he didn't achieve direct greatness...

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:05.120
...surely my son's death
helped humanity fight back, yes?!

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:12.870
Of course...!

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.790
No...

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:22.330
On this latest scouting mission, we...

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:23.660
No...

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:27.500
Just like all the other missions...

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:32.040
...we achieved nothing at all!

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.580
My incompetence has done nothing

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.450
but needlessly send soldiers to their deaths!

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:44.080
We haven't found out <i>anything </i>about them!

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.620
Talk about gruesome.

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.620
You can say that again.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:57.870
Our taxes are basically going
to feeding and fattening those things up now.

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:03.080
What the hell, you little punk?!

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:08.250
H-Hey! What are you doing, Mikasa?!

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:10.450
Hey! Get back here, you!

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:15.120
Mikasa! Enough already!

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:23.540
What's the big idea?!
Now the firewood's all over the place!

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:26.450
Eren.

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:29.910
Have you changed your mind
about joining the Scout Regiment?

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.540
Help pick this up.

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.660
It's not <i>that </i>bad of a mess.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.160
We're home.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.080
Welcome back.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:12.250
Wow, Eren! You actually worked hard!

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:13.540
Yeah...

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:18.330
What do you want?

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.790
Your ear's red. That shows that you're lying.

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:24.200
You had Mikasa help you, didn't you?

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.250
Oh? You're leaving, Dad?

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:29.290
Is it for work?

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:32.000
Yes, some checkups in the interior.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.700
It'll take a couple of days.

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:40.580
Eren says he wants to join the Scout Regiment.

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.580
M-Mikasa! I told you not to say anything!

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.080
Eren!

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.000
What are you thinking?!

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.120
Do you have any idea how many people
have died outside the walls?!

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.450
--Y-Yeah, I know!
--Then...!

00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:57.950
Eren.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:02.040
Why do you want to go out there?

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:07.500
I want to know what the outside world is like!

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:11.870
I don't want to live my entire life
in ignorance inside the walls!

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:13.790
Plus...

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:17.040
If no one else is willing to take their place,

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.160
then the lives of all who've died
will be for nothing!

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:25.370
I see.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.870
My boat's about to leave. I better get going.

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:33.080
Hold on, dear! Talk some sense into Eren!

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.370
Carla.

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:39.950
Words can't hold back human curiosity.

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:41.040
Eren.

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:45.290
When I get back, I'll show you the basement

00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:48.000
that I've kept secret all this time.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.500
R-Really?!

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.200
Take care!

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:00.040
Just forget it.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:01.790
Joining the Scout Regiment is a stupid idea!

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:03.950
Huh?! Stupid?!

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:09.160
People who don't mind living like livestock
are the stupid ones, if you ask me!

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.370
Eren!

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.870
Mikasa.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.700
He gets himself into trouble so easily.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.620
If anything ever happens,
you need to be there for each other!

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:21.910
Mm.

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:27.580
What's the matter, heretic?!

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:30.250
If you don't like it, let's see you hit back!

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.080
Y-Yeah, right!

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.410
That would be stooping to <i>your </i>level!

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:36.660
Say what?!

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:40.040
You know I'm right!

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.540
That's why you have to resort to violence!
Because you can't argue back!

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:46.750
Which means you
concede defeat to me, does it not?!

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.620
Shut up, smart-ass!

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:51.700
Stop that!

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.250
It's Eren!

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:58.330
--That idiot's back for more?!
--Does he <i>want </i>his ass kicked?!

00:15:58.330 --> 00:15:59.950
We'll tear you a new one!

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:03.660
M-Mikasa's with him!

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.250
S-Screw this! Let's get outta here!

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:14.580
One look at me and they ran off!

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:17.330
No, it was Mikasa they saw...

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:18.750
Oww!

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:20.750
Hey! You okay, Armin?!

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:27.370
I can get up on my own...

00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:28.750
Oh.

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:36.790
I said humanity needs to venture
into the outside world at some point...

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:39.120
...and then they beat me up
and called me a heretic.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.410
Damn...

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:46.080
Why does everyone look down on people
just for wanting to go outside?!

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.120
Well, because we've had
a hundred years of peace

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.540
by staying inside the walls.

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.790
They're worried that going outside carelessly

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:56.790
will invite them inside the walls.

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:59.000
The royal government's policies have made

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
having <i>any </i>interest
in the outside world a taboo.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.330
It's <i>our </i>lives! We can risk 'em if we want!

00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:07.870
Absolutely not.

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:11.160
Forget about it.

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.120
Which reminds me,
I can't believe you told my parents!

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.120
Huh?

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.830
I never agreed to help.

00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:18.870
So, what did they say?

00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:22.120
They're... less than pleased.

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:24.870
It figures.

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:31.750
Indeed, I think people are crazy

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:36.040
if they think we'll be
safe inside these walls forever.

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.200
Mommy!

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:43.370
Just because the walls
haven't fallen for a hundred years

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:46.080
doesn't guarantee that they won't fall today....

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.410
And yet...

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:10.040
Wh-What was that?!

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.250
An explosion?!

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.830
--That way!
--Did something fall?!

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:16.080
I'm not really sure...

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.790
Hey, Armin!

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:26.200
What is it?! What do you see?!

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:37.410
It can't be...!

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:42.200
Th-That wall... is fifty meters high!

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.580
It's one of them...

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:51.700
A Titan!

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:42.160
I-It... opened a hole in the wall...

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.580
They're inside!

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:51.040
The Titans have gotten inside!

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.580
We need to run too!

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:57.660
Eren!

00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:59.750
My house is in that direction!

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:00.790
Mom...!

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.040
Mikasa!

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.700
It's all over...

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:18.000
Countless Titans... are going to overrun the city!

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:25.790
It <i>couldn't </i>have hit our home!

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:29.080
Just around this corner...
our house is standing there, like always!

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:34.950
Mom!

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:38.700
Mom!

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:43.120
--Eren!
--Mikasa! Grab that end!

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.620
We gotta move this pillar!

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:04.750
Hurry, Mikasa!

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:06.700
I know!

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.950
The Titans have gotten inside, haven't they?

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:12.330
Eren! Take Mikasa and run away!

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:13.700
Hurry!

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:15.540
I want to!

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.080
So hurry and get out of there!

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:21.700
The debris has crushed my legs...

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:25.540
Even if I could get out,
I wouldn't be able to run.

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:26.540
You understand what that means.

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:28.540
I'll carry you, then!

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:31.870
Why don't you ever listen to your mother?!

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:34.790
You can at least do this one last thing!

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:35.950
Mikasa!

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:38.660
No...

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.500
No...!

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.580
If you don't go, all three of us will...

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:45.580
Hannes!

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:49.830
Take the children and get out of here!

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:54.000
Don't go underestimatin' me, Carla.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.450
I'm gonna slaughter these Titans
and save all three of ya!

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:00.950
Wait! Don't fight them!

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:04.410
Yeah, I could save those two for sure.

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:05.870
But now...

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:08.370
I'm finally going to repay the favor I owe!

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:26.910
Hey! Mr. Hannes!

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:28.830
What are you doing?!

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:31.750
--Thank you...
--Hey!

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:34.660
Mom's still...!

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:37.620
Eren! Mikasa!

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:40.000
You have to survive!

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:54.580
Don't go...

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:08.500
Stop!

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:45.660
Humanity was suddenly reminded that day...

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:53.370
...of the terror of being at their mercy...

00:23:55.540 --> 00:24:00.700
...of the humiliation
of being trapped inside a cage...

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:30.830
<i>Your dreams are where your heart is</i>

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:37.080
<i>They're more fragile than life itself</i>

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:41.790
<i>Over and over you cast them aside,</i>
<i>only to find more</i>

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:48.500
<i>Now, rest in peace</i>

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:59.620
<i>Pounding impulses defile the things we wish for</i>

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:10.120
<i>and the more we forget</i>
<i>the more we remember again</i>

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:16.080
<i>In this beautiful, cruel world</i>

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:21.370
<i>all I can do is ask why we're still alive</i>

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:27.000
<i>Oh, with our strength--and our weakness--</i>

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.540
<i>what are we going to protect if there's no sense</i>

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:37.120
<i>to anything anymore?</i>

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:45.540
Shiganshina falls.

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:51.080
Prayers, screams, and death
are all that humanity is allowed.

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.910
Amid this, Eren alone
swears revenge in his small heart.
