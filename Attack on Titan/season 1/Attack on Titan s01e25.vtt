WEBVTT

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.370
We don't have a choice.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.910
We live in a cruel world.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.950
I'm going... to drive them out...!

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.500
No...

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.910
Kill them!

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.450
Humanity was suddenly reminded that day.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.870
Of the terror of being at their mercy...

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.450
Of the humiliation of being
trapped inside a cage...

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.040
Eren!

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.540
Eren...

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.450
<i>I won't let your deaths be meaningless</i>

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.620
<i>even if I'm the last one standing</i>

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.500
<i>In both hands, Gloria</i>

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.500
<i>What sings is Sieg</i>

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.700
<i>On my back, Flügel der Freiheit</i>

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.540
<i>Clenched determination to my left chest</i>

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.870
<i>What slashes across is Linie der Torheit</i>

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.120
<i>Soaring across the azure skies</i>

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.660
<i>Flügel der Freiheit</i>

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.410
"Wall"
"Assault on Stohess, Part 3"

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.200
Let us pray.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.040
For the solidity of the three
goddesses, Maria, Rose, and Sina.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.580
For our own welfare.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.250
We must not misdoubt the sacred walls.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.580
These walls of light born
from the hands of the divine

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:22.080
are made ever more stalwart
through the offering of our faith.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.120
For it is <i>only </i>the
innocence of faithful devotion

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.620
that protects us from the Titans.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.500
It, alone, keeps the Titans away from--

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.620
A Titan?! <i>Here</i>?!

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.790
N-No...

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.410
Stay away from the wall...

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.000
Stay away...!

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.160
Looks like he's in control
of himself this time around.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.290
Yes.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.330
But Eren has yet to win against
the Female Titan even once.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.200
If he's transformed, it means
he's gotta be ready for the worst.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.790
--He won't lose so eas--
--Spirit alone can't win a fight.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.450
You know that first-hand.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.450
Surpassing Annie...

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.370
...will require more!

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.290
Level ground!

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.950
She's heading for level ground!

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.830
We can't use ODM there!

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.790
Split into two teams and go around!

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.000
Understood!

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.000
Come on! Come on! Come on!

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.750
This is crazy! What are Titans doing here?!

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.750
Annie...

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:39.540
You always acted like everything
around you was stupid and pointless...

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.160
You never seemed interested in anything.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.790
But, there <i>are </i>times when you're full of life...

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.000
Whenever you show off
those combat skills of yours.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.540
You talked about how there was no point to it...

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:02.040
...but it didn't seem
like you believed that at all.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:09.120
If anything, you struck me as a bad liar.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.200
Tell me, Annie...

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.330
What are <i>you </i>fighting for?

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.080
For what cause did you murder people?!

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.410
Oh, man...

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:44.620
Section Commander.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.290
Even if we do catch the Female Titan,
the city's going to end up in ruins!

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:53.620
That's not our concern.
This is Erwin's decision.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.450
Ready the capture nets.

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:56.870
Right!

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.160
Eren...

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.830
No one said anything about <i>this</i>...

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.120
Why are there Titans fighting here?

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.250
What in the world is happening?

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.620
Titans are fighting each other?!

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.790
Yes. The damage done to
the city is unimaginable...

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:22.120
Scores of civilians and soldiers
have been killed or wounded.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:27.370
Erwin! Is this the result of your doing?!

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:28.910
It is.

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:35.160
I acted entirely on my own authority.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.250
I offer no excuses.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.660
You <i>had </i>to have known what this plan of yours

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.250
would've caused in the middle of a city!

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.540
Why?! Why did you do it?!

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.410
For humankind's...

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.290
...victory.

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.450
Don't give me that!

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:01.080
You're a traitor!

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:06.120
None of the higher-ups will
complain if I execute you right now!

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.540
If you wish.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.540
But...

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.290
You'll be in charge afterward.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:13.370
Do <i>not </i>let the Female Titan escape.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:17.410
Peer is in charge of troop deployment.
Beirer is in charge of provisions.

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:21.910
--Work with them and do whatever it takes--
--W-Wait! Stop!

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.700
Do you really think...

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.200
...this is for humanity's sake?

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.950
I have faith it will serve as a step forward.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:38.750
Everyone, lower your guns!

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:40.500
Cuff him!

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.410
Yes, Sir!

00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:44.620
Deploy all troops

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:48.000
and focus on aiding and evacuating the citizens!

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.200
Yes, Sir!

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:55.580
Erwin. I'll let a court of law
decide how to execute you.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:59.250
I'll gladly accept that,
once everything is over.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:03.700
Levi. Stay put. You don't like pointless death.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:08.370
You're right. I'm not fond of
causing it <i>or </i>experiencing it.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:17.290
Those who can't abandon anything...

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:19.950
...can't change anything.

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:24.000
The ability to give up your humanity...

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.200
...when forced to rise above monsters...

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:35.450
I think that's something Annie can do!

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:42.700
Annie...

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.750
Annie!

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:07.450
Annie...

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:13.370
Your dad is always on your side...

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:33.580
I... will kill...

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.580
...the Titans...

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:39.620
Every last one...

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.700
Eren!

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:10.040
Is he...?!

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.540
--Eren!
--Stop!

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.620
I'm not sure Eren would recognize you right now!

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:34.250
Whoa...

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:05.120
--She's on the wall!
--She intends to climb over!

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.410
Oh, no!

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:20.080
She's getting away!

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.410
I won't let her!

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.120
Annie.

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:44.040
Fall.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.950
Annie...

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:58.160
It was wrong of me...

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.950
I won't ask for your forgiveness now.

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:05.250
But... all I ask of you...

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:06.910
...is one thing...

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:14.040
Even if you turn the whole
world against you, it's okay.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.830
I will...

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:25.160
...destroy... the entire world...!

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:29.790
Even if the entire world ends up hating you...

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:35.000
...just know that your
dad is always on your side...

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.160
Oh, no! He's going to eat the person inside!

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.790
Stop, Eren!

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.000
Eren!

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.450
I'm...

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:43.290
...free...!

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.910
So promise me...

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.120
...that you'll come back...

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.580
Huh? What's he doing?

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.660
What the...?!

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.910
They're merging?!

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:28.410
Eren!

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:39.870
Don't go eatin' our key evidence, you idiot...

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.120
Eren...

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.080
Mikasa...

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.620
Where's Annie?

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:46.870
Damn it!

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:50.750
What the hell?! After all this,
we get the silent treatment?!

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:52.120
Annie!

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.410
Get out here!

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:55.750
Get out here and pay for what you've done!

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:57.660
Come on! Don't be a coward!

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:00.500
Annie! Annie!

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:03.410
Stop.

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.160
It's pointless.

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:13.080
Make a wire net!

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.160
Let's get this thing underground!

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.660
Understood!

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:22.830
If we end up not getting
any info out of Annie...

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:24.910
...what'll be left?

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:31.080
Nothing but countless casualties,
ruined lives, and unanswered questions...

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.500
...all for what?

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:46.950
Seems the plan wasn't much of a success.

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:51.870
No, I'd say the Scout
Regiment's in the clear now.

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:55.000
Just barely.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:58.910
Let's hope so...

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:13.410
Erwin. We have a number of
questions concerning this latest operation.

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:16.410
If you believe you knew the target's identity,

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.450
why did you not ask for the
Military Police's assistance?

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:20.580
Sir.

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:25.040
Given the likelihood that the
Female Titan has inside accomplices,

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:29.250
it was necessary to involve
only those above suspicion.

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:34.410
But how do you justify the damage
caused to Stohess as a result of that?!

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:38.790
Our ineptitude is to blame.
I offer my sincerest apologies.

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:41.120
Apologies won't fix this!

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.750
Had we left her unchecked, the wall
would've been destroyed eventually.

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:47.620
The ensuing destruction would've been far worse.

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.450
I see.

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:53.250
So, <i>do </i>you have any proof that
this devastating operation of yours

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:57.450
has helped to prevent the downfall of humankind?

00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:03.160
I find it unlikely you'll get anything
out of Annie Leonhart now...

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.200
Indeed, I doubt we will.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:10.160
In other words... it was all for naught?

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.120
Eren.

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:27.950
Do you feel all right?

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.910
Yeah...

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:36.290
It's weird how normal I feel.

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:40.120
I guess Annie's still stuck in there?

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.000
Yeah.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.330
Damn...

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:46.950
That big of an operation, all for nothin'.

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:50.750
Annie went that far to
keep her information safe...

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:54.330
Yeah. She slipped right through our fingers.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:56.870
<i>Eren </i>let her get away.

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:03.580
Isn't that right, Eren?

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:06.790
If it hadn't been for that brief moment...

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:08.580
Yeah.

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.790
It's true.

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:14.700
I screwed up.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:18.870
I froze as soon as I saw her...

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:23.330
Armin Arlelt.

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:24.950
Jean Kirschtein.

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:26.370
You're wanted for debriefing.

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:27.540
Right.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:28.910
Guess we're up first.

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:30.620
See you later, then.

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.620
Yeah...

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:48.330
It actually felt nice...

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:52.830
Having my body come apart
somehow felt... refreshing.

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:58.370
So much so that I felt like I <i>wanted </i>to die.

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:00.000
Eren!

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.950
I don't want to now.

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:20.950
I'm glad... that you came back...

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:28.410
It's too much for me to understand.

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:32.660
Abandoning your humanity
to rise above monsters...

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:35.410
That's the only way to win, huh?

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:40.160
It's one hope humankind has
for prevailing over the Titans.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.410
I think Eren can do it.

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:45.830
I wonder...

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:49.950
Getting rid of the Titans by
becoming that kind of monster...

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:53.330
Would that really be a victory for humankind?

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:04.870
Eat.

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:25.790
It won't be easy.

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:29.250
However...

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:34.870
I believe humankind has
gained great potential for survival.

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:42.830
There was a time when we never
even imagined humans becoming Titans.

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:46.910
Compared to then, capturing a member
of the enemy is an enormous step forward.

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:50.330
Yes. There <i>are </i>more out there.

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:53.000
And we will go after every last one.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.830
This time, it is <i>our </i>turn to launch

00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:00.660
an attack on the Titans within our walls!

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:10.450
The Scout Regiment and Eren Jaeger's
recall to the capital was rescinded,

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:19.040
and the Scouts were placed in charge of
supervising Annie Leonhart deep underground.

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.790
However...

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:25.080
It would take much more time and many more lives

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:30.910
for humanity to learn
what was holding it prisoner.

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:35.450
<i>...changed into ringing in my ears</i>

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:40.620
<i>It's as if time has stopped</i>

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:43.410
<i>Now wake up</i>

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:48.660
<i>I made my way out of the deep darkness</i>

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:53.950
<i>I fled like a swift wind</i>

00:22:53.950 --> 00:23:01.450
<i>We used to be like living corpses,</i>

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:03.500
<i>but now we head beyond the walls</i>

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.540
<i>Let's meet again</i>

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:10.370
<i>in a place not on any map</i>
