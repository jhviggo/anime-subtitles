00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.125
I was born on a small farm in
the northern region of Wall Rose.

00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:02.625
It was on land owned by
the noble family of Reiss.

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:10.792
As far back as I can remember,
I was helping around the farm.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.167
But, my mother was always reading books
and not once did I see her doing housework.

00:02:20.167 --> 00:02:22.542
She was a beautiful woman...

00:02:24.458 --> 00:02:27.625
At night, someone would
come for her in a wagon...

00:02:27.625 --> 00:02:31.750
...and she'd go off to
the city wearing fancy clothes.

00:02:32.833 --> 00:02:36.083
For me, that was just life as I knew it.

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:44.542
After I learned to read and write,
I picked up a book to imitate my mother.

00:02:44.542 --> 00:02:48.000
Only then did I know how alone I was.

00:02:49.167 --> 00:02:53.000
In all the books, parents cared
about their children.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.583
They talked, hugged, fought...
or so the stories went.

00:02:58.708 --> 00:03:02.042
I had never experienced any of those things.

00:03:03.167 --> 00:03:08.875
One day, out of curiosity,
I decided to try hugging my mother.

00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:13.125
I just wanted to see what
kind of face she would make.

00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:14.583
Mother!

00:03:20.292 --> 00:03:26.750
She ended up shoving me away, but that was
the first thing my mother ever did to me.

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:30.917
That's why it made me so happy.

00:03:33.167 --> 00:03:38.083
If only I had the courage... to kill the girl...

00:03:41.292 --> 00:03:45.417
Those were... the first words
my mother said to me.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.083
After that, she left the house
and began living somewhere else.

00:03:53.667 --> 00:04:00.167
And then, five years ago...
One night just days after Wall Maria fell...

00:04:00.167 --> 00:04:04.000
For the very first time, I met my father.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.042
Nice to meet you, Historia.

00:04:07.042 --> 00:04:12.042
My name is Rod Reiss... I'm your father.

00:04:12.042 --> 00:04:16.750
That man... He was the lord
ruling the land we lived on.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.125
My mother I hadn't seen in years
looked terribly frightened.

00:04:23.208 --> 00:04:27.292
Historia... You'll be living with me now.

00:04:35.083 --> 00:04:37.708
This is a problem, Lord Reiss.

00:04:37.708 --> 00:04:40.833
Let's avoid acting rashly now.

00:04:40.833 --> 00:04:45.750
Did the fall of Wall Maria
make you a little scared?

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:46.792
Mother!

00:04:46.792 --> 00:04:50.667
No! I am not the mother of that girl!

00:04:50.667 --> 00:04:54.708
She has nothing to do with me!

00:04:54.708 --> 00:04:58.500
Oh? Is that true, Lord Reiss?

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.500
Do you really have nothing to do
with this woman or child?

00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:11.458
So be it...

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.917
These two here have nothing to do with me.

00:05:15.917 --> 00:05:18.333
I thought that might be the case.

00:05:19.792 --> 00:05:21.375
What?! What are you...?

00:05:21.375 --> 00:05:23.917
You never existed.

00:05:23.917 --> 00:05:26.667
You never worked at the estate either.

00:05:26.667 --> 00:05:28.708
Nobody knows who you are.

00:05:28.708 --> 00:05:34.292
That's not... Master!
Please tell them that's not true!

00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:36.542
Mother...

00:05:38.125 --> 00:05:39.833
If only...

00:05:39.833 --> 00:05:42.625
If only I never had you!

00:05:50.083 --> 00:05:53.792
Those were my mother's last words.

00:05:58.375 --> 00:06:00.167
Wait.

00:06:00.167 --> 00:06:05.500
Moments before I was to be killed,
my father proposed an idea.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:12.042
That if I were to be sent far away and live out
a quiet life, perhaps they could spare me.

00:06:12.042 --> 00:06:16.125
Your name will be Christa Lenz.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.333
Please forgive me for everything.

00:06:27.333 --> 00:06:31.625
In order to protect you, I had no other choice.

00:06:31.625 --> 00:06:34.333
F-Father...

00:06:34.333 --> 00:06:37.667
I was always thinking about you.

00:06:37.667 --> 00:06:42.042
I've always dreamed of the day
I could hold you like this.

00:06:42.042 --> 00:06:46.333
You're special... Royal blood runs through you.

00:06:48.458 --> 00:06:50.625
It... does?

00:06:50.625 --> 00:06:53.625
That's right, Historia.

00:06:53.625 --> 00:06:57.583
Our Reiss family is the true royal line.

00:06:57.583 --> 00:07:03.083
And because you're special, you're the one
and only person who can save all of humanity.

00:07:03.083 --> 00:07:05.583
Now, let us go, Historia.

00:07:05.583 --> 00:07:08.417
To the place it all began...

00:07:12.375 --> 00:07:13.792
Sannes!

00:07:13.792 --> 00:07:16.125
Are you... all right?!

00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:20.417
Hey, don't tell me...

00:07:20.417 --> 00:07:23.208
You didn't tell them anything, right?

00:07:23.208 --> 00:07:25.708
Our loyalty to the King is more--

00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:28.083
Sannes!

00:07:28.083 --> 00:07:30.875
I can't stand to hear your voice anymore!

00:07:30.875 --> 00:07:34.333
You've betrayed me since the very beginning!

00:07:36.333 --> 00:07:38.625
To think how I trusted you!

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:41.708
Sannes! He never told us anything.

00:07:41.708 --> 00:07:44.542
In fact, we never questioned him.

00:07:45.875 --> 00:07:51.083
We threatened Ralph with a knife and
forced him to read this script that I wrote.

00:07:51.083 --> 00:07:52.792
That's all.

00:07:58.333 --> 00:08:00.125
Then...

00:08:00.125 --> 00:08:01.833
I...

00:08:01.833 --> 00:08:04.583
I betrayed the King?

00:08:08.625 --> 00:08:11.542
Y-You devils!

00:08:13.667 --> 00:08:20.708
I'm not trying to deny it, but... I'm sure
Nick thought the same thing about you.

00:08:20.708 --> 00:08:23.250
That's why I said what I did.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:26.333
That I was beginning to feel sorry for you.

00:08:26.333 --> 00:08:30.875
Look at how pathetic you are!
Grown-ass men wailing and crying!

00:08:30.875 --> 00:08:33.958
It serves you right, morons!

00:08:33.958 --> 00:08:38.542
See how you like spending the rest
of your life shitting in a tiny cell!

00:08:38.542 --> 00:08:40.125
See you.

00:08:41.167 --> 00:08:43.125
Next in line...

00:08:44.833 --> 00:08:49.500
This role of ours... There's an order to it.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:55.917
When one's role is done,
another steps in to start the act again.

00:08:55.917 --> 00:08:59.792
And thus, the world can never be rid of it.

00:09:01.625 --> 00:09:04.667
Good luck, Hange.

00:09:07.208 --> 00:09:08.708
Section Commander?

00:09:23.667 --> 00:09:27.250
Sorry... I made a mess.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.375
There was a cockroach.

00:09:29.375 --> 00:09:35.083
I see... Just one kick of yours
should've blasted it to bits.

00:09:35.083 --> 00:09:37.292
It's about time you fill them in.

00:09:37.292 --> 00:09:40.625
Oh... Yeah, I should.

00:09:40.625 --> 00:09:42.708
Eren will be eaten?!

00:09:42.708 --> 00:09:43.958
Yeah.

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:47.458
Eren remembered a conversation
that went like this...

00:09:47.458 --> 00:09:49.958
Do you resent me for it?

00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.750
I'm not sure...

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:55.000
I... don't know.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.542
You probably didn't want
to eat a human either...

00:09:58.542 --> 00:10:04.000
Speculating based on that, Ymir was a
Titan wandering alone outside the wall.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.417
Bertholdt, Reiner, and Annie
had a comrade that she ate.

00:10:08.417 --> 00:10:12.500
When a Titan eats someone,
they don't change back into a human.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.833
But what if a Titan ate
one of Reiner's comrades?

00:10:15.833 --> 00:10:19.417
They're humans who can transform into Titans.

00:10:19.417 --> 00:10:24.958
In other words, if a Titan eats someone with
that power, they revert back into a human.

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:28.792
Furthermore, they obtain
the power of those they eat.

00:10:28.792 --> 00:10:34.750
In the other day's battle, Reiner was
throwing Titans at Eren, who had escaped.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:38.708
Eren has the power to
control Titans with his scream.

00:10:38.708 --> 00:10:41.750
He was trying to snatch
that power with those Titans.

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:47.500
In that case, Eren is just a vessel
who is bound to be replaced.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:54.083
Basically, if the government has a Titan
of their own, they'll be the one to eat Eren.

00:10:56.375 --> 00:10:57.750
Calm down.

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:02.292
Even if you go on a rampage,
they're not going to give Eren back to us.

00:11:02.292 --> 00:11:06.125
Anyways, we head for
the lands of this Rod Reiss.

00:11:06.125 --> 00:11:08.125
Get ready to leave at once.

00:11:08.125 --> 00:11:09.250
Yes, sir!

00:11:12.208 --> 00:11:16.292
I'll go tell Erwin what we learned
about the Reiss family.

00:11:16.292 --> 00:11:18.750
I'm sure he's waiting to hear from us.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:20.000
Right.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.292
We can meet up on Reiss' land.
Hear from me at the usual spot.

00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:32.042
Excuse me. Commander Erwin,
Pyxis is here for you.

00:11:32.042 --> 00:11:33.167
The commander?

00:11:33.167 --> 00:11:36.250
Yes, he wants to see you.

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:38.708
Let him in.

00:11:38.708 --> 00:11:39.833
Sir!

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:47.667
Sorry about the late visit.

00:11:47.667 --> 00:11:50.833
I just couldn't stand still, you see.

00:11:50.833 --> 00:11:53.292
I finished reading your letter.

00:11:53.292 --> 00:11:56.083
I came with some thoughts of my own.

00:11:58.208 --> 00:12:02.542
But first I need to ask... Are you serious?

00:12:03.542 --> 00:12:05.583
Yes.

00:12:05.583 --> 00:12:10.583
In order to retake Wall Maria,
we'll overthrow the government.

00:12:19.833 --> 00:12:22.875
I knew this would happen one day.

00:12:22.875 --> 00:12:28.542
This cramped world can only hold people
for so long before they begin to lash out.

00:12:28.542 --> 00:12:34.417
And when that time came, I'd have to
point my gun at the King as well.

00:12:35.458 --> 00:12:42.292
If my guess proves correct, this plan will not
require military forces to take action.

00:12:42.292 --> 00:12:45.375
Nor should it be necessary for anyone to die.

00:12:45.375 --> 00:12:51.917
Oh? Do tell me then.
Is such a method possible?

00:12:51.917 --> 00:12:56.667
However, the groundwork for this
to happen is not quite ready.

00:12:56.667 --> 00:13:02.750
And if everything is not in order, me and
everyone else will be hanged, no doubt.

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:05.250
Oh, that's all?

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:08.500
In other words, it's another huge gamble.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.750
It seems I may be a betting man.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.875
The news should come shortly.

00:13:13.875 --> 00:13:18.750
Until it arrives, I'd like you to hear
a story regarding my childhood.

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:20.333
Hmm?

00:13:20.333 --> 00:13:23.750
My father... He was a teacher.

00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:28.958
"An Intelligent Titan is conceived when a Pure Titan
lacking intelligence consumes some other Intelligent
Titan. By consuming an Intelligent Titan, it gains
consciousness as well as the consumed Titan's powers."

00:13:34.875 --> 00:13:36.250
What in the world?

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:37.625
Section Commander, that was--

00:13:37.625 --> 00:13:40.000
Yeah, I know.

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:44.917
Excuse me!

00:13:44.917 --> 00:13:46.083
Erwin...

00:13:48.208 --> 00:13:50.833
I thought as much.

00:13:50.833 --> 00:13:54.750
My gamble was right after all, Commander.

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:57.625
One of the First Interior Squad confessed.

00:13:57.625 --> 00:14:00.542
The current royal family is a fraud.

00:14:00.542 --> 00:14:03.542
Reiss is the true royal family.

00:14:03.542 --> 00:14:05.208
My word!

00:14:05.208 --> 00:14:09.625
Right now, Squad Levi is underway
rescuing Eren and Historia.

00:14:09.625 --> 00:14:14.875
Once they're recovered, we'll have
Historia Reiss enthroned as Queen.

00:14:14.875 --> 00:14:17.917
As one possessing the true royal blood.

00:14:19.333 --> 00:14:23.458
And you'll force the makeshift
King to relinquish the crown?

00:14:23.458 --> 00:14:25.583
To the true Queen...

00:14:25.583 --> 00:14:29.542
Without spilling any blood,
we will overthrow the government.

00:14:29.542 --> 00:14:35.458
And in front of the people, we'll reveal that
the system as they know it has all been a lie.

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:41.375
Very well. I'll back your plan.

00:14:41.375 --> 00:14:46.583
However, whether or not it should be
carried out is not for us to decide.

00:14:46.583 --> 00:14:49.458
You understand that, don't you, Erwin?

00:14:49.458 --> 00:14:51.958
Of course, Commander.

00:14:57.208 --> 00:15:00.000
Did anything come of the Reiss investigation?

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.375
I found out as much as I could.

00:15:03.375 --> 00:15:06.625
From all that I learned,
one curious incident stuck out.

00:15:06.625 --> 00:15:08.833
Incident?

00:15:08.833 --> 00:15:12.708
Commander Erwin! The Interior Squad
demands you turn yourself in!

00:15:13.708 --> 00:15:18.875
They're making a scene in the middle of
the city that you organized a murder!

00:15:18.875 --> 00:15:22.208
It seems the enemy's been
making plans of their own.

00:15:22.208 --> 00:15:24.125
Hange, get far from here.

00:15:24.125 --> 00:15:27.125
Huh?! What are you planning to do?

00:15:27.125 --> 00:15:30.333
I need to be the face of the Scout Regiment.

00:15:30.333 --> 00:15:33.375
You should act at your own discretion.

00:15:33.375 --> 00:15:36.875
Furthermore, the next commander
of the Scout Regiment...

00:15:36.875 --> 00:15:39.417
Hange Zoë, it's you.

00:15:40.458 --> 00:15:42.667
The Scouts are in your hands.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.167
Hey, he's here.

00:15:49.167 --> 00:15:50.708
It's Erwin.

00:15:55.917 --> 00:15:59.458
I take it you know who this is, Erwin?

00:16:00.542 --> 00:16:03.083
The boss of Reeves Company.

00:16:03.083 --> 00:16:04.833
Mr. Dimo Reeves.

00:16:04.833 --> 00:16:11.042
Yesterday, and in this very place, Eren Jaeger
was abducted by underlings of Reeves.

00:16:11.042 --> 00:16:16.458
However... that was all a mere scheme
between the Scouts and Reeves Company

00:16:16.458 --> 00:16:21.333
in order to evade handing over
Eren Jaeger to the government.

00:16:21.333 --> 00:16:27.417
And then... when Reeves was no longer needed,
they killed the man to keep him from talking.

00:16:27.417 --> 00:16:31.875
The murderer is still at large
and must be holed up with Eren.

00:16:31.875 --> 00:16:34.125
What a convenient story that is.

00:16:34.125 --> 00:16:40.292
What you scoundrels are doing... It's the same
as monopolizing Eren's power for yourself.

00:16:40.292 --> 00:16:44.417
And that act violates Clause Six
of the Charter of Humanity.

00:16:44.417 --> 00:16:46.958
You know which that one is, don't you?

00:16:46.958 --> 00:16:52.458
To prioritize one's own gain over the safety
and longevity of humanity, yes?

00:16:52.458 --> 00:16:54.083
That's right.

00:16:54.083 --> 00:17:00.167
Therefore, in acknowledgment of violating
said law, all Scouts are to be apprehended!

00:17:00.167 --> 00:17:01.625
Old Man...

00:17:08.542 --> 00:17:12.000
You think the fat cats will finally be satisfied?

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.917
I bet Reeves would be glad to know
he proved useful in the end.

00:17:15.917 --> 00:17:18.000
There's still Levi to deal with...

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
I told you, he'll show up on his own.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.417
We'll crush him when the time comes.

00:17:29.333 --> 00:17:31.375
What do we do now?!

00:17:33.708 --> 00:17:35.000
May I have a moment?

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.083
Hmm?

00:17:40.583 --> 00:17:43.500
Get away from my husband, you lowlife!

00:17:45.125 --> 00:17:47.500
In the battle of Trost District,

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:52.167
Mr. Reeves delayed the evacuation
by trying to take along his wealth.

00:17:53.583 --> 00:17:56.667
So what?! Are you saying he deserved to die?!

00:17:56.667 --> 00:18:02.208
However... given the current situation
with Trost on the verge of collapse...

00:18:02.208 --> 00:18:05.833
He planted his feet in the city,
and using any means possible...

00:18:05.833 --> 00:18:11.167
...he aided those with no place to go
while striving to revive the city.

00:18:11.167 --> 00:18:15.958
Except, by somebody's hands
that dream was extinguished.

00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:19.458
I promise you... I will avenge him.

00:18:29.583 --> 00:18:33.667
My father... He was a teacher.

00:18:33.667 --> 00:18:36.500
One day, we were learning history.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:39.458
To protect themselves from the Titans,

00:18:39.458 --> 00:18:44.250
humanity took refuge within the walls
and realized 100 years of peace.

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:51.042
In doing so, any records of our
earlier past were lost for all of time.

00:18:51.042 --> 00:18:53.167
That's what we're all taught.

00:18:54.167 --> 00:19:01.000
However, I... having doubts of my own,
asked my father a question.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.292
My father evaded answering the question
and ended class as normal.

00:19:07.292 --> 00:19:09.458
But...

00:19:09.458 --> 00:19:14.042
After we got home,
my father answered my question.

00:19:14.042 --> 00:19:16.167
He said the history books
given by the government

00:19:16.167 --> 00:19:20.083
were full of contradictions and mysteries.

00:19:20.083 --> 00:19:26.625
My father continued to tell me more,
and even as a child, I was astounded.

00:19:26.625 --> 00:19:33.792
There's a reason he didn't tell that story to the
entire class, but I wasn't smart enough to know.

00:19:35.125 --> 00:19:38.458
I'd been telling the other
kids my father's story,

00:19:38.458 --> 00:19:42.500
and one day, the Military Police
came to question me.

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:48.667
My father didn't come home that day...
He died in some accident in a faraway town.

00:19:48.667 --> 00:19:53.208
Based on what I knew,
my father was killed by the government.

00:19:55.083 --> 00:19:59.625
One hundred and seven years ago...
Humanity that fled into these walls...

00:19:59.625 --> 00:20:04.250
The King had altered their memories
to make them easy to rule.

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.542
That was my father's theory.

00:20:06.542 --> 00:20:13.292
Oh? Because if they hadn't done that,
civilization within the walls could never succeed?

00:20:13.292 --> 00:20:14.583
Yes.

00:20:14.583 --> 00:20:17.458
Ever since I was a child, I've been thinking...

00:20:17.458 --> 00:20:22.625
Why did my father have to die for
nothing more than getting close to the truth?

00:20:22.625 --> 00:20:28.000
Even those in the government would
believe what they're doing is just.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.417
However, I realized one thing about them...

00:20:32.417 --> 00:20:38.875
What they're trying to protect is not humanity,
but their gardens, houses, and lands.

00:20:38.875 --> 00:20:46.250
Rather, if anyone dares threaten their authority,
they'll be extinguished, whoever they are.

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:51.083
In the end, there was nothing
to justify my father's death.

00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:56.917
My father was killed by human greed...
And by the foolishness of his own son.

00:20:56.917 --> 00:21:02.417
Before I knew it, my father's theory
became truth inside my heart.

00:21:02.417 --> 00:21:08.250
Now, my mission in life... It's to prove
my father's theory once and for all.

00:21:12.167 --> 00:21:15.417
The Scout Regiment murdered a civilian!

00:21:15.417 --> 00:21:19.333
Some of them have fled capture!
They're still on the loose!

00:21:19.333 --> 00:21:23.208
If you spot any of these persons,
report it immediately!

00:21:23.208 --> 00:21:25.000
Told you, didn't I?

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.542
They're the ones who had that Titan battle here
and destroyed practically everything!

00:21:29.542 --> 00:21:33.542
I bet they're planning to use that
Eren monster to wipe us out!

00:21:36.667 --> 00:21:39.583
Captain, we bought the supplies.

00:21:39.583 --> 00:21:42.125
The Military Police were handing out these.

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:47.875
If this is true, the Scouts will be disbanded.

00:21:47.875 --> 00:21:50.542
I heard they'll be hunting for us tonight.

00:21:50.542 --> 00:21:56.458
They're also putting guards on all the vital roads,
and it's impossible to get through without a pass.

00:21:56.458 --> 00:21:58.500
Captain, what now?

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.500
If we don't hurry, Eren...

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.083
Calm down.

00:22:02.083 --> 00:22:04.292
They're using a wagon.

00:22:04.292 --> 00:22:08.000
It'll take at least a day
to reach Reiss' territory.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.750
We'll have to use that time
to come up with a plan.

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:14.000
Captain, I hear footsteps.

00:22:16.167 --> 00:22:18.167
They're coming this way.

00:23:57.542 --> 00:23:59.542
Those who throw away their life...

00:23:59.542 --> 00:24:01.667
Those who believe in justice...

00:24:01.667 --> 00:24:03.917
Those who protect the city...

00:24:03.917 --> 00:24:09.833
Courage which swells up from memories
gives people the courage to fight.

00:24:09.833 --> 00:24:12.096
Next episode: "Trust."
