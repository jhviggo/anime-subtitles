00:00:19.208 --> 00:00:23.458
There are names given
to each of the Nine Titans.

00:00:23.458 --> 00:00:27.667
That includes the Titan you will inherit.

00:00:27.667 --> 00:00:32.000
No matter which era this Titan
has found itself in,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.042
it has ever pushed forward,
seeking out freedom.

00:00:36.042 --> 00:00:39.208
For the sake of freedom, it fights.

00:00:41.125 --> 00:00:42.875
Its name...

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:45.167
...the Attack Titan.

00:00:49.208 --> 00:00:52.625
Eren was able to control
Pure Titans in the past...

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:55.417
...to escape a dire situation.

00:00:57.292 --> 00:01:01.083
If someone with royal blood
is made into a Titan that I touch,

00:01:01.083 --> 00:01:05.875
it might be possible for me to use
the Founding Titan's powers.

00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:11.667
But if they knew of that possibility,
what would the military do to Historia?

00:01:14.167 --> 00:01:16.042
Have a family.

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:17.042
Huh?

00:01:17.042 --> 00:01:20.583
Your wife, your child,
your neighbors if need be...

00:01:20.583 --> 00:01:22.958
Love someone inside the walls.

00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:28.000
If you can't do that, it'll only repeat.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The same history... The same
mistakes... Over and over...

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.708
To save Mikasa, Armin, and everyone else,
you must see it through.

00:01:38.708 --> 00:01:42.333
Mikasa? Armin? Who is that?

00:01:43.417 --> 00:01:46.958
Who knows? I'm not sure...

00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:49.042
Whose memories are those?

00:03:34.208 --> 00:03:36.583
Our enemy is... the world.

00:03:37.583 --> 00:03:42.875
But if we announce this to the public,
the walls will crumble into chaos.

00:03:42.875 --> 00:03:48.375
That's right. We still haven't fully grasped
the magnitude of this situation.

00:03:48.375 --> 00:03:51.958
Then will we deceive the people again?

00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.125
You wish to follow the lead of King Reiss

00:03:54.125 --> 00:03:58.333
and ensure the people of the walls
stay domesticated and ignorant?

00:03:59.625 --> 00:04:06.875
If so, then by what ideals did we rise
to take the crown from King Reiss?

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:12.000
Let's announce it.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.167
After all, we're just returning
the memories King Reiss stole

00:04:17.167 --> 00:04:20.458
back to the people a century later.

00:04:20.458 --> 00:04:24.792
We all share the same fate
as people of the walls.

00:04:24.792 --> 00:04:28.917
We must unite as one and
bring our entire strength together.

00:04:36.417 --> 00:04:40.875
The true identity of the Titans
who've threatened us are humans.

00:04:40.875 --> 00:04:45.917
They have the same ancestry as us.
We are "Subjects of Ymir."

00:04:45.917 --> 00:04:49.375
Our King erected these walls 100 years ago.

00:04:49.375 --> 00:04:52.458
He then altered our memories
using Titan powers

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:57.167
and made us believe humanity
outside the walls was wiped out.

00:04:57.167 --> 00:05:00.167
But in fact, humanity hasn't perished.

00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:06.458
When speaking of Subjects of Ymir,
they call us this: A race of devils.

00:05:08.125 --> 00:05:13.750
In the near future, the enemy will invade
our lands to obtain resources.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:19.417
Their plans began five years ago
with the attack of the Colossal Titan.

00:05:21.875 --> 00:05:27.583
I know the article's already published, but...
Is this as credible as you make it sound?

00:05:27.583 --> 00:05:33.750
At the very least, it's consistent with
the doubts we've had this whole time.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.958
I don't want to believe it,
either, but it's true.

00:05:39.792 --> 00:05:41.333
Thanks.

00:05:41.333 --> 00:05:44.042
So? How are people reacting?

00:05:44.042 --> 00:05:45.958
It's a bit of everything.

00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:49.333
Some accept it. Some laugh it off.

00:05:49.333 --> 00:05:54.875
Some lash out at the military
and insist it's a conspiracy theory.

00:05:54.875 --> 00:05:58.458
As all of you feared, it's become chaotic.

00:05:58.458 --> 00:06:01.333
Yeah, but there's no helping that.

00:06:01.333 --> 00:06:04.292
The reports are what put food in our mouths.

00:06:04.292 --> 00:06:07.375
The taxpayers decide what to make of it.

00:06:10.458 --> 00:06:14.708
That's one thing we're doing
better than the old King.

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:17.250
I couldn't be any prouder of all you.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.333
Eh?

00:06:18.333 --> 00:06:24.458
Not only as a fellow person of the walls,
but also as a working man.

00:06:25.875 --> 00:06:26.708
Thank you.

00:06:26.708 --> 00:06:31.667
Right... Next time, whip up an article
that pats us on the back.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.917
What will happen to all of us?

00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:44.875
Just as we've looked at Titans
with fear... with hate...

00:06:44.875 --> 00:06:49.625
...and with the wish that they
would disappear from the world,

00:06:49.625 --> 00:06:57.250
the people of the world see us not as humans,
but as dangerous monsters.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:02.583
And as a result, what if this hell
only repeats itself?

00:07:06.667 --> 00:07:13.292
Until the last of us are wiped out,
this hell... won't end.

00:07:21.875 --> 00:07:24.750
Hey, you heroes of the walls.

00:07:26.083 --> 00:07:29.000
Hitch... You came?

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.458
I just came to see you guys receive your medals.

00:07:32.458 --> 00:07:33.708
I see.

00:07:37.208 --> 00:07:38.708
Marlo was...

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:42.708
...brave all the way till the end.

00:07:44.167 --> 00:07:45.375
Yeah.

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:50.250
Right, Floch? Tell her.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:51.792
Sure...

00:07:54.042 --> 00:07:59.458
Marlo Freudenberg was an
urgent recruit, just like me.

00:07:59.458 --> 00:08:02.750
But he managed to bring us recruits together.

00:08:03.792 --> 00:08:10.125
The situation was hopeless and
the Scouts were on the verge of ruin.

00:08:10.125 --> 00:08:13.625
We thought all was lost
and were stricken with fear.

00:08:13.625 --> 00:08:17.542
But he... Only he inspired us.

00:08:18.625 --> 00:08:20.917
Yeah?

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:22.500
He was an amazing person.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.292
I know. That's why...

00:08:26.583 --> 00:08:29.708
That's probably why he never listened to me.

00:08:32.167 --> 00:08:34.417
But in the end...

00:08:34.417 --> 00:08:37.250
...I'm sure he regretted being there.

00:08:43.292 --> 00:08:44.875
Thanks.

00:08:44.875 --> 00:08:47.583
I'll laugh if you screw up the ceremony.

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:52.083
Hey! Why did you do that?

00:08:53.292 --> 00:08:58.125
Because... Someone has to tell the truth.

00:09:06.917 --> 00:09:12.833
I know how desperate you were
to revive Commander Erwin.

00:09:12.833 --> 00:09:14.375
That's right.

00:09:14.375 --> 00:09:18.500
It should have been the commander, not you.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:22.625
I'm not the only one who thinks that. We all do.

00:09:22.625 --> 00:09:26.292
Everyone who read the report
thinks the same thing:

00:09:26.292 --> 00:09:28.833
Why wasn't Erwin the one picked?

00:09:33.833 --> 00:09:37.583
What the hell do you know about Armin? Tell me!

00:09:37.583 --> 00:09:43.500
Nothing at all. I'm not his childhood friend,
and we're not chums, either.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.125
But I can still tell you why Armin was chosen.

00:09:47.125 --> 00:09:51.000
It's because you two and Captain Levi
brought your emotions into it.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.125
You thought the injection was all yours
and made a totally irrational decision!

00:09:56.125 --> 00:10:00.583
Basically, it was too hard for you
to let go of someone important.

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:06.792
Hey, you should shut your mouth.

00:10:08.542 --> 00:10:14.458
Eren. Deep down inside, I bet you think
you're always in the right.

00:10:14.458 --> 00:10:16.833
That's why you never gave up in the end.

00:10:16.833 --> 00:10:19.625
Just like a brat that won't listen.

00:10:22.083 --> 00:10:25.292
Eren, just leave him alone.

00:10:25.292 --> 00:10:28.792
Mikasa's the one who behaved like an adult.

00:10:28.792 --> 00:10:31.792
At least she gave up in the end.

00:10:35.375 --> 00:10:38.333
Hey! What the hell's wrong with you two?

00:10:38.333 --> 00:10:43.625
Floch. Let's not do this during a funeral
for our fallen comrades, all right?

00:10:43.625 --> 00:10:46.708
What's done is done, so let's just drop it.

00:10:46.708 --> 00:10:50.875
And you guys... You didn't
stand up to your superiors.

00:10:50.875 --> 00:10:53.583
You didn't even stop Eren and Mikasa.

00:10:53.583 --> 00:10:56.708
All you could do was watch.

00:10:56.708 --> 00:10:58.833
Medals for what?

00:10:58.833 --> 00:11:01.083
A funeral for who?

00:11:01.083 --> 00:11:06.083
You guys better start telling the truth
when you go to enlist more recruits.

00:11:06.083 --> 00:11:10.042
That way, you won't get cowards
like me joining by accident.

00:11:10.042 --> 00:11:13.667
What the hell are we supposed
to do now without Erwin?!

00:11:13.667 --> 00:11:16.542
Because... even fodder like me...

00:11:16.542 --> 00:11:20.083
I get that I'm completely expendable, but...

00:11:20.083 --> 00:11:23.333
Even fodder like me...

00:11:23.333 --> 00:11:26.250
...has a right to decide
if it's worth dying for!

00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:34.417
Floch is right.

00:11:35.583 --> 00:11:38.958
Commander Erwin is the one who should've lived.

00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:43.167
I'm not the one who can turn
this situation around.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.125
How can you be so sure of that?

00:11:55.917 --> 00:12:00.458
I really can't say if it was
the right decision or not.

00:12:00.458 --> 00:12:03.500
None of us know what the future holds.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:09.042
For starters, have you even seen beyond the walls?

00:12:09.042 --> 00:12:11.708
What is there beyond the walls?

00:12:15.292 --> 00:12:16.667
The sea.

00:12:16.667 --> 00:12:19.458
That's right. The sea.

00:12:19.458 --> 00:12:21.542
You haven't seen it, right?

00:12:21.542 --> 00:12:23.958
None of us really know anything!

00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:28.667
Fiery water, lands of ice, sandy snowfields!

00:12:28.667 --> 00:12:31.375
The possibilities are endless out there!

00:12:32.708 --> 00:12:36.000
On the other side of the wall, freedom is--

00:12:43.167 --> 00:12:44.917
Hey, brats.

00:12:44.917 --> 00:12:47.333
It's time. Line up.

00:13:13.542 --> 00:13:16.292
What did we find in the basement?

00:13:17.625 --> 00:13:20.917
Was it hope?

00:13:20.917 --> 00:13:23.208
Or was it despair?

00:13:24.333 --> 00:13:27.792
Our enemy was tremendously powerful.

00:13:27.792 --> 00:13:32.958
If nothing changes for the better,
that hideous scene will happen again.

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:40.708
I'd easily give up my life if it actually
managed to change something.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:50.375
But I... am not about to sacrifice Historia.

00:13:52.333 --> 00:13:54.250
What should I do?

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.500
I can't... tell anyone...

00:14:03.667 --> 00:14:06.583
I'm an Eldian who came from outside the walls!

00:14:07.708 --> 00:14:10.500
I'm a Subject of Ymir just like all you!

00:14:11.583 --> 00:14:13.458
King of the walls!

00:14:13.458 --> 00:14:17.000
Please, you have to kill the
Titans attacking the walls!

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.708
Before my wife... and children...!

00:14:19.708 --> 00:14:22.875
Before the people of the walls are eaten!

00:14:39.083 --> 00:14:40.417
Eren?

00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:50.500
"The people of our world wish to eradicate us
'Subjects of Ymir.' However, we must not simply
wait for our extermination. As long as we live,
we must strive to ensure our survival.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.958
However, is a fear-inspiring display
of power our only method of doing so?
Is it delusional to think we could all sit around
the same table and talk? I want to think it possible."

00:14:57.458 --> 00:15:03.125
The sound of Titans being crushed
by Trost's giant sledge went silent...

00:15:03.125 --> 00:15:05.667
...as snow began to stick.

00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:12.917
When the piles of snow began to melt,

00:15:12.917 --> 00:15:18.875
the military announced that Wall Maria
had been cleansed of Titans.

00:15:21.083 --> 00:15:24.333
By the time we began retiring
the elevators of Trost

00:15:24.333 --> 00:15:27.958
and started working to pave the main road,

00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:31.917
the flowers were budding
and the butterflies dancing.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.375
Refugees were finally permitted
to return to their hometowns

00:15:38.375 --> 00:15:43.542
roughly one year following
the attack on Trost District.

00:15:49.417 --> 00:15:54.958
And so, six years after the
Colossal Titan's first attack...

00:15:57.542 --> 00:16:03.167
...the Scouts once again resumed
expeditions past Wall Maria.

00:16:05.833 --> 00:16:08.542
It's just like you thought, Hange.

00:16:08.542 --> 00:16:11.958
The Titans inside Wall Maria
were pretty much all of them.

00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:16.375
We thinned out the majority
in just a single year.

00:16:16.375 --> 00:16:20.500
In that case, let's head straight
to our target as planned.

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:51.292
A Titan!

00:16:51.292 --> 00:16:54.167
One showed up, huh? Be careful!

00:16:59.333 --> 00:17:01.042
Right there...

00:17:05.292 --> 00:17:08.625
It's not able to move?

00:17:08.625 --> 00:17:14.750
With a body like that... it tried to
crawl to the wall, little by little?

00:17:26.167 --> 00:17:27.667
H-Hey!

00:17:29.875 --> 00:17:32.500
It was shipped to paradise.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.625
It's a fellow patriot.

00:17:39.917 --> 00:17:43.000
Let's go. We're close.

00:17:49.583 --> 00:17:51.042
Hey!

00:17:51.042 --> 00:17:54.958
Is it okay to leave it here?!
Shouldn't we kill it?!

00:17:56.083 --> 00:17:57.417
Shit!

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:34.708
I'm sure of it.

00:18:34.708 --> 00:18:39.417
This is the place where Eldians
were made into Titans.

00:18:39.417 --> 00:18:42.458
And... beyond that...

00:19:56.125 --> 00:19:57.708
Eyy!

00:19:57.708 --> 00:19:58.542
--My eyes!

00:19:58.542 --> 00:20:01.083
--Damn, it's salty!
--My eyes!

00:20:01.083 --> 00:20:05.583
Woohoo! Is this thing seriously all salt water?!

00:20:05.583 --> 00:20:07.500
Huh? What's that?

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:11.250
Hey, Hange! It might be poisonous,
so don't touch it.

00:20:16.708 --> 00:20:17.792
Eep!

00:20:31.125 --> 00:20:33.125
Look!

00:20:33.125 --> 00:20:35.375
I told you, Eren!

00:20:35.375 --> 00:20:38.750
A salt lake so big that merchants
could spend their whole lives

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:42.042
and still not get all the salt.

00:20:42.042 --> 00:20:46.167
The stuff I talked about wasn't wrong after all!

00:20:48.417 --> 00:20:50.292
Yeah...

00:20:50.292 --> 00:20:53.375
It's so damn big...

00:20:55.208 --> 00:20:57.125
Yeah.

00:20:57.125 --> 00:21:00.167
Look, Eren! On the other side of the wall--

00:21:00.167 --> 00:21:01.792
There's a sea.

00:21:04.875 --> 00:21:09.042
On the other side of the sea... is freedom.

00:21:11.292 --> 00:21:14.125
That's what I always believed.

00:21:18.667 --> 00:21:20.750
But I was wrong.

00:21:22.125 --> 00:21:27.542
On the other side of the sea... are enemies.

00:21:27.542 --> 00:21:32.917
Every part of this is exactly how
I saw it in my dad's memories.

00:21:41.083 --> 00:21:42.417
Hey...

00:21:44.667 --> 00:21:49.792
If we kill all our enemies... over there...

00:21:49.792 --> 00:23:57.078
...will we finally... be free?
