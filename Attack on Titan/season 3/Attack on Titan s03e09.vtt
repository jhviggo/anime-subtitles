00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:23.333
The true King within the walls...

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:26.750
...Rod Reiss and his devious
schemes were foiled.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.958
The Scouts succeeded in
rescuing Eren and Historia.

00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:33.708
However...

00:00:33.708 --> 00:00:36.833
Appearing before them was...

00:00:36.833 --> 00:00:40.125
...Rod Reiss, transformed into a Titan.

00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:43.458
Because I wanted to believe my father.

00:00:43.458 --> 00:00:47.000
I didn't want my father to hate me...

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.125
But now, it's time to say goodbye.

00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:54.708
When you're Queen, you can
punch that runt in the face.

00:00:54.708 --> 00:00:57.792
How do you intend to evacuate
the citizens in time?

00:00:57.792 --> 00:00:59.667
We won't evacuate.

00:00:59.667 --> 00:01:03.958
We'll have the citizens remain
in Orvud District just as they are.

00:03:27.708 --> 00:03:30.208
What the hell are you thinking, Erwin?!

00:03:30.208 --> 00:03:33.917
Keep the citizens in the
city without evacuating?!

00:03:33.917 --> 00:03:37.833
By the time it's dawn,
that Titan will be all over us!

00:03:37.833 --> 00:03:39.750
That Titan is an Abnormal.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.333
What the hell does that even mean?!

00:03:42.333 --> 00:03:47.792
The target Titan is strangely attracted
to high concentrations of people.

00:03:47.792 --> 00:03:49.750
Hence, Abnormal.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.917
It means the fellow will turn
a blind eye to a small village,

00:03:52.917 --> 00:03:56.875
ignoring it in favor of
reaching this fortified city.

00:03:56.875 --> 00:03:57.458
"Capital Mitras"                           "Orvud District"'
ignoring it in favor of
reaching this fortified city.

00:03:57.458 --> 00:04:02.333
"Capital Mitras"                           "Orvud District"'
If right now, you were to evacuate
the citizens within Wall Sina,

00:04:02.333 --> 00:04:08.000
"Capital Mitras"                           "Orvud District"'
it would be drawn towards them,
destroying the wall and all in its path.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.458
In the end, it would reach Mitras,
with the greatest density of people...

00:04:13.458 --> 00:04:17.375
...and deliver a devastating blow to humanity.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:26.208
On our way back, we attempted to use
Eren Jaeger's power to control Titans, but...

00:04:26.208 --> 00:04:29.208
...Rod Reiss' Titan showed no reaction.

00:04:36.583 --> 00:04:38.417
Stop, Titan!

00:04:39.792 --> 00:04:43.542
Hey, stop! I'm talking to you!

00:04:43.542 --> 00:04:45.667
Can't you hear me, idiot?!

00:04:45.667 --> 00:04:47.625
Rod Reiss, that means you!

00:04:47.625 --> 00:04:49.542
You tiny old man!

00:04:57.333 --> 00:05:02.583
If we are to stop that Titan, we must do so
outside the walls of Orvud District.

00:05:02.583 --> 00:05:07.625
For that to happen, we must
have the citizens act as bait.

00:05:07.625 --> 00:05:10.833
However, this does not change the fact

00:05:10.833 --> 00:05:15.208
that our first duty as soldiers
is to protect the citizens.

00:05:15.208 --> 00:05:17.875
Supposing we're unable to halt the target,

00:05:17.875 --> 00:05:21.417
we'll take measures so that
not a single citizen is killed.

00:05:22.417 --> 00:05:26.708
We'll announce an emergency
evacuation drill for Orvud District,

00:05:26.708 --> 00:05:31.750
so that if needed, the citizens
will be ready to evacuate at once.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
It seems there's no other choice...

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.292
The body of our target
is the largest we've seen.

00:05:44.292 --> 00:05:47.708
As such, it presents an easy target.

00:05:47.708 --> 00:05:51.167
Wall-mounted cannons should
prove highly effective, but...

00:05:51.167 --> 00:05:53.958
If that's not enough to bring it down...

00:05:55.333 --> 00:05:59.000
The Scout Regiment will throw
everything we have at it.

00:06:29.667 --> 00:06:33.958
As part of this drill, dummy Titans
and cannons will be used!

00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:37.500
It'll be a large-scale exercise
like nothing you've seen before!

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.667
However, we ask you not to panic!
Remain calm and follow our--

00:06:41.667 --> 00:06:43.333
Ma'am.

00:06:43.333 --> 00:06:48.000
I gotta get my store ready for the day,
so can't you let us go home?

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.125
Customers won't be coming today.

00:06:50.125 --> 00:06:51.208
Take the day off.

00:06:51.208 --> 00:06:53.250
I don't think so, lady.

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.000
What's with the drills when we're so far north?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.042
The military outs the government, and now this?

00:06:59.042 --> 00:07:00.667
What do you mean?

00:07:00.667 --> 00:07:04.750
I'm saying this is all just a
demonstration of their power.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.708
To prove that now the fake King is gone,
they're the ones in control.

00:07:08.708 --> 00:07:12.792
So, we're being dragged through
this for no reason at all?

00:07:12.792 --> 00:07:13.792
Yeah.

00:07:13.792 --> 00:07:19.000
At this rate, I think I prefer the fake King,
even if he was incompetent.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.958
H-Hey! Look over there!

00:07:26.542 --> 00:07:27.750
Smoke?

00:07:28.708 --> 00:07:30.333
Fire!

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.250
Well, how's that...?

00:08:18.583 --> 00:08:20.250
Fire!

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:26.542
The ground cannons seem even less effective.

00:08:26.542 --> 00:08:28.250
Of course they are.

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:33.000
The wall cannons barely hit the nape,
even with the better angle.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.750
What's the problem?

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.625
It's a mishmash of soldiers...

00:08:36.625 --> 00:08:38.417
Cannons they scraped together...

00:08:38.417 --> 00:08:40.583
Superficial leadership...

00:08:40.583 --> 00:08:43.583
To top it off, this is a northern region.

00:08:43.583 --> 00:08:47.792
Unlike troops on the front lines,
they have no battle experience.

00:08:47.792 --> 00:08:52.250
However, this is the best we're
going to get, and that's a fact.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:56.292
Yeah, that much is painfully obvious.

00:08:56.292 --> 00:09:01.792
Yet again, your strategy for the Scouts
boils down to another gamble.

00:09:01.792 --> 00:09:04.167
Just like everything else you conjure up.

00:09:04.167 --> 00:09:07.083
Erwin! I brought the goodies!

00:09:07.083 --> 00:09:10.083
All the gunpowder, ropes,
and netting I could find!

00:09:10.083 --> 00:09:12.083
We'll have to assemble it ourselves though.

00:09:12.083 --> 00:09:16.667
Oh, and this! There's another
on the opposite side.

00:09:16.667 --> 00:09:19.000
The trigger's held in place,
so when it's fired,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.583
it'll wind itself back up,
just like ODM gear.

00:09:22.583 --> 00:09:25.125
So, is the artillery doing any damage?

00:09:25.125 --> 00:09:28.083
Slightly more than a pissing insect.

00:09:28.083 --> 00:09:31.833
Then we're really planning on using this?

00:09:31.833 --> 00:09:35.208
Levi, Jean, Sasha, Conny...

00:09:35.208 --> 00:09:36.792
Take care of that side.

00:09:36.792 --> 00:09:38.083
Roger!

00:09:42.542 --> 00:09:45.667
How should we do this? Let's see...

00:09:45.667 --> 00:09:49.167
Try to imagine we're wrapping up
a nice gift for someone special...

00:09:49.167 --> 00:09:52.542
I believe you've heard from Levi, Historia.

00:09:52.542 --> 00:09:54.917
Supposing we live through this,

00:09:54.917 --> 00:09:59.458
we'll have you become the Queen,
ruling our world in the walls.

00:09:59.458 --> 00:10:04.000
Naturally, having you on the
front lines poses a problem.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.417
I doubt it will work.

00:10:06.417 --> 00:10:11.083
You think the people so naÃ¯ve that
they'd bow to a ruler in name only?

00:10:14.292 --> 00:10:16.500
What is it that you're thinking?

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.125
Fire!

00:10:24.417 --> 00:10:26.083
Historia...

00:10:27.042 --> 00:10:30.625
Just look how strong she's become...

00:10:30.625 --> 00:10:33.875
For the longest time,
I thought she was the weak one.

00:10:33.875 --> 00:10:35.333
I had it wrong.

00:10:37.083 --> 00:10:39.000
The weak one was me.

00:10:40.708 --> 00:10:44.417
Somewhere along the line,
I thought myself special.

00:10:44.417 --> 00:10:48.250
Which is why, when other
soldiers died for my sake...

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:51.333
...I accepted it like it was natural.

00:10:51.333 --> 00:10:53.583
The same goes for my Titan powers.

00:10:54.833 --> 00:10:57.167
I hated Titans more than anything...

00:10:57.167 --> 00:11:01.125
...but when I became one,
I thought nothing of it.

00:11:01.125 --> 00:11:05.458
I wanted to believe that strength was all mine.

00:11:05.458 --> 00:11:08.125
That's exactly how a weakling thinks.

00:11:13.042 --> 00:11:15.083
What's the next step?

00:11:15.083 --> 00:11:18.208
So what if I'm able to plug up the wall?

00:11:18.208 --> 00:11:21.500
Is that enough to save humanity?

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.417
I'm not special, I'm nobody.

00:11:26.167 --> 00:11:31.500
But... it's all of humanity that
got the short end of the stick...

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.208
...being stuck with me as their trump card.

00:11:40.708 --> 00:11:41.875
Hey.

00:11:45.042 --> 00:11:48.500
The kids in this city remind me...

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.833
...of us on that day.

00:11:52.875 --> 00:11:54.000
Yeah...

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.417
Nobody thinks today is the day
a Titan bigger than the wall attacks.

00:12:00.542 --> 00:12:04.542
They might end up seeing the
same sight as we did that day.

00:12:04.542 --> 00:12:07.000
But there's one big difference.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.292
Atop the walls, soldiers stand to face the Titan.

00:12:10.292 --> 00:12:12.833
And that would be us.

00:12:12.833 --> 00:12:15.583
Yeah, stack it up on the edge.

00:12:26.292 --> 00:12:27.708
Eren.

00:12:27.708 --> 00:12:30.875
There's no time to stop. Keep your hands busy.

00:12:34.792 --> 00:12:35.792
Eren!

00:12:37.125 --> 00:12:38.625
Wh-Whoa!

00:12:38.625 --> 00:12:39.875
What are you doing?!

00:12:40.875 --> 00:12:43.875
Making a wound? It's too early for that!

00:12:43.875 --> 00:12:45.167
No...

00:12:45.167 --> 00:12:48.375
Just beating the shit out of a useless brat.

00:12:48.375 --> 00:12:51.750
I hope he's dead and gone for good.

00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:56.958
"The transfigured form of Rod Reiss resulting
from the transformation serum. Its size exceeds
even the Colossal Titan and it possesses
a similar ability to emit scalding steam."

00:12:57.583 --> 00:13:00.667
Adjust your aim for a moving target!

00:13:00.667 --> 00:13:03.417
Focus all cannons on its nape!

00:13:04.375 --> 00:13:05.792
Fire!

00:13:13.458 --> 00:13:16.042
Good! That ripped off its flesh!

00:13:16.042 --> 00:13:17.792
Finish it off with a volley!

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.667
Argh, hot!

00:13:21.667 --> 00:13:24.125
Shit, not good...

00:13:25.708 --> 00:13:27.375
The wind changed direction!

00:13:27.375 --> 00:13:29.917
Captain! I can't see a thing!

00:13:29.917 --> 00:13:33.583
Doesn't matter! The target
is straight below! Fire away!

00:13:42.708 --> 00:13:44.417
Are we too late?

00:14:02.333 --> 00:14:03.833
It's a Titan...

00:14:25.792 --> 00:14:26.833
Titan!

00:14:26.833 --> 00:14:28.750
Wait! Don't go anywhere!

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:30.208
Shut up!

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.167
Retreat! Everyone, retreat!

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:45.792
Shit... It's breaking through...

00:14:45.792 --> 00:14:48.417
The city I grew up in...

00:14:48.417 --> 00:14:50.708
...is done for.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.167
Stand back, Captain.

00:14:55.167 --> 00:14:57.958
We'll take over from here.

00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.458
Eren, we're up.

00:14:59.458 --> 00:15:00.625
Right.

00:15:02.125 --> 00:15:05.500
Armin, another thing's different from then.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:06.542
Eh?

00:15:06.542 --> 00:15:10.125
It might not be all they hoped for, but now...

00:15:10.125 --> 00:15:12.417
...humanity has an ace up its sleeve.

00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:20.125
Is that... a Titan?!

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:24.375
We're good to go!

00:15:36.708 --> 00:15:38.125
Let the attack...

00:15:39.542 --> 00:15:40.917
...commence!

00:15:50.417 --> 00:15:52.292
Take this!

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.750
Yes! It's losing balance!

00:16:15.167 --> 00:16:16.333
Eren!

00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:28.500
So you're saying...

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.875
In order to defeat that Titan...

00:16:30.875 --> 00:16:33.667
...we'll stuff gunpowder into its throat...

00:16:33.667 --> 00:16:36.833
...and hope it's enough to blow up its nape?

00:16:36.833 --> 00:16:38.417
Correct.

00:16:38.417 --> 00:16:44.167
With the heat that it's producing,
I imagine it'll ignite without a detonator.

00:16:44.167 --> 00:16:48.583
So as long as it hangs its mouth
wide open for us like an idiot...

00:16:48.583 --> 00:16:53.042
An explosion against its nape
won't have the desired effect.

00:16:53.042 --> 00:16:57.125
Which is why the explosion
must go off from the inside.

00:16:57.125 --> 00:17:02.750
But the target may be protecting itself
by dragging its face along the ground.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:06.667
For all we know, it may not
even have a mouth to open.

00:17:06.667 --> 00:17:08.917
That's the gamble this time.

00:17:12.458 --> 00:17:14.083
Jackpot!

00:17:34.083 --> 00:17:38.292
All troops! Finish it off with ODM gear!

00:17:38.292 --> 00:17:39.875
It may be gigantic,

00:17:39.875 --> 00:17:43.958
but its vitals are still one meter high
and ten centimeters across.

00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:49.667
Unless we destroy the main body, it will
regenerate and form another shield of heat.

00:17:49.667 --> 00:17:51.292
We've only got one shot.

00:17:51.292 --> 00:17:52.333
Hot!

00:17:52.333 --> 00:17:54.500
Shit! Which is it?!

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.375
Historia?!

00:17:57.375 --> 00:18:02.083
I understand your reasons, but...
I can't approve you entering combat.

00:18:02.083 --> 00:18:04.167
Commander, please!

00:18:04.167 --> 00:18:07.708
I've finally grasped the duty
I was meant to fulfill!

00:18:07.708 --> 00:18:10.125
That's why I'm here right now!

00:18:12.208 --> 00:18:14.125
Well, in any case...

00:18:14.125 --> 00:18:19.083
With my body as it is...
I can't exactly stop you, can I?

00:18:21.542 --> 00:18:24.750
I'm sorry for being so selfish.

00:18:25.708 --> 00:18:29.375
But this is the first time
I've gone against my parents...

00:18:30.375 --> 00:18:33.917
This is my first fight... with my father.

00:18:39.792 --> 00:18:40.917
Father!

00:18:40.917 --> 00:18:42.750
Listen to me, Father!

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:45.125
We can kill the Titans, once and for all!

00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:47.167
Why?! Why don't you understand?!

00:18:47.167 --> 00:18:49.750
You know I'll be fine, Brother.

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:51.167
Pray for me...

00:18:51.167 --> 00:18:54.375
Alma, you're the only one
who understands me...

00:18:54.375 --> 00:18:56.417
Leave it to me, Father.

00:18:56.417 --> 00:18:59.792
I won't lose to the ghosts of our ancestors!

00:18:59.792 --> 00:19:01.292
Oh, God...

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.542
Was our city just saved?

00:19:27.542 --> 00:19:29.500
Hey... You okay?

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.333
Are you injured?

00:19:32.875 --> 00:19:35.625
Were you the one who
dealt the finishing blow?

00:19:37.042 --> 00:19:40.625
Was that all... my imagination?

00:19:40.625 --> 00:19:43.292
Am I... really...

00:19:43.292 --> 00:19:45.875
...acting on my own accord?

00:19:48.167 --> 00:19:51.458
I... don't know.

00:19:51.458 --> 00:19:53.500
But...

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:57.042
The one always going with the flow is...

00:19:57.042 --> 00:19:59.292
...without a doubt, me.

00:20:01.042 --> 00:20:02.458
I am...

00:20:03.708 --> 00:20:06.792
I am Historia Reiss.

00:20:06.792 --> 00:20:09.167
The true ruler of the walls.

00:20:22.875 --> 00:20:26.708
I'm afraid... I cannot die right now.

00:20:26.708 --> 00:20:29.792
Please, forgive me.

00:20:29.792 --> 00:20:31.458
Gimme a damn break...

00:20:31.458 --> 00:20:33.208
You hear me, don'tcha?

00:20:34.542 --> 00:20:36.000
Gotta name?

00:20:37.375 --> 00:20:40.958
That's why I'm able to do any job asked of me.

00:20:40.958 --> 00:20:43.708
Are you any different?

00:20:43.708 --> 00:20:45.208
Doesn't matter to me.

00:20:45.208 --> 00:20:47.208
It's all pointless anyways.

00:20:47.208 --> 00:20:48.667
Captain Ackermann!

00:20:48.667 --> 00:20:50.417
Idiots! Get away!

00:21:20.667 --> 00:21:21.792
Kenny.

00:21:28.292 --> 00:21:30.083
Oh, gee...

00:21:30.083 --> 00:21:31.792
It's you?

00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:38.458
Your comrades we fought...
They all ended up getting crushed.

00:21:38.458 --> 00:21:40.833
Are you the only survivor?

00:21:42.125 --> 00:21:43.958
Seems that way.

00:21:48.083 --> 00:21:50.792
Report back. I'm fine here alone.

00:21:50.792 --> 00:21:52.250
Understood.

00:22:01.583 --> 00:22:04.542
With those burns and that blood loss...

00:22:04.542 --> 00:22:07.458
...there's no helping you now.

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:12.125
Yeah?

00:22:13.333 --> 00:22:15.083
I wonder...

00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:01.458
Levi stumbles across Kenny
on the brink of death.

00:24:01.458 --> 00:24:04.500
In his hazy and fading mind...

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:09.000
...he remembers the man
he once called a friend.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.096
Next episode: "Friends."
