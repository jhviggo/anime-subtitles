WEBVTT

00:00:17.875 --> 00:00:20.083
You had your time, but it's over!

00:00:20.083 --> 00:00:22.333
Look above you, morons!

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.917
Where are Eren and Christa?

00:00:33.917 --> 00:00:35.583
It's no use!

00:00:35.583 --> 00:00:40.542
If you don't turn yourselves in, every last
Scout we captured will get the noose!

00:00:40.542 --> 00:00:43.417
I entrusted something to Commander Pyxis.

00:00:43.417 --> 00:00:46.083
When it comes, I will only watch.

00:00:46.083 --> 00:00:47.875
It's up to you to decide.

00:00:47.875 --> 00:00:50.375
You... and them.

00:02:34.917 --> 00:02:37.250
That sure is a lot of wagons.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.542
What's going on?

00:02:39.542 --> 00:02:41.167
You don't know?

00:02:41.167 --> 00:02:44.708
Right now, all the heads of the
military are meeting inside the castle

00:02:44.708 --> 00:02:47.625
to finally dismantle the Scout Regiment.

00:02:47.625 --> 00:02:48.708
See?

00:02:48.708 --> 00:02:52.375
There's the gallows for
hanging their commander.

00:02:52.375 --> 00:02:56.750
I bet it's ongoing as we speak...
his final judgment.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:03.000
If humanity loses the Scout Regiment,
that means humanity loses their spear.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.208
When enemies close in, you guard not with a
shield, but a spear that eliminates the threat.

00:03:09.208 --> 00:03:14.208
Suppose now, if this instant,
Wall Rose were to be breached...

00:03:14.208 --> 00:03:19.542
The residents of Wall Rose would again
flee and take refuge in Wall Sina.

00:03:19.542 --> 00:03:25.458
But the earlier evacuation left stockpiles
with no more than a few days at best.

00:03:25.458 --> 00:03:31.333
In the blink of an eye, most of the residents
would be forced to fight for survival.

00:03:31.333 --> 00:03:38.625
Wall Rose and Sina... Humanity would be split
in two factions and civil war would erupt.

00:03:38.625 --> 00:03:45.042
Even if the wall was not breached, Wall Rose
is continually suffering a food shortage.

00:03:45.042 --> 00:03:48.500
It may not be Titans that breach Wall Sina...

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.417
There's a chance the residents
of Wall Rose do it first.

00:03:57.125 --> 00:03:59.417
Reclaim Wall Maria.

00:03:59.417 --> 00:04:04.333
If humanity is to ever hope for
a future, that is the only way.

00:04:04.333 --> 00:04:08.542
Are you implying that the Scouts
are needed for such a cause?

00:04:08.542 --> 00:04:13.125
Our duty as Scouts has always been
to charge forth at the enemy.

00:04:13.125 --> 00:04:17.083
Cowering away will not solve anything.

00:04:17.083 --> 00:04:23.000
Or could it be... you have some sort
of secret plan to overcome this ordeal?

00:04:29.167 --> 00:04:32.500
Erwin, I don't think you understand.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.292
The reason you're here today is not
to discuss our future within the walls,

00:04:37.292 --> 00:04:41.250
nor is it because of something
as simple as murder.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.250
Clause Six, Charter of Humanity.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.542
"Thou shall not prioritize one's own
gain over the longevity of humanity."

00:04:48.542 --> 00:04:50.958
You're here for this grave offense.

00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:55.625
Indeed. You've refused to hand
over Eren Jaeger multiple times.

00:04:55.625 --> 00:04:58.833
In doing so, you've violated the Charter.

00:04:58.833 --> 00:05:02.042
But Eren is vital for reclaiming Wall Maria!

00:05:02.042 --> 00:05:04.458
That is not for the Scouts to decide!

00:05:04.458 --> 00:05:07.958
Eren Jaeger is a Titan whose
powers are not understood!

00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:11.458
Sheltering him within the walls
is a risk to humanity!

00:05:11.458 --> 00:05:16.083
It's absurd for a single commander
to have control of him alone.

00:05:16.083 --> 00:05:19.875
And yet, you stubbornly persisted
in some plan of yours.

00:05:19.875 --> 00:05:24.500
Not only did you feign his abduction
and conceal Eren Jaeger...

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.125
...but you silenced Dimo Reeves
since he knew of your plans.

00:05:28.125 --> 00:05:30.208
This is clearly treason.

00:05:30.208 --> 00:05:35.208
It is not a stretch to say that
you're the threat to humanity.

00:05:35.208 --> 00:05:36.542
Commander Pyxis.

00:05:36.542 --> 00:05:37.542
Hmm?

00:05:37.542 --> 00:05:42.083
The Garrison and Scout Regiments
both risk their lives on the front lines.

00:05:42.083 --> 00:05:45.667
How are we to know that
you're not his comrade?

00:05:45.667 --> 00:05:50.542
I'm quite disturbed that you believe
we would align ourselves with the Scouts.

00:05:50.542 --> 00:05:54.250
Nothing is more senseless
than humans killing humans.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:06:00.542
In this cramped world that we humans have,
one spark will engulf all in no time.

00:06:00.542 --> 00:06:03.583
When it came time to defend Trost District,

00:06:03.583 --> 00:06:08.792
that's what I told my soldiers
before sending many to their deaths.

00:06:08.792 --> 00:06:14.500
If the Scout Regiment is that one spark,
it should be smothered at once.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:20.500
After all, if the Titans do manage to break
the wall and find hardly anyone left inside...

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.583
...those poor Titans might go hungry.

00:06:25.208 --> 00:06:26.708
Very well.

00:06:26.708 --> 00:06:28.792
Allow us to discuss.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.792
Your Majesty... May we?

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.042
Erwin... Is this how you want it to end?!

00:06:54.875 --> 00:06:59.250
In the name of the King,
I will announce your judgment.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.333
Erwin Smith.

00:07:01.333 --> 00:07:07.083
For violating Clause Six of the Charter
of Humanity, you are sentenced to death.

00:07:09.125 --> 00:07:12.333
Your execution will be carried out immediately.

00:07:12.333 --> 00:07:13.750
Take him.

00:07:16.542 --> 00:07:19.458
Is this what you wanted, Erwin?!

00:07:25.875 --> 00:07:27.958
With this, you're...

00:07:42.708 --> 00:07:44.583
Wall Rose...

00:07:44.583 --> 00:07:46.375
...has been breached!

00:07:49.583 --> 00:07:51.708
The Colossal Titan appeared out of nowhere!

00:07:51.708 --> 00:07:56.917
Along with the Armored Titan, they broke
through both gates of Calaneth District!

00:07:56.917 --> 00:08:00.917
Currently, refugees from the East
are flocking here for safety!

00:08:01.958 --> 00:08:04.458
Establish a route for the evacuees!

00:08:04.458 --> 00:08:08.833
Have all Garrison troops
converge and defend the East!

00:08:08.833 --> 00:08:11.583
Get the evacuees safely to Wall Sina!

00:08:11.583 --> 00:08:15.333
Everyone, hurry! Saving the
evacuees is our top priority!

00:08:15.333 --> 00:08:15.917
--Sir!

00:08:15.917 --> 00:08:17.208
--No!
--Sir!

00:08:17.208 --> 00:08:18.208
Hmm?

00:08:18.208 --> 00:08:20.958
Close up all of the gates to Wall Sina!

00:08:20.958 --> 00:08:24.792
Don't let a single refugee inside!

00:08:24.792 --> 00:08:26.542
Huh?!

00:08:26.542 --> 00:08:31.125
B-But that's... all the Wall Rose residents.

00:08:31.125 --> 00:08:34.958
Your command is to sit back and
watch as half of humanity dies?

00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:38.708
It's just like he said earlier!
That's asking for civil war!

00:08:38.708 --> 00:08:42.833
We can't let the government lose control!
If that happens, it's over!

00:08:42.833 --> 00:08:46.875
B-But... That's only a mere possibility!

00:08:46.875 --> 00:08:49.667
It's enough for that possibility to exist!

00:08:49.667 --> 00:08:52.833
Our authority is and always will be absolute!

00:08:52.833 --> 00:08:54.875
Now, get moving!

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:03.417
Shit...

00:09:03.417 --> 00:09:06.708
To think the wall would be
breached at a time like this...

00:09:06.708 --> 00:09:09.292
Though, there is a silver lining.

00:09:09.292 --> 00:09:11.667
We've already found the power.

00:09:11.667 --> 00:09:15.708
All that's left is to bide our time
until the vessel takes it.

00:09:15.708 --> 00:09:20.625
That's right. There's no need to be
flustered by this little disaster.

00:09:20.625 --> 00:09:23.583
As long as Wall Sina holds up, we'll be fine.

00:09:23.583 --> 00:09:26.625
Yes, once Lord Reiss comes back...

00:09:28.583 --> 00:09:30.917
Let's do it! Close the gates!

00:09:30.917 --> 00:09:31.833
Wait!

00:09:31.833 --> 00:09:33.875
It'll be too late if we wait!

00:09:36.333 --> 00:09:38.292
Who gets to choose?

00:09:38.292 --> 00:09:40.167
Who decides?

00:09:40.167 --> 00:09:42.542
What are you doing?! Hurry it up!

00:09:42.542 --> 00:09:45.208
It'll be treason if you don't!

00:09:47.542 --> 00:09:48.583
I will not!

00:09:48.583 --> 00:09:49.667
What?!

00:09:49.667 --> 00:09:50.958
Hey...

00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:54.958
I... am a human of Wall Rose!

00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.083
I will not allow the gates to be closed!

00:09:57.083 --> 00:09:58.000
You fool!

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.333
I will stand behind him.

00:10:06.125 --> 00:10:09.625
Dhalis Zachary...

00:10:09.625 --> 00:10:14.917
Are you surprised at all by
their reaction, Premier Zachary?

00:10:14.917 --> 00:10:17.167
No... Not a bit.

00:10:17.167 --> 00:10:20.583
Zachary, what's the meaning of this?!

00:10:20.583 --> 00:10:23.375
That report just now was a false alarm.

00:10:23.375 --> 00:10:25.208
Rest assured.

00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:29.833
At the moment, there has been
no report of a Titan attack.

00:10:29.833 --> 00:10:32.208
You bastards! What is this farce?!

00:10:32.208 --> 00:10:35.250
If you want the mastermind, it's me.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.000
Pyxis?!

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.333
It seems most of the Interior Police
are off somewhere or other.

00:10:41.333 --> 00:10:43.583
I suppose that's quite fortunate.

00:10:43.583 --> 00:10:44.833
What do you mean?!

00:10:44.833 --> 00:10:51.250
Earlier, I declared to you that the Garrison
Regiment isn't aligned with the Scout Regiment.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.250
But I did forget to mention one thing...

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:57.750
I'm not aligned with any of you, either.

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:02.167
While I do possess some of the
same feelings as Erwin here...

00:11:02.167 --> 00:11:05.375
...I considered leaving things
up to your government

00:11:05.375 --> 00:11:09.667
if that were the better choice
for the sake of humanity.

00:11:09.667 --> 00:11:16.042
You are, after all, much wiser than us
when it comes to Titans and the walls.

00:11:16.042 --> 00:11:20.875
Supposing you actually cared about
saving as many people as possible,

00:11:20.875 --> 00:11:24.833
I would have been fine
sending Erwin to the gallows.

00:11:24.833 --> 00:11:31.750
Of course, depending on your decision,
all of us were prepared to forfeit our heads.

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:36.542
However, the answer you've
given us is very clear!

00:11:36.542 --> 00:11:40.875
We may be ignorant about the Titans
and their powers, but...

00:11:40.875 --> 00:11:45.500
I daresay, we in our ignorance can save
far more people than you ever could!

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:50.042
Y-You're a fool! What do you think
undermining us will accomplish?!

00:11:50.042 --> 00:11:52.958
The citizens will never listen to you!

00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:55.792
They'll obey whatever the crown says!

00:11:55.792 --> 00:11:58.208
The regional lords will have none of this!

00:11:58.208 --> 00:12:01.667
It seems you don't quite understand.

00:12:01.667 --> 00:12:04.083
This is no mere threat.

00:12:04.083 --> 00:12:05.917
It's a coup d'état.

00:12:07.667 --> 00:12:11.083
We've successfully restrained
the Interior Police!

00:12:11.083 --> 00:12:12.333
Mmm.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:20.708
The thing with soldiers, they'll obey
their superior officer over the king.

00:12:20.708 --> 00:12:23.750
Especially when the king in question is a fraud.

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:27.208
We will put in place a new ruler of our own.

00:12:27.208 --> 00:12:30.667
It can't be... They're actually...

00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:33.542
Don't even think you can
get away with this hoax!

00:12:33.542 --> 00:12:36.125
If that disaster had in fact happened...

00:12:36.125 --> 00:12:41.625
The decision that all of you made violates
Clause Six of the Charter of Humanity.

00:12:41.625 --> 00:12:44.042
Furthermore, is installing a fake king

00:12:44.042 --> 00:12:48.708
to personally control and run the
government not punishable by death?

00:12:55.833 --> 00:12:57.792
Shit! Wake up, dotard!

00:12:57.792 --> 00:12:59.292
What? Time to eat?

00:12:59.292 --> 00:13:01.625
Shut up, you useless oaf!

00:13:08.625 --> 00:13:10.208
Erwin...

00:13:10.208 --> 00:13:12.083
This is your victory.

00:13:13.083 --> 00:13:14.875
Aren't you happy?

00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:17.833
Nile.

00:13:17.833 --> 00:13:23.167
Humanity has just begun down a new path...
One far more dangerous than before.

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:45.208
And there you have it.
The coup d'état was successful.

00:13:45.208 --> 00:13:49.667
Premier Zachary has control of
the capital and administrative district.

00:13:49.667 --> 00:13:53.125
For the time being, the nobility haven't rebelled.

00:13:53.125 --> 00:13:56.042
What about the Boss Reeves incident?

00:13:56.042 --> 00:13:59.292
We got a confession that proved
the charges unfounded.

00:13:59.292 --> 00:14:01.958
His son Flegel really pulled through big time.

00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:03.792
Don't you get it?!

00:14:03.792 --> 00:14:07.083
The government doesn't give
a shit about saving any of us!

00:14:07.083 --> 00:14:10.208
Face the truth now, because it'll be
too late when you're dead!

00:14:10.208 --> 00:14:15.958
That's right! If Titans attack us again,
there'll be nothing left this time!

00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:18.625
Not the company! Not our families!

00:14:18.625 --> 00:14:21.667
Let's print the truth before that happens!

00:14:23.083 --> 00:14:28.625
Just like it's written right there, it shows the
charges were bogus, they abused their power,

00:14:28.625 --> 00:14:32.167
and that King Fritz was a total fake.

00:14:32.167 --> 00:14:35.792
All our actions were justified self-defense.

00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:39.542
In other words, we're free people now.

00:14:42.875 --> 00:14:47.125
Woohoo!

00:14:47.125 --> 00:14:50.667
No... This can't be...

00:14:50.667 --> 00:14:52.958
Looks like the gamble paid off.

00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.458
Yeah.

00:14:54.458 --> 00:14:57.000
It wasn't just Erwin though.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.125
The lone choices of many
managed to change the world.

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:07.625
And I managed to kill the
three people you loaned me.

00:15:07.625 --> 00:15:09.125
I'm sorry.

00:15:12.083 --> 00:15:18.833
The thing is, part of the Interior Police, their
leader, Eren, and Historia are somewhere else.

00:15:18.833 --> 00:15:21.042
If we don't find them soon...

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:25.208
I may have a clue about that.

00:15:25.208 --> 00:15:28.583
Let's get there and put an end to this battle.

00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:33.958
"Underground Chapel"
"A sacred location where the royal family's power
has been passed down for generations. The walls
are composed of a naturally luminescent ore."

00:15:36.042 --> 00:15:38.875
As a result of Erwin's actions,

00:15:38.875 --> 00:15:42.750
it was declared that the current
regime would be ousted.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:45.208
That announcement came immediately after

00:15:45.208 --> 00:15:48.583
the military gained control of the
capital and administrative district.

00:15:48.583 --> 00:15:54.208
And took place upon the gallows
constructed specifically for him.

00:15:54.208 --> 00:15:55.667
That's right.

00:15:55.667 --> 00:15:59.167
It's exactly how Premier Zachary
explained in the speech.

00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:03.417
Understand that our goal
is not to establish military rule.

00:16:03.417 --> 00:16:07.500
In place of Fritz, a new ruler will
come from the true royal family.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:10.417
They will be the one responsible
for leading the people.

00:16:10.417 --> 00:16:12.375
I understand that well enough,

00:16:12.375 --> 00:16:17.250
but do you really think people will simply
accept a new ruler just like that?

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:20.625
There're a lot of citizens out
there who are very worried.

00:16:20.625 --> 00:16:23.708
At this point, who do we trust?

00:16:25.625 --> 00:16:31.625
As far as humanity's concerned, we should
have let the government do as they please.

00:16:31.625 --> 00:16:33.667
Like Commander Pyxis was saying,

00:16:33.667 --> 00:16:38.292
they've somehow devised a means
of keeping humanity alive until now.

00:16:38.292 --> 00:16:44.208
Even if they watch as half of humanity dies,
it's better than us going extinct.

00:16:46.583 --> 00:16:52.958
Should I have let Eren go, risked my comrade's
lives, given up both my life and my duty,

00:16:52.958 --> 00:16:55.917
and entrusted it all to the government?

00:16:55.917 --> 00:17:00.042
If humanity is more precious
than one single life...

00:17:03.583 --> 00:17:06.917
Your duty is as painful as ever.

00:17:06.917 --> 00:17:10.083
Dying seems a far easier option.

00:17:11.458 --> 00:17:15.833
In that case, why didn't you do as you said?

00:17:15.833 --> 00:17:16.792
That's...

00:17:16.792 --> 00:17:19.958
Shall I tell you my reason?

00:17:19.958 --> 00:17:23.083
For a long time, I've hated those bastards!

00:17:23.083 --> 00:17:23.750
--Huh?

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:25.458
--They piss me off!
--Huh?

00:17:25.458 --> 00:17:28.958
Those pompous pricks and pigs
who think they're important...

00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:32.500
No... Maybe I actually liked them.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:36.042
I've been dreaming for
this day to come for ages.

00:17:36.042 --> 00:17:42.083
That is... Even if you hadn't done it, I would've
given it a shot before I kicked the bucket.

00:17:42.083 --> 00:17:48.083
I couldn't care less if this coup d'état
is good or bad for humanity.

00:17:48.083 --> 00:17:50.917
I'm quite the scoundrel, right?

00:17:50.917 --> 00:17:53.833
But you're no different than me.

00:17:54.833 --> 00:17:57.917
You didn't want to die.

00:17:57.917 --> 00:18:04.500
Just like me, you prioritize yourself
over the fate of humanity.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:08.667
I... must be very conceited to think that.

00:18:08.667 --> 00:18:11.375
What's your reason?

00:18:11.375 --> 00:18:14.292
Now it's your turn to answer.

00:18:16.458 --> 00:18:18.583
I...

00:18:18.583 --> 00:18:21.250
...have a dream.

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:23.750
One I've had since I was a child...

00:18:34.333 --> 00:18:36.000
Hange.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.042
You might know where they are?

00:18:38.042 --> 00:18:41.000
Yeah, I'll explain.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.417
Erwin gave me this Scout investigation
report regarding Lord Reiss' land.

00:18:45.417 --> 00:18:50.417
Most of it has to do with an incident five
years ago that shook up the Reiss family.

00:18:50.417 --> 00:18:51.667
Five years ago?

00:18:51.667 --> 00:18:55.792
Right. On the day Wall Maria was breached.

00:18:55.792 --> 00:18:59.250
I'll summarize the important
bits from the beginning.

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:05.042
As the lord of his territory, popular opinion
of Rod Reiss wasn't all that bad.

00:19:05.042 --> 00:19:10.500
He had five children, and his eldest
daughter Frieda was a down-to-earth girl

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.792
that even the peasants adored.

00:19:13.792 --> 00:19:17.667
But that night, five years ago, disaster struck.

00:19:17.667 --> 00:19:21.083
With the world having plunged into pure chaos,

00:19:21.083 --> 00:19:25.958
some bandits raided and set fire
to the only chapel around.

00:19:25.958 --> 00:19:31.958
Unfortunately, that night, the entire
Reiss family was there praying together.

00:19:31.958 --> 00:19:38.042
And so, the whole family, save for
the head of the house, Rod Reiss...

00:19:38.042 --> 00:19:41.625
...was massacred that night by the bandits.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:48.583
To top it off, this incident occurred
just a few days before Historia's mother

00:19:48.583 --> 00:19:51.125
was killed by the Interior Police.

00:19:52.625 --> 00:19:58.792
In other words, immediately after losing
his family, Rod Reiss sought out Historia.

00:19:58.792 --> 00:20:03.708
There must be a reason he
and his lackeys are after Historia.

00:20:03.708 --> 00:20:05.917
The same bloodline?

00:20:05.917 --> 00:20:08.542
Is there some secret to their blood?

00:20:08.542 --> 00:20:10.917
I don't know for sure yet.

00:20:10.917 --> 00:20:16.292
But what really makes me curious is that
parts of the chapel were completely wrecked.

00:20:16.292 --> 00:20:22.083
The chapel itself is stone. It would take
tons of time and effort to destroy it.

00:20:22.083 --> 00:20:25.333
Bandits would take what they can
and make a quick escape.

00:20:25.333 --> 00:20:30.417
Plus, the only one who saw those
bandits was Rod Reiss himself.

00:20:30.417 --> 00:20:34.917
Soon after, he used his own
fortune to rebuild the chapel.

00:20:34.917 --> 00:20:36.375
But why?

00:20:40.875 --> 00:20:46.625
If you think about it, it's actually stranger
that there were no traces of Titans.

00:20:46.625 --> 00:20:54.292
Even if I'm jumping to conclusions, something
this suspicious deserves us checking it out.

00:21:18.167 --> 00:21:19.750
What the hell?!

00:21:29.458 --> 00:21:34.583
Before the night is over,
we'll have soldiers all over Reiss' land.

00:21:34.583 --> 00:21:38.917
Unfortunately, I doubt
he'll be waiting that long.

00:21:38.917 --> 00:21:43.917
If we don't hurry and get there,
Eren may end up being eaten.

00:21:46.625 --> 00:21:52.917
If a Titan eats a person who can change into
a Titan and thus inherits their powers...

00:21:52.917 --> 00:21:55.875
If that's actually true...

00:21:55.875 --> 00:22:02.417
When and how did Eren become a Titan,
and who did he eat to gain his powers?

00:22:08.917 --> 00:22:10.333
Shit!

00:22:21.875 --> 00:22:23.875
Historia?

00:23:57.917 --> 00:24:02.500
To save Eren, Mikasa and the
others head for the Reiss chapel.

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:05.458
However, the captured Eren finds out...

00:24:05.458 --> 00:24:10.042
...his father, Grisha's, unforgivable sin.

00:24:10.042 --> 00:24:12.096
Next episode: "Sin."
