WEBVTT

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.875
That naÃ¯ve day of my youth...

00:00:30.875 --> 00:00:32.458
...when I...

00:00:32.458 --> 00:00:35.375
...had to face the truth of this world.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.625
Move it, you vermin.

00:01:03.625 --> 00:01:05.500
What, more devil-bloods?

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.833
Damn Eldians crawling around as they please.

00:01:08.833 --> 00:01:10.042
Grisha...

00:01:10.042 --> 00:01:13.167
It's all right. Aren't you used to it?

00:01:13.167 --> 00:01:14.792
Look.

00:01:14.792 --> 00:01:16.667
It's right over that bank.

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:34.417
It's so big...!

00:01:38.917 --> 00:01:42.542
Have you come to see the airship, too?

00:01:42.542 --> 00:01:45.000
Huh? Uh, yes...

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.583
You from the Liberio Internment Zone?

00:01:47.583 --> 00:01:49.417
Let's see your exit permit.

00:01:49.417 --> 00:01:51.375
Huh? Um...

00:01:54.083 --> 00:01:55.792
I don't have one.

00:01:55.792 --> 00:01:58.417
You entered the city without permission?

00:01:58.417 --> 00:02:00.708
You know what that means, right?

00:02:00.708 --> 00:02:01.542
Yes.

00:02:01.542 --> 00:02:05.000
Labor or beating. Which is it?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.333
A beating...

00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:07.208
Grisha!

00:02:07.208 --> 00:02:10.833
Oh? You don't want to trouble your parents?

00:02:10.833 --> 00:02:12.792
Yes.

00:02:12.792 --> 00:02:15.208
I forced my sister to come with me!

00:02:15.208 --> 00:02:18.042
Please give her punishment to me, too!

00:02:18.042 --> 00:02:19.500
Very well.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.833
Grisha!

00:02:23.833 --> 00:02:25.417
Here's another!

00:02:25.417 --> 00:02:28.375
Man, go easy on him, Kruger.

00:02:28.375 --> 00:02:31.167
Come on. Let's get you on your way home.

00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:40.292
It was smart not to take off your armbands.

00:02:40.292 --> 00:02:45.750
Eldians without one are sent to
their paradise, even if they're kids.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.417
I'll go... home.

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:49.292
Wait.

00:02:49.292 --> 00:02:51.417
Didn't you come to see the airship?

00:02:51.417 --> 00:02:53.750
Might as well see it.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.083
The following day,
my sister was found in the river.

00:03:05.792 --> 00:03:09.750
I showed the girl the Liberio gates
and went on my way.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.792
I'm busy with work, you know.

00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:17.125
Eldian kids shouldn't be roaming the city
without permits in the first place.

00:03:17.125 --> 00:03:21.542
It seems that your son doesn't
grasp the place of his people.

00:03:21.542 --> 00:03:26.500
Shouldn't you be teaching him the sins
that your ancestors committed?

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.458
--I knew that man from Marley Public
Security was lying through his teeth.
--If that's not enough to make
him behave, put a collar on him.

00:03:32.458 --> 00:03:36.083
He had been slacking off
and was napping on the bank.

00:03:36.083 --> 00:03:38.458
He wasn't busy at all.

00:03:38.458 --> 00:03:41.000
Though my mother grieved, my father...

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.750
Thank you so much for your guidance.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.208
I assure you, I'll teach
my foolish son to know better.

00:03:47.208 --> 00:03:50.333
He demeaned himself to the men.

00:03:50.333 --> 00:03:55.792
I began to hate that man and my father
so much that it made me dizzy.

00:03:55.792 --> 00:03:59.667
But more so, I cursed my own foolishness.

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:05.708
One thousand, eight hundred
and twenty years ago,

00:04:05.708 --> 00:04:08.500
our ancestor Ymir Fritz made a contract

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.083
with the Devil of All Earth and
obtained the Power of the Titans.

00:04:13.083 --> 00:04:16.958
Upon her death, Ymir's spirit
was split into the Nine Titans

00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.458
who formed the Eldian Empire.

00:04:19.458 --> 00:04:24.958
After defeating the great nation of Marley,
they ruled over the continent.

00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:27.792
Thus began the Dark Ages...

00:04:27.792 --> 00:04:33.833
The Subjects of Ymir called other races
inferior and began to oppress them.

00:04:33.833 --> 00:04:35.708
They stole lands and fortunes,

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:40.042
and forced other races to bear their
children to increase their numbers.

00:04:40.042 --> 00:04:44.875
Their ethnic cleansing continued
for some 1,700 more years.

00:04:44.875 --> 00:04:47.500
But the once great nation of Marley

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.917
plotted to subvert Eldia
and its arrogance from within.

00:04:50.917 --> 00:04:55.250
They brought seven of the Nine
Titans under their control

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.458
and were victorious in the
Great Titan War 80 years ago.

00:04:59.458 --> 00:05:04.500
The Eldian King at the time erected
three walls on the island of Paradis

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.000
and fled there with many of his people.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.417
Our ancestors were abandoned and
left behind on this continent, but...

00:05:12.417 --> 00:05:16.792
The gracious people of Marley
let us live and stay on their land...

00:05:16.792 --> 00:05:21.333
My father was talkative for someone
who had just lost their daughter.

00:05:21.333 --> 00:05:23.833
He obeyed his master's command

00:05:23.833 --> 00:05:29.667
and gladly shamed his own ancestry,
much like he was their dog.

00:05:29.667 --> 00:05:32.208
That man was telling lies.

00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:36.875
The truth wasn't good for him, so he lied.

00:05:36.875 --> 00:05:39.792
Quiet. The walls here are thin.

00:05:39.792 --> 00:05:42.000
I bet he's the one who took Fay and--

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.167
Silence!

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.292
I told you... Our ancestors
did terrible things.

00:05:49.292 --> 00:05:52.042
They believed in eugenics
and tried to cleanse--

00:05:52.042 --> 00:05:54.083
Fay and I did nothing like that!

00:05:54.083 --> 00:05:56.208
We were just walking around!

00:05:57.708 --> 00:05:59.417
What is wrong with you?

00:05:59.417 --> 00:06:03.792
Are you that eager for all of us
to get shipped off to paradise?

00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:09.417
Listen, Grisha...

00:06:09.417 --> 00:06:14.292
It doesn't matter that we're not
directly responsible for the sins.

00:06:14.292 --> 00:06:20.625
But what we are able to do is live
humble lives within this internment zone.

00:06:20.625 --> 00:06:26.125
I'm begging you. Please don't
lead us all to the same fate as Fay.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.875
I wonder who was truly in the wrong.

00:06:31.875 --> 00:06:35.042
Was it me or this world?

00:06:35.042 --> 00:06:36.708
Okay...

00:06:36.708 --> 00:06:38.958
I understand.

00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.000
Perhaps it was both.

00:06:42.792 --> 00:06:45.125
I was ignorant and foolish.

00:06:46.625 --> 00:06:49.292
The world, irrational and insane.

00:06:51.625 --> 00:06:55.417
I discovered my own path in life when I was 18.

00:06:55.417 --> 00:06:59.958
It was around the time I was
to take over my father's clinic.

00:07:01.167 --> 00:07:04.333
What is that wound of yours?

00:07:04.333 --> 00:07:07.333
This is proof I'm a patriot.

00:07:07.333 --> 00:07:08.500
A patriot?

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.125
Your sister was killed by a man
in Marley Public Security.

00:07:13.125 --> 00:07:17.375
We have an informant inside
the Marley government.

00:07:17.375 --> 00:07:20.042
There are some things you need to hear.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.750
It can't be...!

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:26.625
You're kidding me...!

00:07:27.583 --> 00:07:32.125
When I learned the truth of my
sister's death, I swore in my heart...

00:07:33.292 --> 00:07:36.458
...that I'd show them who the real devil was.

00:07:37.625 --> 00:07:41.708
That my ancestors had done the right thing.

00:07:41.708 --> 00:07:47.167
In order to correct the world again,
Eldia would have to be restored.

00:07:49.375 --> 00:07:53.417
Our informant in the Marley
government was called "the Owl."

00:07:53.417 --> 00:07:57.708
He led the Restorationists
without ever showing himself.

00:07:57.708 --> 00:08:00.833
Look! This is the truth!

00:08:00.833 --> 00:08:04.333
Our founder Ymir awakened
the Power of the Titans...

00:08:04.333 --> 00:08:07.125
Cultivated the wilds... Built roads...

00:08:07.125 --> 00:08:09.208
And bridged the mountains!

00:08:09.208 --> 00:08:13.042
She helped the people prosper
and develop this entire continent!

00:08:13.042 --> 00:08:16.458
The history we were taught is just
a convenient deception for Marley!

00:08:16.458 --> 00:08:17.750
Impressive, Grisha...

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.917
--That's right! Even if they fool the others,
they can't trick us true Eldians!
--You can read this ancient language.

00:08:19.917 --> 00:08:23.833
--That's right! Even if they fool the others,
they can't trick us true Eldians!
--No... I still haven't deciphered most of it.

00:08:23.833 --> 00:08:26.750
Then how did you know the truth?

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:28.958
Isn't it staring us in the face?

00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:32.375
I know it because I believe
in our founder Ymir!

00:08:32.375 --> 00:08:35.792
We're the chosen children of God!
The Subjects of Ymir!

00:08:35.792 --> 00:08:37.333
Yeah!

00:08:37.333 --> 00:08:40.708
Comrades! The Owl sent us somebody!

00:08:41.708 --> 00:08:43.833
Nice to meet you, everyone.

00:08:45.042 --> 00:08:48.083
My name is Dina Fritz.

00:08:48.083 --> 00:08:50.958
I'm a descendant of the royal family.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:57.208
I allowed fate to steer my life
and followed wherever it took me.

00:08:59.917 --> 00:09:04.667
She was the last descendant of royal
blood who remained on the continent.

00:09:04.667 --> 00:09:09.333
She provided info about the Titans
that only the royal family knew.

00:09:09.333 --> 00:09:13.250
This was the break we needed for victory.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:14.667
I'm sure of it!

00:09:14.667 --> 00:09:17.750
The King took the Founding
Titan into the walls!

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:23.708
If we obtain that, we can control all other
Titans and completely annihilate Marley!

00:09:23.708 --> 00:09:29.875
But if he could wield a power that absolute,
why did he flee to an island?

00:09:29.875 --> 00:09:34.083
That is because he refused to fight.

00:09:34.083 --> 00:09:36.458
At the time of the Great Titan War,

00:09:36.458 --> 00:09:40.292
the King abandoned his role of
balancing the continent's powers

00:09:40.292 --> 00:09:43.792
and moved the capital to a remote island.

00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:47.042
And so, these wretched days we live

00:09:47.042 --> 00:09:50.875
all began when the King
turned away from conflict.

00:09:52.833 --> 00:09:55.083
Let's fight!

00:09:55.083 --> 00:10:00.083
The true royal family held their ground
on this continent for the sake of Eldia!

00:10:00.083 --> 00:10:03.250
It's time we bring the Founding
Titan back to them!

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:09.208
My comrades! We'll overthrow Marley
and restore the pride of Eldia!

00:10:09.208 --> 00:10:13.292
Yeah!

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:24.667
The next year, the two of us married
and were blessed with a son.

00:10:24.667 --> 00:10:26.875
His name was Zeke.

00:10:26.875 --> 00:10:29.208
A child with royal blood...

00:10:29.208 --> 00:10:33.583
Someday, this child will
lead us all to victory...

00:10:35.375 --> 00:10:39.333
As time goes on, people change...

00:10:39.333 --> 00:10:42.958
As the world around us rapidly advanced...

00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:46.125
...a turning point came
for the Restorationists.

00:10:47.458 --> 00:10:50.083
Listen up, Eldians!

00:10:50.083 --> 00:10:51.250
--We will be selecting warriors from
various zones around the continent!

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.542
--The Marley government
needed Subjects of Ymir
--We will be selecting warriors from
various zones around the continent!

00:10:54.542 --> 00:11:00.458
--to serve as vessels for the Nine Titans
and become Marleyan warriors.
--If chosen, their family will be granted
the title of Honorary Marleyans and...

00:11:01.625 --> 00:11:06.417
According to info from the Owl,
the reason Marley is making a move

00:11:06.417 --> 00:11:09.750
is to prepare themselves
for a struggle for resources

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:12.750
as military technology advances.

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:16.583
Though Marley leads the world using
the power of the Seven Titans,

00:11:16.583 --> 00:11:19.167
the end of their dominance is nigh.

00:11:19.167 --> 00:11:22.083
A massive cache of fossil
fuel lies beneath Paradis,

00:11:22.083 --> 00:11:25.333
and gone are the days they can ignore it.

00:11:25.333 --> 00:11:30.083
But the King of the walls left this
warning behind 80 years ago...

00:11:30.083 --> 00:11:32.542
"If you ever interfere with us,

00:11:32.542 --> 00:11:38.458
the millions upon millions of Titans in
the walls will flatten the entire world."

00:11:38.458 --> 00:11:43.208
As long as this threat exists,
none dare to confront him.

00:11:43.208 --> 00:11:47.458
The thing is, the Marley government
has the same goal as us.

00:11:47.458 --> 00:11:52.250
To infiltrate the walls and
recover the Founding Titan.

00:11:53.583 --> 00:11:55.167
What do we do?

00:11:55.167 --> 00:11:56.292
At this rate...

00:11:56.292 --> 00:11:58.458
...Marley will get it before us.

00:11:58.458 --> 00:12:03.583
If that happens, Eldia won't see
the light of day again!

00:12:03.583 --> 00:12:07.167
No... There's still a way for us...

00:12:07.167 --> 00:12:09.625
We'll have my son Zeke...

00:12:09.625 --> 00:12:12.000
...become a Marleyan warrior!

00:12:13.792 --> 00:12:15.292
Got it, Zeke?

00:12:15.292 --> 00:12:18.958
Everything the Marleyans
are telling you is wrong.

00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:24.292
But more so than anyone else,
you have to obey exactly what they say.

00:12:24.292 --> 00:12:27.792
You're the one who will
save Eldia from disgrace.

00:12:27.792 --> 00:12:30.417
Okay... I understand...

00:12:32.333 --> 00:12:35.500
But if anyone, I should have known...

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:39.833
How terrible the sin to besmirch
one's beliefs on your children...

00:12:40.917 --> 00:12:45.833
Not as a child of royal blood...
Not as the hope of restoring Eldia...

00:12:45.833 --> 00:12:50.000
But as my son Zeke, had I ever
thought of him that way?

00:12:51.458 --> 00:12:57.042
In any case, Zeke chose to protect
himself and his grandparents...

00:12:58.208 --> 00:13:03.292
In exchange for turning in his foolish
parents to Marley Public Security.

00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:09.000
"Though the humans who live outside the walls look
no different than us and speak the same language,
their civilization appears far more advanced than ours.
However, they view us inside the walls as a race of devils"

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:12.083
We're here.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.667
This is...

00:13:19.667 --> 00:13:21.375
...paradise...

00:13:22.875 --> 00:13:24.333
That's right.

00:13:24.333 --> 00:13:28.625
The penal colony of Eldia
traitors: Paradis Island.

00:13:28.625 --> 00:13:31.917
This is where you'll serve
your life sentence...

00:13:31.917 --> 00:13:34.292
As a Pure Titan, that is.

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:39.875
Answer me! Who is the Owl?!

00:13:39.875 --> 00:13:42.208
Please! No more!

00:13:42.208 --> 00:13:44.458
I told you everything! It's true!

00:13:44.458 --> 00:13:47.667
That's unfortunate. Let's do another.

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:58.542
I've met you before...

00:13:58.542 --> 00:14:00.750
When I was little...

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.125
You remember that?

00:14:03.125 --> 00:14:07.792
As if I could ever forget
what happened that day...!

00:14:07.792 --> 00:14:11.333
Please, just kill me... Don't...

00:14:11.333 --> 00:14:13.042
Keep walking!

00:14:13.042 --> 00:14:15.750
Please not a Titan...

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.417
Grice?

00:14:17.417 --> 00:14:19.750
Grisha?! What the hell?!

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:23.917
Why in the world did Zeke
betray us?! He's your son!

00:14:25.875 --> 00:14:29.333
I was an idiot to entrust everything to you!

00:14:29.333 --> 00:14:31.833
The Restorationists! Dina, too!

00:14:31.833 --> 00:14:33.958
Say something!

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:37.125
I'm sorry...

00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:44.000
Why did we let... a guy like you...?

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.458
Eldia is finished...

00:14:46.458 --> 00:14:49.125
We've got a lively one here.

00:14:49.125 --> 00:14:51.042
You're free to go.

00:14:52.458 --> 00:14:53.917
Grice!

00:14:54.917 --> 00:14:56.458
--Hey! Grice!

00:14:56.458 --> 00:14:58.292
--Run straight north!
--Hey! Grice!

00:14:58.292 --> 00:15:01.417
If you're lucky, you might make it to the wall!

00:15:03.458 --> 00:15:05.000
Sergeant Major Gross?

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.958
Hmm? This your first time here?

00:15:07.958 --> 00:15:10.917
If we let him run off,
the Titans we're about to make

00:15:10.917 --> 00:15:13.583
will chase him down and leave the area.

00:15:13.583 --> 00:15:16.167
It won't be long till he's eaten.

00:15:16.167 --> 00:15:18.417
Isn't that right, Kruger?

00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:19.792
Yeah.

00:15:19.792 --> 00:15:22.958
It's him... Without a doubt...

00:15:22.958 --> 00:15:26.125
He's the one who killed my sister!

00:15:26.125 --> 00:15:28.833
All right! We've got a bunch to do this time!

00:15:28.833 --> 00:15:31.000
Let's get a move on!

00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:35.875
Guys...

00:15:35.875 --> 00:15:37.417
Don't do it!

00:15:53.083 --> 00:15:54.958
Guys!

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:04.750
Stop it! Guys, stop it!

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:06.875
--It's Grice! Can't you see?!

00:16:06.875 --> 00:16:08.375
--Kruger! He's so loud, I can't stand it.
--It's Grice! Can't you see?!

00:16:08.375 --> 00:16:10.167
--Kruger! He's so loud, I can't stand it.

00:16:10.167 --> 00:16:12.917
I still want to interrogate him a bit.

00:16:12.917 --> 00:16:14.667
Continue without me.

00:16:14.667 --> 00:16:19.458
Oh? A woman this time? What a waste...
If only you weren't a devil!

00:16:23.417 --> 00:16:25.708
Dina...

00:16:25.708 --> 00:16:27.125
Darling...

00:16:27.125 --> 00:16:31.542
Why are you here? I... I told them
everything there is to know...!

00:16:31.542 --> 00:16:33.208
She's a royal--!

00:16:33.208 --> 00:16:34.417
Silence!

00:16:35.958 --> 00:16:39.125
Could it be... he's trying to cover it up?!

00:16:39.125 --> 00:16:42.958
Sheesh. Make him a Titan
to shut him up already.

00:16:42.958 --> 00:16:46.167
Grisha, I...

00:16:46.167 --> 00:16:50.417
No matter what form I take,
I promise I'll come and find you.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.500
That's lovely. You'll make
a great Titan couple.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.833
Dina!

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:15.083
Where is this?

00:17:15.083 --> 00:17:17.625
Who... am I?

00:17:17.625 --> 00:17:20.042
Eren, relax!

00:17:20.042 --> 00:17:21.958
You're in the stockades.

00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:25.250
You and Mikasa are serving
time for insubordination.

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:28.583
Were you having a nightmare, Eren?

00:17:28.583 --> 00:17:31.917
Yeah... I was...

00:17:31.917 --> 00:17:35.125
You just said... "Who am I?"

00:17:35.125 --> 00:17:36.292
Huh?

00:17:36.292 --> 00:17:37.875
You did.

00:17:37.875 --> 00:17:40.500
Are you crying, Eren?

00:17:44.042 --> 00:17:49.125
I feel like... I just woke up
from the longest dream ever.

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:54.792
No... Not a dream...

00:17:54.792 --> 00:17:57.208
Memories...

00:17:57.208 --> 00:18:01.292
Just now, I was connected to my dad's memories.

00:18:02.583 --> 00:18:04.625
That Titan...

00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:06.542
It was you...

00:18:08.333 --> 00:18:09.875
Dina...

00:18:13.458 --> 00:18:17.917
Look! She's running after Grice
and forgot all about you!

00:18:17.917 --> 00:18:21.500
I guess she fancies that guy more than you!

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.833
Shut up!

00:18:24.333 --> 00:18:26.292
Did you say something?

00:18:26.292 --> 00:18:28.042
It's you!

00:18:28.042 --> 00:18:34.208
Fifteen years ago, the one who fed
my eight-year-old sister to the dogs was you!

00:18:36.417 --> 00:18:37.542
Tsk.

00:18:37.542 --> 00:18:41.667
Let me get him off your hands.
You can head back to the ship.

00:18:41.667 --> 00:18:44.042
Um, yes, sir.

00:18:44.042 --> 00:18:46.000
What was that all about?

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.417
The sergeant major wants some
time to have fun, rookie.

00:18:49.417 --> 00:18:51.667
It's best to leave it at that.

00:18:55.333 --> 00:19:02.042
Kruger. Are you done interrogating?
Let's have that lad dance for us.

00:19:02.042 --> 00:19:03.042
Dance?

00:19:03.042 --> 00:19:05.708
I remember you now, son.

00:19:05.708 --> 00:19:08.208
Let's not make you a Titan.

00:19:08.208 --> 00:19:13.417
I'll have this one turn into a 3- to 4-meter
Titan so you can fight him.

00:19:14.542 --> 00:19:18.458
Why would you... do something like this?

00:19:18.458 --> 00:19:22.917
Do you get enjoyment out of
people getting eaten by Titans?

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:27.500
Why, you ask?

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.500
Because it's interesting.

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.750
Do you think that's a little crazy?

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:36.458
But you know, people actually
want to see cruelty.

00:19:36.458 --> 00:19:42.208
Peace can be such a wonderful thing,
but something about it is lacking.

00:19:42.208 --> 00:19:45.000
Losing touch with life and death perhaps?

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.917
We should live thinking this
might be the last day we've got.

00:19:48.917 --> 00:19:52.750
That's the only proper state
of mind for living things.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:56.250
I'm ready to accept it
when that day comes for me.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:59.250
That's because I've faced
this cruel world head on

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:02.500
and deepened my understanding of it.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:08.000
Yeah... It was educational having
my sons' dogs eat your sister.

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:14.250
Do you not feel any remorse?

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:17.000
Well, I get what you're saying.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.250
If something like that happened to one
of my sons, it would crush my heart.

00:20:23.958 --> 00:20:25.958
You poor things.

00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:28.875
If only you weren't Eldians.

00:20:30.917 --> 00:20:34.958
Look. That's your people's true form.

00:20:34.958 --> 00:20:41.042
All it takes is some Titan spinal fluid
and you turn into gigantic monsters.

00:20:41.042 --> 00:20:45.417
The world needs to wipe out
every last one of you Eldians.

00:20:45.417 --> 00:20:48.750
That's the wish of humanity everywhere.

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:50.208
What did you...?

00:20:50.208 --> 00:20:52.500
Of course I don't feel remorse.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.500
You're the murderers here.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:58.833
What were you Restorationists
planning to do to Marley?

00:20:58.833 --> 00:21:01.000
Don't you feel any remorse?

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.875
It's a lie! I know the truth!

00:21:03.875 --> 00:21:06.667
Our founder Ymir helped people
prosper on the continent--

00:21:06.667 --> 00:21:08.625
Yeah, whatever.

00:21:08.625 --> 00:21:13.250
Since your history is so grand, go and
share it with your friend down below!

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:15.583
Stop it! Don't!

00:21:15.583 --> 00:21:18.000
Hear that? Your sister is calling for you!

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.083
Dammit!

00:21:47.208 --> 00:21:51.500
Well? Is it really that interesting?

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:53.708
You're...

00:21:53.708 --> 00:21:56.417
I'm the Owl.

00:21:56.417 --> 00:21:58.708
Remember this, Grisha.

00:21:58.708 --> 00:22:01.833
A Titan uses their power like this.

00:23:57.917 --> 00:24:02.125
A Titan's power revealed by Grisha's past...

00:24:02.125 --> 00:24:08.708
The men's fierce desire to pursue
freedom... is passed on to Eren.

00:24:08.708 --> 00:24:12.096
Next episode: "Attack Titan."
