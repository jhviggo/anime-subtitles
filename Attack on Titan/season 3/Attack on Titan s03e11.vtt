00:01:53.708 --> 00:01:55.375
Hey!

00:01:55.375 --> 00:01:57.458
You wait right there!

00:01:58.875 --> 00:02:00.667
Isn't this...?

00:02:00.667 --> 00:02:04.875
--Yeah... Not quite the Queen I was expecting.
--Don't you run from me!
Listen when I'm talking to you!

00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:08.125
And it's only been two months
since she was crowned.

00:02:08.125 --> 00:02:11.792
Seems like she's better
suited to run an orphanage.

00:02:12.792 --> 00:02:15.542
Do you know what the people are calling her?

00:02:15.542 --> 00:02:16.250
--Snacks come after our work is all done!

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.833
--The Cattle-Farming Goddess.
--Snacks come after our work is all done!

00:02:18.833 --> 00:02:21.250
--In a good way, of course.
--You're such a piggy!

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.292
So we've finally got a goddess among us.

00:02:24.292 --> 00:02:30.333
At this rate, no one will remember
the chump who plugged up Trost, yeah?

00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:34.708
One of the reasons Historia decided
to become queen was...

00:02:34.708 --> 00:02:36.750
...to do all this.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.333
This, meaning?

00:02:38.333 --> 00:02:43.917
Taking care of the orphans and needy from
the underground to the edge of the walls.

00:02:43.917 --> 00:02:48.208
Since he was raised underground,
the captain supported her, too.

00:02:48.208 --> 00:02:50.042
When people need help,

00:02:50.042 --> 00:02:54.375
she said she'll come to their rescue,
no matter who or where.

00:02:54.375 --> 00:02:58.167
That's... what Historia wants to do.

00:02:58.167 --> 00:03:00.417
Oh? You're slacking again!

00:03:00.417 --> 00:03:01.333
Uh...

00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:03.417
It's getting dark, you know!

00:03:04.375 --> 00:03:08.000
She's becoming more
and more like my mother...

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Some goddess...

00:03:11.333 --> 00:03:14.708
I hear your hardening
experiments are going well.

00:03:14.708 --> 00:03:15.875
Yeah...

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:20.125
But if we don't hurry... they'll be back.

00:03:21.583 --> 00:03:23.792
What would you do?

00:03:23.792 --> 00:03:28.333
If you met Reiner and Bertholdt...
and had to face them again?

00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:33.917
I've got no other choice... but to kill them.

00:03:39.833 --> 00:03:42.667
I hope we find out soon.

00:03:42.667 --> 00:03:46.958
About this world... and why it is like it is.

00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:52.292
All that we've done...
I don't want to regret any of it.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.583
Even the kids from the underground
have been smiling lately.

00:04:01.625 --> 00:04:05.125
This can't have been the wrong choice.

00:04:05.125 --> 00:04:06.500
Yeah.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.000
You've done great.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.792
That's not...

00:04:09.792 --> 00:04:13.208
Though you're the one who said
humanity should get wiped out.

00:04:13.208 --> 00:04:16.333
Th-That was only 'cuz I got carried away!

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.667
What?

00:04:23.667 --> 00:04:24.833
Gimme that.

00:04:24.833 --> 00:04:26.042
Hey!

00:04:26.042 --> 00:04:27.917
Eren's tired from the experiments.

00:04:27.917 --> 00:04:30.167
That's true. Sorry, Mikasa.

00:04:30.167 --> 00:04:33.917
Would you stop treating me
like some feeble old man?

00:04:36.375 --> 00:04:42.958
Due to the military purge, considerable
talent was lost from humanity's forces, but...

00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:46.875
...the discovery of glowing
ore in the underground cavern

00:04:46.875 --> 00:04:49.375
was one of many things gained.

00:04:50.833 --> 00:04:58.417
Also, with Eren's hardening ability,
a certain anti-Titan weapon was born.

00:05:03.333 --> 00:05:04.792
That's it...

00:05:04.792 --> 00:05:07.292
Jam your head in here.

00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:10.125
Now!

00:05:13.792 --> 00:05:15.417
Ooh!

00:05:15.417 --> 00:05:17.792
A direct hit on the nape!

00:05:17.792 --> 00:05:19.667
This could be it...!

00:05:23.583 --> 00:05:26.792
We did it! That's a 12-meter, crushed!

00:05:26.792 --> 00:05:28.458
We did it!

00:05:28.458 --> 00:05:33.417
Hell yeah! With this, we can kill Titans
without a single soldier fighting!

00:05:33.417 --> 00:05:36.208
We'll hack down the Titans all day and night!

00:05:36.208 --> 00:05:39.167
Say hello to the executioner from hell!

00:05:39.167 --> 00:05:41.083
We did it, Eren!

00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.833
Eren?

00:05:44.833 --> 00:05:48.458
He probably overused his Titan powers.

00:05:48.458 --> 00:05:52.083
All he's done is hardening experiments lately.

00:05:52.083 --> 00:05:55.125
Sorry, Eren...

00:05:55.125 --> 00:05:58.000
There's nothing to apologize for, Hange.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.583
Who gives a damn if I'm tired?

00:06:01.583 --> 00:06:05.292
Let's hurry... make weapons, and get going...

00:06:05.292 --> 00:06:07.250
...to Shiganshina.

00:06:10.167 --> 00:06:11.917
We can win! We can beat 'em!

00:06:11.917 --> 00:06:15.667
With the new weapons,
the Titans will crumble like paper!

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:17.833
You're so damn worked up.

00:06:17.833 --> 00:06:21.500
Only you would be happy
about becoming a Scout.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.667
That's right! Didn't Hitch try
to stop you from joining?

00:06:25.667 --> 00:06:28.208
Hitch? Why would she?

00:06:28.208 --> 00:06:32.292
Why? 'Cuz you two are... you know?

00:06:32.292 --> 00:06:33.917
I don't follow, but...

00:06:33.917 --> 00:06:38.708
Hitch told me off, saying I wasn't
cut out for it and not to act cool.

00:06:38.708 --> 00:06:42.833
That if I stayed in the Military Police,
I could coast along in life.

00:06:42.833 --> 00:06:45.292
I thought she was better than that...

00:06:45.292 --> 00:06:47.625
Told her I was wrong about her.

00:06:47.625 --> 00:06:48.458
You shit.

00:06:48.458 --> 00:06:50.042
--Huh?
--Marlo, are you stupid?

00:06:50.042 --> 00:06:52.000
He's a bowl cut imbecile.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.333
Why? Marlo said nothing wrong.

00:06:54.333 --> 00:07:00.792
Anyways, the only ones as worked up as you
are the recruits with zero battle experience.

00:07:00.792 --> 00:07:05.458
Whoa, whoa... Think you're
some veteran hero now?

00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:08.375
Compared to you, I am.

00:07:08.375 --> 00:07:11.708
How rude. Weren't we in the 104th together?

00:07:11.708 --> 00:07:14.458
Besides, we're not the only ones.

00:07:14.458 --> 00:07:19.917
Everyone in the walls is pumped up
about the idea of retaking Wall Maria.

00:07:19.917 --> 00:07:21.500
Is that so?

00:07:22.708 --> 00:07:26.750
Still, you all do seem different now.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.208
It's your faces, I guess...

00:07:29.208 --> 00:07:32.583
What... exactly happened?

00:07:32.583 --> 00:07:34.250
Wanna know?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.208
No... I think... I'll ask later.

00:07:44.667 --> 00:07:46.583
I'm outta here. See you later.

00:07:46.583 --> 00:07:48.333
Eh? So soon?

00:07:48.333 --> 00:07:52.917
Tomorrow's a prep day, so I'm heading
to my village in the morning.

00:07:54.083 --> 00:07:57.208
Might find out something new there.

00:07:57.208 --> 00:07:58.625
Good night.

00:08:00.833 --> 00:08:06.875
Turning Conny's mom back to
normal... isn't impossible, right?

00:08:06.875 --> 00:08:07.917
Yeah...

00:08:07.917 --> 00:08:12.708
If our understanding of Titans
keeps improving, someday...

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.042
You're telling me Titans are people?

00:08:17.042 --> 00:08:19.750
It's just speculation for now.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:22.083
About 60 years.

00:08:22.083 --> 00:08:26.792
It was like... I was stuck in a
nightmare that never would end.

00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:29.458
A nightmare, huh?

00:08:29.458 --> 00:08:30.750
Eh?

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:34.375
With all that's happened, it's been so vague...

00:08:34.375 --> 00:08:38.250
But who exactly are we fighting against?

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:42.125
That is, are Titans just...

00:08:42.125 --> 00:08:47.208
...people being tormented by some nightmare?

00:08:47.208 --> 00:08:51.958
For a time, I was... one of those Titans.

00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.083
Eren!

00:08:55.458 --> 00:08:58.792
You still have bread and soup left.

00:08:58.792 --> 00:09:01.708
Save talking for after you've eaten.

00:09:03.375 --> 00:09:05.250
Right.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.833
Sorry, Mikasa.

00:09:07.833 --> 00:09:10.250
For crying out loud, Eren.

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:15.125
I swear that's all you do lately...
mumbling shit to yourself.

00:09:15.125 --> 00:09:19.500
When you should be trying
to remember that one guy.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.792
You saw, right? In the cavern
when those memories came back...

00:09:23.792 --> 00:09:27.708
That guy in the Scouts
who you think met your dad.

00:09:28.917 --> 00:09:33.750
Yeah... That day, I'm pretty sure
he was with my dad.

00:09:35.167 --> 00:09:37.833
He's gotta know something.

00:09:37.833 --> 00:09:42.208
The thing is, though, I feel like
I've met the guy somewhere.

00:09:42.208 --> 00:09:45.792
You mean not Dr. Jaeger, but you, yourself?

00:09:45.792 --> 00:09:47.417
I think so...

00:09:47.417 --> 00:09:49.667
Smack your head and see if you remember.

00:09:49.667 --> 00:09:51.167
That's right, twerp.

00:09:51.167 --> 00:09:55.667
You might remember if you stopped
holding hands with Historia for once.

00:09:55.667 --> 00:09:57.958
Get a head-butt from the commandant.

00:09:57.958 --> 00:10:00.583
If that helped me remember, I'd--

00:10:03.417 --> 00:10:05.000
Huh?

00:10:18.458 --> 00:10:21.917
The Cadet Corps commandant...

00:10:21.917 --> 00:10:23.875
Keith Sadies!

00:10:27.042 --> 00:10:32.792
Before Erwin, he was the 12th
commander of the Scout Regiment.

00:10:32.792 --> 00:10:35.500
It's been a long while since I've seen him.

00:10:37.958 --> 00:10:39.583
Commandant Sadies.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
"Executioner from Hell" "A semi-automatic Titan
extermination weapon constructed in part by Eren's
hardening ability and the wall. It can safely fell
and eliminate Titans compared to previous methods."

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:58.042
What's wrong, Braus? Not sitting?

00:10:58.042 --> 00:11:01.500
No! I am quite fine standing here!

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.000
If I recall...

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.458
Back in the day, I always used to
call you in here to chew you out.

00:11:09.458 --> 00:11:12.333
And it's only been a handful of months.

00:11:12.333 --> 00:11:15.375
I hardly recognize you all anymore.

00:11:15.375 --> 00:11:17.042
Commander Sadies...

00:11:17.042 --> 00:11:19.708
Rather, Commandant...

00:11:19.708 --> 00:11:22.792
With preparations to retake
Wall Maria underway,

00:11:22.792 --> 00:11:26.667
perhaps you can guess
what brings us here today.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Eren. You resemble your mother so much.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.500
However, the fangs lurking deep
in your eyes are surely your father's.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:50.333
Tell me about him! Everything you know!

00:11:50.333 --> 00:11:54.375
I know nothing... in the grand scheme of things.

00:11:54.375 --> 00:12:00.250
However, I can tell you a story
utterly useless to humanity.

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:04.917
The story of my past... as a mere bystander.

00:12:06.708 --> 00:12:09.958
Twenty years ago. Wall Maria.

00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:13.750
In front of the gates of
Shiganshina, he was there.

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:16.333
Hey, you!

00:12:16.333 --> 00:12:18.333
What are you doing here?!

00:12:18.333 --> 00:12:21.083
How did you get past the wall?!

00:12:21.083 --> 00:12:25.208
Wh-What are all of you doing outside the wall?!

00:12:25.208 --> 00:12:28.708
Don't tell me... you're fighting?!

00:12:28.708 --> 00:12:30.958
Huh?

00:12:30.958 --> 00:12:33.542
Was it the truth or a lie?

00:12:33.542 --> 00:12:37.708
He couldn't remember why
he was outside the walls.

00:12:39.417 --> 00:12:42.292
All of his memories had been lost.

00:12:42.292 --> 00:12:47.000
Except that he knew his
name was Grisha Jaeger.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.958
Who knew it was a crime to go into
Titan territory without permission?

00:12:51.958 --> 00:12:57.917
I thought only you Scouts were
dumb enough to go outside the walls.

00:12:57.917 --> 00:13:04.208
Isn't there a law that jails idiots
who drink on duty, Hannes?

00:13:04.208 --> 00:13:07.167
Anyways, it's not like he hurt anyone, so...

00:13:07.167 --> 00:13:10.542
Let's not report it, all right?

00:13:10.542 --> 00:13:12.042
Yeah.

00:13:13.625 --> 00:13:14.875
Well?

00:13:14.875 --> 00:13:19.417
What do you plan on doing now, Grisha Jaeger?

00:13:19.417 --> 00:13:23.292
I remember something other than my name.

00:13:23.292 --> 00:13:25.292
I'm a doctor.

00:13:25.292 --> 00:13:29.458
Introduce me to a hospital.
I should be able to help.

00:13:29.458 --> 00:13:31.083
Oh?

00:13:31.083 --> 00:13:34.958
Also... Do you think you could teach me?

00:13:34.958 --> 00:13:38.958
About this world... About the Scouts.

00:13:40.375 --> 00:13:42.667
About all of you.

00:13:46.167 --> 00:13:49.667
He truly knew nothing at all.

00:13:49.667 --> 00:13:54.333
Not about this world... or anything.

00:13:54.333 --> 00:13:56.083
I see.

00:13:56.083 --> 00:14:00.792
Although there's economic inequality,
there's peace within the walls.

00:14:00.792 --> 00:14:05.833
At the least, you don't live
in constant fear of Titans.

00:14:05.833 --> 00:14:07.292
That's good.

00:14:08.833 --> 00:14:10.625
That's good, huh?

00:14:10.625 --> 00:14:12.958
You're one of them?

00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:14.208
Eh?

00:14:14.208 --> 00:14:16.750
Within these cramped walls,

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:21.542
as long as there's food and alcohol,
some think that's good enough.

00:14:21.542 --> 00:14:26.333
Not once have they stopped to
think how wide the world might be.

00:14:27.458 --> 00:14:30.917
Is that why you venture outside the walls?

00:14:30.917 --> 00:14:33.250
Is that what Scouts do?

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:35.125
That's right.

00:14:35.125 --> 00:14:37.208
Does it seem foolish?

00:14:37.208 --> 00:14:39.083
Not at all.

00:14:39.083 --> 00:14:43.250
The Scouts are wiser and braver
than anyone else in the walls.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:46.917
Your existence signifies
the freedom in our souls.

00:14:46.917 --> 00:14:49.292
You're the pride of humanity.

00:14:49.292 --> 00:14:52.708
Pride? We are?

00:14:52.708 --> 00:14:53.792
Yes.

00:14:53.792 --> 00:14:55.667
Come on, Keith.

00:14:56.917 --> 00:14:59.333
Recruiting for the Scouts again, are we?

00:14:59.333 --> 00:15:01.917
N-Not this time, Carla. I'm just...

00:15:01.917 --> 00:15:05.958
Oh, no. I'd never be suited
for that kind of work.

00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.750
Being a Scout takes someone special...

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:11.500
You have to be a chosen one.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.542
Oh, is that right?

00:15:17.417 --> 00:15:19.542
A chosen one...

00:15:19.542 --> 00:15:22.917
It was the first time anyone told me that.

00:15:23.958 --> 00:15:28.958
It's true, inside the wall was
much too cramped for me.

00:15:31.875 --> 00:15:34.333
Another day, another defeat...

00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:37.542
Will you ever build a base outside the wall?

00:15:37.542 --> 00:15:42.042
If only I was commander, I'd show results.

00:15:42.042 --> 00:15:44.417
These idiots with their tiny brains...

00:15:44.417 --> 00:15:47.500
I'd accomplish so much,
even they'd understand.

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:51.583
And then everyone...
would have to acknowledge me.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:56.875
Grisha!

00:15:56.875 --> 00:15:59.042
Carla caught the plague going around!

00:15:59.042 --> 00:16:01.417
Can you help her?!

00:16:01.417 --> 00:16:03.292
Put her in the rear bed.

00:16:05.708 --> 00:16:07.958
Dr. Jaeger...

00:16:07.958 --> 00:16:11.292
My parents... have it, too.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.458
Don't worry, I'll help everyone.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.458
Dr. Jaeger!

00:16:22.458 --> 00:16:25.000
My wife is well again!

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.333
Dr. Jaeger, thank you!

00:16:35.167 --> 00:16:36.917
Congrats!

00:16:36.917 --> 00:16:39.333
You're appointed as the
Scout Regiment commander.

00:16:39.333 --> 00:16:40.833
Congratulations!

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:46.292
Congratulations, Dr. Jaeger!

00:16:52.375 --> 00:16:54.417
Shit, our base!

00:16:56.125 --> 00:16:59.625
It's no use! Let's retreat, Commander!

00:17:04.458 --> 00:17:07.000
The moron charges straight into death.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.500
He's always the only one who lives.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.875
I hear nobody on Erwin's squad has died yet.

00:17:12.875 --> 00:17:16.125
Wish they'd change commanders then.

00:17:17.792 --> 00:17:19.667
Someone special...

00:17:20.625 --> 00:17:23.292
A chosen one...

00:17:23.292 --> 00:17:24.875
Keith?

00:17:35.042 --> 00:17:37.542
Carla? Who's this child?

00:17:37.542 --> 00:17:40.792
Eren. He's our boy.

00:17:40.792 --> 00:17:43.833
I guess you never got the news.

00:17:43.833 --> 00:17:46.167
My husband worried about you.

00:17:46.167 --> 00:17:48.958
Yeah... I'm sorry.

00:17:50.917 --> 00:17:53.042
Do you intend...

00:17:53.042 --> 00:17:55.958
...on keeping this up until you die?

00:18:00.792 --> 00:18:02.792
It's about time you...

00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:08.542
Do you know why people live and
die without doing a damn thing?

00:18:08.542 --> 00:18:11.167
It's because they lack imagination!

00:18:11.167 --> 00:18:13.167
Their whole lives, for nothing!

00:18:13.167 --> 00:18:16.917
They're not ashamed of a life
that produces nothing but shit!

00:18:16.917 --> 00:18:19.167
They can't accomplish greatness... No!

00:18:19.167 --> 00:18:21.625
They can't even understand it!

00:18:21.625 --> 00:18:24.167
Not even the half of it!

00:18:24.167 --> 00:18:26.833
So a girl who flirts with every man in sight...

00:18:26.833 --> 00:18:31.083
...good for absolutely nothing
besides pouring drinks...

00:18:31.083 --> 00:18:32.667
...will never...

00:18:34.875 --> 00:18:37.042
Yes...

00:18:37.042 --> 00:18:40.208
Normal people accomplish nothing...

00:18:43.625 --> 00:18:47.250
Erwin... Will you take over as commander?

00:18:49.375 --> 00:18:52.042
Special people do exist.

00:18:53.292 --> 00:18:57.917
This just means I was never one of them.

00:18:58.917 --> 00:19:03.708
Why did I not realize that simple fact?

00:19:05.125 --> 00:19:08.375
Wall Maria was destroyed!

00:19:08.375 --> 00:19:10.917
Shiganshina District was decimated!

00:19:10.917 --> 00:19:13.417
Us in Trost District are next!

00:19:20.208 --> 00:19:21.667
Keith!

00:19:24.417 --> 00:19:28.250
Oh... I know now...

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:30.333
It was your fault...

00:19:34.333 --> 00:19:35.667
Eren.

00:19:36.667 --> 00:19:40.333
Wake up, Eren. Was your mother not with you?

00:19:43.583 --> 00:19:45.917
Dad...

00:19:45.917 --> 00:19:47.625
Mom...

00:19:47.625 --> 00:19:49.333
A Titan...

00:19:50.625 --> 00:19:52.417
...ate her.

00:20:02.167 --> 00:20:04.042
Eren.

00:20:04.042 --> 00:20:06.917
Avenge your mother.

00:20:06.917 --> 00:20:09.208
You must.

00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:11.125
I know you can.

00:20:12.458 --> 00:20:14.208
Let's go.

00:20:14.208 --> 00:20:17.083
Wait. Where are you going?

00:20:17.083 --> 00:20:19.917
Don't follow us.

00:20:19.917 --> 00:20:21.667
Wait.

00:20:21.667 --> 00:20:25.500
Why don't you just do it? Avenge Carla...

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.458
Why? Is it because you're special?

00:20:28.458 --> 00:20:31.042
Unlike me...

00:20:31.042 --> 00:20:33.875
What if your kid is different, too?

00:20:33.875 --> 00:20:37.500
He might not be a chosen one either.

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.208
Right?

00:20:39.208 --> 00:20:43.208
Are you going to curse... someone else now?

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:46.958
This child is not like you.

00:20:46.958 --> 00:20:48.875
He's my son.

00:20:48.875 --> 00:20:50.583
I beg you.

00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:52.417
Stay out of it.

00:21:00.292 --> 00:21:01.875
Thunder?

00:21:11.417 --> 00:21:18.042
And then I carried your unconscious
body back to the shelter.

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:25.250
That is everything I know.

00:21:32.833 --> 00:21:35.875
So that's... it?

00:21:38.708 --> 00:21:42.250
Now we know the real reason you resigned.

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:45.125
Not to atone for the soldiers you killed,

00:21:45.125 --> 00:21:47.958
but because you realized
you were never special.

00:21:47.958 --> 00:21:50.250
That's the childish reason you're here.

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:51.792
Quit it, Hange.

00:21:51.792 --> 00:21:56.125
Screw your inferiority complex.
Don't run from reality.

00:21:56.125 --> 00:22:00.167
Isn't that what vowing to give
our hearts was all about?!

00:22:00.167 --> 00:22:02.333
Please stop, Hange.

00:22:03.333 --> 00:22:08.917
The commandant was right.
I was never special or anything.

00:22:08.917 --> 00:22:10.750
But...

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:14.208
I'm the son of a special man.

00:22:14.208 --> 00:22:16.292
That's all it is.

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:20.792
Your mother...

00:22:20.792 --> 00:22:24.250
Carla said this...

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:27.000
Is it wrong not to be special?

00:22:30.833 --> 00:22:34.417
I don't think that way.

00:22:34.417 --> 00:22:37.042
When it comes to my child...

00:22:37.042 --> 00:22:40.583
...it's fine if he's never great.

00:22:40.583 --> 00:22:43.333
He doesn't have to be better than anyone.

00:22:45.667 --> 00:22:48.750
After all, just look at him...

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:51.792
He's so cute!

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:57.375
He's already special.

00:22:57.375 --> 00:22:59.417
Because he was...

00:22:59.417 --> 00:23:01.875
...born into this world.

00:23:06.125 --> 00:23:10.583
And you, just like your father wanted...

00:23:10.583 --> 00:23:13.375
...chose to set ablaze your life...

00:23:13.375 --> 00:23:16.292
...which will burn to ashes outside the walls.

00:23:25.833 --> 00:23:28.708
In the end, I couldn't...

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.083
I couldn't change a single thing at all.

00:23:35.917 --> 00:23:38.458
I'm a mere bystander.

00:23:57.625 --> 00:24:00.458
The night before leaving for Shiganshina...

00:24:00.458 --> 00:24:05.875
Now knowing of a world outside the walls,
with hope and fear in their hearts,

00:24:05.875 --> 00:24:08.792
they pray for the future of humanity.

00:24:08.792 --> 00:24:12.208
Next episode: "Night of the
Battle to Retake the Wall."
