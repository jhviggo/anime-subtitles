WEBVTT

00:00:18.894 --> 00:00:20.437
In other words...

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:24.608
It's possible for us to plug
that hole in Wall Maria now.

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:31.240
The Scout Regiment hurry their
preparations for retaking Wall Maria.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.748
Hell yeah! We did it, Eren!

00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:43.460
Eren?

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.839
Let's hurry... make weapons, and get going...

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:49.132
...to Shiganshina.

00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:54.304
Seems if I inject this...
I'll turn into a Titan.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.933
There came another...

00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:02.563
One more thing to shape
their fate had been found.

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:08.569
Sorry I'm late.

00:01:11.864 --> 00:01:13.490
Well?

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.326
Have we discovered what's in the container?

00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:18.203
The thing is...

00:01:18.203 --> 00:01:23.292
With our technology, I'm afraid
we can't dig much deeper.

00:01:23.292 --> 00:01:25.627
Like we've heard from Eren and Historia,

00:01:25.627 --> 00:01:30.883
it seems to originate from
some sort of human bodily fluid.

00:01:30.883 --> 00:01:36.805
However, it vaporizes when exposed
to air, making analysis difficult.

00:01:36.805 --> 00:01:41.894
Whoever made it must have had
technology far superior to ours.

00:01:41.894 --> 00:01:45.814
If it was the Reiss family,
I can't imagine how...

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:47.524
Hmm...

00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:51.320
In that case, instead of tampering with it,

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.740
we should use it to achieve
our current objective.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.367
But who do we entrust it to?

00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:59.536
Erwin, to you?

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:01.371
No...

00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:04.374
I'm no more than a wounded soldier.

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:10.339
This box belongs with one of our elite
soldiers who has the best odds of survival.

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:13.634
Levi, would you keep it?

00:02:13.634 --> 00:02:16.220
If it's an order, just say so.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.597
Why even ask the question?

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:24.520
We can't predict in what situation
we'll have to use this.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.608
We'll be relying on you
to make a decision on the fly.

00:02:29.608 --> 00:02:35.322
Judging when and who to use it on
will be for you to choose.

00:02:35.322 --> 00:02:38.200
Can we leave that to you?

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.539
If this dream of yours comes true,
what will you do then?

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:46.333
I... don't know.

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:48.585
I won't know until it happens.

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:52.381
I see... All right.

00:02:52.381 --> 00:02:54.049
I'll do it.

00:02:58.554 --> 00:03:03.100
By the way, I'd like to unveil
that work of mine soon.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.601
Have you given it thought?

00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:06.979
You still haven't given up on that?

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:13.735
If the public saw that repulsive display,
trust in the military would hit rock bottom.

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:16.530
You don't know art when you see it.

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:01.635
In other words, Eren's father, Grisha Jaeger...

00:05:01.635 --> 00:05:05.889
...is likely a human who came
from outside the walls.

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.349
Yes.

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:13.772
Just like Annie, Reiner, and Bertholdt,
he possessed the Power of the Titans.

00:05:13.772 --> 00:05:20.070
But different from those three, he was
supportive of humanity within the walls.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.574
If he was so interested to know
about the Scouts and such,

00:05:23.574 --> 00:05:26.994
we could've used more of that support of his.

00:05:26.994 --> 00:05:29.037
I wonder...

00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:31.373
From the moment he entered the walls,

00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:35.294
he was searching for the royal
family all alone, I'm sure.

00:05:35.294 --> 00:05:36.879
And that...

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:41.175
That's not something you do
without incredible resolve.

00:05:41.175 --> 00:05:46.889
That same father wanted to show his
10-year-old son, eager to join the Scouts,

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:48.849
the basement of their house.

00:05:49.975 --> 00:05:55.272
On death's door, he said the truth
of it all was... in the basement.

00:05:55.272 --> 00:05:58.859
What in the world do you think is down there?

00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:03.363
Things which mustn't be said.

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:06.283
No...

00:06:06.283 --> 00:06:11.246
Things Grisha Jaeger couldn't say,
even if he wanted to.

00:06:11.246 --> 00:06:15.459
That which the First Reiss King
wiped from our memories...

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:17.878
...memories of our world...

00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:19.671
...is what I hope, but...

00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:22.799
Pondering about it here won't accomplish much.

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:27.638
The preparations finished today.

00:06:27.638 --> 00:06:31.808
The operation to retake
Wall Maria starts in two days.

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:34.394
Want to know what's in the basement?

00:06:34.394 --> 00:06:36.980
Let's go see for ourselves.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.025
Isn't that what Scouts do?

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:45.697
Let all your squads know.

00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:48.700
Right. Keeping it secret of course, yeah?

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.703
On a day like this,
we deserve some meat, right?

00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:57.167
Good idea. Gotta show those kids
us adults can be counted on.

00:06:57.167 --> 00:07:00.462
What about Commander Sadies
keeping secrets from us?

00:07:00.462 --> 00:07:03.924
Forget about him.
We don't have time to deal with it.

00:07:03.924 --> 00:07:07.302
I'm shocked, Hange. You used to adore him!

00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:08.804
Shut up!

00:07:12.266 --> 00:07:14.685
What is it, Levi?

00:07:14.685 --> 00:07:17.312
It's a bit hasty, but...

00:07:17.312 --> 00:07:20.941
What will you do after retaking Wall Maria?

00:07:20.941 --> 00:07:24.444
I'd guess a defense plan comes first, but...

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:26.238
After that?

00:07:26.238 --> 00:07:28.532
Eliminating threats.

00:07:28.532 --> 00:07:34.788
Outside the walls, there seems to be
someone hoping Titans will eat us all.

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:40.460
Of course, the answer to who
is in the basement, I imagine.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.963
It's as I said earlier.

00:07:42.963 --> 00:07:45.883
We'll plan that after the basement.

00:07:45.883 --> 00:07:50.095
I'm asking this because you
might not live that long.

00:07:50.095 --> 00:07:53.390
You can't exactly move like you used to.

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:57.269
Let Hange call the shots.

00:07:57.269 --> 00:07:59.897
You'll just be dead weight.

00:07:59.897 --> 00:08:02.191
Let the good news come to you.

00:08:02.191 --> 00:08:05.611
We'll tell the others I argued till you gave in.

00:08:05.611 --> 00:08:08.947
No... That's actually what I intend.

00:08:08.947 --> 00:08:10.657
Fine with that?

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:19.917
I'm not.

00:08:21.293 --> 00:08:24.713
I'm fine being food. Use me as bait.

00:08:24.713 --> 00:08:27.549
The chain of command still remains.

00:08:27.549 --> 00:08:29.510
If I'm gone, then Hange.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:32.429
If Hange's gone, the next.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:35.724
It's true, this operation
will be dangerous, but...

00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:39.269
...to humanity, it's more
important than anything else.

00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:41.396
That's why I've gone to such lengths.

00:08:41.396 --> 00:08:43.899
This is all my plan.

00:08:43.899 --> 00:08:46.693
If I don't do it, the success rate will plummet.

00:08:46.693 --> 00:08:50.864
That's right. The operation might fail, but...

00:08:50.864 --> 00:08:54.326
If you bite the dust in
the process, we're doomed.

00:08:54.326 --> 00:08:58.372
So just sit at your desk
and keep using your head.

00:08:58.372 --> 00:09:01.542
That's the last thing the Titans would want.

00:09:01.542 --> 00:09:05.963
And for humanity,
it's the best thing going for us.

00:09:05.963 --> 00:09:07.840
No, you're wrong.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.592
Our best option is for me to gamble it all--

00:09:10.592 --> 00:09:13.554
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hold up...

00:09:13.554 --> 00:09:18.642
Keep using that bluff around me
and I'll break both of your damn legs.

00:09:18.642 --> 00:09:22.062
I'll make it nice and easy to attach them later.

00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:27.067
But the operation to retake Wall Maria
will proceed with you weeping here.

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:30.362
It'll be a bitch to get to the toilet though.

00:09:32.573 --> 00:09:34.658
I'd like to avoid that.

00:09:35.993 --> 00:09:38.453
What you're saying is right.

00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:42.165
A wounded soldier should
stay off the battlefield.

00:09:43.292 --> 00:09:45.586
However...

00:09:45.586 --> 00:09:49.047
There will come a moment when
we learn the truth of our world...

00:09:49.047 --> 00:09:51.758
...and I must be there for it.

00:09:54.094 --> 00:09:57.556
Is it that important to you?

00:09:57.556 --> 00:09:59.474
More than your legs?

00:09:59.474 --> 00:10:01.101
Yes.

00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:04.062
More than humanity's victory?

00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:05.397
Yes.

00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:11.528
I see...

00:10:17.242 --> 00:10:18.660
Erwin...

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.246
I'll trust your judgment.

00:10:27.044 --> 00:10:32.049
"After the fall of Wall Maria, there was a dramatic decrease
in food production. Livestock in particular suffered
due to requiring plentiful land. As a result, meat became
expensive and occasions to eat it are scarce."

00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:39.640
This may be a special night, but...
let's not let the public find out!

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.809
Behave like soldiers without causing a ruckus!

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:45.187
Eh? Meat?

00:10:45.187 --> 00:10:48.398
What? Is this... meat?

00:10:49.316 --> 00:10:50.817
Am I dreaming?

00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:54.530
Tonight's the night before
we retake Wall Maria!

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.156
Cheers!

00:10:56.156 --> 00:10:57.658
Huh?! Wait!

00:10:57.658 --> 00:10:59.993
Calm down! We'll split it evenly!

00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:02.120
Hey! That big piece counts as two!

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:02.996
Hell no!

00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:06.750
But you suck with the spear!
You're useless, so gimme yours!

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:07.835
Say what?!

00:11:07.835 --> 00:11:10.254
Don't you start pulling that shit, potato girl!

00:11:10.254 --> 00:11:12.965
What the hell do you think you're doing?!

00:11:12.965 --> 00:11:14.424
Cut it out, Sasha!

00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:18.136
I... I don't wanna have to kill you!

00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:20.597
You can't eat the whole thing alone!

00:11:21.807 --> 00:11:23.725
You're eating me! Eating me! Eating me!

00:11:23.725 --> 00:11:27.563
Sasha! That meat is Jean!
Have you lost your mind?!

00:11:27.563 --> 00:11:30.691
Do the Scouts never get fed any meat?

00:11:30.691 --> 00:11:32.192
Pathetic...

00:11:34.653 --> 00:11:37.239
Conny, would you knock Sasha out already?

00:11:37.239 --> 00:11:38.824
I'm trying!

00:11:38.824 --> 00:11:41.869
She should be unconscious,
but she's still moving!

00:11:41.869 --> 00:11:44.329
Hey, I think we've got casualties.

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:47.249
Whose brilliant idea was it to serve meat?

00:11:47.249 --> 00:11:53.213
Sorry. But now we know blowing the food budget
for two months in one night results in this.

00:11:55.883 --> 00:11:57.426
That should do it.

00:11:57.426 --> 00:11:59.845
She finally ran out of energy.

00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:03.265
Can you believe this freak?

00:12:03.265 --> 00:12:06.643
And to think she once offered
to share meat with everyone.

00:12:06.643 --> 00:12:08.604
Huh? When?

00:12:08.604 --> 00:12:12.774
Four months ago, when we were
servicing the cannons.

00:12:14.276 --> 00:12:18.030
I brought some meat from
the officers' storehouse!

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:19.990
It'll be fine!

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:24.411
We can just raise more cattle and
sheep once we retake our land!

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:30.709
It's happening again!

00:12:30.709 --> 00:12:34.087
The Titans are going to get in!

00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:37.758
It disappeared!

00:12:37.758 --> 00:12:41.386
I thought... I felt sorry for you.

00:12:42.596 --> 00:12:43.680
Hey.

00:12:46.475 --> 00:12:50.979
Only four months have passed since back then?

00:12:50.979 --> 00:12:52.773
Only four months.

00:12:52.773 --> 00:12:56.485
But just think: Four months later,
we're in Squad Levi!

00:12:56.485 --> 00:12:58.904
We climbed the ranks in a flash.

00:13:00.239 --> 00:13:02.282
It's 'cuz you're a genius.

00:13:02.282 --> 00:13:03.951
Damn straight I am.

00:13:03.951 --> 00:13:06.828
Let's eat before our food gets cold.

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:09.790
Don't you see?

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:13.877
You're the rear guard 'cuz
you've got no experience.

00:13:13.877 --> 00:13:16.296
I understand that I may be weak, but...

00:13:16.296 --> 00:13:20.300
Isn't the vanguard the best place
to learn how the enemy moves?

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:24.346
What's this? Trying to act all tough
talking about self-sacrifice?

00:13:24.346 --> 00:13:29.184
But if we're all not of that mentality,
how will we be effective as a unit?

00:13:29.184 --> 00:13:32.771
Listen here... Everyone starts out as a recruit.

00:13:32.771 --> 00:13:37.985
If we throw recruits into battle like cannon
fodder, they'll all be too dead to learn.

00:13:37.985 --> 00:13:41.238
Which is why it's your job to
sit in the back and study,

00:13:41.238 --> 00:13:44.074
so you can come home in one piece.

00:13:45.284 --> 00:13:50.914
But the most useless of all is the suicidal
maniac who only knows how to charge in.

00:13:50.914 --> 00:13:52.165
Right?

00:13:54.668 --> 00:13:57.546
Jean... Who do you mean by that?

00:13:59.339 --> 00:14:01.216
Who else but you?

00:14:01.216 --> 00:14:02.885
You suicidal maniac.

00:14:02.885 --> 00:14:05.429
Actually, I found something out recently.

00:14:05.429 --> 00:14:07.848
I'm quite a normal person, you know?

00:14:07.848 --> 00:14:13.228
So if you're saying that to me,
that just makes you a coward, Jean.

00:14:15.314 --> 00:14:17.649
You're so full of yourself, you pig shit!

00:14:17.649 --> 00:14:21.236
You trying to grow out the hair
on your mane, horse face?!

00:14:21.236 --> 00:14:22.362
Hey, what the--?

00:14:22.362 --> 00:14:23.906
Just don't hit the face.

00:14:23.906 --> 00:14:24.740
You jerk!

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.366
You're ripping it, ass!

00:14:26.366 --> 00:14:28.535
What the hell are they doing?

00:14:32.706 --> 00:14:34.708
You bastard!

00:14:36.502 --> 00:14:37.753
Show 'em what you've got!

00:14:37.753 --> 00:14:40.547
He's losing ground!

00:14:40.547 --> 00:14:42.341
Looks like something started.

00:14:42.341 --> 00:14:44.885
And here I told 'em to behave...

00:14:47.638 --> 00:14:49.056
But seriously...

00:14:49.056 --> 00:14:50.015
Ah?

00:14:50.015 --> 00:14:54.269
If you didn't have Titan powers,
you'd be dead ten times over.

00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:58.357
And every time, Mikasa would
swoop in to save your ass.

00:14:59.775 --> 00:15:02.152
If you insist on being suicidal...

00:15:02.152 --> 00:15:04.738
...I'll just have to kill you!

00:15:04.738 --> 00:15:08.992
That's something I'll have to take to heart!

00:15:08.992 --> 00:15:13.080
You should start showing
your mom some respect, Jean-boy!

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.414
Would you forget that?!

00:15:14.414 --> 00:15:16.041
Blargh!

00:15:17.376 --> 00:15:19.378
Shouldn't we stop them?

00:15:20.504 --> 00:15:21.672
No...

00:15:23.465 --> 00:15:25.175
I think it's fine.

00:15:28.554 --> 00:15:32.182
Why isn't anybody stopping us?

00:15:32.182 --> 00:15:34.059
How long will this go on for?

00:15:34.059 --> 00:15:37.813
Shit... I think I'm gonna barf up that meat.

00:15:37.813 --> 00:15:38.939
Hey.

00:15:41.525 --> 00:15:44.278
You're all too damn rowdy.

00:15:44.278 --> 00:15:46.488
Go to sleep.

00:15:46.488 --> 00:15:47.823
And clean that up.

00:15:47.823 --> 00:15:49.449
Yes, sir!

00:15:54.538 --> 00:15:56.582
Ouch...

00:15:56.582 --> 00:15:59.001
It's weird when I say it, but...

00:15:59.001 --> 00:16:01.837
Shouldn't you guys watch out for me more?

00:16:01.837 --> 00:16:06.383
I knew if you got hurt it would
heal up quick, so I just watched.

00:16:07.843 --> 00:16:09.887
That's so cruel.

00:16:09.887 --> 00:16:12.514
You're the one who incited it.

00:16:12.514 --> 00:16:15.601
But... at least you're spunky again.

00:16:19.605 --> 00:16:22.316
I'm glad we met the commandant.

00:16:22.316 --> 00:16:25.235
I... It doesn't...

00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:30.115
Whether I'm spunky or not,
I'll do what I have to do.

00:16:30.115 --> 00:16:32.242
But, yeah...

00:16:32.242 --> 00:16:34.203
It's easier now.

00:16:34.203 --> 00:16:37.623
Kept thinking about stuff I can't change.

00:16:38.665 --> 00:16:44.463
And wondering why I can't be
strong like Mikasa and Levi...

00:16:44.463 --> 00:16:46.298
I was jealous.

00:16:47.382 --> 00:16:53.430
But even you and the captain...
alone, you can't do much.

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:58.143
Which is why we've all gotta
find the things we can do.

00:16:58.143 --> 00:17:02.898
And by joining together,
that's what makes us powerful.

00:17:04.441 --> 00:17:06.818
Every person is different.

00:17:06.818 --> 00:17:09.404
And it's all for times like this.

00:17:18.956 --> 00:17:20.374
Yeah...

00:17:21.625 --> 00:17:23.418
I think you're right.

00:17:42.896 --> 00:17:45.399
Once we retake Wall Maria...

00:17:45.399 --> 00:17:48.902
...and defeat all the enemies coming for us...

00:17:48.902 --> 00:17:51.530
...will they come back?

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:54.157
Those days...

00:17:54.157 --> 00:17:56.243
We'll bring it back.

00:17:56.243 --> 00:18:00.163
But some things are forever changed.

00:18:00.163 --> 00:18:02.916
We'll make them pay for that.

00:18:04.376 --> 00:18:06.378
Yeah.

00:18:06.378 --> 00:18:08.630
But there's more than that.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:12.092
The sea...

00:18:12.092 --> 00:18:15.596
A salt lake so big that merchants
could spend their whole lives

00:18:15.596 --> 00:18:18.265
and still not get all the salt.

00:18:19.308 --> 00:18:23.478
There's more than just Titans outside the walls.

00:18:23.478 --> 00:18:28.692
Fiery water, lands of ice, sandy snowfields...

00:18:28.692 --> 00:18:33.322
I joined the Scouts so I could see all that.

00:18:33.322 --> 00:18:37.284
Y-Yeah. You sure did.

00:18:45.292 --> 00:18:46.710
Right?!

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:49.046
Let's start by seeing the sea!

00:18:49.046 --> 00:18:51.590
You still doubt that it's real, Eren!

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:54.843
You'll see! It does exist!

00:18:54.843 --> 00:18:56.512
All right then.

00:18:56.512 --> 00:18:58.722
Guess we'll have to go see.

00:18:58.722 --> 00:19:00.349
It's a promise, then!

00:19:00.349 --> 00:19:01.558
You have to!

00:19:01.558 --> 00:19:04.603
--Yet another conversation only you two get.
--We can explore the outside world!

00:19:04.603 --> 00:19:08.106
It's gotta be way bigger than inside the walls!

00:19:08.106 --> 00:19:10.108
Okay, I get it.

00:19:17.074 --> 00:19:19.117
Just before sunset...

00:19:20.953 --> 00:19:22.663
It's finally time.

00:19:34.675 --> 00:19:37.261
Hey!

00:19:37.261 --> 00:19:39.555
Hange!

00:19:39.555 --> 00:19:40.806
Good luck!

00:19:40.806 --> 00:19:42.891
Flegel?

00:19:42.891 --> 00:19:46.728
Take back Wall Maria for us!

00:19:46.728 --> 00:19:50.524
The future of humanity is in your hands!

00:19:50.524 --> 00:19:52.568
Captain Levi!

00:19:52.568 --> 00:19:56.738
Thank you for saving our city!

00:19:56.738 --> 00:20:00.701
You all come back in one piece, all right?!

00:20:00.701 --> 00:20:04.913
But go and reclaim our territory!

00:20:04.913 --> 00:20:07.332
Someone's got a big mouth.

00:20:07.332 --> 00:20:10.794
Well, with the commotion we made,
of course they'd find out.

00:20:10.794 --> 00:20:15.090
The thing is, all that meat we ordered
was from the Reeves Company.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.758
Damn that Flegel.

00:20:16.758 --> 00:20:20.762
--Yeah! You can count on us!
--You know we will!

00:20:20.762 --> 00:20:24.975
How long's it been since the Scouts
got a send-off like this?

00:20:24.975 --> 00:20:29.396
Who knows? I don't think we've ever...

00:20:29.396 --> 00:20:33.192
As far as I'm aware, this is a first.

00:20:50.042 --> 00:20:52.920
The final operation to retake Wall Maria...

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:54.713
...will now commence!

00:21:01.595 --> 00:21:05.807
Advance!

00:22:40.027 --> 00:22:41.361
You guys...

00:23:00.047 --> 00:23:01.548
You guys...

00:23:02.674 --> 00:23:05.761
Do you have the faintest damn clue...

00:23:05.761 --> 00:23:57.078
...what you're doing?!
