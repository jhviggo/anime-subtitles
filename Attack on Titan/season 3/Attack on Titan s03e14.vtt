WEBVTT

00:02:08.542 --> 00:02:11.208
Erwin, he's gonna climb up.

00:02:27.042 --> 00:02:31.292
All troops! Avoid clashing
with the Armored Titan!

00:02:31.292 --> 00:02:33.000
Stay away from him!

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.583
Roger!

00:02:34.583 --> 00:02:39.042
Hange, why didn't he signal to attack?
What's he thinking?

00:02:39.042 --> 00:02:42.083
He's watching our movements.

00:02:42.083 --> 00:02:47.875
Because Reiner and friends prepared
some sort of grand welcome for us.

00:02:53.917 --> 00:02:57.875
That quadruped type is carrying
luggage on its saddle.

00:02:57.875 --> 00:03:01.208
It wasn't one of those that just transformed.

00:03:01.208 --> 00:03:04.875
In which case, is that the enemy's scout?

00:03:04.875 --> 00:03:11.500
If it took notice of our approach and
informed Reiner, that must mean...

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.417
That quadruped type down there
is an Intelligent Titan.

00:03:16.417 --> 00:03:19.208
No, there might even be others.

00:03:19.208 --> 00:03:22.375
That Titan... has luggage?

00:03:22.375 --> 00:03:24.208
What could it be?

00:03:39.583 --> 00:03:44.042
They're moving! Multiple two-
to three-meters approaching!

00:03:44.042 --> 00:03:47.292
It's just like the raid at Utgard Castle...

00:03:47.292 --> 00:03:50.375
They'll go after the horses first.

00:03:50.375 --> 00:03:54.375
Their primary objective
is to capture Eren, but...

00:03:54.375 --> 00:03:59.875
To achieve that, they'll take away
our only escape option.

00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:03.583
With Wall Maria still being
deep in Titan territory,

00:04:03.583 --> 00:04:07.000
we have no means to get back without horses.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.792
Just by killing our horses, it completely blocks
our escape and severs our supply line.

00:04:13.792 --> 00:04:16.083
Whether it takes one week or a month,

00:04:16.083 --> 00:04:19.667
they can simply wait until
there's nobody who can move.

00:04:19.667 --> 00:04:22.542
Without any of the risks of battle,

00:04:22.542 --> 00:04:26.417
they can waltz in and take Eren
once he's too weak to resist.

00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:32.125
Right now, the fact that all those larger
Titans are staying in formation

00:04:32.125 --> 00:04:37.167
is proof that their only
purpose is to cage us in.

00:04:40.875 --> 00:04:43.458
Commander! The Armored Titan is close!

00:04:43.458 --> 00:04:46.375
And we still don't know where Bertholdt is!

00:04:46.375 --> 00:04:49.583
Yeah, I know.

00:04:49.583 --> 00:04:52.458
At this point, what I fear most...

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:57.917
...is that Reiner and Bertholdt
slaughter our horses unchecked.

00:04:57.917 --> 00:04:59.208
Therefore...

00:05:00.292 --> 00:05:02.833
Are you finally ready to say something?

00:05:02.833 --> 00:05:05.750
I could've had breakfast during the wait.

00:05:07.083 --> 00:05:09.250
Dirk Squad and Marlene Squad!

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.792
Protect the horses at the gate with Klaus Squad!

00:05:12.792 --> 00:05:17.125
Levi Squad and Hange Squad!
Take down the Armored Titan!

00:05:17.125 --> 00:05:20.167
Employ the Thunder Spears
at your own discretion!

00:05:20.167 --> 00:05:23.208
Achieve your objectives, whatever it takes!

00:05:23.208 --> 00:05:26.000
This moment! This battle!

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.250
The survival of humanity depends on it!

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.667
Once more, for humanity...

00:05:31.667 --> 00:05:34.250
...give your hearts!

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.375
Yes, sir!

00:05:36.917 --> 00:05:41.125
You hear that?! Turn the tables on
the Titans coming for our horses!

00:05:41.125 --> 00:05:42.208
Sir!

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:44.042
Wait! Levi, Armin!

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.167
I did say Levi Squad,
but I need you to stay, Levi.

00:05:49.167 --> 00:05:51.750
To protect the horses and not Eren?

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.000
That's right.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.833
And to strike him down when the chance comes.

00:05:57.833 --> 00:06:01.667
You're the only one I can entrust
to take on the Beast Titan.

00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.667
Understood.

00:06:04.667 --> 00:06:08.000
Since I failed to kill that
armored brat earlier,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.083
I'll make up for it with the Beast Titan's head.

00:06:14.125 --> 00:06:17.250
Armin, I have a plan for the Armored Titan.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.625
Sir.

00:06:18.625 --> 00:06:21.667
There are two halves in this
battle for humanity's fate.

00:06:21.667 --> 00:06:26.042
And one of them... I'm putting
on Hange and your shoulders.

00:06:44.417 --> 00:06:48.375
There they are... all gathered in one place.

00:06:48.375 --> 00:06:51.292
I'll kill the horses and make a break for it.

00:06:51.292 --> 00:06:53.292
That's good enough.

00:06:53.292 --> 00:06:59.333
No matter how strong Captain Levi is,
he's still no match for our War Chief.

00:07:04.125 --> 00:07:06.292
That was close...

00:07:06.292 --> 00:07:10.208
If I was any slower transferring
my consciousness to my body,

00:07:10.208 --> 00:07:12.125
I would've died instantly.

00:07:13.208 --> 00:07:17.042
How did they even think
to look inside the walls?

00:07:18.458 --> 00:07:21.708
Armin? Was it you?

00:07:23.792 --> 00:07:26.167
No... It doesn't matter.

00:07:26.167 --> 00:07:30.667
With this, our long journey
is finally coming to an end.

00:07:38.917 --> 00:07:41.708
Erwin Smith...

00:07:41.708 --> 00:07:45.208
Don't get distracted.
I've got to kill the horses first.

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:54.500
Eren!

00:07:57.625 --> 00:08:00.917
Why did he show up unprovoked?

00:08:00.917 --> 00:08:05.292
They should be painfully aware
that he's our main objective.

00:08:05.292 --> 00:08:07.208
What are you thinking?

00:08:12.583 --> 00:08:15.958
To flee south and escape over the wall?

00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:20.625
If he's alone, he could escape as
a Titan to Trost without a horse.

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:25.500
And were that to happen, we'd have
no reason to stay here and fight.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.833
Even if we did manage to annihilate the Scouts,

00:08:28.833 --> 00:08:33.875
we can't let someone who mastered hardening
in two months back in the walls.

00:08:33.875 --> 00:08:39.167
If he learns how to harness the
Coordinate's full power, it'll be too late.

00:08:41.167 --> 00:08:43.958
No, wait. This is weird...

00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.917
If he really was escaping,

00:08:45.917 --> 00:08:51.042
he would've transformed after using
ODM gear to scale the wall.

00:08:51.042 --> 00:08:55.125
Why would he transform when
Shiganshina is surrounded by walls?

00:08:57.333 --> 00:08:59.333
I get it!

00:08:59.333 --> 00:09:01.667
They're trying to...

00:09:01.667 --> 00:09:05.208
...change my target from the horses to Eren!

00:09:13.417 --> 00:09:17.083
Not giving me time to think, are we?

00:09:17.083 --> 00:09:21.917
Dammit, Commander.
And I climbed way up here...

00:09:27.417 --> 00:09:29.583
Good! He took the bait!

00:09:30.583 --> 00:09:33.458
He wants to use Eren as bait?

00:09:33.458 --> 00:09:36.125
Yes, those were Commander Erwin's orders.

00:09:36.125 --> 00:09:40.917
He'd resort to using Eren as bait
just to protect the horses?

00:09:40.917 --> 00:09:45.875
You're kidding... And what if Reiner
chooses to kill the horses anyway?

00:09:45.875 --> 00:09:49.042
No, he should chase Eren.

00:09:49.042 --> 00:09:51.500
If Reiner does go after the horses,

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:55.875
Eren will keep going and wrap
around behind the Beast Titan.

00:09:55.875 --> 00:10:01.083
With Levi, the Scouts, and Eren,
they can pincer and fight the Beast Titan.

00:10:01.083 --> 00:10:04.083
Erwin must have said that, right?

00:10:04.083 --> 00:10:05.167
Yes.

00:10:05.167 --> 00:10:09.333
Even if it doesn't go as planned,
by having Eren flee like that,

00:10:09.333 --> 00:10:12.375
it'll confuse the enemy enough
to break their ranks.

00:10:12.375 --> 00:10:15.583
It all depends if Reiner can see that far ahead.

00:10:20.167 --> 00:10:24.333
Knowing him, I bet that he will.

00:10:24.333 --> 00:10:28.167
All right! We'll take on the
Armored Titan in Shiganshina!

00:10:29.292 --> 00:10:30.750
Hold on!

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:33.958
There's one more thing I'm worried about.

00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:37.750
Bertholdt is still in hiding somewhere.

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:43.042
The last time they fought, Eren had
Reiner on the verge of defeat, but...

00:10:43.042 --> 00:10:47.542
...Bertholdt's attack caught him off guard
and he ended up their captive.

00:10:50.833 --> 00:10:56.083
It's a simple counter-strategy,
but let's fight away from the walls.

00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:06.333
It might've been a fluke, but...

00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:08.958
...I've beaten you once already.

00:11:10.375 --> 00:11:12.417
I had it in the bag.

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:16.875
One-on-one, I can win.

00:11:17.917 --> 00:11:23.708
When it comes to hand-to-hand combat,
Annie was a tougher opponent by far!

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.208
Do you have any idea...
where we're standing right now?!

00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:01.375
This is the place...

00:12:06.125 --> 00:12:07.542
...where I...

00:12:08.792 --> 00:12:10.250
...where we...

00:12:11.833 --> 00:12:14.167
...once called home!

00:12:16.125 --> 00:12:18.542
I'm taking it back.

00:12:18.542 --> 00:12:21.000
I'll slaughter you all...

00:12:22.375 --> 00:12:24.958
...and take back what you stole!

00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:26.542
All of it!

00:12:26.917 --> 00:12:31.958
"Thunder Spears"
"A weapon developed to combat the stout
defense of the Armored Titan using technology
formerly kept secret by the Interior Police."

00:12:36.667 --> 00:12:39.750
Recruits! Move the remaining horses west!

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:42.542
Protect the recruits with Dirk Squad!

00:12:42.542 --> 00:12:43.500
Where, Marlo?!

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:44.375
Huh?

00:12:44.375 --> 00:12:45.750
Where do we tie the horses?!

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:49.167
W-We were told not to put them all in one place.

00:12:49.167 --> 00:12:50.792
Not here. Farther.

00:12:50.792 --> 00:12:53.250
Three- to four-meters coming from the east!

00:12:58.042 --> 00:13:00.500
That's... a Titan?

00:13:11.042 --> 00:13:12.417
Captain Levi!

00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:14.292
Now's our chance! Hurry!

00:13:14.292 --> 00:13:16.542
Clean up the small ones already!

00:13:16.542 --> 00:13:18.500
Do it before the Beast Titan moves!

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:21.125
And no casualties! Don't you dare die!

00:13:21.125 --> 00:13:22.250
Sir!

00:13:25.542 --> 00:13:28.625
Shit, this is pathetic.

00:13:28.625 --> 00:13:31.167
The weak ones die so fast.

00:13:31.167 --> 00:13:33.250
Should've kept 'em up there.

00:13:37.167 --> 00:13:40.125
Struggling with three- to four-meter Titans...

00:13:40.125 --> 00:13:43.083
Casualties all over the place...

00:13:43.083 --> 00:13:47.417
The Scouts aren't nearly
as strong as they once were.

00:13:47.417 --> 00:13:54.125
However, without all those sacrifices,
we never would have made it this far.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:00.500
When I was a cadet,

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:05.125
I told the others about my father's
theory, which I also believed.

00:14:05.125 --> 00:14:09.250
And that once I was a Scout, I would prove it.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:14.875
But after I joined the Scouts,
I stopped talking about it for some reason.

00:14:16.042 --> 00:14:19.375
No, that's wrong...

00:14:19.375 --> 00:14:23.542
It wasn't some reason. I had realized something.

00:14:23.542 --> 00:14:29.083
That only I... was fighting for myself.

00:14:29.083 --> 00:14:34.083
That only I... had a dream I wanted to see.

00:14:37.833 --> 00:14:44.167
Before I knew it, I was giving people orders
and inspiring my comrades.

00:14:44.167 --> 00:14:48.375
Saying they should give
their hearts to humanity.

00:14:48.375 --> 00:14:51.375
Thus, I fooled my comrades...

00:14:51.375 --> 00:14:53.333
Fooled myself...

00:14:54.333 --> 00:14:57.667
And upon a mountain of their corpses...

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:00.750
...I now stand.

00:15:08.083 --> 00:15:12.125
And yet, the basement lingers
at the back of my mind.

00:15:13.083 --> 00:15:19.417
Even if this plan fails, I might be able
to reach the basement before I die...

00:15:19.417 --> 00:15:22.708
The basement Grisha Jeager left behind...

00:15:22.708 --> 00:15:24.833
The truth of our world...

00:15:34.583 --> 00:15:36.833
Those experiments paid off!

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.792
These fists are all I need to fight!

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:48.708
By focusing the hardening on
one spot, it gets even stronger!

00:15:48.708 --> 00:15:54.167
Since his armor's spread across his
whole body, I can smash it like thin ice!

00:16:01.875 --> 00:16:05.208
Too slow, you big oaf!

00:16:08.125 --> 00:16:09.208
Shit!

00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:56.125
Hange!

00:16:56.125 --> 00:16:59.667
Not yet! Everything rides on the first attack!

00:16:59.667 --> 00:17:03.083
Wait and trust Eren will give us a good opening!

00:17:10.667 --> 00:17:13.500
That metal rod is your new weapon?

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.750
You could at least call it a spear.

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:19.458
The Corps of Engineers really
pulled through for me.

00:17:19.458 --> 00:17:23.625
Using technology kept secret
by the Interior Police, that is.

00:17:23.625 --> 00:17:29.208
I told them, basically, we needed a weapon
we could use against the Armored Titan.

00:17:29.208 --> 00:17:31.625
Against the Armored Titan?!

00:17:31.625 --> 00:17:36.083
Our blades were all but useless
against the Armored Titan.

00:17:36.083 --> 00:17:39.292
As long as he didn't show
an opening in his hardening,

00:17:39.292 --> 00:17:45.000
all we could do was watch Eren fight
the Armored Titan from the sidelines.

00:17:47.458 --> 00:17:52.458
It's true... We couldn't stop him taking
Eren away even if we wanted to.

00:17:53.917 --> 00:17:59.208
Back then, if the commander hadn't
drawn a horde of Titans to him...

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:04.917
Thus far, the only attacks effective
against the Armored Titan

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:08.125
have been Eren's strangles and locks as a Titan.

00:18:08.125 --> 00:18:14.208
Also, we have high hopes for his
"hardened punch" from recent experiments.

00:18:14.208 --> 00:18:19.000
However, the mission won't succeed
with only those as our weapons.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.125
While it's important we plug
the wall, more so than that,

00:18:23.125 --> 00:18:28.167
we must kill Reiner and Bertholdt,
who are responsible for destroying the wall.

00:18:29.375 --> 00:18:34.083
So you're saying... you want us to stab
the Armored Titan with those spears?

00:18:34.083 --> 00:18:36.500
It's easier just to show you.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.125
Let's step outside.

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:50.292
It's powerful, as you can see.

00:18:50.292 --> 00:18:52.625
It's like a strike of lightning.

00:18:52.625 --> 00:18:55.083
Hence the name, "Thunder Spear."

00:18:55.083 --> 00:18:58.667
However, is it enough to bring
down the Armored Titan?

00:18:58.667 --> 00:19:01.458
We won't know until we try.

00:19:01.458 --> 00:19:03.792
It's effective against normal Titans,

00:19:03.792 --> 00:19:08.292
but to deal a blow to the Armored Titan,
it'll take a little more work.

00:19:30.625 --> 00:19:31.750
Shit!

00:19:44.208 --> 00:19:49.458
I guess biting Eren out of there
isn't something I can do by myself.

00:19:49.458 --> 00:19:51.792
I've got to resort to that...

00:19:58.458 --> 00:20:00.375
Go now!

00:20:00.375 --> 00:20:02.292
They're making a move?

00:20:02.292 --> 00:20:05.583
I knew they've been gradually
surrounding me, but...

00:20:05.583 --> 00:20:08.667
What can they even do to me with their blades?

00:20:08.667 --> 00:20:12.833
I've got hardened armor covering
every inch of my body.

00:20:12.833 --> 00:20:14.792
They can't even scratch me!

00:20:38.417 --> 00:20:39.917
We did it?

00:20:39.917 --> 00:20:42.083
No, not yet...

00:20:42.083 --> 00:20:47.167
The Thunder Spears are so destructive,
they're dangerous even to those who fire them.

00:20:47.167 --> 00:20:51.500
If you anchor to the Titan as if to
slash it like normal with your blade,

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.458
you'll get caught up in the explosion.

00:20:54.458 --> 00:20:57.250
Which means the only chance
to use Thunder Spears...

00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:02.167
...is when the target is surrounded
by multiple standing objects.

00:21:02.167 --> 00:21:06.667
We can only attack with Thunder Spears
in situations exactly like this.

00:21:07.667 --> 00:21:11.083
Right here and now, we've got to settle it!

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.458
W-We got 'em!

00:21:25.458 --> 00:21:28.958
It worked! The armor on his nape is peeling off!

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.875
R-Really?

00:21:33.875 --> 00:21:35.208
The spears worked!

00:21:35.208 --> 00:21:36.625
Do it again!

00:21:36.625 --> 00:21:40.125
Attack again with Thunder Spears
and finish him off!

00:21:45.167 --> 00:21:47.208
Reiner...

00:21:47.208 --> 00:21:49.292
You guys!

00:21:49.292 --> 00:21:52.583
I thought you were ready
if it ever came to this!

00:21:52.583 --> 00:21:54.167
Let's do it!

00:22:11.833 --> 00:22:14.083
W-Wait!

00:23:58.125 --> 00:24:03.417
If something had been said that day,
could the future have changed?

00:24:03.417 --> 00:24:09.500
For all the lives they carry on their shoulders,
they wish for the death of each other.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.096
Next episode: "Descent."
