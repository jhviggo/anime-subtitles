WEBVTT

00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:23.083
We die trusting the living who follow
to find meaning in our lives!

00:00:23.083 --> 00:00:29.000
That is the sole method in which
we can rebel against this cruel world!

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.167
My soldiers, rage!

00:00:31.167 --> 00:00:33.583
My soldiers, scream!

00:00:33.583 --> 00:00:36.500
My soldiers, fight!

00:00:49.875 --> 00:00:51.000
The commander!

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.833
Don't look back! Charge!

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.208
How pitiful...

00:02:41.208 --> 00:02:44.792
To never learn from the mistakes of history...

00:02:44.792 --> 00:02:49.583
It's a tragedy how King Reiss
stole their memories of the world.

00:02:49.583 --> 00:02:52.750
That's why they're repeating the same mistakes.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.000
In the end, they'll send every
last person in the walls,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.042
down to the children and
elderly, on a suicide charge.

00:03:00.042 --> 00:03:03.625
Saying if they're going to die,
they may as well die proud.

00:03:03.625 --> 00:03:05.583
It's bullshit!

00:03:07.417 --> 00:03:09.750
I crushed it into dust?

00:03:11.167 --> 00:03:13.583
What's gotten into me?

00:03:13.583 --> 00:03:16.083
Why are you getting worked up?

00:03:16.083 --> 00:03:18.625
You're not like your father, right?

00:03:18.625 --> 00:03:21.458
You've gotta try to enjoy things.

00:03:21.458 --> 00:03:25.958
So let's turn them all into
proud little chunks of meat!

00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:28.958
The second volley is coming! Fire!

00:03:34.875 --> 00:03:36.167
It's coming...

00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.958
Is this how I die?

00:03:44.792 --> 00:03:47.250
I wonder what Hitch is doing...

00:03:48.292 --> 00:03:51.667
Wait, I bet she's still in bed...

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.750
Sounds nice...

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.250
I don't get it... Why am I,
at a time like this...?

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:12.125
Yeah!

00:04:12.125 --> 00:04:14.625
Game over!

00:04:14.625 --> 00:04:18.542
You like that? I changed how I threw the pitch.

00:04:18.542 --> 00:04:20.958
Now you're done for.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.333
Fire!

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.833
Like I said... How is firing those
things going to help you?

00:04:38.208 --> 00:04:43.625
All that screaming...
What good is it going to do you?!

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.625
Aww, you poor things...

00:04:59.917 --> 00:05:01.167
Hmm?

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.208
What's that?

00:05:04.208 --> 00:05:06.667
My Titans have fallen...

00:05:20.333 --> 00:05:21.875
Huh?

00:05:21.875 --> 00:05:24.500
I need to watch out for a single soldier?

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.375
Yes. Captain Levi is dangerous.

00:05:28.375 --> 00:05:30.500
Is this Levi?

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:32.917
My nape!

00:05:35.333 --> 00:05:36.750
What the--?

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.375
I can't see a thing!

00:05:39.417 --> 00:05:41.250
Did he take out my eyes?

00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.083
My legs!

00:05:45.792 --> 00:05:49.375
What happened to all that fun you were having?!

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.958
Tsk! I'll harden!

00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:54.375
Shoot, I won't make it!

00:05:54.375 --> 00:05:57.083
Come on, let's try to enjoy this!

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.500
After transforming, if your
body's severely damaged,

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.542
it's too busy healing to let you transform.

00:06:26.542 --> 00:06:28.542
Isn't that right?

00:06:31.042 --> 00:06:33.208
Hey, answer me.

00:06:33.208 --> 00:06:35.333
Learn some manners.

00:06:36.875 --> 00:06:39.500
I can't kill him yet...

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.208
Isn't anyone out there still alive?

00:06:43.208 --> 00:06:50.000
If they are, even on the brink of death,
this injection will make them a Titan.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
We can have them eat this guy
and steal the Beast Titan's power.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.500
Someone, just one...

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.750
...I can bring back to life.

00:07:15.083 --> 00:07:16.375
Hey...

00:07:16.375 --> 00:07:18.542
Where are you going? Stop...

00:07:19.625 --> 00:07:23.208
All of you! Go kill him!

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.625
It hurts! You've done it now, Levi!

00:07:33.625 --> 00:07:35.542
It hurts!

00:07:35.542 --> 00:07:38.500
But your weapons have to be all used up.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.833
With this, you'll all be wiped out!

00:07:40.833 --> 00:07:44.792
That might've been a close one,
but victory is ours!

00:07:44.792 --> 00:07:46.667
Wait...

00:07:46.667 --> 00:07:49.208
I made a promise to him...

00:07:50.167 --> 00:07:53.042
...that I'd kill you no matter what.

00:07:54.125 --> 00:07:55.833
I promised!

00:08:04.542 --> 00:08:09.458
Why... am I... alive?

00:08:09.458 --> 00:08:10.833
The others...

00:08:13.667 --> 00:08:15.625
Hey!

00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:18.292
Is anyone else alive?!

00:08:23.375 --> 00:08:25.083
That bastard...

00:08:25.083 --> 00:08:28.125
To think he's seriously alive...

00:08:28.125 --> 00:08:31.125
Why won't he just stay dead?

00:08:31.125 --> 00:08:35.167
What the hell do we do...
against something like that?!

00:08:36.625 --> 00:08:38.542
Hey, Armin...

00:08:38.542 --> 00:08:42.417
I think having Eren escape
is the best we can do.

00:08:42.417 --> 00:08:44.167
He's thinner...

00:08:44.167 --> 00:08:45.250
Huh?

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:49.500
The Colossal Titan has gotten a little skinnier.

00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:53.042
It's just like Hange said!

00:08:53.042 --> 00:08:56.542
The Colossal Titan is weak
in a battle of attrition!

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.750
Remember Eren's experiments!

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:03.583
He could only transform up to three times.

00:09:03.583 --> 00:09:09.500
If that's the case for a 15-meter Titan,
a 60-meter one might be less efficient!

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.708
And there's his steam attack, too!

00:09:11.708 --> 00:09:18.458
I bet it's consuming everything except
his skeleton to produce that steam!

00:09:18.458 --> 00:09:20.042
So what are you saying?

00:09:20.042 --> 00:09:21.667
Armin...

00:09:21.667 --> 00:09:23.417
I have a plan.

00:09:23.417 --> 00:09:25.875
You all need to draw Reiner away.

00:09:25.875 --> 00:09:29.000
Eren and I will defeat Bertholdt ourselves.

00:09:31.208 --> 00:09:34.625
The two of us can win and I'm going to prove it.

00:09:36.417 --> 00:09:40.542
All right. Leave Reiner to the rest of us.

00:09:41.667 --> 00:09:44.000
Took long enough, dummy.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.625
I really thought we were goners.

00:09:52.417 --> 00:09:57.833
I don't know why, but when it comes
to taking back freedom...

00:10:00.167 --> 00:10:02.583
...strength flows through me.

00:10:11.333 --> 00:10:15.250
If this plan goes well, I...

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:17.708
...I won't get to look at the sea...

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:24.292
For some reason, when I think
of the outside world...

00:10:24.292 --> 00:10:26.750
...courage flows through me.

00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.708
Eren, wake up!

00:10:37.333 --> 00:10:39.417
Let's go look at the sea!

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.833
"It's said a world beyond our wildest dreams
extends outside the walls. It has fiery waters,
lands of ice, sandy snowfields, and a saltwater lake
called the sea that stretches far past the horizon."

00:11:04.542 --> 00:11:08.542
Eren, that sums up my plan.

00:11:08.542 --> 00:11:14.458
As long as we properly execute it
and manage to trick Bertholdt,

00:11:14.458 --> 00:11:18.250
this battle... is ours for the taking.

00:11:19.458 --> 00:11:24.042
Got it?! We've gotta trust that Eren
and Armin can handle Bertholdt!

00:11:24.042 --> 00:11:28.333
We just need to keep Reiner
away from them if we can!

00:11:28.333 --> 00:11:31.042
Let's keep him occupied from a safe distance!

00:11:31.042 --> 00:11:32.375
Roger!

00:11:39.625 --> 00:11:40.958
He ignored us?!

00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:45.125
That jerk! He's changing his focus to Eren?

00:11:45.125 --> 00:11:46.750
We'll just have to kill him!

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:48.000
Mikasa!

00:12:08.542 --> 00:12:09.500
Hey!

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:13.875
If we can't get Reiner's attention,
we have to finish him off right here!

00:12:13.875 --> 00:12:16.833
It's on us to protect Eren and Armin!

00:12:17.875 --> 00:12:19.708
Yeah, I know...

00:12:19.708 --> 00:12:21.875
We've only got three Thunder Spears left!

00:12:21.875 --> 00:12:23.458
Shit! But...

00:12:23.458 --> 00:12:25.167
We've gotta try anyway!

00:12:25.167 --> 00:12:28.750
'Cuz unless we fight, we can't win!

00:12:29.833 --> 00:12:33.625
What was that? What got me?

00:12:33.625 --> 00:12:36.875
A single attack took out my knee...

00:12:36.875 --> 00:12:40.292
I can't remember much since then...

00:12:40.292 --> 00:12:42.667
I'm blowing this whole area away.

00:12:42.667 --> 00:12:47.708
If you can, lie down with your
Titan body facing upwards.

00:12:47.708 --> 00:12:49.458
Bertholdt...

00:12:49.458 --> 00:12:52.833
What the hell happened to me?

00:12:52.833 --> 00:12:57.083
I don't know what's going on...
and I don't have much strength left.

00:12:57.083 --> 00:13:00.750
But... I know Eren's over there.

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:06.625
And as long as we capture Eren,
that should still mean that we win.

00:13:06.625 --> 00:13:08.875
Isn't that right, Bertholdt?

00:13:08.875 --> 00:13:14.125
I'll deal with these chumps quickly...
and come running to back you up.

00:13:14.125 --> 00:13:17.833
Reiner must be facing the four
who went that way.

00:13:17.833 --> 00:13:23.583
Strange... Only Eren and those guys
in the 104th survived the explosion?

00:13:24.625 --> 00:13:29.125
To be perfectly honest,
I hoped to blow everyone up.

00:13:29.125 --> 00:13:33.125
But I'm used to these sorts of trials, Armin...

00:13:33.125 --> 00:13:37.833
What's the point of waking Eren
when he's all battered like that?

00:13:37.833 --> 00:13:39.792
I want you to show me.

00:13:39.792 --> 00:13:43.542
What will you leave behind
in your final moments?

00:13:44.958 --> 00:13:47.792
I know it's a plan I thought up myself,

00:13:47.792 --> 00:13:53.125
but its success mostly depends on
how long I can hold out for.

00:13:54.417 --> 00:13:57.750
Armin, don't tell me you're...

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:02.500
Eren... Sorry, but I can't die
till I look at the sea.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:06.375
So I'll have to call it quits
before it gets out of hand.

00:14:06.375 --> 00:14:08.167
The rest is up to you.

00:14:08.167 --> 00:14:12.792
Y-You know, because I'm just not a hero.

00:14:12.792 --> 00:14:15.792
No... You're wrong...

00:14:15.792 --> 00:14:18.167
The Armin I know is...

00:14:18.167 --> 00:14:21.042
Eren... You should know.

00:14:21.042 --> 00:14:24.417
We promised to go to the sea together, right?

00:14:24.417 --> 00:14:27.333
Have I ever lied to you in my life?

00:14:31.542 --> 00:14:35.792
So no matter what happens,
stick to my plan till the end!

00:14:50.292 --> 00:14:52.208
Sh-Shit...

00:14:59.958 --> 00:15:01.708
Eren!

00:15:01.708 --> 00:15:05.458
I knew it... This battle is already won.

00:15:05.458 --> 00:15:12.208
He probably has a severe concussion
and can't even stand on his own.

00:15:12.208 --> 00:15:14.250
Enough of this...

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:16.042
Let's end it!

00:15:28.917 --> 00:15:30.750
Armin...

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:33.667
All the way to the very end...

00:15:33.667 --> 00:15:35.583
...you fought well.

00:15:39.292 --> 00:15:42.833
Eren! Armin!

00:15:42.833 --> 00:15:45.583
No... We left it to them...

00:15:45.583 --> 00:15:47.708
We're going to kill Reiner.

00:15:47.708 --> 00:15:53.083
If there's one way to take Reiner out
with three Thunder Spears, this is it.

00:15:53.083 --> 00:15:56.250
We'll pick a fight with him
while he still can't move.

00:15:56.250 --> 00:16:01.125
Either way this fight goes,
this is where it ends.

00:16:02.542 --> 00:16:04.167
Bring it on.

00:16:09.167 --> 00:16:14.500
Reiner!

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.625
First, I go as the decoy.

00:16:18.667 --> 00:16:22.750
Conny and Sasha will follow
with two Thunder Spears...

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:26.417
...and aim for Reiner's jaw from both sides!

00:16:32.292 --> 00:16:33.667
Sasha!

00:16:33.667 --> 00:16:34.917
Jean!

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:38.833
One of them missed...

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.708
If we blow off his jaw,
Reiner's mouth should open up!

00:16:43.708 --> 00:16:49.667
Mikasa can use the last Thunder Spear
to hit his nape through the mouth!

00:16:49.667 --> 00:16:51.542
His mouth isn't open...

00:16:51.542 --> 00:16:54.500
Even so, I have to do it!

00:16:58.208 --> 00:16:59.792
Why?

00:16:59.792 --> 00:17:02.167
I can't blow Armin away...

00:17:02.167 --> 00:17:04.750
Why won't his anchor come loose?

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.542
He shouldn't even be able to get close!

00:17:08.875 --> 00:17:10.542
I knew it...

00:17:10.542 --> 00:17:12.917
His bones aren't being consumed!

00:17:12.917 --> 00:17:15.708
The anchors stay put if they're not in muscle!

00:17:15.708 --> 00:17:21.625
But most importantly, he can't move
his body while he's emitting steam!

00:17:21.625 --> 00:17:25.833
But, Armin... Is this how you go out?

00:17:25.833 --> 00:17:29.708
In all your wisdom, the best plan
you could come up with...

00:17:29.708 --> 00:17:34.250
...was to get scorched to death like this?

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:37.833
I can't breathe! I have to let go...

00:17:37.833 --> 00:17:40.042
No! Not yet!

00:17:40.042 --> 00:17:42.375
It's not enough!

00:17:42.375 --> 00:17:46.333
I've gotta buy more time!

00:17:46.333 --> 00:17:49.667
What's he trying to accomplish? A diversion?

00:17:49.667 --> 00:17:52.917
But Eren's still beat to a pulp over there.

00:17:52.917 --> 00:17:56.917
Mikasa and them have their
hands full with Reiner.

00:17:56.917 --> 00:17:59.417
There isn't anything else to it?

00:17:59.417 --> 00:18:02.750
If this really is the end for you...

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:06.417
All right... I'll make it quick for you.

00:18:10.667 --> 00:18:12.500
Hold on!

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.917
Don't let go!

00:18:14.917 --> 00:18:17.333
I entrust it to Eren!

00:18:17.333 --> 00:18:21.833
My dreams... My life... Everything!

00:18:21.833 --> 00:18:27.250
This is the one and only thing I have to give!

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:29.375
I'm sure...

00:18:29.375 --> 00:18:31.625
...Eren will...

00:18:31.625 --> 00:18:34.625
...reach... the sea...!

00:18:36.375 --> 00:18:37.792
He'll look at...

00:18:39.667 --> 00:18:41.583
...the sea for me!

00:18:49.042 --> 00:18:51.542
Mikasa! It's too risky!

00:18:51.542 --> 00:18:53.833
No, it's perfect!

00:19:04.375 --> 00:19:05.708
Hange!

00:19:07.708 --> 00:19:10.083
Now's your chance, Mikasa!

00:19:14.333 --> 00:19:16.458
She can't be...

00:19:16.458 --> 00:19:17.875
Reiner!

00:19:17.875 --> 00:19:19.375
Come out!

00:19:33.667 --> 00:19:35.250
It's over...

00:19:37.708 --> 00:19:41.042
Next is Eren and the horses...

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:47.667
That's...

00:19:49.292 --> 00:19:50.917
...hardening?

00:19:57.375 --> 00:19:58.875
Gotcha!

00:20:12.708 --> 00:20:15.125
A diversion?!

00:20:15.125 --> 00:20:19.208
Which means Eren tricking me
into thinking he couldn't move...

00:20:19.208 --> 00:20:21.417
...and all Armin's stalling...

00:20:21.417 --> 00:20:26.458
...was just to buy Eren enough time
to make a replica hardened Titan!

00:20:34.167 --> 00:20:39.833
They did it... to make me think
there weren't any enemies nearby...

00:20:39.833 --> 00:20:43.375
To make me... lower my guard...

00:21:10.292 --> 00:21:13.542
Have I ever lied to you in my life?

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:19.375
Dammit, I should've known...

00:21:23.333 --> 00:21:26.625
Hey, why don't you fight back?

00:21:26.625 --> 00:21:27.875
Huh?

00:21:30.042 --> 00:21:32.667
They pick on you 'cuz you don't hit back.

00:21:32.667 --> 00:21:35.083
Are you fine with losing forever?

00:21:37.167 --> 00:21:40.417
I'm... not losing.

00:21:40.417 --> 00:21:41.833
Huh?

00:21:43.667 --> 00:21:46.167
Because I don't run.

00:21:52.542 --> 00:21:54.792
Hey, what's your name?

00:21:54.792 --> 00:21:55.958
Huh?

00:22:06.292 --> 00:22:10.417
I knew... you were more of a hero...

00:22:12.958 --> 00:22:15.042
...than anyone else.

00:23:57.625 --> 00:24:01.375
Finding resolve, Eren and the
others defeat their enemies.

00:24:01.375 --> 00:24:05.750
However, what they lost cost
more than what they won.

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:09.375
The despair alone has left them stunned.

00:24:09.375 --> 00:24:12.096
Next episode: "Midnight Sun."
