00:01:58.583 --> 00:02:00.250
Armin! Get down!

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.875
It hurts...

00:02:12.875 --> 00:02:14.625
It hurts so bad...

00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:46.917
Bertholdt...

00:02:49.458 --> 00:02:50.833
It hurts...

00:02:53.125 --> 00:02:55.542
It hurts so bad...

00:02:55.542 --> 00:02:57.917
Sasha?

00:02:57.917 --> 00:02:59.500
Sasha!

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.583
You're in terrible shape... What happened...?

00:03:03.583 --> 00:03:04.708
Armin!

00:03:06.917 --> 00:03:08.125
Eren?

00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:17.750
I'm glad... you're back!

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.667
Huh?

00:03:23.667 --> 00:03:25.042
You're up?

00:03:26.292 --> 00:03:28.625
Captain!

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:32.500
What in the world happened here?

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.583
I remember... Bertholdt becoming a Titan...

00:03:36.583 --> 00:03:40.500
What about the others?! Are they okay?!

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.417
That's as far back as you remember?

00:03:43.417 --> 00:03:44.750
Huh?

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.583
Eren, tell him everything.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Well? Up to speed, Armin?

00:04:15.542 --> 00:04:19.250
Are you telling me... the Scout Regiment...

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.250
...is the nine of us here... and that's it?

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.208
For the time being.

00:04:25.208 --> 00:04:27.583
The fighting ended four hours ago.

00:04:27.583 --> 00:04:31.250
We've been looking for survivors,
but... none yet...

00:04:33.208 --> 00:04:39.042
S-So, we managed to seal
the walls of Shiganshina...

00:04:39.042 --> 00:04:43.333
But Reiner, the Beast Titan,
and one other escaped...

00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:45.917
Bertholdt was captured...

00:04:45.917 --> 00:04:49.542
Then... there was a dispute...

00:04:49.542 --> 00:04:53.583
...about using the injection on
Commander Erwin or me...

00:04:53.583 --> 00:04:55.417
And I...

00:04:55.417 --> 00:05:00.458
...turned into a Titan and ate B-Bertholdt...

00:05:05.417 --> 00:05:06.625
Here.

00:05:21.875 --> 00:05:25.167
Why... did you pick me?

00:05:26.125 --> 00:05:28.333
No matter how you look at it,

00:05:28.333 --> 00:05:32.167
wasn't Commander Erwin
the right one to bring back?

00:05:32.167 --> 00:05:35.917
Captain! Why did you give me the injection?!

00:05:35.917 --> 00:05:37.000
Tsk!

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.708
I told you to tell him everything.

00:05:40.708 --> 00:05:46.000
The thing is, it seems your two
friends here didn't think that way.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
They stood up to me... prepared to draw blood.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.208
Huh?

00:05:51.208 --> 00:05:55.042
We'll take whatever punishment comes.

00:05:55.042 --> 00:05:58.500
You'll be disciplined for
insubordination, but...

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.250
Does taking the punishment
allow you to do anything?

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.500
No...

00:06:04.708 --> 00:06:06.667
However...

00:06:06.667 --> 00:06:10.167
The final decision to choose you was mine.

00:06:10.167 --> 00:06:12.000
No...

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.875
I chose this to be the place where Erwin dies.

00:06:19.792 --> 00:06:22.250
I don't understand...

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.833
There's no way it's okay to let Erwin die...

00:06:25.833 --> 00:06:31.500
If the commander is gone,
how... how will we go on?

00:06:32.792 --> 00:06:37.292
I agree. I thought it should've
been used on Erwin...

00:06:37.292 --> 00:06:40.000
...if we're being brutally honest.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.292
No... It's a shame we were
put in that position...

00:06:47.208 --> 00:06:51.708
Anyways, Erwin entrusted Levi
with the decision to use it.

00:06:51.708 --> 00:06:54.625
And Levi ended up choosing you.

00:06:54.625 --> 00:06:57.083
There's nothing more to say.

00:06:57.083 --> 00:07:01.583
Erwin's life and a Titan's power
rest on your shoulders.

00:07:01.583 --> 00:07:07.500
No matter what anyone says,
that's part of who you are now, Armin.

00:07:10.542 --> 00:07:16.375
Does that mean... I need to be...
Erwin's replacement?

00:07:16.375 --> 00:07:19.333
No way... I can't...

00:07:21.792 --> 00:07:24.042
Don't get me wrong.

00:07:24.042 --> 00:07:26.875
You'll never be Erwin's replacement.

00:07:27.917 --> 00:07:29.417
But...

00:07:29.417 --> 00:07:34.208
...I know you have a strength
that nobody else has but you.

00:07:35.417 --> 00:07:38.333
I won't regret my decision.

00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:42.375
However, don't make these guys regret it.

00:07:42.375 --> 00:07:44.208
Nor anyone else.

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.250
And don't regret it yourself, either.

00:07:49.208 --> 00:07:51.500
That is your mission.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.000
Shut up!

00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:13.792
We're no match for Sasha.

00:08:13.792 --> 00:08:18.458
Well, being the successor of Erwin
as commander of the Scouts,

00:08:18.458 --> 00:08:21.208
we're kinda in the same boat.

00:08:21.208 --> 00:08:24.458
From here on out,
we'll have to grin and bear it.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.333
Right...

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.250
Now then...

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.458
If it's not a problem for Armin,
we should get going.

00:08:34.375 --> 00:08:38.417
Levi, Eren, Mikasa, and I will go investigate.

00:08:38.417 --> 00:08:42.375
You other four keep watch
from atop Shiganshina's wall.

00:08:42.375 --> 00:08:43.875
Roger.

00:08:43.875 --> 00:08:47.167
Eren. Do you still have the key?

00:08:48.375 --> 00:08:49.667
Yeah.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.833
Right here.

00:08:54.458 --> 00:08:55.833
Eren...

00:08:55.833 --> 00:08:57.292
When I get back,

00:08:57.292 --> 00:09:01.708
I'll show you the basement that
I've kept secret all this time.

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:03.375
Hey, Eren!

00:09:03.375 --> 00:09:06.417
How many times must I say
you can't go in the basement?!

00:09:06.417 --> 00:09:08.542
Why aren't I allowed to?!

00:09:08.542 --> 00:09:11.375
Because your father keeps his work tools there.

00:09:11.375 --> 00:09:12.958
Medicine, too.

00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:14.917
It's dangerous for children.

00:09:16.625 --> 00:09:17.833
Tsk...

00:09:27.083 --> 00:09:28.917
Your intentions are the key.

00:09:29.833 --> 00:09:34.208
The key to saving humankind from this despair.

00:09:34.208 --> 00:09:37.500
We have reason to believe that the
basement of his home in Shiganshina...

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.833
...houses a secret of the Titans
that not even <i>he </i>is aware of.

00:09:40.833 --> 00:09:45.375
If we can just reach this basement,
we may be able to obtain information

00:09:45.375 --> 00:09:50.542
that will help us break free from
the Titans' century-long tyranny.

00:10:19.375 --> 00:10:21.667
Hey, where's your house?

00:10:21.667 --> 00:10:23.500
R-Right...

00:12:16.417 --> 00:12:18.000
Is this it?

00:12:41.667 --> 00:12:43.042
Hey, Dad!

00:12:43.042 --> 00:12:45.958
When will you show me
what's in the basement?

00:12:45.958 --> 00:12:47.875
Who knows?

00:12:47.875 --> 00:12:51.833
Perhaps when you realize
the most important thing of all.

00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:12.000
"Grisha Jaeger, having come from outside the walls
and thus knowing many secrets, entrusted the
basement key to his son. The basement will
likely reveal the mysteries of the world."

00:13:13.875 --> 00:13:17.333
Luckily, the fires didn't make it this far.

00:13:38.583 --> 00:13:39.958
Right here.

00:13:39.958 --> 00:13:42.625
Under this are the stairs to the basement.

00:13:42.625 --> 00:13:43.958
Good.

00:14:06.792 --> 00:14:10.250
That's a relief. It's not flooded with water.

00:14:12.167 --> 00:14:13.375
Let's go.

00:14:33.417 --> 00:14:35.333
Eren.

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:36.583
Right.

00:14:46.458 --> 00:14:47.833
What's wrong?

00:14:47.833 --> 00:14:48.875
Eren?

00:14:48.875 --> 00:14:50.292
Hurry it up.

00:14:52.208 --> 00:14:56.958
This... This key...
It doesn't go to this door...

00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:58.292
What?

00:14:58.292 --> 00:15:03.000
You're kidding... I'm certain that's
the key Dr. Jaeger had.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.333
Step aside.

00:15:04.333 --> 00:15:05.375
I'll open it.

00:15:05.375 --> 00:15:06.792
Huh? Wait...

00:15:10.708 --> 00:15:12.417
Hold up...

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:36.125
It almost feels like a laboratory down here.

00:15:36.125 --> 00:15:41.500
My dad was a doctor, so... he was always
cooped up down here mixing medicine.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.333
That makes sense.

00:15:44.375 --> 00:15:51.375
In fact, if this medicine is all labeled
correctly, it's stuff that's widely available.

00:15:51.375 --> 00:15:56.708
And since all the books here relate to medicine,
at first glance, it's just a doctor's study.

00:15:56.708 --> 00:15:59.583
"There's nothing suspicious here."

00:15:59.583 --> 00:16:02.458
It's like that's what he
wants people to think.

00:16:02.458 --> 00:16:03.750
Yeah...

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:09.500
If you're hiding stuff from the Interior Police,
you wouldn't want it out in the open.

00:16:10.708 --> 00:16:13.667
Hey. Quit standing around, brats.

00:16:13.667 --> 00:16:16.875
Erwin's hunches are rarely wrong.

00:16:16.875 --> 00:16:18.000
Right.

00:16:37.708 --> 00:16:41.375
Thanks, Mikasa. It's another all-nighter.

00:16:47.667 --> 00:16:48.917
Eren...

00:16:50.375 --> 00:16:52.917
There's a keyhole right here.

00:16:58.542 --> 00:16:59.583
Eren.

00:17:05.708 --> 00:17:07.042
It opened.

00:17:13.083 --> 00:17:14.333
It's empty?!

00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:15.750
Look closer.

00:17:17.042 --> 00:17:18.500
It's a false bottom.

00:17:24.417 --> 00:17:27.583
It smells like peppermint oil and charcoal.

00:17:27.583 --> 00:17:31.000
Were these treated to keep
moisture and bugs away?

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.167
We were looking for something...
and these must be it.

00:17:43.208 --> 00:17:47.500
I wonder what it was
my dad wanted to show me.

00:18:10.125 --> 00:18:14.500
That's when Erwin asked this question...

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:20.500
"How do we know there're not
more humans outside the walls?"

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:25.125
He insisted that as long as we haven't
been able to freely explore the outside,

00:18:25.125 --> 00:18:30.750
we can't know for sure if humanity
was completely wiped out by Titans.

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:34.625
And yet, history books declare
the rest were wiped out.

00:18:34.625 --> 00:18:35.708
Hmm?

00:18:35.708 --> 00:18:39.583
If you consider that history books
should maintain an objective viewpoint,

00:18:39.583 --> 00:18:43.792
it should read, "It is believed
the rest of humanity was wiped out."

00:18:43.792 --> 00:18:47.125
You're just trying to find fault
in anything and everything.

00:18:47.125 --> 00:18:50.625
I'm not! There's intent behind it!

00:18:50.625 --> 00:18:51.792
For example...

00:18:51.792 --> 00:18:56.083
To make us believe that humanity
doesn't exist outside the walls.

00:18:56.083 --> 00:19:00.958
That is, by the royal government
that issues the books.

00:19:00.958 --> 00:19:02.917
You're overthinking it.

00:19:02.917 --> 00:19:05.625
This is what they call splitting hairs.

00:19:07.125 --> 00:19:11.042
I was teasing him back then,
but look at us now...

00:19:11.042 --> 00:19:14.375
You'll just have to apologize
to the man himself.

00:19:17.208 --> 00:19:20.500
In not too long, it'll be dawn.

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:24.042
If our heroes were to return,
it's about that time...

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.500
The Scouts returned just a moment ago!

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.208
They successfully took back Wall Maria!

00:19:54.083 --> 00:19:57.667
This is... a portrait?

00:19:57.667 --> 00:19:59.125
Let me see that.

00:20:00.458 --> 00:20:05.333
No... It's far too detailed for this
to be drawn by a person.

00:20:05.333 --> 00:20:07.708
That's Dr. Jaeger's writing.

00:20:09.375 --> 00:20:11.542
"This is no illustration.

00:20:11.542 --> 00:20:15.375
Instead, this uses light
reflected off a subject,

00:20:15.375 --> 00:20:18.500
and burns the image on special paper.

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.125
It's called a photograph.

00:20:21.125 --> 00:20:23.167
I come from a place outside"...

00:20:23.167 --> 00:20:26.375
...the walls where humanity lives in elegance.

00:20:27.708 --> 00:20:30.917
Humanity has not perished.

00:20:30.917 --> 00:20:35.958
I pray the person who finds
this book is a fellow patriot.

00:21:55.792 --> 00:21:58.917
Hurry, Fay! We'll lose it unless we're fast!

00:21:58.917 --> 00:22:01.208
Wait up, Grisha!

00:22:01.208 --> 00:22:03.625
You two stop right there.

00:22:04.583 --> 00:22:08.875
I told you not to forget
your armbands when you go outside.

00:22:08.875 --> 00:22:12.708
Grisha, you absolutely must not leave the walls.

00:22:12.708 --> 00:22:14.000
Hey, wait!

00:22:15.417 --> 00:22:17.000
I got it, Mom!

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.917
We'll be back!

00:22:19.958 --> 00:22:21.000
Come on!

00:22:28.417 --> 00:22:33.167
When I first thought as to how
I should start my story...

00:22:33.167 --> 00:22:35.625
...I immediately thought of that day.

00:22:35.625 --> 00:22:37.667
Hey!

00:22:37.667 --> 00:22:39.042
--Whoa!
--Sorry!

00:22:39.042 --> 00:22:42.292
Grisha, be careful! Watch where you're going!

00:22:44.958 --> 00:22:47.333
Oh... It's leaving...

00:22:48.667 --> 00:22:50.125
Must be nice...

00:22:50.125 --> 00:22:55.167
Someday when I'm rich, will I be able
to ride on an airship, too?

00:22:56.167 --> 00:23:01.042
What are you talking about?
There's no way either of us will get rich.

00:23:01.042 --> 00:23:02.333
Yeah...

00:23:02.333 --> 00:23:04.542
But it must be nice...

00:23:04.542 --> 00:23:07.375
I wonder what we could see from up there.

00:23:12.708 --> 00:23:14.250
There it goes...

00:23:28.375 --> 00:23:29.458
Let's go, Fay!

00:23:29.458 --> 00:23:30.542
Huh?!

00:23:30.542 --> 00:23:34.667
My teacher said the airships take off
and land at a place near here!

00:23:34.667 --> 00:23:35.958
Let's go see!

00:23:35.958 --> 00:23:39.667
What?! But Mom said we're
not allowed to leave the walls!

00:23:39.667 --> 00:23:42.083
It'll be fine! Just for a bit!

00:23:42.083 --> 00:23:42.833
--We'll be right back!

00:23:42.833 --> 00:23:45.875
--Hey! Get back here!
--We'll be right back!

00:23:45.875 --> 00:23:48.167
That naïve day of my youth...

00:23:48.167 --> 00:23:49.875
...when I...

00:23:49.875 --> 00:23:52.833
...had to face the truth of this world.

00:23:57.542 --> 00:24:04.125
His story began with pulling his sister's hand
while gazing upwards at the sky.

00:24:04.125 --> 00:24:10.000
The hatred and hope reflected in
his eyes show Eren a cruel world.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.096
Next episode: "That Day."
