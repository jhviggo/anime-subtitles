WEBVTT

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:43.875
I should've known... this would happen.

00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:50.083
But... I had no other choice but to rely on you.

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:51.500
Armin...

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:56.292
Why... don't you run away?

00:01:03.208 --> 00:01:04.833
A Titan?

00:01:10.375 --> 00:01:11.708
Shit!

00:01:14.042 --> 00:01:16.292
You just try coming closer!

00:01:16.292 --> 00:01:19.375
Make one move to take him and he's dead!

00:01:21.042 --> 00:01:23.125
What's that?

00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:27.917
He's got... Titan marks around his eyes.

00:01:27.917 --> 00:01:30.750
Is he the Beast Titan?!

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.125
Are you...

00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:35.667
...Eren Jaeger?

00:01:35.667 --> 00:01:38.500
If nothing else, I'm taking him with me!

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.500
You look nothing like your father.

00:01:46.125 --> 00:01:47.542
What?

00:01:48.792 --> 00:01:54.042
Believe me, I know what you're going through.

00:01:54.042 --> 00:01:57.750
We're both victims of your father.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.500
You've... been brainwashed by him.

00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:06.500
My... dad?

00:02:09.083 --> 00:02:12.042
Argh... You're kidding me!

00:02:12.042 --> 00:02:14.292
He chased me all the way here?

00:02:21.542 --> 00:02:26.417
Let's call it a draw, Levi.
We're in no shape to fight.

00:02:26.417 --> 00:02:28.083
Bertholdt...

00:02:28.083 --> 00:02:31.667
I'm sorry, but I think it's the end for you.

00:02:33.375 --> 00:02:37.333
Eren! Someday, I'm coming back to rescue you!

00:02:42.333 --> 00:02:43.792
He ran?

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:48.792
Captain!

00:02:48.792 --> 00:02:50.625
That was the last of my gas.

00:02:50.625 --> 00:02:53.417
I'll chase him! Hand over your gas and blades!

00:02:53.417 --> 00:02:54.333
Right!

00:02:54.333 --> 00:02:55.583
Hurry!

00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:17.125
Reiner... What's this metal case
you had in your left chest pocket?

00:03:17.125 --> 00:03:19.875
Before we chopped off all your limbs,

00:03:19.875 --> 00:03:23.625
you tried to grab it with
the strength you had left.

00:03:23.625 --> 00:03:27.292
Suicide pills? Or perhaps a bomb?

00:03:27.292 --> 00:03:28.583
Ouch!

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:29.833
Sorry.

00:03:31.625 --> 00:03:33.250
A letter...

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.167
A letter?

00:03:35.167 --> 00:03:37.417
What kind of letter?

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:41.333
A letter... from Ymir.

00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:47.167
You have to... give it... to Christa...

00:03:48.875 --> 00:03:51.667
Only after we've inspected it.

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:59.042
Now then. I've got a mountain
of questions for you, but...

00:04:00.875 --> 00:04:05.125
Your lips seem as tight as your armor is hard.

00:04:05.125 --> 00:04:10.792
Are you going to cooperate and tell us
everything that we want to know?

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:12.333
No.

00:04:12.333 --> 00:04:16.250
Thanks. It helps that you're prepared for this.

00:04:19.167 --> 00:04:20.875
Hold on!

00:04:20.875 --> 00:04:24.833
Are you sure? We might be able
to steal his power.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.083
Today, I would like to explain...

00:04:31.083 --> 00:04:36.000
...how we're going to get
maximum value from this injection.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.417
Using this medicine, the Colossal
Titan's, the Armored Titan's,

00:04:40.417 --> 00:04:44.333
or the Beast Titan's powers can be stolen.

00:04:44.333 --> 00:04:46.167
As for how...

00:04:46.167 --> 00:04:49.083
The one injected with this will become a Titan

00:04:49.083 --> 00:04:53.083
and eat someone who can change
into a Titan like Eren can.

00:04:53.083 --> 00:04:57.708
By doing so, although they would
initially be a Titan lacking intelligence,

00:04:57.708 --> 00:05:02.333
they would revert into a human
able to wield that Titan's powers.

00:05:03.417 --> 00:05:08.917
If this is achieved, not only do we gain
information regarding Titan powers,

00:05:08.917 --> 00:05:13.875
we're also able to revive a person
on the brink of death.

00:05:13.875 --> 00:05:18.417
If you capture an enemy with
Titan powers, sever all their limbs.

00:05:18.417 --> 00:05:23.125
And when it is safe to do so,
summon Captain Levi.

00:05:25.708 --> 00:05:28.250
We have only this one injection.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.083
I'm entrusting Captain Levi
with the call to use it.

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:38.042
I don't think all the conditions
for that have been met.

00:05:38.042 --> 00:05:41.167
We don't know the situation
with Levi and the other side.

00:05:41.167 --> 00:05:45.042
Neither do we have the time
to go confirm it ourselves.

00:05:45.042 --> 00:05:51.208
Reason being, there's no way for us
to gauge the full depth of their powers!

00:05:51.208 --> 00:05:54.833
Even if I cut his head off,
we can't be too sure!

00:05:59.042 --> 00:06:01.750
This isn't like you, Hange.

00:06:03.417 --> 00:06:06.500
If we back down because
of not knowing something,

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.667
down the line, can we ever
hope to beat the Titans?

00:06:13.375 --> 00:06:14.958
Jean...

00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:20.000
When are we ever going to know
all there is about the enemy?

00:06:23.042 --> 00:06:24.208
Mikasa.

00:06:24.208 --> 00:06:25.167
Yeah?

00:06:25.167 --> 00:06:27.333
How much gas do you have?

00:06:27.333 --> 00:06:29.750
It's almost entirely gone.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.375
But it should be enough to reach
Eren and Armin at least.

00:06:34.375 --> 00:06:36.583
That's more than me.

00:06:38.875 --> 00:06:43.333
Mikasa... I need you to go
check out their situation.

00:06:43.333 --> 00:06:48.125
Fill up your gas and bring back
the injection from Levi.

00:06:48.125 --> 00:06:53.125
If for any reason you're unable
to do so, fire a smoke signal.

00:06:53.125 --> 00:06:55.833
That will be my signal to end Reiner.

00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:58.542
Affirmative.

00:07:03.667 --> 00:07:04.875
Hange, I--

00:07:04.875 --> 00:07:07.000
The decision was mine.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.333
You were just a factor.

00:07:10.458 --> 00:07:13.333
Why... did I?

00:07:13.333 --> 00:07:16.208
After all this time, am I actually...?

00:07:16.208 --> 00:07:18.583
Yeah! Keep it up!

00:07:20.458 --> 00:07:22.958
Armin's breathing again!

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.917
Come on! Just keep on breathing!

00:07:31.417 --> 00:07:32.833
Armin?

00:07:32.833 --> 00:07:35.625
Captain! Get the syringe!

00:07:43.125 --> 00:07:47.083
Make Armin into a Titan and
we'll have him eat Bertholdt!

00:07:47.083 --> 00:07:49.167
Hurry up and inject him!

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.125
Yeah...

00:08:02.292 --> 00:08:03.708
Hange!

00:08:14.208 --> 00:08:15.458
Not good!

00:08:23.792 --> 00:08:26.583
Reiner was taken! Hange!

00:08:27.792 --> 00:08:28.917
Shit!

00:08:28.917 --> 00:08:31.417
Conny! Don't chase!

00:08:34.792 --> 00:08:39.250
We hardly have any gas left.
You'll just end up getting killed.

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:41.167
Shit!

00:08:42.375 --> 00:08:44.083
It's my fault...

00:08:44.083 --> 00:08:48.708
I've... done something terrible...

00:08:48.708 --> 00:08:51.958
I said the decision was mine.

00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:54.208
Let's regroup with the others.

00:09:02.833 --> 00:09:05.875
Captain... Levi...

00:09:05.875 --> 00:09:08.542
I finally found you.

00:09:08.542 --> 00:09:11.167
Commander Erwin is badly wounded!

00:09:11.167 --> 00:09:14.958
His stomach is gouged...
and his organs are demolished!

00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:17.750
The blood just won't stop!

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:21.250
I thought that injection
might be able to help, but...

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:22.875
What do you think?

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.833
Huh?

00:09:37.125 --> 00:09:38.583
Captain?

00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:46.917
He's... still breathing.

00:09:48.417 --> 00:09:52.125
He's... alive.

00:10:03.417 --> 00:10:06.625
I'm using the injection... on Erwin.

00:10:10.708 --> 00:10:12.500
You said...

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.833
...you'd use it on Armin!

00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:20.333
I'm... reviving the one who can save humanity.

00:10:34.667 --> 00:10:38.917
Reiner... You were incredibly lucky.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
"Not only can Titan powers and much-needed information
be stolen by using the injection, but it also allows
the revival of someone who is critically wounded.
The ideal candidate would be someone near death."

00:10:48.458 --> 00:10:50.833
You guys...

00:10:50.833 --> 00:10:53.917
Do you have the faintest damn clue...

00:10:53.917 --> 00:10:55.917
...what you're doing?

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:59.458
It's Erwin...

00:10:59.458 --> 00:11:02.500
The commander of the Scouts.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.250
And you're saying to watch him die.

00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:08.583
There's no time for this.

00:11:08.583 --> 00:11:10.500
Stay out of my way.

00:11:13.208 --> 00:11:16.667
Keep your emotions out of this.

00:11:16.667 --> 00:11:20.542
Keep my... emotions out?

00:11:20.542 --> 00:11:25.250
Tell me... How come you didn't
hand over the syringe right away?!

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:30.333
Because I was considering the
possibility Erwin might still be alive.

00:11:30.333 --> 00:11:34.167
You couldn't have known Floch
would drag the commander here!

00:11:34.167 --> 00:11:36.833
There's just no way you knew!

00:11:36.833 --> 00:11:38.667
You're right, but...

00:11:38.667 --> 00:11:42.875
The fact that Erwin is now here
means I use it on him.

00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:56.292
Hey!

00:11:58.292 --> 00:12:00.667
His strength isn't all there!

00:12:00.667 --> 00:12:03.125
I can take it from him by force!

00:12:03.125 --> 00:12:05.500
You should know as well as I do!

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:09.625
Without Erwin's talent,
humanity can't beat the Titans!

00:12:09.625 --> 00:12:14.000
That's right, Mikasa! Let's stop
with this madness already!

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:21.792
It's... no different if we lose... Armin.

00:12:21.792 --> 00:12:23.458
Eren!

00:12:23.458 --> 00:12:27.125
Hasn't it... always been like that?

00:12:27.125 --> 00:12:31.333
He's the reason why we saved
Trost by plugging it with a rock.

00:12:31.333 --> 00:12:34.292
He revealed Annie's identity.

00:12:34.292 --> 00:12:38.417
It was Armin who came up with
the idea of moving at night!

00:12:38.417 --> 00:12:41.667
The only reason we uncovered
Reiner's hiding spot...

00:12:41.667 --> 00:12:44.333
...and the only reason we defeated Bertholdt...

00:12:44.333 --> 00:12:48.167
...was all because of Armin!

00:12:48.167 --> 00:12:52.375
The one who's gonna save humanity
isn't me or the commander!

00:12:52.375 --> 00:12:54.042
It's Armin!

00:12:54.042 --> 00:12:56.125
Isn't that right, Mikasa?!

00:12:59.167 --> 00:13:01.708
Please give it to me!

00:13:05.667 --> 00:13:09.042
The one who will save humanity...
is Commander Erwin.

00:13:09.042 --> 00:13:11.042
Shut up!

00:13:11.042 --> 00:13:12.958
I will not shut up.

00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:16.083
Don't think you're the only
ones who've had it tough!

00:13:16.083 --> 00:13:18.042
You might not know, but...

00:13:18.042 --> 00:13:22.583
On the other side of that wall,
there's not a single living soldier.

00:13:22.583 --> 00:13:26.458
Everyone died when the Beast
Titan threw boulders at us.

00:13:26.458 --> 00:13:29.792
I didn't think anyone could be saved...

00:13:29.792 --> 00:13:33.750
But Commander Erwin was the only exception.

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:38.750
He thought of a plan for us
to bite back at the Beast Titan...

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:41.042
...and we did.

00:13:41.042 --> 00:13:44.208
We were smashed to bits just as planned.

00:13:46.542 --> 00:13:50.375
And I'm sure the last thing they felt...

00:13:50.375 --> 00:13:52.333
...was fear.

00:13:58.958 --> 00:14:04.458
When I found the commander alive,
I was about to finish him off.

00:14:06.208 --> 00:14:11.333
But... that's going too easy on him.

00:14:11.333 --> 00:14:15.750
I thought to myself that he ought
to taste more of this hell.

00:14:17.917 --> 00:14:21.208
And then... I understood.

00:14:23.458 --> 00:14:28.250
The only one who can lay waste
to the Titans... is a devil!

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:33.542
And if I can bring back the devil,
that must be my mission in life!

00:14:33.542 --> 00:14:38.917
That has to be why I survived like
a coward when everyone else died!

00:14:38.917 --> 00:14:40.708
So stay out of his way!

00:14:40.708 --> 00:14:41.833
Don't do it!

00:14:45.875 --> 00:14:47.292
Hange...

00:14:51.333 --> 00:14:56.042
Hey... You've got to be... kidding me...

00:14:56.042 --> 00:14:57.708
No way...

00:15:00.292 --> 00:15:03.458
You can't... be serious...

00:15:10.833 --> 00:15:15.667
Mikasa! You have to know
how much we need Erwin!

00:15:15.667 --> 00:15:20.042
We can't let the flames of hope
extinguish inside the walls!

00:15:20.042 --> 00:15:23.667
But... Armin could... do that, too!

00:15:23.667 --> 00:15:26.583
It's true, Armin is exceptional...

00:15:26.583 --> 00:15:30.667
But he doesn't have Erwin's
experience and leadership!

00:15:35.958 --> 00:15:40.208
There are people I want to bring back, too.

00:15:40.208 --> 00:15:42.125
Hundreds of them.

00:15:45.458 --> 00:15:50.000
I've had to say farewell since
the day I joined the Scouts.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.375
Hange!

00:16:07.083 --> 00:16:08.875
But...

00:16:08.875 --> 00:16:11.167
You know, don't you?

00:16:11.167 --> 00:16:15.542
No matter who it is,
there comes a day to say farewell.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.708
I know it's impossible,
but you have to accept this.

00:16:23.708 --> 00:16:27.583
There will be times you can't keep your sanity.

00:16:27.583 --> 00:16:29.292
It's tough.

00:16:29.292 --> 00:16:30.875
Very tough.

00:16:30.875 --> 00:16:33.042
I know.

00:16:33.042 --> 00:16:37.208
Even so, we have to keep moving forward.

00:17:00.042 --> 00:17:01.792
Captain...

00:17:02.917 --> 00:17:08.042
Do you... know about... the sea?

00:17:08.042 --> 00:17:13.000
No matter how far you look,
it stretches past the horizon.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.750
It's a gigantic lake.

00:17:16.792 --> 00:17:17.750
Armin said--

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:20.667
Hey! Cut it out!

00:17:20.667 --> 00:17:23.958
There's a sea beyond the walls...

00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:27.417
...and he said we'd go there together!

00:17:27.417 --> 00:17:33.708
But... that was our dream since we
were little, and I forgot it long ago!

00:17:33.708 --> 00:17:38.042
Avenging my mom... Killing the Titans...

00:17:38.042 --> 00:17:41.417
The only thoughts in my head are full of hate!

00:17:41.417 --> 00:17:45.208
But... he's not like that!

00:17:45.208 --> 00:17:48.125
Armin cares about more than just fighting!

00:17:48.125 --> 00:17:50.417
He has dreams!

00:17:54.042 --> 00:17:56.417
Everyone get out of here!

00:17:56.417 --> 00:18:00.417
I'm going to have Erwin eat Bertholdt!

00:18:01.875 --> 00:18:04.250
Come on. Let's go, Mikasa.

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.708
Shit... Shit...!

00:18:09.292 --> 00:18:11.583
Armin...

00:18:11.583 --> 00:18:13.083
See you...

00:18:24.708 --> 00:18:28.125
Let's start by seeing the sea!

00:18:28.125 --> 00:18:31.333
You'll see! It does exist!

00:18:35.542 --> 00:18:37.750
If this dream of yours comes true...

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:39.917
...what will you do then?

00:18:39.917 --> 00:18:44.625
I don't know. I won't know until it happens.

00:18:44.625 --> 00:18:46.792
I...

00:18:46.792 --> 00:18:49.250
I want to go to the basement.

00:18:50.417 --> 00:18:52.292
Good grief.

00:18:52.292 --> 00:18:55.417
They're all the same...

00:18:55.417 --> 00:18:58.500
Whining like brats one after another...

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:05.333
Everyone had to be drunk on
somethin' to keep pushing on...

00:19:05.333 --> 00:19:10.250
Everyone... was a slave to somethin'.

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:12.667
But there's more than that.

00:19:12.667 --> 00:19:14.250
The sea...

00:19:21.625 --> 00:19:23.208
Erwin!

00:19:24.208 --> 00:19:26.458
Teacher...

00:19:26.458 --> 00:19:30.875
How do we know there're not more humans...

00:19:30.875 --> 00:19:34.292
...outside the walls?

00:19:42.583 --> 00:19:45.292
Give up on your dream and die.

00:19:45.292 --> 00:19:48.375
Lead the recruits straight into hell.

00:19:48.375 --> 00:19:53.792
Everyone had to be drunk on
somethin' to keep pushing on...

00:19:53.792 --> 00:19:57.292
I will take down the Beast Titan.

00:20:07.458 --> 00:20:09.292
Levi...

00:20:09.292 --> 00:20:11.000
Thank you.

00:20:44.958 --> 00:20:46.542
Guys!

00:20:46.542 --> 00:20:49.375
Help me!

00:20:54.792 --> 00:20:59.167
Annie! Reiner!

00:21:02.417 --> 00:21:04.208
Captain...

00:21:04.208 --> 00:21:06.792
Why... did you...?

00:21:09.583 --> 00:21:14.333
Do you think... you can forgive him?

00:21:14.333 --> 00:21:17.375
He had no choice but to become a devil.

00:21:18.583 --> 00:21:21.333
It was us who wished for that.

00:21:22.292 --> 00:21:27.375
And in the end, when he had
finally been set free from hell,

00:21:27.375 --> 00:21:31.250
we wanted to bring him back once more.

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:35.667
But I think... it's time to let him rest.

00:21:47.375 --> 00:21:49.125
Erwin...

00:21:49.125 --> 00:21:51.958
I promised I'd kill the Beast Titan, but...

00:21:51.958 --> 00:21:55.083
It's going to have to wait.

00:21:55.083 --> 00:21:58.000
He's... dead.

00:22:01.917 --> 00:22:03.708
I see.

00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:03.042
Armin is shaken after learning
of Bertholdt's and Erwin's deaths.

00:24:03.042 --> 00:24:09.250
Eren heads towards that place his father,
Grisha, promised to show him.

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:12.096
Next episode: "The Basement."
