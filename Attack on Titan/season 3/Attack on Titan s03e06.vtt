WEBVTT

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.083
Shit!

00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:37.000
Eren, you're awake?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.542
Just hang in there a while
longer. Everything's fine.

00:00:40.542 --> 00:00:42.875
Historia's all right?

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:45.458
Eren, listen to me.

00:00:45.458 --> 00:00:48.167
My father has been an ally to
all of humanity within the walls,

00:00:48.167 --> 00:00:51.375
for many years past and many years to come.

00:00:51.375 --> 00:00:54.208
We were clearly mistaken about him.

00:00:54.208 --> 00:01:00.458
It's true that he's been a problem for the
Scouts, and his people did kill Pastor Nick...

00:01:00.458 --> 00:01:03.208
But he didn't have any other choice.

00:01:03.208 --> 00:01:06.917
Everything he's done, he had
to do for the sake of humanity.

00:01:06.917 --> 00:01:11.292
Historia. Let me explain the rest.

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:19.167
It's coming back to me... Yeah...

00:01:19.167 --> 00:01:23.417
The last thing I can remember is those two.

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:25.458
How long has it been?

00:01:25.458 --> 00:01:30.250
Captain... Armin...
What happened to the Scouts?

00:01:36.542 --> 00:01:41.750
What's up with these walls,
glowing like that...?

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.667
I can't tell if it's day or night...

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:48.083
No, hold on a second...

00:01:48.083 --> 00:01:53.042
Haven't I been to this place before?

00:01:53.042 --> 00:01:57.625
What's wrong? This is the first
time you've come here.

00:01:57.625 --> 00:02:01.458
Though, it wouldn't be strange
if you recognize it.

00:02:01.458 --> 00:02:03.625
What does he mean by that?

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:09.083
F-Father, explain to Eren.

00:02:09.083 --> 00:02:15.667
Yes, I intend to. However,
there's something I want to try first.

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:20.250
If we do this, he may remember all on his own.

00:02:30.792 --> 00:02:33.458
What... is this?

00:02:33.458 --> 00:02:35.542
These aren't things I've seen...

00:02:36.708 --> 00:02:38.458
No!

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:40.375
Whose memories are these?!

00:02:42.125 --> 00:02:44.417
This key!

00:02:44.417 --> 00:02:46.583
Is this...?

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:48.083
It can't be...

00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:11.500
Dad?

00:03:18.917 --> 00:03:20.583
Well?

00:03:24.875 --> 00:03:29.125
Did you remember? Your father's sin...

00:05:08.083 --> 00:05:12.750
You're amazing, Historia!
Look at how well you can read now!

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.583
That's only because you taught me so much!

00:05:15.583 --> 00:05:18.917
Hey, we can't have this.
You've got a runny nose.

00:05:18.917 --> 00:05:22.625
You need to learn to be more ladylike, Historia.

00:05:22.625 --> 00:05:24.458
Here, blow.

00:05:26.542 --> 00:05:27.875
Ooh!

00:05:27.875 --> 00:05:30.458
Good! Very well done!

00:05:32.208 --> 00:05:33.083
Hey.

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:33.917
Hmm?

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:36.292
What does being ladylike mean?

00:05:36.292 --> 00:05:43.667
Well... I suppose being ladylike means
being a lot like this girl right here.

00:05:43.667 --> 00:05:45.292
Christa?

00:05:45.292 --> 00:05:48.583
Right. You like Christa, too,
don't you, Historia?

00:05:48.583 --> 00:05:49.875
Yeah.

00:05:49.875 --> 00:05:54.333
Christa is always thinking about
other people because she's so kind.

00:05:54.333 --> 00:05:57.417
You should try to be like Christa, too.

00:05:57.417 --> 00:06:01.250
The world is full of pain and suffering,

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:06.542
so you should live in a way to be
helpful and loved by everybody.

00:06:06.542 --> 00:06:08.375
Okay.

00:06:08.375 --> 00:06:11.500
In that case, I wanna be like you.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.625
Huh?

00:06:12.625 --> 00:06:16.958
When I grow up, do you think
I can be just like you?

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.375
--No need!
--Whoa!

00:06:20.375 --> 00:06:23.458
No need! You're perfect the way you are!

00:06:23.458 --> 00:06:24.917
Whoa...

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.042
I'm sorry, Historia, but it's time for me to go.

00:06:35.042 --> 00:06:37.750
You'll have to forget about me again.

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.500
Until we can meet again.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.667
Huh?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.792
Huh? Who was that girl just now?

00:07:08.667 --> 00:07:11.458
What's wrong, Historia?

00:07:11.458 --> 00:07:13.500
Why?

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.875
Why did I forget about that until now?

00:07:17.875 --> 00:07:20.500
I was never alone.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.958
That girl was always there for me.

00:07:25.125 --> 00:07:29.500
She gave me books...
Taught me how to read and write...

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.500
And was so kind to me...

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.208
How could I forget about her?

00:07:35.208 --> 00:07:38.167
You met Frieda?

00:07:38.167 --> 00:07:39.917
Frieda?

00:07:39.917 --> 00:07:46.917
If it was a young girl with long, black hair...
it was most likely Frieda Reiss.

00:07:46.917 --> 00:07:50.375
She was your half-sister.

00:07:50.375 --> 00:07:55.292
She must have been worried and
came to check up on you occasionally.

00:07:55.292 --> 00:08:00.500
If she was erasing your memories,
it was all done to protect you.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.375
Huh? Erasing my memories?

00:08:03.375 --> 00:08:10.375
Yes, but touching your hand to him seems
to have uncovered those memories again.

00:08:12.167 --> 00:08:14.625
Um, Father?

00:08:14.625 --> 00:08:17.750
Where is Frieda at now?

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.958
I'd like to see and thank her.

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:24.708
If she wasn't there for me, I...

00:08:24.708 --> 00:08:28.208
I need to thank her for
what she did for me then.

00:08:30.542 --> 00:08:34.083
Frieda is no longer in this world.

00:08:34.083 --> 00:08:35.292
Huh?

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.417
At one time, I had five children.

00:08:41.292 --> 00:08:45.792
But my wife and all of
my children, Frieda included,

00:08:45.792 --> 00:08:51.625
were killed five years ago
by his father, Grisha Jaeger.

00:08:59.542 --> 00:09:03.333
Grisha was a person with
the Power of the Titans.

00:09:03.333 --> 00:09:06.542
I do not know who the man was, but...

00:09:08.208 --> 00:09:13.250
...his goal was to steal the power
the Reiss family possessed.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.500
This power Grisha sought to obtain...

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:21.792
It was the Power of the Titans
residing within Frieda.

00:09:24.625 --> 00:09:29.083
Frieda's Titan was superior to all other Titans.

00:09:29.083 --> 00:09:33.083
You could say her Titan
had unsurpassable power.

00:09:33.083 --> 00:09:39.917
However... She did not have
the experience to properly wield it.

00:09:39.917 --> 00:09:47.917
Unable to unleash her true potential, she was
eaten by Grisha and he stole the power.

00:09:49.875 --> 00:09:51.708
But that's not all...

00:09:51.708 --> 00:09:54.542
He then attacked my entire family.

00:09:54.542 --> 00:09:57.625
His rampage sought to
eradicate the Reiss family.

00:09:59.083 --> 00:10:03.625
He crushed the 14-year-old Dirk
and 12-year-old Abel.

00:10:03.625 --> 00:10:07.375
He trampled over my wife and 10-year-old
Florian still clutched in her arms.

00:10:07.375 --> 00:10:11.458
Lastly, he took my eldest son, Ulklin,
and squeezed the life out of him.

00:10:11.458 --> 00:10:15.833
Miraculously, I was the only
one who made it away.

00:10:21.708 --> 00:10:23.375
Unbelievable...

00:10:24.958 --> 00:10:26.833
That's how she...

00:10:28.667 --> 00:10:31.500
Why would he do such a terrible thing?

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:43.875
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:10:45.417 --> 00:10:49.083
What the hell are you guys
blabbering about in here?

00:10:49.083 --> 00:10:52.875
I hope you know a buncha shit
is going down outside.

00:10:52.875 --> 00:10:56.167
Kenny? What happened?

00:10:56.167 --> 00:11:01.000
The Scouts started a coup d'état
and all the regiments changed sides.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.417
Everyone knows the King's a big fake, and
all the big shots ended up getting captured.

00:11:06.417 --> 00:11:09.125
Oh yeah, it's a royal shit show.

00:11:10.458 --> 00:11:13.042
Only a matter of time till they show up here.

00:11:13.042 --> 00:11:15.417
You oughta wrap it up lickety-split.

00:11:15.417 --> 00:11:17.292
Yes, all right.

00:11:17.292 --> 00:11:22.458
Take your Anti-Personnel Control
Squad and defend the entrance.

00:11:22.458 --> 00:11:27.250
I believe I told you already that I need you
and your crew to leave for the ceremony.

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:30.625
Whoa, now, King. Did I make you mad?

00:11:32.292 --> 00:11:36.625
Sorry 'bout that. I'm just so worried about you.

00:11:36.625 --> 00:11:41.125
Kenny... I trust you. Go.

00:11:41.125 --> 00:11:43.583
So do I, King.

00:11:45.083 --> 00:11:46.125
Tsk.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
"Among those with the Power of the Titans, some have a
'Scream.' The Female Titan can use a 'Scream' to control
Pure Titans. The royal family's Titan has a similar ability and
is believed to possess the power to alter human memories."

00:11:55.792 --> 00:12:01.750
From now on, you'll be digesting
everything you eat from the bottom up.

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:06.958
Plus, the only clothes you get to wear
start at your knees and below.

00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:12.875
Of course, once a week we'll take you outside
and parade you around to the public.

00:12:14.042 --> 00:12:16.208
How beautiful...

00:12:16.208 --> 00:12:20.250
This may very well be the finest
work of art ever conceived.

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:23.667
All those decades I spent
envisioning it paid off.

00:12:23.667 --> 00:12:28.833
But see, only after you're publicly humiliated
in front of the same people you tyrannized

00:12:28.833 --> 00:12:32.500
will this masterpiece be truly complete.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.042
Zachary!

00:12:34.042 --> 00:12:36.208
You just wait and see!

00:12:36.208 --> 00:12:39.833
The only blood in you is slave blood!

00:12:39.833 --> 00:12:43.583
It's nothing like our noble bloodlines!

00:12:43.583 --> 00:12:48.208
Soon enough, you'll lose your memory
and even forget how to shit!

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:52.750
That one insult of yours
is getting pretty stale!

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:55.292
Don't you have anything new?!

00:12:57.208 --> 00:12:59.708
This could be bad, Erwin.

00:12:59.708 --> 00:13:02.875
All the officials are saying similar things.

00:13:02.875 --> 00:13:06.458
It's just as your father speculated.

00:13:06.458 --> 00:13:11.292
The Reiss family must be able to alter
people's memories as it suits them.

00:13:11.292 --> 00:13:18.542
From the sound of it, certain bloodlines,
including theirs, are immune to the effects.

00:13:18.542 --> 00:13:20.542
How is that even...?

00:13:20.542 --> 00:13:27.958
If Reiss is able to obtain Eren's "Scream,"
this uprising will amount to absolutely nothing.

00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:32.708
As proof of that, they're spilling
all their secrets with no shame.

00:13:32.708 --> 00:13:35.583
It's a needless beating for them otherwise.

00:13:35.583 --> 00:13:36.958
I see...

00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:42.083
In other words, we will eventually
forget even that vital fact.

00:13:42.083 --> 00:13:48.000
Though, I suppose they might prefer
any torture we can dish out...

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.125
...over falling into Zachary's hands.

00:13:51.125 --> 00:13:53.167
I don't understand that man.

00:13:53.167 --> 00:13:57.208
To think he dedicated so much
of his life just so he could do that.

00:13:57.208 --> 00:14:00.042
Commander, you knew about him?

00:14:00.042 --> 00:14:03.708
Mmm... 'Twas a slip of the tongue.

00:14:03.708 --> 00:14:06.042
Indeed...

00:14:06.042 --> 00:14:10.125
I suspected Dhalis Zachary had such ambitions.

00:14:10.125 --> 00:14:13.500
Unlike you, I'm not very fond of gambling.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.000
And also, unlike you...

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.125
...I value the number of remaining
humans over my own life.

00:14:21.125 --> 00:14:26.875
The reason I backed you was because I
believed it the superior choice for humanity.

00:14:26.875 --> 00:14:34.750
Had the government been the favorable choice,
I was prepared to fight against Zachary.

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:40.667
To think, we're comrades just following
a coup d'état, and look what I'm saying...

00:14:40.667 --> 00:14:46.708
I once heard a song that someday humans
will stop fighting, but when will that be?

00:14:48.083 --> 00:14:49.542
Commander!

00:14:49.542 --> 00:14:52.333
All troops are prepared and ready!

00:14:52.333 --> 00:14:53.875
We're ready to go!

00:14:56.208 --> 00:15:01.750
Humans will continue to fight one another
until the day there's one human or less.

00:15:03.667 --> 00:15:07.583
I was hoping for a better answer
than some bleak hyperbole.

00:15:07.583 --> 00:15:09.583
All troops, fall in!

00:15:09.583 --> 00:15:14.417
Our mission to recover Eren
and Historia will now commence!

00:15:14.417 --> 00:15:18.750
We make for their location, believed
to be the chapel on Reiss territory!

00:15:21.167 --> 00:15:24.667
Understand? He's Kenny the Ripper.

00:15:24.667 --> 00:15:27.625
If he's there, he'll be our biggest obstacle.

00:15:27.625 --> 00:15:31.167
In terms of how much of a threat he is,
equate him to me as an enemy.

00:15:31.167 --> 00:15:34.667
No... With those weapons of his,
he's deadlier than me.

00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:37.458
Then he's unbeatable, at least for us...

00:15:37.458 --> 00:15:39.917
If we could meet up with the troops--

00:15:39.917 --> 00:15:41.250
Absolutely not.

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:46.042
I know, absolutely not! If we wait until
morning, Eren might end up getting eaten!

00:15:46.042 --> 00:15:51.708
Though, if what the captain said is true,
it's not like he has no weak points.

00:15:51.708 --> 00:15:52.958
For real, Armin?

00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:57.292
Yeah, I'm sure he's trained plenty, but having
combat experience is something else.

00:15:57.292 --> 00:16:02.000
I wonder, how is it that you
lived with Kenny the Ripper

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.792
but know almost nothing about him, Levi?

00:16:03.792 --> 00:16:08.125
Sorry, but I only found out
his full name not too long ago.

00:16:08.125 --> 00:16:11.000
Apparently, it's Kenny Ackermann.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.375
He some relative of yours?

00:16:16.167 --> 00:16:21.292
I heard from my parents when they were alive
that my dad's side, the Ackermanns,

00:16:21.292 --> 00:16:25.375
were persecuted in the cities.

00:16:25.375 --> 00:16:31.333
My mom's family was Eastern, so being a
different race meant they didn't fit in anywhere.

00:16:31.333 --> 00:16:35.625
Both were people chased deep in the
mountains near the edge of the walls,

00:16:35.625 --> 00:16:38.167
so that's how they met and married.

00:16:38.167 --> 00:16:42.167
But I never found out why the
Ackermanns were persecuted.

00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:47.458
My dad didn't seem like a
different race like my mom was.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:55.083
Has there ever been a moment where it's felt
like power suddenly awakened inside you?

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.417
There has.

00:17:09.833 --> 00:17:14.125
Kenny Ackermann had a moment like that, too.

00:17:14.125 --> 00:17:19.750
One time, out of nowhere, he felt an absurd
amount of strength surging within him

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:23.083
and he knew exactly what he had to do.

00:17:23.083 --> 00:17:26.500
I've felt a moment like that, too.

00:17:40.167 --> 00:17:43.583
Fess up, Gramps.

00:17:43.583 --> 00:17:46.500
You're about to die anyways, right?

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:54.167
Kenny... Were you out killing
more Military Police?

00:17:54.167 --> 00:17:58.625
Yeah... If you're talking about
those goons snooping around,

00:17:58.625 --> 00:18:01.542
they're in the ground helping the trees grow.

00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:09.625
Speaking of branches, the branch family
moved down south around Shiganshina.

00:18:09.625 --> 00:18:16.917
But it turns out someone's interfering with their
business there, too, so they're still poor as hell.

00:18:16.917 --> 00:18:19.042
What's the big deal?

00:18:19.042 --> 00:18:23.083
Didn't the Ackermanns use to be a
family of warriors protecting the King?

00:18:23.083 --> 00:18:26.667
Now the whole family is on
the verge of extinction.

00:18:26.667 --> 00:18:30.208
The hell did you do to
piss off the King so much?

00:18:32.167 --> 00:18:36.167
C'mon, fess up.
Won'tcha tell your cute grandson?

00:18:41.292 --> 00:18:44.292
What cute grandson?

00:18:44.292 --> 00:18:49.792
The one who's Kenny the Ripper,
terror of the capital?

00:18:49.792 --> 00:18:53.792
The Ackermann family isn't hated by the monarchy.

00:18:53.792 --> 00:18:56.542
It's just, they're afraid of us.

00:18:56.542 --> 00:19:02.000
It's because the King isn't able
to control the Ackermann family.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Control?

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.167
I personally don't know all there is to know.

00:19:07.167 --> 00:19:17.417
But it's true that our family was once the
monarchy's sword and one of their vital supporters.

00:19:17.417 --> 00:19:23.708
However, the King passes down the Power
of the Titans from generation to generation.

00:19:23.708 --> 00:19:27.167
Huh? What's this Power of the Titans?

00:19:27.167 --> 00:19:29.792
It's an immense power they possess

00:19:29.792 --> 00:19:36.000
to alter all of humanity's memories
and make them entirely forget the past.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.208
Except for a few noble bloodlines.

00:19:39.208 --> 00:19:44.333
Among them, there were two groups
that turned their back on the King.

00:19:44.333 --> 00:19:49.708
That is, the Eastern clan
and the Ackermann family.

00:19:49.708 --> 00:19:52.292
Hence the persecution.

00:19:52.292 --> 00:19:54.833
Such a dreadful story.

00:19:58.542 --> 00:20:05.125
It ain't the heartwarming story you wanna hear
on your deathbed, but I did find my little sister.

00:20:05.125 --> 00:20:08.583
Kuchel's been working at
a brothel in the underground.

00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:11.333
Got pregnant by one of her customers.

00:20:11.333 --> 00:20:15.167
Wants to have it and won't listen to me.

00:20:15.167 --> 00:20:16.833
Hell...

00:20:16.833 --> 00:20:23.500
Being born in this piece of shit world... Ain't a
single damn dream worth suffering through it.

00:20:27.458 --> 00:20:29.042
Found it.

00:20:29.042 --> 00:20:30.792
A hidden door.

00:20:30.792 --> 00:20:33.250
Eren's gotta be in here with the enemy.

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:36.333
Hopefully the layout in
there is like I predicted.

00:20:36.333 --> 00:20:41.000
These presents better pay off, considering
we went out of the way to prepare them.

00:20:43.708 --> 00:20:46.167
There's seven enemies at the least.

00:20:46.167 --> 00:20:49.792
You can be sure Levi's among them.

00:20:49.792 --> 00:20:57.917
As you know, Levi got completely ambushed last
time and yet he still killed 12 of our comrades.

00:20:57.917 --> 00:21:01.167
The rest of the Interior Police
are out of the picture,

00:21:01.167 --> 00:21:04.250
not to mention the government lost control.

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:06.667
It's a bad situation all around.

00:21:06.667 --> 00:21:08.542
In a world as tiny as ours,

00:21:08.542 --> 00:21:13.667
dying would be preferable to the life
that awaits us the second we surrender.

00:21:15.458 --> 00:21:20.792
Then again, is a life stuck
in these walls any different?

00:21:21.917 --> 00:21:25.292
We've got an enemy we can't defeat
and all we can do is wait

00:21:25.292 --> 00:21:28.250
till they break down the walls and destroy us.

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:34.083
We chose to join the Military Police, aspired to
be Interior Police, and joined up with Kenny.

00:21:34.083 --> 00:21:39.375
All to seek meaning in our meaningless
lives in this meaningless world.

00:21:39.375 --> 00:21:42.208
Let's keep believing all the way to the end...

00:21:42.208 --> 00:21:47.125
...that Kenny and his dream can
turn the tables on this world.

00:21:50.375 --> 00:21:52.750
All right, we're good to go!

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:54.625
Are we?

00:21:54.625 --> 00:21:59.375
Is everyone ready to get their hands dirty, too?

00:22:06.875 --> 00:22:08.667
Guess so.

00:23:57.708 --> 00:24:00.125
To protect his wish...

00:24:00.125 --> 00:24:02.458
To rescue him...

00:24:02.458 --> 00:24:05.583
To carry on his memories...

00:24:05.583 --> 00:24:09.917
Their many feelings lead
straight towards battle.

00:24:09.917 --> 00:24:12.096
Next episode: "Wish."
