00:00:30.833 --> 00:00:35.542
Beyond the wall, there's a sea,
or so Armin said...

00:00:39.708 --> 00:00:41.583
But past the sea...

00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:47.083
I always wondered what's beyond that...

00:02:28.042 --> 00:02:30.833
You just try to steal some food, Sasha.

00:02:30.833 --> 00:02:34.750
I'll get Captain Levi to chop you up
into nice bite-sized pieces.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.792
I won't! Probably...

00:02:36.792 --> 00:02:37.750
Say what?

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.417
Hey! Did you guys wipe the dust and dirt
off your shoes before you came in?

00:02:41.417 --> 00:02:42.458
Say what?

00:02:42.458 --> 00:02:46.458
No, we didn't. Can't you see
all the stuff we're carrying?

00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:50.583
Do you seriously think that attitude
will satisfy Captain Levi?

00:02:50.583 --> 00:02:53.875
If I hadn't personally given your
sheets hospital corners this morning--

00:02:53.875 --> 00:02:57.292
Quit nagging! Who are you, my mom?!

00:02:57.292 --> 00:02:58.625
We're back.

00:02:58.625 --> 00:03:01.125
Wait, were you just chopping firewood?

00:03:01.125 --> 00:03:02.583
Gotta stay in shape.

00:03:02.583 --> 00:03:05.583
You got grabbed by a Titan!
You should be in bed.

00:03:05.583 --> 00:03:07.417
I try to stop her, but she won't listen.

00:03:07.417 --> 00:03:10.042
I saw her doing sit-ups earlier!

00:03:10.042 --> 00:03:11.875
How dare you, you peeping Tom!

00:03:11.875 --> 00:03:15.833
--Huh?! How does that constitute "peeping"?!
--Mikasa, you <i>do </i>know you're
not a wild animal, right?

00:03:15.833 --> 00:03:20.083
It's almost like we're back in the Cadet Corps.

00:03:20.083 --> 00:03:21.417
Yeah...

00:03:21.417 --> 00:03:26.042
Why do you figure we were chosen
for the new Levi Squad, though?

00:03:26.042 --> 00:03:29.417
Protecting Eren and Historia
is such an important mission...

00:03:29.417 --> 00:03:31.792
Because we're talented, I assume.

00:03:32.708 --> 00:03:36.125
Sasha... what did you just put in your bag?

00:03:36.125 --> 00:03:38.583
Nothing bread-related.

00:03:38.583 --> 00:03:40.333
Why, you!

00:03:40.333 --> 00:03:41.292
Give it back.

00:03:41.292 --> 00:03:45.250
Hey, focus! We gotta finish cleaning
before the captain gets back!

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.833
Put back the bread.

00:03:46.833 --> 00:03:47.958
What's this commotion about?

00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.333
How many times have you done this now?

00:03:49.333 --> 00:03:51.333
Our food reserves are precious!

00:03:51.333 --> 00:03:54.750
Cut the crap, Potato Girl!

00:04:02.583 --> 00:04:05.583
I'm <i>quite </i>sure I gave you enough time.

00:04:08.917 --> 00:04:10.292
Anyways...

00:04:10.292 --> 00:04:13.833
We'll discuss your lax cleaning job another time.

00:04:13.833 --> 00:04:15.208
Eren.

00:04:15.208 --> 00:04:18.208
Hange is itching to get the experiment started.

00:04:18.208 --> 00:04:20.125
R-Right.

00:04:26.542 --> 00:04:27.417
Eren!

00:04:27.417 --> 00:04:30.417
What's wrong, Eren?! Get up!

00:04:30.417 --> 00:04:33.583
The future of humanity is riding on you!

00:04:33.583 --> 00:04:35.875
Get up, dammit!

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:37.250
Hey, four-eyes.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.875
He's not quite the same this time.

00:04:39.875 --> 00:04:44.042
He's not even 10 meters, and some
of his body doesn't have muscle.

00:04:44.042 --> 00:04:45.917
Plus, Eren's ass is hanging out.

00:04:45.917 --> 00:04:47.667
I can see that!

00:04:47.667 --> 00:04:50.292
Eren! Can you still move?!

00:04:50.292 --> 00:04:52.833
Give us a signal or something!

00:04:52.833 --> 00:04:54.167
Eren!

00:04:54.167 --> 00:04:55.333
Mikasa!

00:04:55.333 --> 00:04:59.833
Hey... That gloomy brat
is acting on her own again.

00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:01.417
Time to think up a punishment?

00:05:01.417 --> 00:05:04.125
No, there's no signal... We're done here!

00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:05.833
Eren!

00:05:08.125 --> 00:05:11.917
Hot! Hot damn, you are hot!

00:05:11.917 --> 00:05:14.167
Hange, wait! Eren is bleeding!

00:05:14.167 --> 00:05:16.917
Whoa! Check it out, Moblit!

00:05:16.917 --> 00:05:19.333
Eren's face! Hurry up and sketch it!

00:05:19.333 --> 00:05:22.792
Section Commander!
Are you lacking in human compassion?!

00:05:29.167 --> 00:05:32.042
Sorry, I got carried away...

00:05:32.042 --> 00:05:35.250
Looks like we've got a long road ahead...

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.958
...before we can use the Titan
hardening ability to seal the wall.

00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:43.875
Yes... I knew we'd be grasping
at straws from the start.

00:05:43.875 --> 00:05:46.292
Strategically, it's not a bad plan.

00:05:46.292 --> 00:05:50.875
Instead of lugging tons of supplies,
all we need is to get Eren there.

00:05:50.875 --> 00:05:55.667
Whether or not we're grasping at straws...
all depends on Eren.

00:05:55.667 --> 00:05:58.917
Experiment's over! All troops, disperse at once!

00:05:58.917 --> 00:06:00.208
Roger!

00:06:00.208 --> 00:06:01.833
Make sure there's no witnesses!

00:06:01.833 --> 00:06:02.958
Yes, sir!

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.667
You ride in the same wagon as Eren.

00:06:08.667 --> 00:06:12.917
I'm headed for Trost District with Hange's group.

00:06:12.917 --> 00:06:14.292
Okay.

00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:18.375
You must find her at once.

00:06:18.375 --> 00:06:23.833
Only she... She may know the truths
which even we cannot perceive.

00:06:37.875 --> 00:06:41.833
I see... Another failure, then.

00:06:41.833 --> 00:06:44.250
If the plan would have worked out,

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.625
we could have plugged the hole in
Shiganshina District in less than a day.

00:06:47.625 --> 00:06:49.833
It's because we lack information.

00:06:49.833 --> 00:06:54.417
Might be a different story if there was
a book about the hardening ability.

00:06:54.417 --> 00:06:58.667
But we have Christa. No, Historia Reiss...

00:06:58.667 --> 00:07:02.833
Maybe we learn about the wall through her?

00:07:02.833 --> 00:07:06.500
I read the entire report about her upbringing.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:13.583
She's the illegitimate daughter of Lord Reiss,
and it's by no means a happy story.

00:07:13.583 --> 00:07:19.958
But the real mystery here... is why a mere
regional lord would know the secrets of the wall.

00:07:31.375 --> 00:07:32.833
Eren!

00:07:32.833 --> 00:07:34.667
You should still be in bed!

00:07:34.667 --> 00:07:38.625
I'm fine. I already slept a whole day.

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:43.583
Besides, it's my fault the strategy
for retaking Wall Maria got shelved.

00:07:43.583 --> 00:07:45.417
It's not your fault.

00:07:45.417 --> 00:07:47.583
So don't worry about it.

00:07:47.583 --> 00:07:52.667
All I care about... is getting
a chance to fight that Beast Titan.

00:07:52.667 --> 00:07:56.917
Whatever that damn ape is, I'll never forgive it.

00:08:02.542 --> 00:08:05.708
It's about time to switch lookouts.

00:08:05.708 --> 00:08:06.958
Mikasa?

00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:08.083
Yeah.

00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:13.125
Must be nice.

00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:17.875
You and the others... You have goals in mind,
even though they won't be easy.

00:08:18.875 --> 00:08:23.875
But me, now that Ymir is gone...
I don't even know what I want.

00:08:23.875 --> 00:08:27.083
Don't you want to save Ymir, though?

00:08:27.083 --> 00:08:30.000
Yeah, but...

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.583
Back then, I couldn't believe what she did...
Though, it's true I wanted to save her.

00:08:35.583 --> 00:08:39.042
But now, I'm thinking differently.

00:08:39.042 --> 00:08:42.375
Ymir chose her own path in life.

00:08:42.375 --> 00:08:46.792
I have no right to change that... and no need to.

00:08:47.917 --> 00:08:51.083
Finally, you're talking again.

00:08:51.083 --> 00:08:52.375
Huh?

00:08:52.375 --> 00:08:55.750
When we came here,
you told us all about yourself, but...

00:08:55.750 --> 00:09:00.625
Since then, you haven't smiled once,
and you rarely talk either.

00:09:00.625 --> 00:09:02.583
Because it's a pain.

00:09:03.667 --> 00:09:05.333
Sorry.

00:09:05.333 --> 00:09:10.000
That good-girl Christa who was
nice to everyone is gone now.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.167
Nah, I think it's better this way.

00:09:13.167 --> 00:09:14.000
Huh?

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.125
Before, it felt like you always put on a facade.

00:09:17.125 --> 00:09:20.292
It was so forced and unnatural, it made me sick.

00:09:21.458 --> 00:09:22.875
I see...

00:09:22.875 --> 00:09:26.333
But, the you right now is pretty normal.

00:09:26.333 --> 00:09:30.042
A stupidly honest, but normal girl.

00:09:30.042 --> 00:09:33.208
Anyways, you have plenty of time
to think about Ymir.

00:09:33.208 --> 00:09:35.750
In a lot of ways, I...

00:09:37.792 --> 00:09:40.083
Wait... Wasn't that...?

00:09:40.083 --> 00:09:42.417
Hange and the others arrived!

00:09:42.417 --> 00:09:44.333
Gather in the main room!

00:09:47.833 --> 00:09:50.208
Huh? What was that?

00:09:51.375 --> 00:09:54.667
He's dead... Pastor Nick.

00:09:54.667 --> 00:09:56.458
He was murdered.

00:09:57.542 --> 00:10:00.500
This morning, in the Trost District barracks.

00:10:06.625 --> 00:10:07.458
Hey!

00:10:07.458 --> 00:10:09.958
You'll disrupt the crime scene, you damn Scout!

00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.708
Don't get any closer.

00:10:11.708 --> 00:10:14.333
This is our job, not yours.

00:10:14.333 --> 00:10:18.667
It's another robbery-murder.
They've been springing up a lot lately.

00:10:18.667 --> 00:10:20.917
Wha--?! I'm not buying that!

00:10:20.917 --> 00:10:22.792
His nails were torn off!

00:10:22.792 --> 00:10:25.167
Which unit are you in?

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:33.000
Fourth Squad Section Commander Hange ZoÃ«
and Executive Officer Moblit Berner.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.542
Your ranks mean practically nothing
when your branch is the trash that it is.

00:10:38.542 --> 00:10:42.292
Listen here... It was no Titan that killed that man.

00:10:42.292 --> 00:10:44.583
A person killed another person.

00:10:44.583 --> 00:10:47.208
This work is out of your league.

00:10:48.208 --> 00:10:51.458
First Interior Squad?

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:58.000
Why? What's the capital's Military Police
doing down south in Trost?

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.625
What's so strange about it?

00:11:00.625 --> 00:11:06.125
Unlike you useless goons, us valuable
soldiers are busy getting things done.

00:11:06.125 --> 00:11:09.333
Oh! So that's how it is!

00:11:09.333 --> 00:11:12.083
You're right, I'm worthless, really.

00:11:12.083 --> 00:11:14.875
I'm so lucky to meet great soldiers like you.

00:11:14.875 --> 00:11:17.458
Let me shake your hand!

00:11:17.458 --> 00:11:20.917
I see... So poor Nick was robbed...

00:11:20.917 --> 00:11:22.833
Such a pity...

00:11:22.833 --> 00:11:26.208
Did he ever have stuff worth
stealing in the first place?

00:11:26.208 --> 00:11:27.500
Of course.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.958
Everyone knows the Church's trinkets
are made from valuable iron.

00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.125
Huh?!

00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:36.292
Nick was a pastor for the Order of the Walls?!

00:11:36.292 --> 00:11:38.208
What are you talking about?

00:11:38.208 --> 00:11:41.458
He was a friend of mine on personal terms...

00:11:41.458 --> 00:11:46.250
But, as far as I knew the man,
he was just a chair-maker.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:49.083
I even wrote that on his application here...

00:11:49.083 --> 00:11:49.958
Dammit, stop--

00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:55.917
Though, I guess this only means I never
knew Nick as well as I thought I did...

00:11:55.917 --> 00:11:57.833
Hey! Let go!

00:11:57.833 --> 00:12:01.292
Oh, I'm sorry! Forgive me!

00:12:01.292 --> 00:12:04.500
Well then, good luck with the investigation.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:08.000
When you capture the culprit,
please tell them this...

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.417
The things you did to him,
perhaps you felt were righteous and just.

00:12:12.417 --> 00:12:16.250
But, personally, I couldn't
care less about any of that.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:20.542
To you scoundrels, I will ensure
you're tortured alive like my friend,

00:12:20.542 --> 00:12:23.958
and experience suffering above
and beyond what you did to him.

00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:26.333
Yes, you'll be sorry!

00:12:26.333 --> 00:12:29.625
Pass along that message. Excuse us.

00:12:36.375 --> 00:12:38.708
Section Commander, do you think they really--?

00:12:38.708 --> 00:12:42.250
Yeah... First Interior Squad, Djel Sannes.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:44.542
All the skin on his fist was split.

00:12:44.542 --> 00:12:48.250
Nick was tortured by the Interior Military Police...

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:50.125
And then murdered...

00:12:52.667 --> 00:12:58.250
I figured the Church would want to deal with Nick
since he was cooperating with the Scouts.

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:02.917
That's why I hid his identity and
had him stay in the barracks, but...

00:13:02.917 --> 00:13:06.250
To think they would use soldiers to kill him...

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:08.083
I was too careless.

00:13:08.083 --> 00:13:10.375
It's entirely my fault.

00:13:15.542 --> 00:13:22.208
The Military Police... Did they torture Pastor Nick
just to find out what information he spilled to us?

00:13:22.208 --> 00:13:23.917
Most likely.

00:13:23.917 --> 00:13:29.750
But it was the Interior Military Police,
which means there's something more behind it.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:32.750
So, how many nails did Nick have ripped off?

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:33.583
Huh?

00:13:33.583 --> 00:13:35.750
You saw, right? How many?

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:40.625
I only caught a glimpse of him,
but all the nails that I could see.

00:13:40.625 --> 00:13:47.125
People that talk, talk after one. If they don't,
peeling more won't make a difference.

00:13:47.125 --> 00:13:51.583
Pastor Nick... I thought he was an idiot, but...

00:13:51.583 --> 00:13:55.833
He didn't turn away from what
he believed, all the way till the end.

00:13:59.167 --> 00:14:04.708
In other words, they have no idea
we've caught wind of the Reiss family.

00:14:04.708 --> 00:14:10.542
Though, someone in the government is up
to no good, and their eyes are fixed on us.

00:14:11.583 --> 00:14:13.208
Captain Levi.

00:14:13.208 --> 00:14:15.583
A message from Commander Erwin.

00:14:16.792 --> 00:14:22.000
I went to tell him about Pastor Nick,
but he sent me off with this.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.958
Everyone, out. We leave now.

00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:27.125
Leave no trace we were here.

00:14:33.708 --> 00:14:35.458
That was close...

00:14:35.458 --> 00:14:38.958
If we hadn't left right then,
what would've happened to us?

00:14:38.958 --> 00:14:42.750
But why? What would make Commander Erwin...?

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:45.250
New orders came from the government.

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:49.208
There's been a freeze on all Scout
Regiment activity outside the wall.

00:14:49.208 --> 00:14:52.750
They're telling us to hand over Eren and Historia.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:56.250
By the way, right after
he gave me the message...

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:58.875
...the Military Police came for him...

00:15:02.417 --> 00:15:05.000
That's treating him like some sort of criminal!

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.875
Someone's not working
from the shadows anymore.

00:15:07.875 --> 00:15:09.917
They're moving for all eyes to see.

00:15:09.917 --> 00:15:13.458
To go that far to protect the wall's secrets...

00:15:13.458 --> 00:15:18.083
What's more, why do they want us
to hand over Eren and Historia?

00:15:18.083 --> 00:15:21.458
Not to kill, but for them to obtain?

00:15:21.458 --> 00:15:23.125
Who knows?

00:15:23.125 --> 00:15:26.917
Anyways, it's clear the enemy is after these two.

00:15:26.917 --> 00:15:29.667
Loitering around here is dangerous.

00:15:29.667 --> 00:15:32.958
We're moving her and Eren to Trost District.

00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:36.833
Why? That's the same place
Pastor Nick was killed.

00:15:36.833 --> 00:15:39.667
It's worse to head towards the interior.

00:15:39.667 --> 00:15:42.958
With Trost in a panic, it should be easy to slip in.

00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:47.125
And if somehow it comes down to it,
we can use these in the city.

00:15:47.125 --> 00:15:48.292
True...

00:15:48.292 --> 00:15:52.042
Plus, not knowing the enemy
puts us in a tough spot.

00:15:52.042 --> 00:15:55.583
We need to find out who's behind this.

00:15:55.583 --> 00:15:58.500
Hange, lend me some of your squad.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.125
Of course.

00:16:01.583 --> 00:16:04.708
All right, I'm going after Erwin.

00:16:04.708 --> 00:16:08.417
Moblit's with me. The rest of you will follow Levi.

00:16:08.417 --> 00:16:09.583
Roger!

00:16:10.917 --> 00:16:13.000
Hange!

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.042
Here...

00:16:15.042 --> 00:16:19.000
I remembered a conversation
between Ymir and Bertholdt.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.625
Didn't get time to tell you, but it's here.

00:16:22.625 --> 00:16:24.250
All right.

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:26.333
I'll take a look at it later.

00:16:27.375 --> 00:16:28.500
Hiyaah!

00:16:34.167 --> 00:16:36.500
They're rather quick on the move.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:41.792
Hmph... It's because that
little runt is actually disciplined.

00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:44.458
An acquaintance of yours?

00:16:44.458 --> 00:16:45.958
An old one.

00:16:45.958 --> 00:16:50.958
"The body of every Titan varies significantly, but each
has a weak point of height 1 meter and width 10 cm
at their nape. When severed, this area ruins a Titan's
regenerative ability and results in their destruction."

00:17:00.208 --> 00:17:04.000
Try not to walk in a cluster. We'll stand out.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.292
Eren and Historia, just walk normal.

00:17:07.292 --> 00:17:10.083
Why is the royal family's flag hanging everywhere?

00:17:10.083 --> 00:17:13.375
Oh! Today must be the anniversary
of the King's coronation.

00:17:13.375 --> 00:17:16.417
Once a year, they hand out a haul of rations.

00:17:16.417 --> 00:17:17.083
--Oh...

00:17:17.083 --> 00:17:19.167
--We'll begin handing out rations!
--Oh...

00:17:20.542 --> 00:17:27.292
King Fritz has heard of Trost District's hardship
and will donate the royal family's reserves!

00:17:27.292 --> 00:17:30.375
There's enough for everyone! Line up orderly!

00:17:30.375 --> 00:17:30.958
--Thank goodness!

00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:33.125
--Long live King Fritz!
--Thank goodness!

00:17:33.125 --> 00:17:35.958
What a King! He sure is generous!

00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:38.583
He's got more than he knows what to do with.

00:17:38.583 --> 00:17:41.875
People are weak, especially
when baited with food.

00:17:47.292 --> 00:17:52.000
By handing out those rations,
over 60% of the reserves are gone.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.917
Don't you think it's a bit too much for
raising the people's morale, Lord Reiss?

00:17:56.917 --> 00:18:02.667
It's necessary. There was a need to raise
the public's approval of the royal family.

00:18:02.667 --> 00:18:05.417
More importantly, we need
that power and the vessel.

00:18:05.417 --> 00:18:07.667
And we must hurry.

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:11.208
The Military Police failed again?

00:18:11.208 --> 00:18:14.167
I'll return and continue the hunt at once.

00:18:14.167 --> 00:18:17.208
No, we'll soon have what we need.

00:18:17.208 --> 00:18:19.542
"That" is set in motion.

00:18:33.458 --> 00:18:35.583
Watch out! Behind us!

00:18:41.125 --> 00:18:41.958
Armi--

00:18:41.958 --> 00:18:44.375
I mean, Christa and Eren!

00:18:44.375 --> 00:18:47.333
They got snatched away again!

00:18:52.667 --> 00:18:55.292
Will it really work?

00:18:55.292 --> 00:18:59.125
He looks absolutely nothing like me...

00:18:59.125 --> 00:19:02.083
That horse face? Yeah right...

00:19:06.083 --> 00:19:10.708
Yeah? You like that? Let me hear you moan.

00:19:10.708 --> 00:19:15.042
Well? How's that? Doesn't it feel good?

00:19:15.042 --> 00:19:18.500
I'm just dying to hear your cute little voice.

00:19:24.417 --> 00:19:28.375
This is why I didn't wanna go
through this shit a second time!

00:19:28.375 --> 00:19:29.917
Screw being his body double!

00:19:29.917 --> 00:19:32.708
Sheâs more muscular than I expectedâ¦

00:19:38.625 --> 00:19:40.750
How's it going inside?

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:45.167
If we don't hurry, they'll see
through Armin's disguise.

00:19:45.167 --> 00:19:47.208
And I feel bad for him...

00:19:47.208 --> 00:19:49.333
I see.

00:19:49.333 --> 00:19:52.875
How is your leg? Any better?

00:19:52.875 --> 00:19:56.333
I can move well enough. It's not bad.

00:19:56.333 --> 00:20:01.875
More importantly, these kidnappers...
They're nothing but amateurs.

00:20:01.875 --> 00:20:04.792
Why would they be using guys like this?

00:20:05.833 --> 00:20:09.917
You can handle the rest on your own.
I'm heading for Eren.

00:20:09.917 --> 00:20:13.333
Once you've dealt with the trash,
come and meet up with me.

00:20:13.333 --> 00:20:15.000
Roger.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.875
One more thing... I'll tell you, just in case.

00:20:19.875 --> 00:20:22.083
Tell Armin and the others, too.

00:20:35.292 --> 00:20:38.708
You're sure, without a doubt,
it's Christa and Eren?

00:20:38.708 --> 00:20:42.083
Yes, they match the description.

00:20:42.083 --> 00:20:44.333
Huh? Where's the guard?

00:20:55.208 --> 00:20:56.208
What the--?!

00:21:01.875 --> 00:21:04.167
Don't you dare move.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.125
Conny! Is it really just the four of them?!

00:21:09.125 --> 00:21:10.917
Yeah, that's it!

00:21:10.917 --> 00:21:12.875
Nobody else in the area!

00:21:16.292 --> 00:21:19.375
If you move again, who knows where I'll hit?

00:21:19.375 --> 00:21:23.833
All right! First, we tie these guys up,
then we meet up with the captain.

00:21:23.833 --> 00:21:25.125
What do you mean?

00:21:25.125 --> 00:21:28.417
Captain's orders, and he sends a message, too.

00:21:32.375 --> 00:21:34.917
Hey! Get outta the way!

00:21:38.292 --> 00:21:39.583
Captain?

00:21:39.583 --> 00:21:40.917
Well?

00:21:40.917 --> 00:21:43.958
The road is crowded, but nothing unusual.

00:21:43.958 --> 00:21:47.042
It's not much farther to Commander Pyxis'.

00:21:47.042 --> 00:21:48.917
How's the body double mission?

00:21:48.917 --> 00:21:50.750
A success.

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:53.167
And yet, you don't look that happy...

00:21:53.167 --> 00:21:55.458
No...

00:21:55.458 --> 00:21:57.458
Something is wrong...

00:21:57.458 --> 00:22:00.125
The Military Police can't be behind this.

00:22:00.125 --> 00:22:04.708
They're far too arrogant.
They wouldn't use amateurs.

00:22:04.708 --> 00:22:07.375
This is more like...

00:22:07.375 --> 00:22:10.792
Assuming the wagon was being followed...

00:22:10.792 --> 00:22:13.292
And the group was trailing their target...

00:22:13.292 --> 00:22:15.250
Captain.

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:17.500
The wagon's almost moving again.

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:22.000
Nifa, have you heard about Kenny the Ripper?

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.708
The mass-murderer in the capital?

00:22:24.708 --> 00:22:27.667
The one that slit the throats
of over 100 Military Police?

00:22:27.667 --> 00:22:31.542
That's just an urban legend
from years ago, right?

00:22:31.542 --> 00:22:34.458
He is real, and the stories are true.

00:22:34.458 --> 00:22:35.625
Huh?

00:22:35.625 --> 00:22:38.625
I lived with him for a while when I was a kid.

00:22:38.625 --> 00:22:41.542
What? Why would you even say that?

00:22:41.542 --> 00:22:44.042
This isn't the time to be making jokes.

00:22:44.042 --> 00:22:48.917
That's right... He wouldn't care
about using amateurs.

00:22:48.917 --> 00:22:54.000
If a group was trailing their target,
it would be from both rear angles, and...

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.500
...a place high up, with a view...

00:22:58.792 --> 00:22:59.917
Nifa!

00:23:21.292 --> 00:23:23.750
Yo, Levi.

00:23:24.875 --> 00:23:27.250
You grown any yet?

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.125
Oh? It don't look like you changed at all!

00:23:52.167 --> 00:23:54.583
Kenny!

00:23:57.917 --> 00:24:00.583
Kenny and Levi meet again.

00:24:00.583 --> 00:24:04.583
The enemy's target was Eren and Historia.

00:24:04.583 --> 00:24:10.042
In order to get them back, Levi and
the others must take aim and shoot.

00:24:10.042 --> 00:24:12.096
Next episode: "Pain."
