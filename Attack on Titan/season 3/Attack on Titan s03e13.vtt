00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.500
Wall Maria contained one third
of humanity's remaining territory.

00:00:27.458 --> 00:00:31.333
Five years ago,
when humanity lost this territory,

00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:35.417
from within the remaining
two walls, they realized:

00:00:35.417 --> 00:00:39.917
"That we... are not meant to continue living."

00:00:40.833 --> 00:00:46.083
After all, humanity cannot defeat the Titans.

00:00:46.083 --> 00:00:48.000
I'm going to drive out...

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.292
...every last one from this world!

00:00:53.292 --> 00:00:58.417
However, one young man gripped
that small blade held in his heart

00:00:58.417 --> 00:01:04.125
and thrust it into a Titan, pounding its
massive head into the ground.

00:01:05.083 --> 00:01:09.458
When humanity saw this, what did they think?

00:01:10.667 --> 00:01:13.125
Some were proud.

00:01:13.125 --> 00:01:15.792
Some held hope.

00:01:15.792 --> 00:01:18.750
Some cried out in anger.

00:01:19.875 --> 00:01:27.167
Then, if Wall Maria was retaken,
what would humanity cry out?

00:01:27.167 --> 00:01:32.167
Would they finally start believing
that humanity deserves to live?

00:01:32.167 --> 00:01:36.083
Advance!

00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:42.958
That our own fate is something we can decide?

00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:46.000
Will it be enough for them to believe?

00:01:47.625 --> 00:01:51.833
If only Wall Maria was retaken...

00:03:38.625 --> 00:03:39.625
Whoa!

00:03:39.625 --> 00:03:42.333
Hey! You've gotta light up the ground!

00:03:42.333 --> 00:03:44.125
S-Sorry.

00:03:44.125 --> 00:03:47.375
We're not at the foot yet? It's almost dawn.

00:03:47.375 --> 00:03:51.250
Once we're over this mountain,
Shiganshina's right there.

00:03:52.625 --> 00:03:55.292
Sorry you're stuck with my horse.

00:03:55.292 --> 00:03:57.833
You're supposed to be saving your energy.

00:03:57.833 --> 00:03:59.417
Yeah, I know.

00:03:59.417 --> 00:04:01.833
She's right. Rest up, Eren.

00:04:01.833 --> 00:04:03.500
Don't say his name, idiot.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.792
Oh, yeah, sorry.

00:04:05.792 --> 00:04:09.250
Assume this place is swarming with enemies.

00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:14.417
Titan on the left! Everyone halt!
Light up the area!

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.625
It's all right. He's fast asleep.

00:04:19.625 --> 00:04:24.542
This lad must not be one of those
new types that moves at night.

00:04:24.542 --> 00:04:27.583
That's too bad. Let him be.

00:04:33.708 --> 00:04:37.042
I can't believe we didn't
see it till that close up.

00:04:37.042 --> 00:04:39.708
Yeah, I'm with you there.

00:04:39.708 --> 00:04:43.750
This moonless night must be protecting us.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.167
Light from the moon is reflected sunlight.

00:04:47.167 --> 00:04:48.708
The new type of Titan...

00:04:48.708 --> 00:04:54.083
We think they use that minuscule
amount of reflected light to move.

00:04:54.083 --> 00:04:57.292
Using the new moon was the right move.

00:04:57.292 --> 00:05:01.583
There's no guarantee we won't
have a repeat of before.

00:05:01.583 --> 00:05:06.542
That lad may be one of those
"Moonlight Titans" for all we know.

00:05:06.542 --> 00:05:09.583
Hope we capture one someday!

00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:18.708
I'm shaking?

00:05:19.667 --> 00:05:23.083
Why? What am I so scared of?

00:05:24.333 --> 00:05:25.958
Shit...

00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:30.625
If I screw up retaking Wall Maria
because I'm like this, what then?!

00:05:30.625 --> 00:05:33.500
How many people will lose hope forever?

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.458
There won't be a chance like this ever again!

00:05:37.458 --> 00:05:40.833
Am I not cut out for it after all?

00:05:40.833 --> 00:05:45.250
Someone like me? How can I save humanity?

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.750
Someone like me? How?

00:05:50.208 --> 00:05:51.500
Eren...

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.708
What are you shaking for? Are you scared?

00:05:55.708 --> 00:05:57.958
Huh?! I'm not scared!

00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:01.542
Huh? You're kidding... Look at your hand.

00:06:01.542 --> 00:06:06.375
This is... It's cold!
My hand's damn freezing!

00:06:06.375 --> 00:06:11.750
Really? My entire body's been
shaking this whole time.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.042
See?

00:06:16.458 --> 00:06:19.875
Eren, have you ever been afraid of Titans?

00:06:21.125 --> 00:06:24.250
Normally, everyone's terrified of them.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:30.958
Like me... The first time I faced a Titan,
I couldn't move a muscle.

00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:33.833
But... there I was...

00:06:33.833 --> 00:06:37.708
And you pulled me right out of a Titan's mouth.

00:06:37.708 --> 00:06:41.250
How were you able to do something like that?

00:06:45.083 --> 00:06:47.083
I remembered...

00:06:47.083 --> 00:06:49.917
...the time you showed me that book.

00:06:51.083 --> 00:06:56.458
Up until then, I never once thought
about what was outside the walls.

00:06:56.458 --> 00:07:00.333
I just spent every day
staring at the clouds and sky.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:06.542
But then, I heard your story
and looked into your eyes.

00:07:08.125 --> 00:07:11.083
You were seeing an awesome dream.

00:07:11.083 --> 00:07:12.875
But I had nothing.

00:07:13.875 --> 00:07:16.542
That's when I knew.

00:07:16.542 --> 00:07:19.667
I wasn't free.

00:07:19.667 --> 00:07:26.292
Trapped in a small cage in a huge world,
my freedom stolen by those unthinkable fiends.

00:07:26.292 --> 00:07:30.000
When I realized that, I couldn't forgive them.

00:07:31.208 --> 00:07:36.792
I don't know why, but when it
comes to taking back freedom...

00:07:36.792 --> 00:07:40.750
Yes... Strength flows through me.

00:07:43.292 --> 00:07:45.083
Thanks for that.

00:07:45.083 --> 00:07:46.375
I'm good now.

00:07:46.375 --> 00:07:48.042
Mmm.

00:07:48.042 --> 00:07:53.375
I bet, by this time next year,
we'll be looking at the sea.

00:07:57.583 --> 00:08:00.333
I recognize this area.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:06.125
I think... we came here for firewood.

00:08:09.167 --> 00:08:11.792
I can see the foot!

00:08:11.792 --> 00:08:13.708
There're signs of a trail!

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.375
It's so close.

00:08:18.375 --> 00:08:20.417
I can hear the river.

00:08:20.417 --> 00:08:23.708
Finally, we're back...

00:08:25.333 --> 00:08:28.875
The first time... since we fled from here.

00:08:30.167 --> 00:08:32.542
Back to our hometown...

00:08:49.458 --> 00:08:53.042
Be on guard for Titans hiding in the shadows!

00:08:53.042 --> 00:08:55.417
Our operation begins now!

00:08:55.417 --> 00:08:58.750
All troops, switch to ODM gear!

00:09:07.042 --> 00:09:11.458
There're two gates we must seal--
the inner and outer.

00:09:11.458 --> 00:09:13.750
With that, Shiganshina will be isolated.

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:16.250
We'll exterminate any Titans left inside.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:21.292
If the enemy knows our plan,
they'll go straight after Eren, but...

00:09:26.083 --> 00:09:31.583
We'll have hoods covering the faces
of all 100 of our soldiers.

00:09:31.583 --> 00:09:36.500
By the time they find out who Eren is,
we'll have the outer gate plugged.

00:09:50.083 --> 00:09:52.000
Don't stop!

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.500
Head for the outer gate!

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:55.625
Roger!

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.250
This is...

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:04.167
...the remains of a fire?

00:10:07.958 --> 00:10:11.250
They're here... and close!

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.292
Bertholdt and Reiner!

00:10:20.625 --> 00:10:23.417
My house is right around there.

00:10:23.417 --> 00:10:27.375
That's where... we left everything behind.

00:10:34.708 --> 00:10:37.792
It's okay, I'll take it all back!

00:10:41.667 --> 00:10:44.333
This is all too strange...

00:10:44.333 --> 00:10:47.292
Not a single Titan in sight?

00:10:47.292 --> 00:10:49.125
But we have to keep going.

00:10:49.125 --> 00:10:52.708
Yeah, there's no reason to call it off.

00:10:59.167 --> 00:11:02.958
I can do this! No...

00:11:02.958 --> 00:11:05.792
We can do this!

00:11:05.792 --> 00:11:11.500
Because we've all been special
since the day we were born!

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.500
We're free!

00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:37.958
"Ore harvested from the Reiss family's underground
cavern. Thought to be produced by some sort
of Titan power. It emits more light than a torch,
and can greatly extend nighttime operations."

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.042
Don't let your guard down!

00:12:07.042 --> 00:12:08.375
Keep on the lookout!

00:12:08.375 --> 00:12:09.583
Roger!

00:12:11.875 --> 00:12:12.833
Eren!

00:12:12.833 --> 00:12:15.083
How's your ODM gear?

00:12:15.083 --> 00:12:16.583
It's fine.

00:12:16.583 --> 00:12:19.708
But I did manage to lose my cloak.

00:12:24.833 --> 00:12:26.250
Thanks.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:28.000
Mmm.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.167
The hole?!

00:12:30.167 --> 00:12:31.625
Success!

00:12:32.667 --> 00:12:34.667
It's plugged all right!

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:40.333
We did it!

00:12:40.333 --> 00:12:41.750
Eren, you okay?

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:43.250
No problems here.

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:45.042
I'm ready like we trained.

00:12:45.042 --> 00:12:46.875
We'll head for the inner gate!

00:12:46.875 --> 00:12:50.500
While we're on the move,
remember to hide your faces!

00:12:53.375 --> 00:12:57.500
I really plugged the hole? And that easily...?

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.125
You did it.

00:12:59.125 --> 00:13:01.208
Believe in your own power.

00:13:04.042 --> 00:13:06.083
The hole from then...

00:13:08.833 --> 00:13:10.500
Not yet!

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:15.250
No matter how much you plug it,
they'll break the wall as long as they live.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:18.875
Until we kill Reiner, Bertholdt,
and any other enemies,

00:13:18.875 --> 00:13:21.792
the operation to retake Wall Maria won't end.

00:13:21.792 --> 00:13:24.292
Of course... I know that!

00:13:26.375 --> 00:13:29.250
The outer gate was a success.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:31.750
Still, it's odd...

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:33.917
There's no attack coming.

00:13:33.917 --> 00:13:38.958
On the contrary, we've not seen
a single Titan so far.

00:13:38.958 --> 00:13:42.542
Were they not prepared for our sudden assault?

00:13:42.542 --> 00:13:44.375
We can only hope, but...

00:13:44.375 --> 00:13:46.917
Considering what Arlelt discovered...

00:13:46.917 --> 00:13:48.792
Hmm?

00:13:48.792 --> 00:13:50.375
I looked into it.

00:13:50.375 --> 00:13:53.833
I'm pretty sure someone was camping.

00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:58.000
The pot was cold and lights
were scattered on the ground.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.833
They were drinking something like black tea.

00:14:02.375 --> 00:14:06.125
Smells good... What is this drink?

00:14:06.125 --> 00:14:10.583
Also, there were three cups
with drops of a black liquid in it.

00:14:10.583 --> 00:14:13.625
At the least, there were
three people atop the wall.

00:14:13.625 --> 00:14:15.958
Th-Three, you say?!

00:14:15.958 --> 00:14:18.375
Was the metal pot completely cool?

00:14:18.375 --> 00:14:19.292
Yes.

00:14:19.292 --> 00:14:20.625
I find that odd.

00:14:20.625 --> 00:14:21.542
Agreed.

00:14:21.542 --> 00:14:24.333
Th-The pot?

00:14:24.333 --> 00:14:29.875
We charged here at full speed
using horses and ODM gear.

00:14:29.875 --> 00:14:34.250
Had they noticed our approach
by sound or by sight,

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:36.917
they'd have two minutes to react.

00:14:36.917 --> 00:14:41.167
A pot in use wouldn't cool in just two minutes.

00:14:41.167 --> 00:14:45.458
They had to have known we were
coming for five minutes or more.

00:14:45.458 --> 00:14:49.083
Meaning they've had plenty
of time to prepare for us.

00:14:49.083 --> 00:14:51.292
But... how?

00:14:51.292 --> 00:14:56.125
Th-There must be a scout in addition
to the three on the wall...

00:14:56.125 --> 00:15:01.000
No, we have to assume there are
many more enemies in hiding.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.208
For now, locating the enemy is our priority.

00:15:04.208 --> 00:15:05.500
Arlelt...

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:10.042
With that brain of yours, you've saved
us from disaster countless times.

00:15:10.042 --> 00:15:13.333
Right now is one of those times we need you.

00:15:13.333 --> 00:15:15.250
Huh?

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:17.333
Take as many soldiers as needed.

00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:20.625
Find out if enemies are hiding
near the inner gate or not.

00:15:22.917 --> 00:15:26.417
As of now, you obey Armin Arlelt's commands.

00:15:26.417 --> 00:15:28.417
Continue the search!

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:33.833
R...

00:15:33.833 --> 00:15:35.000
Roger!

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.083
We searched the wall thoroughly!

00:15:37.083 --> 00:15:39.375
What are your orders, Arlelt?!

00:15:41.333 --> 00:15:43.667
Send one group to each side of the wall!

00:15:43.667 --> 00:15:46.292
Search all the buildings near the inner gate!

00:15:46.292 --> 00:15:49.000
Report any findings with an acoustic shell!

00:15:50.333 --> 00:15:53.500
A-All right?

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:54.833
Roger!

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:00.750
Another big gamble of yours?

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:03.792
No, he's proven himself.

00:16:03.792 --> 00:16:07.042
He's one of our greatest weapons.

00:16:07.042 --> 00:16:09.750
Eren's coming to plug the inner gate.

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.167
What now?

00:16:11.167 --> 00:16:14.125
Pause the operation until we find the enemy?

00:16:15.917 --> 00:16:18.083
We continue.

00:16:18.083 --> 00:16:21.458
We'll lose a prolonged battle
in enemy territory.

00:16:21.458 --> 00:16:25.833
For us, our only chance
is with a decisive battle.

00:16:25.833 --> 00:16:32.083
Besides, if this is all according to the
enemy's plan, we'll just have to live with it.

00:16:32.083 --> 00:16:36.875
In any case, they're not the
only ones hiding something.

00:16:43.458 --> 00:16:45.708
What do I do?

00:16:45.708 --> 00:16:49.125
Eren's coming to seal the inner gate...

00:16:49.125 --> 00:16:51.750
And we don't know where the enemy's at!

00:16:52.875 --> 00:16:56.917
Why haven't they shown
even though we plugged the wall?

00:16:56.917 --> 00:17:00.750
Why can't we find them
no matter how much we search?

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:03.167
This is bad... What now?

00:17:03.167 --> 00:17:06.833
If we fail... that'll really be the end!

00:17:06.833 --> 00:17:09.708
It's over. Everything...

00:17:09.708 --> 00:17:14.292
They always attack us in unthinkable
ways we always fail to predict.

00:17:14.292 --> 00:17:16.667
We're always at a disadvantage because...

00:17:16.667 --> 00:17:20.083
...we simply know nothing about Titans!

00:17:21.042 --> 00:17:22.625
Always...?

00:17:38.917 --> 00:17:40.542
Did you find them, Arlelt?!

00:17:40.542 --> 00:17:41.500
Where are they?!

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.458
Not yet! Everyone search the walls!

00:17:44.458 --> 00:17:46.375
I told you we already did!

00:17:46.375 --> 00:17:48.000
There's nowhere to hide!

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.625
Inside the walls!

00:17:50.917 --> 00:17:52.333
Inside the walls?

00:17:52.333 --> 00:17:53.417
Yes!

00:17:53.417 --> 00:17:57.500
There must be a spot where someone
could stay inside for a long time!

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.417
How do you know that?!

00:18:02.167 --> 00:18:03.417
It's a hunch.

00:18:04.375 --> 00:18:07.708
Do you have any idea what
sort of situation we're in?!

00:18:07.708 --> 00:18:10.125
We don't have time to waste on hunches!

00:18:10.125 --> 00:18:11.792
Think about it!

00:18:11.792 --> 00:18:16.458
The enemy always attacks us using
Titan powers in ways we never imagine!

00:18:16.458 --> 00:18:19.500
If we constrain ourselves to
common sense and reason,

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.542
we'll never be able to gain the upper hand!

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.250
The signal to halt the mission!

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:36.125
All troops, scatter and stand by atop the wall!

00:18:36.125 --> 00:18:37.458
Roger!

00:18:39.208 --> 00:18:42.833
There are times to be strict
and times to be flexible.

00:18:42.833 --> 00:18:47.125
Adhere to the principles you vowed
while giving everything you've got.

00:18:47.125 --> 00:18:49.333
Obey the chain of command.

00:18:49.333 --> 00:18:52.375
The reason we are here is to claim victory!

00:18:54.917 --> 00:18:57.792
Break into two groups again
and search the surface!

00:18:57.792 --> 00:18:59.750
Especially above the gate!

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:01.583
Commence the search!

00:19:02.625 --> 00:19:03.500
Rog...

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:04.875
Roger!

00:19:12.333 --> 00:19:14.375
What are they doing?

00:19:14.375 --> 00:19:17.208
Should we really be waiting like this?

00:19:17.208 --> 00:19:21.042
Yeah, so much for our surprise attack...

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.500
Armin... Did you figure something out?

00:19:33.542 --> 00:19:38.167
A position to react, no matter
when Eren appears...

00:19:38.167 --> 00:19:41.208
A position able to see everything...

00:19:41.208 --> 00:19:45.500
If there is such a place,
it has to be in the walls.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:49.875
If the enemy has no idea we know
about the Titans in the walls,

00:19:49.875 --> 00:19:53.167
and they think we'll never see it coming...

00:19:53.167 --> 00:19:54.500
Or possibly...?

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:04.125
Here! There's a cavity here!

00:20:16.167 --> 00:20:17.500
Reiner!

00:20:35.542 --> 00:20:36.500
Shit!

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:37.125
--Captain?!

00:20:37.125 --> 00:20:37.792
--Is that another Titan power?!
--Captain?!

00:20:37.792 --> 00:20:39.042
--Is that another Titan power?!

00:20:39.042 --> 00:20:42.458
So close! But I couldn't finish 'em!

00:21:00.375 --> 00:21:02.458
Keep on the lookout!

00:21:02.458 --> 00:21:04.375
Locate his allies!

00:21:40.167 --> 00:21:41.917
Boulder incoming!

00:21:41.917 --> 00:21:43.875
Get down!

00:21:48.292 --> 00:21:49.417
What the--?!

00:21:49.417 --> 00:21:51.125
Did he miss?

00:21:51.125 --> 00:21:55.000
No... That was good aim.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.167
He plugged the entrance.
Now the horses can't pass.

00:22:00.167 --> 00:22:02.583
They'll aim for the horses and surround us...

00:22:02.583 --> 00:22:07.167
...in order to block our escape
and annihilate us here.

00:22:07.167 --> 00:22:10.042
We're both hoping for the same thing.

00:22:10.042 --> 00:22:13.167
To settle it here once and for all.

00:22:13.167 --> 00:22:15.375
Humanity or Titans?!

00:22:15.375 --> 00:22:19.542
Which side will live?! Which side will perish?!

00:23:58.125 --> 00:24:01.792
A horde of Titans appears out of nowhere.

00:24:01.792 --> 00:24:04.042
As Eren and company resolve to fight,

00:24:04.042 --> 00:24:09.458
an old friend turned enemy
appears to block their path.

00:24:09.458 --> 00:24:12.096
Next episode: "Thunder Spears."
