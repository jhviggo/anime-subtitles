WEBVTT

00:01:57.125 --> 00:01:58.667
Defend him!

00:01:58.667 --> 00:02:01.292
Even if it costs us our lives...

00:02:01.292 --> 00:02:03.833
...we <i>must </i>let Eren reach the gate!

00:02:03.833 --> 00:02:07.250
Do <i>not </i>let the Titans get near him!

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.125
They're going to plug the hole
with that? It's insane...

00:02:12.125 --> 00:02:14.292
Eren might end up getting eaten.

00:02:14.292 --> 00:02:17.625
And if that happens,
we still won't know a thing.

00:02:17.625 --> 00:02:22.417
Yeah... If it comes to it, I'll have to do
something with my Titan somehow.

00:02:22.417 --> 00:02:26.917
But if their plan works, it'll plug
the hole we finally opened.

00:02:26.917 --> 00:02:28.625
It doesn't matter.

00:02:28.625 --> 00:02:33.292
We've been searching for a clue these
past five years and we finally found it.

00:02:33.292 --> 00:02:35.875
Hey... you guys?

00:02:35.875 --> 00:02:39.542
What... were you just talking about?

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.333
What did you mean by "my Titan," Reiner?

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:50.250
What's this about "The hole
we opened," Bertholdt?

00:02:53.208 --> 00:02:54.750
Marco...

00:02:56.583 --> 00:03:00.292
That conversation just now... was a joke.

00:03:01.875 --> 00:03:05.542
H-Have you guys lost it? This isn't like you!

00:03:05.542 --> 00:03:07.375
Focus on the mission!

00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:10.167
Look, the Titans are coming! Let's go!

00:03:19.292 --> 00:03:22.708
Eren transformed into a Titan...

00:03:22.708 --> 00:03:25.792
Humans can become Titans...

00:03:25.792 --> 00:03:30.792
So if the Colossal Titan appeared out
of nowhere and suddenly vanished...

00:03:30.792 --> 00:03:33.333
...it's probably a human, too.

00:03:34.833 --> 00:03:39.667
In other words, the enemy Titans
are hiding as humans somewhere.

00:03:39.667 --> 00:03:41.250
That means...

00:03:44.708 --> 00:03:45.542
Reiner!

00:03:45.542 --> 00:03:48.917
R-Reiner! What are you doing?!

00:03:48.917 --> 00:03:50.250
Reiner?!

00:03:51.208 --> 00:03:53.042
This is a joke, right?!

00:03:53.042 --> 00:03:58.833
No, Marco... The problem
is you're too damn sharp.

00:03:58.833 --> 00:04:00.542
Someone help--!

00:04:05.292 --> 00:04:08.167
Annie! Help me out!

00:04:08.167 --> 00:04:10.042
What's this all about?

00:04:10.042 --> 00:04:13.042
Reiner's acting crazy! Help me!

00:04:13.042 --> 00:04:17.292
He heard our conversation.
We can't let him live.

00:04:19.208 --> 00:04:22.042
You're shitting me... You asshole!

00:04:22.042 --> 00:04:23.208
What?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.833
A Titan! It's coming this way!

00:04:29.333 --> 00:04:32.708
Annie! Take off Marco's ODM gear!

00:04:32.708 --> 00:04:33.958
Huh?!

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.583
Do it, fast!

00:04:36.583 --> 00:04:38.750
Why... do I have to?

00:04:40.167 --> 00:04:44.583
Back there, you risked your
life for Conny, didn't you?

00:04:44.583 --> 00:04:47.708
Why did you put yourself in danger?

00:04:47.708 --> 00:04:51.292
Have you become attached to
this evil race or something?

00:04:51.292 --> 00:04:54.667
If I'm wrong, prove it to me right now!

00:04:54.667 --> 00:04:58.167
If you, and your father waiting
for you to come home,

00:04:58.167 --> 00:05:02.167
are any different than this
filthy race, prove it right now!

00:05:02.167 --> 00:05:04.708
Reiner! It's almost on top of us!

00:05:04.708 --> 00:05:06.042
Annie!

00:05:10.792 --> 00:05:13.792
Stop it! Annie! Don't do this!

00:05:13.792 --> 00:05:17.333
Why?! Why?! Why?! Why do this?!

00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:18.875
Annie!

00:05:21.125 --> 00:05:23.167
This is what makes us warriors.

00:05:23.167 --> 00:05:25.792
Annie, you did well.

00:05:27.417 --> 00:05:29.667
Reiner. What now?

00:05:29.667 --> 00:05:32.750
Not yet. We have to let them gather first.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.708
I see... They were waiting
for all the Titans to gather...

00:05:42.125 --> 00:05:44.125
Wait...

00:05:44.125 --> 00:05:48.958
Why? What are you in such a hurry for?!

00:05:50.667 --> 00:05:54.125
We haven't... even...

00:05:54.125 --> 00:05:59.542
...had a chance to talk this through!

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:16.667
Hey...

00:06:16.667 --> 00:06:18.083
Why...

00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:26.042
...is Marco...

00:06:26.042 --> 00:06:27.958
...getting eaten?

00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.875
I already told you...

00:06:34.875 --> 00:06:37.667
Annie is doing fine, I'm sure.

00:06:37.667 --> 00:06:40.708
There's no way she's getting tortured.

00:06:40.708 --> 00:06:43.917
For starters, don't you think that's unlikely?

00:06:43.917 --> 00:06:49.708
With powers like ours, one scratch and
we can pretty much handle anything.

00:06:49.708 --> 00:06:52.667
And remember, it's Annie
we're talking about here.

00:06:52.667 --> 00:06:57.292
I bet she's in hiding somewhere
practicing her kicks and whatnot.

00:06:57.292 --> 00:07:01.000
Still, there's no mistaking
her identity was revealed.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.833
Even if it's Annie...

00:07:02.833 --> 00:07:07.375
Oh? Does this mean you're
not fully committed yet?

00:07:07.375 --> 00:07:08.792
Is that right?

00:07:08.792 --> 00:07:14.083
And what about the agreement
we came to? Was that all for nothing?

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.500
We can go at it again if you want, Reiner.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.542
But the next time you lose, you give up
your armor to another warrior.

00:07:23.542 --> 00:07:26.625
N-No, that's not what I meant.

00:07:26.625 --> 00:07:28.792
Then pull yourself together.

00:07:28.792 --> 00:07:31.125
We only have one goal.

00:07:31.125 --> 00:07:36.125
To recover the Coordinate and
put an end to this cursed history.

00:07:37.875 --> 00:07:40.417
Let's... end this.

00:07:42.458 --> 00:07:46.292
I want to end all this, with us.

00:07:47.417 --> 00:07:52.292
Understood. I'll try to keep
Annie out of my head for now.

00:07:52.292 --> 00:07:56.375
There's no need to put anyone
else through this hell but us.

00:07:57.792 --> 00:07:59.125
Let's...

00:08:02.833 --> 00:08:04.625
...end this.

00:08:06.042 --> 00:08:07.875
Bertholdt...

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:12.417
War Chief Zeke.

00:08:14.792 --> 00:08:17.333
Enemy troops are approaching.

00:08:17.333 --> 00:08:19.375
They've reached the foot.

00:08:23.292 --> 00:08:25.667
My brave warriors.

00:08:25.667 --> 00:08:30.542
It's time to settle this here and
finish our mission once and for all.

00:08:33.417 --> 00:08:34.542
Hot!

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:41.708
--Let's go.

00:08:41.708 --> 00:08:42.833
--Yeah.
--Let's go.

00:08:47.167 --> 00:08:48.458
Bertholdt.

00:08:48.458 --> 00:08:50.667
I've told you a bunch of times, but...

00:08:50.667 --> 00:08:53.417
You and I will be in separate positions.

00:08:53.417 --> 00:08:55.833
So try thinking on your own for once.

00:08:55.833 --> 00:08:58.042
R-Right.

00:08:58.042 --> 00:09:00.625
You don't always have to wait for my signal.

00:09:00.625 --> 00:09:03.250
Yeah, I know.

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:06.792
You're supposed to be the one
with the greatest ability of all,

00:09:06.792 --> 00:09:09.792
yet you leave it to others when it matters.

00:09:09.792 --> 00:09:13.417
To be honest, I never thought you reliable.

00:09:13.417 --> 00:09:15.333
I know.

00:09:15.333 --> 00:09:17.208
Up until now.

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:22.708
We're ending this here, right?

00:09:22.708 --> 00:09:24.250
That's right.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:26.792
We're gonna win and end this.

00:09:28.917 --> 00:09:32.125
Keep up that attitude till
you're with your beloved Annie.

00:09:32.125 --> 00:09:34.500
I-It's not like that...

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:39.208
I bet even Annie would appreciate
the one who rushes in to save her...

00:09:39.208 --> 00:09:41.917
...and mistake him for her prince.

00:09:41.917 --> 00:09:44.625
Even if it's you.

00:09:44.625 --> 00:09:47.583
And... Christa...

00:09:47.583 --> 00:09:49.875
We'll save her no matter what.

00:09:49.875 --> 00:09:52.125
That's our promise to Ymir.

00:09:52.125 --> 00:09:54.625
Yeah, no matter what.

00:09:56.583 --> 00:09:59.333
See ya. I'm counting on you, buddy.

00:09:59.333 --> 00:10:00.917
Leave it to me.

00:10:11.292 --> 00:10:14.833
It's been a while since Reiner transformed...

00:10:14.833 --> 00:10:16.417
No signal yet?

00:10:16.417 --> 00:10:21.042
Reiner... Are you okay out there?

00:10:21.042 --> 00:10:23.375
We did it!

00:10:23.375 --> 00:10:25.292
We blew his head off!

00:10:25.292 --> 00:10:28.000
The Armored Titan bit the dust!

00:10:31.125 --> 00:10:32.583
We did it...

00:10:32.583 --> 00:10:35.708
You were such a pain in the ass for us.

00:10:35.708 --> 00:10:38.375
Serves you right, scumbag!

00:10:46.125 --> 00:10:48.042
What the hell are you crying for?!

00:10:48.042 --> 00:10:51.208
C'mon, get up! This ain't over yet!

00:10:52.917 --> 00:10:56.000
Don't cry! We're the ones who killed him!

00:11:00.042 --> 00:11:04.083
It's not over! Ready your equipment
for the next round!

00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:10.458
Armin...

00:11:10.458 --> 00:11:14.375
It's not like... we had
any chance to negotiate...

00:11:15.333 --> 00:11:20.667
It's our side dealing with the
overwhelming lack of information.

00:11:20.667 --> 00:11:25.667
We don't have the power to capture
someone who can turn into a Titan.

00:11:25.667 --> 00:11:29.125
There was... nothing we could do.

00:11:47.208 --> 00:11:48.417
It can't be...

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:55.083
There it was! The signal!

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.375
Nail him with Thunder Spears!
We'll just have to blow his body to bits!

00:12:08.375 --> 00:12:10.833
That scream just now...

00:12:10.833 --> 00:12:12.792
Was it for Bertholdt?

00:12:16.375 --> 00:12:19.750
Wait! We need to get away from Reiner!

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:22.458
Up there! The Colossal Titan is coming!

00:12:22.458 --> 00:12:25.292
We'll all get blown away!

00:12:25.292 --> 00:12:27.958
Where are you, Reiner?! I'm coming!

00:12:27.958 --> 00:12:32.958
"Dark Liquid"
"Believed to be a beverage consumed by the Titan shifters
while they were camping out. Its origin is unknown,
but this suggests the existence of an 'outside' culture."

00:12:34.292 --> 00:12:35.542
Tsk!

00:12:38.542 --> 00:12:40.083
They got us...

00:12:40.083 --> 00:12:43.292
Shit! Everyone, get away
from the Armored Titan!

00:12:43.292 --> 00:12:46.458
The Colossal Titan is falling our way!

00:12:49.542 --> 00:12:52.292
Shoot! At this distance...

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:55.375
...none of us can avoid it.

00:12:58.708 --> 00:13:00.500
I'm close to the ground.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.917
It's now or never. I'll blow
this whole place away.

00:13:15.875 --> 00:13:18.542
Reiner!

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:24.667
Reiner?!

00:13:26.583 --> 00:13:28.250
Reiner?

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:35.042
He's alive!

00:13:35.042 --> 00:13:37.375
But he...

00:13:37.375 --> 00:13:42.458
He transferred his consciousness
throughout his whole nervous system?

00:13:42.458 --> 00:13:46.042
But that was... a last resort.

00:13:46.042 --> 00:13:48.583
To think he'd actually do it...

00:13:49.833 --> 00:13:52.958
It's hard to believe they
cornered you like that.

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.333
Reiner...

00:13:58.125 --> 00:14:00.958
I need you to do something for me.

00:14:00.958 --> 00:14:03.583
You're going to have to move a little.

00:14:04.583 --> 00:14:07.250
And if you can't, I'm sorry...

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:09.167
Prepare for the worst.

00:14:14.708 --> 00:14:16.417
I'm ending this.

00:14:19.667 --> 00:14:24.208
In any case, our mission objective
just came falling into our laps.

00:14:24.208 --> 00:14:26.958
You could even call this lucky.

00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:29.375
Target approaching from ahead!

00:14:29.375 --> 00:14:31.500
It's Bertholdt!

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.417
Our plan is as follows:

00:14:33.417 --> 00:14:36.625
Levi Squad protects Eren
under Armin's command!

00:14:36.625 --> 00:14:39.917
All others work together to
take down the two targets!

00:14:39.917 --> 00:14:41.000
Roger!

00:14:43.417 --> 00:14:44.917
Please wait!

00:14:44.917 --> 00:14:46.083
Armin?

00:14:46.083 --> 00:14:49.000
This is our final chance to negotiate!

00:14:54.375 --> 00:14:57.333
Bertholdt! Stop right there!

00:15:01.417 --> 00:15:03.083
Armin...

00:15:03.083 --> 00:15:05.750
What are you trying to accomplish?

00:15:07.583 --> 00:15:11.375
Bertholdt! Let's talk this over!

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:20.458
If I agree to talk, would you all agree to die?!

00:15:20.458 --> 00:15:23.250
We only want two simple things!

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:27.333
We want Eren and the demise
of humanity in the walls!

00:15:27.333 --> 00:15:31.667
That's the harsh truth of reality, Armin!

00:15:31.667 --> 00:15:34.167
It's all been decided already!

00:15:34.167 --> 00:15:39.125
Wha--? Wh-Who decided any of that?!

00:15:39.125 --> 00:15:40.292
I did...

00:15:40.292 --> 00:15:41.792
Huh?

00:15:41.792 --> 00:15:43.167
What was that?!

00:15:43.167 --> 00:15:44.708
I decided it!

00:15:44.708 --> 00:15:47.750
Your lives are coming to an end right here!

00:15:49.167 --> 00:15:51.375
That's very unfortunate!

00:15:51.375 --> 00:15:55.792
I was hoping... I wouldn't have to
hear Annie's screams any longer!

00:15:57.458 --> 00:16:01.208
The only one who can save her from
the savages in the Military Police...

00:16:01.208 --> 00:16:03.500
...is you, and no one else!

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.792
At this rate, she'll end up
as feed for the pigs!

00:16:05.792 --> 00:16:06.917
Fine by me!

00:16:06.917 --> 00:16:07.958
Huh?

00:16:08.958 --> 00:16:10.875
Let 'em feed her to the pigs!

00:16:10.875 --> 00:16:14.250
If they really have her, that is!

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:17.750
What's the rush, Armin?
Aren't we going to talk?

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:26.042
Did you think that if you talked
about Annie, I'd lose my cool again?

00:16:26.042 --> 00:16:31.500
That since I'm the meek and timid Bertholdt,
you could fool me into letting my guard down?

00:16:33.792 --> 00:16:36.750
Stand down, Eren. You should know.

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:39.625
You've got a slim chance against him.

00:16:39.625 --> 00:16:41.917
This isn't your fight yet.

00:16:41.917 --> 00:16:45.583
Shit... Armin, why?!

00:16:45.583 --> 00:16:49.708
I know what you're doing.
You're just buying time.

00:16:49.708 --> 00:16:52.208
Surrounding me with soldiers...

00:16:52.208 --> 00:16:56.375
...and distracting me with this ruse
while the others finish off Reiner!

00:16:56.375 --> 00:16:57.875
I can tell.

00:16:57.875 --> 00:17:03.208
You're standing there shaking
so much, you can't do a damn thing.

00:17:03.208 --> 00:17:07.042
If you knew that much,
why did you even come talk?

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:11.208
I wanted to know.

00:17:11.208 --> 00:17:18.917
To know whether, if I faced you guys,
I'd start whining and beg for forgiveness again.

00:17:18.917 --> 00:17:20.125
But...

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.208
...seems like I'm fine now.

00:17:24.208 --> 00:17:30.500
Yeah. You are precious comrades to me.
I also intend to kill you.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:35.333
Is that... because you think
we're spawn of the devil?

00:17:35.333 --> 00:17:36.500
No.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:40.750
None of you have done anything wrong,
and you're not devils either.

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:43.833
But you all still have to die.

00:17:43.833 --> 00:17:45.708
That's just how it is.

00:17:51.792 --> 00:17:52.917
Mikasa!

00:18:00.167 --> 00:18:03.000
Armin! Don't chase!

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.625
There's no knowing when he'll transform.

00:18:05.625 --> 00:18:09.667
If we don't keep our distance,
we'll get caught in another explosion.

00:18:09.667 --> 00:18:12.583
I don't think Bertholdt intends to just yet.

00:18:12.583 --> 00:18:18.000
Reiner's on the verge of death,
so if he did, he'd finish Reiner off.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.208
We could take Reiner as a hostage
and fight him straight on with swords.

00:18:22.208 --> 00:18:24.792
We should, but...

00:18:24.792 --> 00:18:29.458
It seemed like he had some sort of plan though.

00:18:29.458 --> 00:18:33.417
Still, was that really Bertholdt just now?

00:18:33.417 --> 00:18:37.250
To me, he seemed like a different person.

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:38.750
Me, too.

00:18:40.042 --> 00:18:42.542
Hurry! The Armored Titan is weak!

00:18:42.542 --> 00:18:44.917
Let's finish him off!

00:18:44.917 --> 00:18:46.542
Wha--?

00:18:46.542 --> 00:18:48.542
He's facing upwards now?!

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:51.542
We can't finish him off!

00:18:52.625 --> 00:18:55.000
This is a very strange feeling...

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.417
I don't feel that scared at all.

00:18:57.417 --> 00:18:59.833
I can see everything clearly.

00:18:59.833 --> 00:19:05.375
I feel like, no matter how this all plays out,
I can accept whatever happens.

00:19:05.375 --> 00:19:08.292
That's right, nobody's in the wrong.

00:19:08.292 --> 00:19:10.417
There's nothing we could do.

00:19:12.167 --> 00:19:13.875
Because this world...

00:19:14.875 --> 00:19:16.708
...is just...

00:19:16.708 --> 00:19:18.542
...that cruel.

00:19:18.542 --> 00:19:20.417
He's going up! Don't tell me...

00:19:20.417 --> 00:19:23.083
But I thought Reiner was right over there!

00:19:23.083 --> 00:19:24.958
Quick, get out of here!

00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:27.917
Hange!

00:20:01.292 --> 00:20:02.708
You guys alive?!

00:20:02.708 --> 00:20:05.083
I don't know! Are you?!

00:20:05.083 --> 00:20:08.292
I-I'm hanging in there...

00:20:08.292 --> 00:20:10.750
Mikasa! Armin!

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:11.792
You okay?!

00:20:11.792 --> 00:20:13.167
We're fine.

00:20:13.167 --> 00:20:14.542
Hange Squad?

00:20:15.708 --> 00:20:18.250
They were so close to Bertholdt...

00:20:31.792 --> 00:20:33.458
You don't think...

00:20:39.042 --> 00:20:41.375
...the only ones who survived...

00:20:41.375 --> 00:20:43.208
...are us here?

00:20:51.792 --> 00:20:53.583
H-Hey...

00:20:59.583 --> 00:21:01.333
Armin! What now?!

00:21:01.333 --> 00:21:04.583
Wait for burning houses to flatten us?!

00:21:04.583 --> 00:21:05.875
Armin.

00:21:05.875 --> 00:21:09.125
You're in command. We follow your orders.

00:21:11.458 --> 00:21:13.333
We retreat...

00:21:13.333 --> 00:21:16.375
Rally at the commander for new orders.

00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:21.000
We'll engage the Colossal Titan in a
battle of attrition as originally planned.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.458
Hold up, Armin...

00:21:22.458 --> 00:21:23.708
Huh?

00:21:23.708 --> 00:21:27.250
It'll be a disaster if we let Bertholdt
near the wall and the others.

00:21:28.417 --> 00:21:30.833
If the houses in the inner gate catch fire,

00:21:30.833 --> 00:21:34.375
they'll be sandwiched between
the fire and the Beast Titan.

00:21:34.375 --> 00:21:36.542
Th-That means...

00:21:36.542 --> 00:21:39.583
...we have no choice but to
defeat Bertholdt right here?

00:21:39.583 --> 00:21:43.708
And we have to do it...
with the people we have here?

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.292
A-Armin!

00:21:51.292 --> 00:21:52.958
The fire! Your orders?!

00:21:52.958 --> 00:21:54.708
Hurry it up!

00:22:10.917 --> 00:22:13.500
What will you do?

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.750
Beast Titan...

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:18.292
Is this exactly what you wanted?

00:23:58.167 --> 00:24:03.333
With the Colossal Titan's arrival,
Shiganshina becomes a blaze.

00:24:03.333 --> 00:24:09.083
Meanwhile, Erwin and the others take
a serious blow from the Beast Titan.

00:24:09.083 --> 00:24:12.096
Next episode: "Perfect Game."
