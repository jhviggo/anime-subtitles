WEBVTT

00:01:56.167 --> 00:02:00.250
At last, there's nobody here but us.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.875
Father...

00:02:01.875 --> 00:02:04.833
Sorry to make you wait.

00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:07.125
Listen, Historia...

00:02:07.125 --> 00:02:12.667
This may sound very strange to you,
but Frieda is not entirely dead.

00:02:12.667 --> 00:02:14.083
Eh?

00:02:14.083 --> 00:02:17.583
The memories of Frieda still live on.

00:02:17.583 --> 00:02:21.208
Would you like to meet your sister?

00:02:21.208 --> 00:02:22.583
Yes!

00:02:31.833 --> 00:02:33.958
Understand, Eren?!

00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:37.792
You'll be the one to avenge your mother!

00:02:49.458 --> 00:02:50.792
They got in?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.333
That's...

00:02:57.875 --> 00:02:59.250
What are those?

00:03:03.542 --> 00:03:04.750
Fire arrow?

00:03:09.417 --> 00:03:10.958
Gunpowder?!

00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:16.375
By the burning pattern, they must
have scattered bags full of oil...

00:03:16.375 --> 00:03:17.875
This could get ugly!

00:03:20.917 --> 00:03:21.917
Here they come!

00:03:21.917 --> 00:03:23.417
Shoot 'em down!

00:03:25.917 --> 00:03:27.292
Smoke signal shells?!

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:32.417
Tsk! We'll never hit a thing in all this smoke.

00:03:34.292 --> 00:03:36.125
Twenty-four.

00:03:36.125 --> 00:03:38.083
Thirty-two.

00:03:38.083 --> 00:03:39.708
Thirty-five enemies!

00:03:39.708 --> 00:03:42.458
They're gathered behind the pillars!

00:03:42.458 --> 00:03:43.833
Continue the plan!

00:03:43.833 --> 00:03:46.083
We'll take 'em all out right here!

00:03:46.083 --> 00:03:49.583
All troops, spread out!
Surround them one at a time!

00:03:58.667 --> 00:04:00.417
More smoke?!

00:04:00.417 --> 00:04:02.750
Shit! Where'd they go?!

00:04:05.375 --> 00:04:08.542
A big weakness of the
Anti-Personnel ODM gear is...

00:04:08.542 --> 00:04:14.208
...their line of fire and anchor trajectory
are both faced in the same direction.

00:04:14.208 --> 00:04:19.458
In other words, the area directly behind
them is completely out of their reach.

00:04:30.542 --> 00:04:32.583
Over there! Fire!

00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:37.625
I missed?!

00:04:37.625 --> 00:04:38.875
Where are they?!

00:04:43.875 --> 00:04:45.250
You're mine!

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:53.792
Sasha!

00:04:53.792 --> 00:04:57.167
Conny! Hide in the smoke and fight!

00:04:58.458 --> 00:04:59.792
Take this!

00:05:03.375 --> 00:05:04.625
Shit!

00:05:05.625 --> 00:05:10.042
But their greatest weakness is...
once they've fired off two shots...

00:05:11.083 --> 00:05:14.333
...it takes a while for them to reload.

00:05:18.708 --> 00:05:20.500
This ain't looking good.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.417
The hell's with that girl?!

00:05:30.625 --> 00:05:34.125
When they manage to get this close,
swords have the advantage!

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.208
We've gotta stop 'em!

00:05:44.917 --> 00:05:47.667
At this rate, we'll get wiped out!

00:05:55.875 --> 00:05:58.042
Yo, Levi.

00:05:58.042 --> 00:06:01.917
Not that I've got time to waste on you, but...

00:06:01.917 --> 00:06:05.708
If you get past here, it'll all be for nothin'.

00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:12.625
So be it. Guess I'll have to play.

00:06:12.625 --> 00:06:15.083
Neener, neener, neener!

00:06:20.875 --> 00:06:23.375
You're a spunky one, damn.

00:06:26.708 --> 00:06:27.833
Tsk!

00:06:39.625 --> 00:06:43.583
Not sick of playing yet? Good grief.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.958
Didn't I teach you?!

00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:51.667
When chasing an enemy,
don't just stare straight ahead!

00:06:56.917 --> 00:06:58.625
Over here, dimwit!

00:07:20.417 --> 00:07:22.708
You... bastard.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.625
That really hurt!

00:07:28.625 --> 00:07:32.083
If I can force one of them
to show a small opening...

00:07:38.167 --> 00:07:42.708
Huh? Both of your shots were way off!

00:07:42.708 --> 00:07:45.833
You like to live recklessly, too?!

00:07:51.167 --> 00:07:52.375
Argh!

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.083
Hange!

00:08:10.792 --> 00:08:14.750
Now! Fall back to the final defensive post!

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:16.375
Time to regroup!

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:22.708
Tsk!

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:28.500
Stay out of the way, you little runt.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.167
Ouch...

00:08:35.208 --> 00:08:36.417
Drop it!

00:08:40.833 --> 00:08:42.792
Guard the ritual, Captain!

00:08:42.792 --> 00:08:45.417
Yeah, that's where I'll be!

00:08:45.917 --> 00:08:50.917
"Syringe" "A device Rod Reiss wants Historia Reiss
to use and transform into a Titan. It is believed to
use spinal fluid, and by injecting the transformation
serum, one is granted the inherent abilities of a Titan."

00:08:53.417 --> 00:08:56.375
It seems the enemy is nearby.

00:08:56.375 --> 00:08:58.250
Let's hurry, Historia.

00:08:58.250 --> 00:08:59.458
Right.

00:09:05.292 --> 00:09:08.833
What, Eren? Why are you glaring?

00:09:08.833 --> 00:09:13.542
It's because... he has perceived his fate.

00:09:13.542 --> 00:09:18.833
That the stolen power will
return to where it belongs.

00:09:18.833 --> 00:09:20.750
Historia...

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:23.208
That means inside you.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:25.542
Eh?

00:09:28.292 --> 00:09:36.125
This cavern... It was built around 100
years ago by the power of a certain Titan.

00:09:36.125 --> 00:09:40.167
Those three walls were built by the same power.

00:09:40.167 --> 00:09:45.042
By creating those enormous walls,
humanity was protected.

00:09:45.042 --> 00:09:53.250
The power of that Titan reached out to touch
people's hearts and alter their memories.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:57.208
However, several bloodlines
were excluded from that.

00:09:57.208 --> 00:10:00.333
But their descendants and
the rest of humanity...

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:04.708
...retain no history of the
world past a century ago.

00:10:05.667 --> 00:10:09.875
Except for one, Frieda Reiss.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:15.833
Frieda possessed more
than her power as a Titan.

00:10:15.833 --> 00:10:22.875
She knew how this world came about
and all the details behind it.

00:10:22.875 --> 00:10:28.542
She was 15 years old when
that knowledge became hers.

00:10:28.542 --> 00:10:32.125
Right here, eight years ago in this very place...

00:10:32.125 --> 00:10:37.708
...after she ate her uncle, my younger brother.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.708
Frieda inherited the Founding Titan
and the memories of this world.

00:11:00.708 --> 00:11:06.625
As had been done for 100 years,
repeated and passed through generations.

00:11:10.833 --> 00:11:12.417
Father...

00:11:13.542 --> 00:11:15.083
Yes...

00:11:15.083 --> 00:11:22.167
Basically, if Frieda had just used her power,
there wouldn't have been any problems.

00:11:22.167 --> 00:11:26.583
We might have eliminated Titans
from this world entirely.

00:11:26.583 --> 00:11:31.208
If only his father hadn't stolen
the power from her.

00:11:32.333 --> 00:11:36.583
Now, that power resides within Eren.

00:11:36.583 --> 00:11:38.417
However, that power...

00:11:38.417 --> 00:11:44.292
It can't truly manifest unless the blood
of the Reiss family runs through them.

00:11:44.292 --> 00:11:48.667
As long as he remains a vessel for that power...

00:11:48.667 --> 00:11:51.708
...this hell will forever continue.

00:11:51.708 --> 00:11:53.542
Eh?

00:11:53.542 --> 00:11:55.375
Then...

00:11:55.375 --> 00:11:58.000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:11:59.375 --> 00:12:00.625
Kenny.

00:12:00.625 --> 00:12:06.125
So unless it's a Reiss who eats Eren,
they can't become a true King?

00:12:06.125 --> 00:12:07.750
That is correct.

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:14.083
Th-Then... even if I turn into a Titan
and eat Eren, it'll mean nothin'?

00:12:14.083 --> 00:12:15.375
What are you--?

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.250
Father!

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:21.917
Do you think I'm lying to you or something?

00:12:21.917 --> 00:12:23.583
Nope.

00:12:23.583 --> 00:12:30.167
I waited long for this day 'cuz I knew you
weren't lying about the succession ritual.

00:12:30.167 --> 00:12:31.708
For crying out loud!

00:12:31.708 --> 00:12:39.292
You used me this whole time knowing full well
what I was after, you sleazy playboy!

00:12:39.292 --> 00:12:41.208
I'm grateful for you.

00:12:41.208 --> 00:12:46.042
You may have been a stray dog that my
whimsical younger brother took in, but--

00:12:46.042 --> 00:12:51.458
Keep on insulting Uri, and you can
say goodbye to half of your head.

00:12:51.458 --> 00:12:53.333
Stop it!

00:12:53.333 --> 00:12:55.167
Let my father go!

00:12:56.833 --> 00:13:01.542
Huh? You're plain pitiful, Historia.

00:13:01.542 --> 00:13:03.792
Don't you get it?!

00:13:03.792 --> 00:13:10.125
This father of yours wants to turn you
into a monster and make you eat Eren.

00:13:16.375 --> 00:13:18.833
Because that's my duty.

00:13:20.458 --> 00:13:21.958
Yes...

00:13:21.958 --> 00:13:26.333
I'm going to eat Eren and bring my sister back.

00:13:26.333 --> 00:13:32.417
I'll inherit the world's history and
exterminate every last Titan!

00:13:32.417 --> 00:13:35.333
That's my duty!

00:13:37.083 --> 00:13:39.375
Hey, hey, Historia!

00:13:39.375 --> 00:13:43.292
Have you forgotten everything
this guy has done to you?

00:13:43.292 --> 00:13:47.167
The only thing he cares about
is the blood inside you.

00:13:47.167 --> 00:13:49.792
He doesn't wanna become a Titan himself!

00:13:49.792 --> 00:13:53.708
He's just trash that forces
his brother and daughter to!

00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:56.292
That's this father of yours!

00:13:58.875 --> 00:14:01.958
He's wrong, Historia...

00:14:01.958 --> 00:14:05.667
I must not become a Titan myself.

00:14:05.667 --> 00:14:10.083
Do not believe... what anyone else says...

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:15.625
Oh, is that right?

00:14:15.625 --> 00:14:16.875
Father!

00:14:20.708 --> 00:14:22.375
Kenny.

00:14:22.375 --> 00:14:25.208
You've served well up until now.

00:14:25.208 --> 00:14:27.542
You're free now.

00:14:27.542 --> 00:14:32.458
Go find another purpose in life...
and live out your years.

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:40.083
That would bore me to death.

00:14:45.833 --> 00:14:49.500
Kenny! What are you doing?

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.583
Go ahead and turn into a Titan.

00:14:51.583 --> 00:14:54.125
I won't interfere anymore.

00:14:57.667 --> 00:15:00.667
However, no head starts.

00:15:02.042 --> 00:15:05.208
You both become Titans and have at it.

00:15:05.208 --> 00:15:08.917
If Historia wins, you'll have your peace.

00:15:08.917 --> 00:15:13.542
But if you lose to Eren,
the situation stays the same.

00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:20.583
Keep drawing breath till I run out and die?

00:15:20.583 --> 00:15:23.750
Can you even call that livin'?!

00:15:24.792 --> 00:15:26.500
Historia!

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.500
With this injection, you can
become a powerful Titan!

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.458
Then you can eat him,
but in fact, it's more than that!

00:15:32.458 --> 00:15:35.667
You must bite his spine
and consume the spinal fluid!

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.417
Whoops, better step back.

00:15:42.333 --> 00:15:44.458
Hurry up, Historia!

00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:53.042
Eren, why?!

00:15:53.042 --> 00:15:55.208
Why aren't you transforming?!

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:59.917
If I become a Titan, you'll get eaten!

00:15:59.917 --> 00:16:01.542
At this rate...

00:16:06.708 --> 00:16:09.875
Do it, Historia!

00:16:09.875 --> 00:16:12.792
It shouldn't have happened...

00:16:12.792 --> 00:16:14.583
Eh?

00:16:14.583 --> 00:16:16.375
Me...

00:16:16.375 --> 00:16:18.333
My dad, too...

00:16:19.333 --> 00:16:24.333
If five years ago, he hadn't done that here...

00:16:24.333 --> 00:16:30.000
Your sister... would have been
able to do something, right?

00:16:31.083 --> 00:16:35.292
But my dad stole the Power of
the Titans from its rightful place.

00:16:35.292 --> 00:16:39.042
Just how many died for that?

00:16:39.042 --> 00:16:40.792
Armin's grandpa...

00:16:40.792 --> 00:16:45.042
Thomas, Nack, Mina, Milieus...

00:16:45.042 --> 00:16:50.542
Marco... Those guys on Squad Levi...
The people of Stohess...

00:16:50.542 --> 00:16:53.458
Those soldiers who came to save me...

00:16:53.458 --> 00:16:55.125
Mr. Hannes...

00:16:56.417 --> 00:17:00.958
I can never atone for it all.

00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:03.792
It shouldn't have happened...

00:17:03.792 --> 00:17:06.792
Those days of training...

00:17:06.792 --> 00:17:10.250
That dream beyond the walls...

00:17:12.333 --> 00:17:16.375
I... shouldn't have happened.

00:17:26.333 --> 00:17:29.958
So, at the least...

00:17:29.958 --> 00:17:33.458
...let it end at your hand.

00:17:33.458 --> 00:17:35.958
Eat me.

00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:38.458
Save humanity.

00:17:42.458 --> 00:17:45.917
It's all... up to you.

00:17:53.542 --> 00:17:55.208
Eren...

00:17:55.208 --> 00:17:57.333
That time...

00:17:57.333 --> 00:18:02.292
...when you called me a normal
person, I was so happy.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:12.208
So you're trying to do something "nice," huh?

00:18:18.375 --> 00:18:22.417
What's wrong, Historia? Are you scared?

00:18:22.417 --> 00:18:26.417
All you have to do is inject
that liquid into your body.

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.667
Father...

00:18:29.667 --> 00:18:31.750
Why?

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:35.750
Why didn't the Reiss family...
in that whole 100 years...

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:40.500
...eliminate the Titans and liberate humanity?

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:45.250
All while possessing the power
to control all the Titans...

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:54.083
Because, the first Reiss King who
built this world within the walls...

00:18:54.083 --> 00:18:58.500
...wished for us to be controlled by the Titans.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:04.125
The first King believed that was
the only path to true peace.

00:19:04.125 --> 00:19:06.917
But I do not know why.

00:19:06.917 --> 00:19:10.125
It's only known by those who
see the world's memories.

00:19:11.542 --> 00:19:13.708
Long ago, I...

00:19:13.708 --> 00:19:18.292
...along with my brother, pleaded with our
father to free humanity from the Titans...

00:19:18.292 --> 00:19:21.208
...time and time again.

00:19:21.208 --> 00:19:26.125
However, he would not fulfill our wish.

00:19:26.125 --> 00:19:30.833
Eventually, it came time for
my father to pass on that role.

00:19:30.833 --> 00:19:34.792
When my brother inherited the Power of
the Titans and I looked into his eyes...

00:19:34.792 --> 00:19:37.250
...I understood what that meant.

00:19:38.458 --> 00:19:43.333
To create this world...
To govern its very foundation...

00:19:43.333 --> 00:19:49.000
To be an omnipotent being
is to be what my brother became.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.042
Do you know what we call that?

00:19:53.125 --> 00:19:55.083
God.

00:19:55.083 --> 00:19:59.292
What we call that... is God.

00:19:59.292 --> 00:20:05.625
And my duty is to bring God back to
our world and offer them my prayers.

00:20:05.625 --> 00:20:08.542
I'm praying, Historia.

00:20:08.542 --> 00:20:12.458
For God to lead and guide humanity!

00:20:14.958 --> 00:20:16.917
Christa.

00:20:16.917 --> 00:20:22.167
I have no right to tell you
how to live your life.

00:20:22.167 --> 00:20:27.250
So actually, this is nothing more
than a hope of mine...

00:20:30.792 --> 00:20:34.250
I want you... to live a life you're proud of.

00:20:48.042 --> 00:20:50.250
Historia!

00:20:54.833 --> 00:21:00.375
God, my ass! You're just giving yourself
an out and manipulating other people!

00:21:00.375 --> 00:21:04.333
I've had it! I won't let you kill me!

00:21:10.458 --> 00:21:14.375
That's the spirit! This is gettin' good!

00:21:16.042 --> 00:21:18.500
What are you doing, Historia?!

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:19.958
Eren, we're leaving.

00:21:19.958 --> 00:21:21.958
Hey, stop it!

00:21:21.958 --> 00:21:25.125
If I go on living, everyone will keep suffering!

00:21:25.125 --> 00:21:27.125
Hurry up and eat me!

00:21:27.125 --> 00:21:29.417
I can't take living like this!

00:21:29.417 --> 00:21:33.208
Shut up, idiot! Just shut up, crybaby!

00:21:35.167 --> 00:21:39.458
Exterminate the Titans?!
Who the hell wants to do that bullshit?!

00:21:39.458 --> 00:21:41.667
I'm starting to hate humanity!

00:21:41.667 --> 00:21:44.167
Let 'em get wiped out by Titans!

00:21:44.167 --> 00:21:46.750
I'm humanity's biggest enemy!

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:50.583
Got it?! I'm the worst girl who ever lived!

00:21:52.125 --> 00:21:54.000
You escape from here.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.542
I'll destroy everything else!

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.833
Father...

00:22:01.833 --> 00:22:03.625
Uri...

00:22:03.625 --> 00:22:05.625
Frieda...

00:22:05.625 --> 00:22:07.333
Wait for me...

00:22:07.333 --> 00:22:10.917
I'll... now...

00:23:57.417 --> 00:24:00.625
Rod Reiss becomes a Titan.

00:24:00.625 --> 00:24:08.292
To protect Mikasa and the others from a cave-in,
Eren is cornered by another decision.

00:24:08.292 --> 00:24:12.096
Next episode: "Outside the
Walls of Orvud District."
