WEBVTT

00:00:18.583 --> 00:00:21.583
Yo, Levi.

00:00:21.583 --> 00:00:23.917
You grown any yet?

00:00:27.792 --> 00:00:32.417
Oh? It don't look like you changed at all!

00:00:32.417 --> 00:00:34.667
Kenny!

00:00:37.833 --> 00:00:39.292
Kaboom!

00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:27.083
Gunshots?!

00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:30.042
What's going on?!

00:02:30.042 --> 00:02:31.833
Stay in there! Hiyaah!

00:02:40.042 --> 00:02:41.333
Historia!

00:02:48.458 --> 00:02:49.542
Eren!

00:02:52.542 --> 00:02:53.708
Hiyaah!

00:03:07.292 --> 00:03:11.250
Shit! They predicted every
last one of our movements!

00:03:20.083 --> 00:03:24.250
Kenny... What the hell is he doing
in the Military Police?!

00:03:43.083 --> 00:03:45.542
It's Levi... of the Scouts!

00:03:45.542 --> 00:03:47.958
W-Welcome to our establishment!

00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:49.667
Oof!

00:03:49.667 --> 00:03:54.625
Shit... If this keeps up, I'll lose
my team, Eren, and Historia too.

00:03:54.625 --> 00:03:55.458
Tsk!

00:03:55.458 --> 00:04:00.708
Ain't that the damnedest thing!
I smell a filthy rat coming from this bar...

00:04:00.708 --> 00:04:03.458
Come out, you little rodent...

00:04:03.458 --> 00:04:05.375
Found ya!

00:04:05.375 --> 00:04:08.250
The law has come to exterminate the vermin!

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.083
Bang! Bang!

00:04:11.083 --> 00:04:12.292
Eek!

00:04:13.833 --> 00:04:16.875
The hell?! Ain't you here?!

00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:19.875
Right here, Kenny. It's been a while.

00:04:19.875 --> 00:04:22.375
Never thought you'd still be alive.

00:04:22.375 --> 00:04:26.250
What happened to slaughtering the
Military Police? Now you're one of them?

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.125
Adults do plenty of things a kid
like you can't understand.

00:04:30.125 --> 00:04:31.833
Oops, my bad.

00:04:31.833 --> 00:04:36.750
You're just so tiny, it's hard
to believe you're older now.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.875
I been looking forward to seeing you in action.

00:04:39.875 --> 00:04:45.500
Never thought all those tricks I taught you
would be helping you out like this.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.917
Didn't I ever tell you what happens to a cornered rat?

00:04:49.917 --> 00:04:55.500
No matter which way you try to run,
you'll get blasted from above.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.833
Hey, Levi...

00:05:00.875 --> 00:05:06.708
There's gotta be a reason you became a Scout,
and I think I know what it is.

00:05:06.708 --> 00:05:10.083
We had no choice but to survive
in that garbage dump.

00:05:10.083 --> 00:05:13.458
It took all we had each day to keep livin'.

00:05:13.458 --> 00:05:20.167
And when we found out how big the world
really was, you can bet it hurt like hell.

00:05:20.167 --> 00:05:23.125
But something saved us...

00:05:23.125 --> 00:05:27.500
We'd found something we
wanted to do. It's that simple.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:33.333
It's simple, but the truth is... The only thing that
made our lives fulfilling was finding hobbies.

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:38.667
Hobbies? So is blowing the heads
off my team another hobby of yours?

00:05:38.667 --> 00:05:43.833
Yup... To achieve my grand goals,
I'll kill as much as I have to.

00:05:43.833 --> 00:05:47.292
You're no different.
You kill when it benefits you, too.

00:05:47.292 --> 00:05:48.667
Yeah...

00:05:52.542 --> 00:05:53.875
Wait!

00:05:53.875 --> 00:05:55.458
Captain...

00:05:55.458 --> 00:05:57.458
Thanks, Old Man.

00:06:03.625 --> 00:06:04.792
A chair?!

00:06:10.417 --> 00:06:10.917
--What?!

00:06:10.917 --> 00:06:12.208
--Fire!
--What?!

00:06:19.667 --> 00:06:20.792
Gunshots!

00:06:20.792 --> 00:06:21.417
--Huh?

00:06:21.417 --> 00:06:22.667
--From there!
--Huh?

00:06:23.667 --> 00:06:25.708
I heard a bunch of shots!

00:06:27.458 --> 00:06:29.542
You think something happened?

00:06:29.542 --> 00:06:31.958
Most likely.

00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.250
The Captain had this message for us...

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:39.458
From now on, we'll be fighting
humans, too, and not just Titans.

00:06:39.458 --> 00:06:41.542
Huh? You mean...?

00:06:41.542 --> 00:06:43.375
Hey!

00:06:43.375 --> 00:06:44.500
Hmm?

00:06:45.667 --> 00:06:48.375
Was that the First Interior Squad?

00:06:48.375 --> 00:06:51.875
Commander. You're needed
to check some papers.

00:06:54.792 --> 00:06:56.417
Captain.

00:06:56.417 --> 00:06:58.667
Finally bit the dust?

00:06:58.667 --> 00:07:02.875
You moron... How would
I answer that if I'm dead?

00:07:02.875 --> 00:07:06.292
Ow, ow, ow... He got me good.

00:07:06.292 --> 00:07:11.292
Forgot that bar owners are allowed to
keep guns for their own self-defense...

00:07:11.292 --> 00:07:14.083
For a runt, he's sure grown up.

00:07:14.083 --> 00:07:15.250
That's wonderful.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.917
Huh?! Like hell it is!

00:07:17.917 --> 00:07:21.333
My dream is getting further and further away...

00:07:26.083 --> 00:07:28.042
Hey! There goes Eren!

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:30.458
Captain!

00:07:34.917 --> 00:07:36.375
What the hell?!

00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:49.375
Chase the wagon!

00:07:49.375 --> 00:07:50.708
Yes, sir!

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:52.375
--Listen up! They're used to fighting other people!

00:07:52.375 --> 00:07:54.667
--Hiyaah!
--Listen up! They're used to fighting other people!

00:07:54.667 --> 00:07:57.250
They already got three of ours.

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.417
If we're gonna get those two back,
you can't hesitate!

00:08:00.417 --> 00:08:04.000
If you get the chance, you kill! Got it?!

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.333
Roger!

00:08:10.792 --> 00:08:11.875
Tsk!

00:08:11.875 --> 00:08:15.458
Armin, Jean! Secure the wagon! We'll cover you!

00:08:15.458 --> 00:08:16.292
Sir!

00:08:16.292 --> 00:08:17.583
Another dead...

00:08:17.583 --> 00:08:18.750
Jean!

00:08:24.792 --> 00:08:26.375
Don't move!

00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:30.458
You...

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:37.917
Jean!

00:08:43.917 --> 00:08:48.917
"Anti-Personnel omni-directional mobility gear was
developed not to exterminate Titans but to directly counter
ODM gear for use in fighting other humans. The device
exhibits tremendous dominance in cities and forests."

00:08:52.542 --> 00:08:56.042
How disappointing that nothing came of Erwin.

00:08:56.042 --> 00:08:59.792
We still don't know the location
of Eren Jaeger and Historia.

00:08:59.792 --> 00:09:04.250
At this rate, freezing Scout activity
will prove all for naught.

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.250
Indeed...

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:09.500
Do we know what information they
might have learned from Pastor Nick?

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.000
No helping it.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.375
If we question too much, we'll reveal to them
things they didn't know in the first place.

00:09:16.375 --> 00:09:19.542
No, what they know or don't know matters not.

00:09:19.542 --> 00:09:23.042
It's what they tried to learn. That's plenty.

00:09:23.042 --> 00:09:26.000
We should deal with them
to the extent of the law.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.792
Just as we've done until now...

00:09:33.708 --> 00:09:35.417
It's from Lord Reiss.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.125
Eren and Historia have been captured.

00:09:41.125 --> 00:09:45.250
He's already moved against Erwin
and the Scout Regiment.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:48.042
There's no need for us to take action.

00:09:49.667 --> 00:09:51.500
That's the last of it.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.583
If you want your personal effects back, ask later.

00:09:54.583 --> 00:09:57.167
No, it's fine.

00:09:57.167 --> 00:09:59.750
I was hoping to speak with you.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:02.292
I'm in no mood to reminisce about the past.

00:10:02.292 --> 00:10:04.125
How cold of you, Nile.

00:10:04.125 --> 00:10:07.458
Weren't we once comrades aiming to be Scouts?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.042
This tiny world is about to change.

00:10:12.042 --> 00:10:14.417
Will it bring hope, or despair?

00:10:14.417 --> 00:10:18.333
Can we trust the government with
the future of humanity or not?

00:10:18.333 --> 00:10:20.250
Who gets to choose?

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:22.125
Who decides?

00:10:22.125 --> 00:10:25.458
Who will you trust?

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:29.833
Erwin, you... What are you planning to do?

00:10:31.292 --> 00:10:33.875
Gamble, like I always do.

00:10:43.833 --> 00:10:46.167
Did you go through this, too?

00:10:50.792 --> 00:10:51.958
Sorry...

00:10:51.958 --> 00:10:53.125
It's okay.

00:10:53.125 --> 00:10:56.167
Sorry... Sorry...

00:11:09.333 --> 00:11:11.625
Shit! Armin! Jean!

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.042
Don't do it! Fall back!

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.375
Eren!

00:11:42.333 --> 00:11:43.875
What's wrong?

00:11:43.875 --> 00:11:46.333
This grimy place kill your appetite?

00:11:46.333 --> 00:11:47.792
No...

00:11:47.792 --> 00:11:51.667
Jean, there's something I don't understand...

00:11:51.667 --> 00:11:53.333
What's that?

00:11:53.333 --> 00:11:59.458
When I shot that gun to save you...
I honestly thought I didn't make it in time.

00:11:59.458 --> 00:12:05.292
Sorry, but... why was I the one who shot first?

00:12:09.458 --> 00:12:11.167
That's...

00:12:11.167 --> 00:12:14.292
Because the other person hesitated.

00:12:14.292 --> 00:12:15.792
It's true.

00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:21.625
Armin, I'm sorry... I should've
done what I had to do.

00:12:21.625 --> 00:12:24.333
I know what it is...

00:12:24.333 --> 00:12:29.625
The person that I killed...
I bet they were a nice person.

00:12:29.625 --> 00:12:33.417
Someone that was much more human than I am...

00:12:33.417 --> 00:12:37.583
I pulled the trigger so easily... I did...

00:12:37.583 --> 00:12:38.958
I'm...

00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:42.875
Armin, you've got blood on your hands now.

00:12:42.875 --> 00:12:45.542
You can't go back to who you were.

00:12:45.542 --> 00:12:47.000
Why would you say that?

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.042
Embrace the new you.

00:12:50.042 --> 00:12:56.833
Just think, if your hands were still clean...
Jean wouldn't be here right now.

00:13:00.125 --> 00:13:06.208
I'll tell you why you pulled the trigger...
Because your comrade was about to die.

00:13:06.208 --> 00:13:07.458
Armin...

00:13:07.458 --> 00:13:13.917
Thanks to you getting blood on your hands,
nobody on our squad ended up dead.

00:13:13.917 --> 00:13:15.458
Thank you.

00:13:19.833 --> 00:13:25.917
Captain Levi, I... I thought it was
wrong to be fighting other humans...

00:13:25.917 --> 00:13:29.500
And wrong for you to order us to do it.

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.875
I was afraid to be hurting other people.

00:13:32.875 --> 00:13:36.250
But... I'm the one who was wrong.

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:38.083
Next time, I'll shoot.

00:13:38.083 --> 00:13:42.542
I never said anything about
who was right or wrong.

00:13:42.542 --> 00:13:45.125
I don't even know myself.

00:13:45.125 --> 00:13:48.292
Are you really the one in the wrong?

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:53.500
Now then...

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.875
It's about time we hear what he has to say.

00:14:03.833 --> 00:14:07.875
Wait! I'm just an old man used
for moving wagons around the--

00:14:07.875 --> 00:14:10.125
I've met this man once before.

00:14:12.708 --> 00:14:16.125
In the city, people were calling him "Boss."

00:14:17.875 --> 00:14:21.167
Yeah, I know. Dimo Reeves, right?

00:14:21.167 --> 00:14:22.333
Tsk!

00:14:22.333 --> 00:14:27.875
We were just following orders the Military Police
forced on us. And failed big time...

00:14:27.875 --> 00:14:31.333
They'll plunder the Reeves Company
for all that it's worth.

00:14:31.333 --> 00:14:33.375
They won't stop with me and my dumb son.

00:14:33.375 --> 00:14:37.875
They'll make sure all my employees
die in so-called accidents.

00:14:37.875 --> 00:14:40.958
So you'll die without a fight?

00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:44.583
Trost should have collapsed by now,
but it's persevered.

00:14:44.583 --> 00:14:48.667
That's because the Reeves Company
brings people and work together.

00:14:48.667 --> 00:14:54.458
But if the company was gone for good,
just how few would survive the winter?

00:14:54.458 --> 00:14:57.250
Are you suggesting I team up with you?

00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:00.792
We just need to know
where Eren and Historia are.

00:15:00.792 --> 00:15:04.458
If you're supplying the Military Police,
we can figure something out.

00:15:04.458 --> 00:15:09.042
But can you can stop my city and
employees from dying of starvation?

00:15:09.042 --> 00:15:10.792
I can't guarantee it.

00:15:10.792 --> 00:15:15.292
However, you can trust that
we'll move towards that end.

00:15:23.125 --> 00:15:26.000
Finally, the nuisance is gone.

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:30.500
Erwin, big trouble! The situation got worse!

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:35.292
There's two things! The first is that
Eren and Historia were abducted!

00:15:35.292 --> 00:15:37.583
Three on my team were killed, too.

00:15:37.583 --> 00:15:42.042
I'm planning to meet up with Levi to see
if we can hunt down their location.

00:15:42.042 --> 00:15:43.625
And? The other?

00:15:43.625 --> 00:15:47.542
Eren remembered a conversation
between Ymir and Bertholdt, but...

00:15:47.542 --> 00:15:50.000
Shit, if this is true...

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.875
My head's gonna explode!

00:15:51.875 --> 00:15:53.667
Calm down!

00:15:53.667 --> 00:15:55.333
What's the problem?

00:15:59.083 --> 00:16:02.917
If we don't rescue him quick, Eren will get eaten!

00:16:07.792 --> 00:16:11.000
Hey! Are Levi and them actually there?

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.750
They are. I promised him I'd cooperate,
so they let us go for some reason.

00:16:18.667 --> 00:16:20.250
Are we there?

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.750
Reeves, you damn--

00:16:31.875 --> 00:16:34.750
Sorry about that, pals.

00:16:41.208 --> 00:16:45.333
What now? Does this really mean
we're safe, Old Man?

00:16:45.333 --> 00:16:46.792
There's no guarantee.

00:16:46.792 --> 00:16:49.542
You're kidding! Then why?!

00:16:49.542 --> 00:16:52.667
A merchant must learn to follow their nose.

00:16:52.667 --> 00:16:58.042
Not just to smell easy money,
but to sniff out profit awaiting in the future.

00:16:58.042 --> 00:17:01.333
Once you find it, bite and don't let go.

00:17:01.333 --> 00:17:04.042
Got it? Remember that.

00:17:04.042 --> 00:17:06.917
Sorry I'm late! You're still going at it?

00:17:06.917 --> 00:17:09.750
Yeah, I'm pretty new to this.

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:15.958
Sannes! You should know I'm also a novice
at human torture, so please bear with me!

00:17:15.958 --> 00:17:21.000
Wait! What do you even want?! Who the hell
tortures without asking questions?!

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.958
Oh, right... We do have some questions for you.

00:17:24.958 --> 00:17:27.333
Where are Eren and Historia?

00:17:27.333 --> 00:17:29.500
Why are you after Historia?

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:30.917
What's the Reiss family?

00:17:30.917 --> 00:17:35.000
Too slow! Can't you see that we're in a hurry?!

00:17:36.833 --> 00:17:38.667
It starts again...

00:17:38.667 --> 00:17:42.833
I feel like the screams are louder
than when the captain did it.

00:17:42.833 --> 00:17:48.375
Even though I know it's to save
those two, it makes me sick.

00:17:48.375 --> 00:17:52.000
Let's face it... We're criminals now.

00:17:53.583 --> 00:17:59.542
The enemies that we're fighting... We're not
killing them because they're trying to eat us.

00:17:59.542 --> 00:18:02.333
It's because their views are different...

00:18:02.333 --> 00:18:06.667
No, just the group they belong to.

00:18:06.667 --> 00:18:09.292
And for that, their lives...

00:18:09.292 --> 00:18:10.750
Armin...

00:18:11.875 --> 00:18:15.667
All of us... We're not good people anymore.

00:18:16.958 --> 00:18:20.750
Sorry, I can't peel nails as well as you.

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:25.125
Just how many did you peel to get so good?

00:18:25.125 --> 00:18:27.375
Too many to count.

00:18:27.375 --> 00:18:33.583
Within these cramped walls, do you know
why war has never broken out?

00:18:33.583 --> 00:18:39.750
It's because the First Interior Squad
dirtied our hands to protect the peace.

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:42.208
A teacher too smart for their own good...

00:18:42.208 --> 00:18:44.958
A stupid couple who tried to fly...

00:18:44.958 --> 00:18:47.417
A whore from some ranch in the sticks!

00:18:47.417 --> 00:18:51.417
Humanity has only made it this far
because we erased them!

00:18:51.417 --> 00:18:53.583
You should be thanking us!

00:18:53.583 --> 00:18:59.750
I've never seen anyone get more pleasure
out of torture than you guys! You're monsters!

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:02.333
But I'm not even afraid.

00:19:02.333 --> 00:19:05.750
I... I have...

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:11.958
I have the King, I... I believe in
the King and peace in the walls.

00:19:11.958 --> 00:19:16.083
That all the things we've done were justified...

00:19:16.083 --> 00:19:18.208
But...

00:19:18.208 --> 00:19:21.292
To think it hurt this much...

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:25.583
Go on and torture me to death already.

00:19:25.583 --> 00:19:30.542
That's all I ever did with this
blood-stained life of mine.

00:19:31.958 --> 00:19:33.625
Time for a break.

00:19:36.792 --> 00:19:41.083
That's troubling... I'm beginning
to feel sorry for him.

00:19:45.583 --> 00:19:49.000
Quit shoving me. It hurts...

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.292
Ralph!

00:19:50.292 --> 00:19:56.000
You're pathetic. It only took
one nail to make you talk.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.958
Sannes doesn't have any nails left.
You're nothing like him.

00:19:59.958 --> 00:20:03.292
Like I care? That was his decision.

00:20:03.292 --> 00:20:08.292
The guy never shuts up about peace
and the King. The rest of us hate him.

00:20:08.292 --> 00:20:11.292
Do us a favor and kill him already.

00:20:12.458 --> 00:20:16.292
We're not letting it happen
until he verifies your story.

00:20:16.292 --> 00:20:20.500
You already got what you wanted
out of me. Gimme a break.

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:24.625
Will I be getting a bed in my cell, or what?

00:20:39.875 --> 00:20:42.500
Ready, Sannes? Let's try again.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:45.167
This is tough for me, too, but I'll do my best to--

00:20:45.167 --> 00:20:48.083
Reiss is the true royal family.

00:20:57.125 --> 00:21:00.125
So much for trying not to stand out...

00:21:00.125 --> 00:21:02.875
Flegel is taking forever, dammit.

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:18.167
Merchants shouldn't be sellouts
when it comes to trust.

00:21:23.458 --> 00:21:26.792
Was it wise not to ask him where Levi is?

00:21:26.792 --> 00:21:29.542
He'll show up even if we do nothing.

00:21:29.542 --> 00:21:31.208
How do you know?

00:21:31.208 --> 00:21:33.500
Because I raised him.

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:37.208
Levi Ackermann is just that kind of guy.

00:21:44.792 --> 00:21:47.792
The true royal successor...

00:21:47.792 --> 00:21:49.625
...is Historia?

00:21:49.625 --> 00:21:55.625
In other words, both Eren and Historia
are likely wherever Rod Reiss is.

00:22:01.292 --> 00:22:02.750
That's him.

00:22:07.625 --> 00:22:09.250
Historia...

00:22:12.625 --> 00:22:15.208
I'm sorry for everything...

00:23:57.542 --> 00:23:59.500
A girl's past...

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:03.833
It's a secret big enough
to change the kingdom...

00:24:03.833 --> 00:24:09.167
Once this secret is known to Erwin,
he remembers a past of his own.

00:24:09.167 --> 00:24:12.096
Next episode: "Old Story."
