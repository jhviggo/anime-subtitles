00:00:19.375 --> 00:00:22.583
Hey, don't you think we're a bit far out?

00:00:22.583 --> 00:00:25.875
No point in searching if we're not spread out.

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:28.667
Why did I get stuck with you?

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:33.000
Wait, Marlo... You just wanted
alone time with me, didn't you?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.333
Hitch... I'm sorry, but you're
not my first choice either.

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:40.625
Oh, is that right? Well, good for you.

00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:43.292
But, don't you think it's odd?

00:00:43.292 --> 00:00:47.333
Why would the Scouts kill
a civilian and run for the hills?

00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:53.167
They're the same group that's always
risking their lives for the sake of humanity.

00:00:53.167 --> 00:00:56.625
I can't believe you... Did you forget?

00:00:56.625 --> 00:00:59.458
Remember what they did to Stohess District?

00:00:59.458 --> 00:01:02.333
How they turned it into a battlefield?

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:05.583
All those corpses we had to carry?

00:01:06.583 --> 00:01:09.208
And how Annie's still missing?

00:01:10.583 --> 00:01:15.083
All of her junk is still in
my room... and it's annoying.

00:01:15.083 --> 00:01:21.167
But they also uncovered that Titan in hiding
and somehow managed to capture it.

00:01:21.167 --> 00:01:24.750
You think any other regiment could do that?

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.458
If the Scouts get disbanded
like this, humanity can't--

00:01:28.458 --> 00:01:29.625
Quiet.

00:01:30.792 --> 00:01:32.458
I hear water.

00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:37.708
Don't move!

00:01:40.417 --> 00:01:42.375
Slowly turn this way.

00:01:45.625 --> 00:01:47.667
You must be a Scout.

00:01:49.625 --> 00:01:52.625
Just like that... Not a word.

00:01:52.625 --> 00:01:55.333
Now listen to me and do as I--

00:01:57.375 --> 00:02:01.750
That's right... Hand over your
guns to the one in front.

00:02:08.042 --> 00:02:10.000
And not a word, right?

00:03:56.125 --> 00:03:59.417
Sorry to keep you waiting, Erwin.

00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:05.042
I know it's sudden, but let's get
the interrogation over with.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.708
So, it's unmistakable that the Scout
Regiment murdered a civilian?

00:04:13.708 --> 00:04:16.000
Judging by the evidence, at least.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.333
Having said that, we can't say
for sure at the time being.

00:04:20.333 --> 00:04:23.750
Are you saying the Interior Police are
responsible for issuing the search--?

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.792
Hey, Peaure!

00:04:25.792 --> 00:04:30.375
Sorry about him, Commander Dawk.
He's still a rookie, through and through.

00:04:30.375 --> 00:04:33.708
He doesn't know how we
do things within the walls.

00:04:33.708 --> 00:04:37.875
Don't you worry about the Interior Police.
We won't write anything about 'em.

00:04:37.875 --> 00:04:41.042
That goes for their new ODM gear, too.

00:04:41.042 --> 00:04:43.250
I appreciate it, Roy.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.458
Their new ODM gear...

00:04:47.458 --> 00:04:52.250
That buckshot is useless against Titans,
but it's perfect for killing people.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.833
It's a weapon practically made
for killing the Scouts...

00:04:55.833 --> 00:04:59.917
Plus, its existence being hidden
even from us means...

00:04:59.917 --> 00:05:06.042
...sooner or later, we might find ourselves
staring down their muzzles all the same.

00:05:06.042 --> 00:05:10.833
Anyways, we should hear a report
from them soon, so be patient.

00:05:13.917 --> 00:05:16.500
Wait up, you fat-ass!

00:05:23.583 --> 00:05:26.875
You idiot! That way's a dead end!

00:05:28.125 --> 00:05:29.208
Shit!

00:05:37.917 --> 00:05:40.042
Shit, he's gone!

00:05:40.042 --> 00:05:42.208
Find him! Find him!

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:43.708
Don't let 'im escape!

00:05:49.083 --> 00:05:51.958
You're the son of Boss Reeves, right?

00:05:51.958 --> 00:05:53.292
What's your name?

00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.625
Flegel.

00:05:56.625 --> 00:05:58.417
Nice to meet you, Flegel.

00:05:58.417 --> 00:06:00.333
I'm Hange ZoÃ«.

00:06:00.333 --> 00:06:03.750
The thing is, if the Military Police are after you,

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.417
that must mean you know the truth
about your father's death, right?

00:06:07.417 --> 00:06:09.750
Can you tell me what happened?

00:06:11.583 --> 00:06:16.625
While I was busy taking a piss,
the Interior Police got my old man.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:23.083
A tall guy wearing a black coat...
he killed my father.

00:06:23.083 --> 00:06:25.792
In any case, it's great that you're still alive.

00:06:25.792 --> 00:06:27.792
Now we can make the truth public.

00:06:27.792 --> 00:06:31.333
How's that?! Haven't you seen the paper?!

00:06:31.333 --> 00:06:34.500
If the Military Police say the
Scouts did it, that's the truth!

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.250
My testimony means jack shit!

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.167
They know I was there... The Interior
Police found out I saw everything...

00:06:42.167 --> 00:06:45.125
Now there's nowhere safe for me to go.

00:06:45.125 --> 00:06:48.917
All I can do is run and hide
in these cramped walls...

00:06:48.917 --> 00:06:53.042
My life is... shit!

00:06:53.042 --> 00:06:55.583
Well, you have a point...

00:06:55.583 --> 00:06:59.375
The thing is, that doesn't
sound like living to me.

00:07:00.667 --> 00:07:03.292
Look at it this way, Flegel.

00:07:03.292 --> 00:07:07.458
Instead of scampering around like
a scared little mouse your whole life,

00:07:07.458 --> 00:07:11.208
wouldn't you rather face up to your enemy,
even if it means risking your life--?

00:07:11.208 --> 00:07:13.250
Like hell I would!

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:16.875
Not everyone has the same disregard
for their lives as you do!

00:07:16.875 --> 00:07:20.458
Not only that, but you have
no right to criticize me either!

00:07:20.458 --> 00:07:24.000
Don't you care about telling your
company and family the truth?!

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.250
Huh?! That's just what's best for you!

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.042
Of course it is!

00:07:28.042 --> 00:07:30.625
You oughta start thinking
what's best for you, too!

00:07:30.625 --> 00:07:33.458
Who's that?! Who's making
a scene on my roof?!

00:07:33.458 --> 00:07:35.875
Now then, you're coming with me, Flegel.

00:07:35.875 --> 00:07:39.417
Hell no! Your gang already lost!

00:07:39.417 --> 00:07:41.500
You've been defeated!

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.208
What are you talking about?

00:07:43.208 --> 00:07:46.750
Defeat is all the Scout
Regiment has ever known!

00:07:49.042 --> 00:07:51.917
Disguise as Military Police
to get by the guards...

00:07:51.917 --> 00:07:55.708
Then figure out where Eren
was taken by snooping around.

00:07:55.708 --> 00:07:58.875
To think we'd have no better option...

00:07:58.875 --> 00:08:03.833
We just don't have time...
We've got no choice but to do or die.

00:08:03.833 --> 00:08:04.958
Captain.

00:08:06.292 --> 00:08:07.958
Now then...

00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:10.667
Stohess District Military Police.

00:08:10.667 --> 00:08:13.375
Private Marlo Freudenberg.

00:08:13.375 --> 00:08:16.208
Captain Levi! It's really him!

00:08:16.208 --> 00:08:19.583
Same assignment, Private Hitch Dreyse.

00:08:19.583 --> 00:08:21.667
As for how we'll dispose of you...

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.417
Because of you guys, over 100 people
from Stohess District were killed!

00:08:28.417 --> 00:08:29.542
Huh?

00:08:29.542 --> 00:08:30.375
Hey!

00:08:30.375 --> 00:08:34.875
You people... You might think
that you're all heroes of justice,

00:08:34.875 --> 00:08:39.083
but the victims and their families
were dropped straight into hell!

00:08:39.083 --> 00:08:41.292
Yeah, I know.

00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:47.250
You there... You're from the
Southern Cadet Corps, yeah?

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:49.792
Just like Annie Leonhart.

00:08:49.792 --> 00:08:52.500
Were you friends of hers?

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:58.458
No... I doubt she had any friends.
Being as gloomy and aloof as she was.

00:08:58.458 --> 00:09:02.125
It's like she was a kid afraid of other people...

00:09:03.083 --> 00:09:06.542
I never got the chance to
know anything about her.

00:09:06.542 --> 00:09:09.667
And the reason they still haven't found her...

00:09:09.667 --> 00:09:13.500
...is because she was pulverized
by a Titan into a puddle of jelly!

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.958
No...

00:09:14.958 --> 00:09:19.833
Because the Titan in hiding was...
Annie Leonhart herself.

00:09:21.083 --> 00:09:24.333
Goddammit, it makes me sick.

00:09:24.333 --> 00:09:29.292
Nobody knows a damn thing about
this world... Not us or anyone else.

00:09:29.292 --> 00:09:33.458
Except for those bastards
at the center of it all.

00:09:33.458 --> 00:09:37.667
We'll release you both
as soon as we get out of here.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.333
Annie was...

00:09:42.333 --> 00:09:46.083
Captain Levi! Please let me help you!

00:09:46.083 --> 00:09:49.292
I don't think what you guys are doing is wrong!

00:09:49.292 --> 00:09:54.958
If I can help correct this world's injustice,
I'll do whatever it takes!

00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.292
What's with this guy?

00:09:58.583 --> 00:10:00.500
I beg of you, Captain Levi!

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:01.750
Not a chance.

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:06.500
I can't tell how prepared you are about
making an enemy of the government.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.917
Let's go.

00:10:07.917 --> 00:10:10.917
Sasha. Tie them up somewhere nearby.

00:10:10.917 --> 00:10:11.917
Yes, sir!

00:10:15.208 --> 00:10:16.333
Captain.

00:10:17.333 --> 00:10:19.542
Please let me do it.

00:10:23.458 --> 00:10:24.917
Knock yourself out.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.208
Stop.

00:10:37.625 --> 00:10:40.292
We'll forget what we saw here.

00:10:40.292 --> 00:10:44.125
Yeah, you will! Because both
of you will die here!

00:10:44.125 --> 00:10:45.417
That's not what he said!

00:10:45.417 --> 00:10:48.167
Letting you two run free is too dangerous.

00:10:48.167 --> 00:10:50.667
I'll take it upon myself to kill you!

00:10:50.667 --> 00:10:52.250
Please, believe us!

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:55.958
We know you guys are fighting
to try and save humanity!

00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:56.917
Right, Hitch?!

00:10:56.917 --> 00:10:57.750
Mmm, mmm!

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:02.542
As if I could trust you.
Especially you, Mr. Bowl Cut.

00:11:02.542 --> 00:11:05.500
Who in their right mind
would cut their hair like that?

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.417
You'll get no sympathy from this guy!

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:14.417
Hitch, run!

00:11:17.208 --> 00:11:19.250
My gun is faster, you know.

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:21.375
Wanna take your chances?

00:11:21.375 --> 00:11:24.500
Your knife and my gun... Let's race!

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:27.083
Wait! I'm really your ally!

00:11:27.083 --> 00:11:30.292
Why the hell would anyone
believe you'd wanna join us?

00:11:30.292 --> 00:11:35.292
We're so severely outmatched,
you really think we can save humanity?

00:11:36.375 --> 00:11:39.083
Then, why are you...?

00:11:39.083 --> 00:11:42.208
Why are you still with the Scouts then?

00:11:44.125 --> 00:11:47.542
I picked the wrong regiment to join.

00:11:47.542 --> 00:11:51.875
As long as you guys have it in you
to risk your lives and keep fighting...

00:11:51.875 --> 00:11:53.833
...I will trust you.

00:11:59.458 --> 00:12:01.375
Hitch!

00:12:01.375 --> 00:12:02.750
You damn horse face!

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:06.875
Wait, Hitch! He was just testing us!

00:12:06.875 --> 00:12:08.458
Huh?!

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:12.125
Hey, you.

00:12:12.125 --> 00:12:16.875
What would you have done
if I swung the knife at you?

00:12:16.875 --> 00:12:19.417
Why did you trust me so much?

00:12:20.542 --> 00:12:24.500
Somehow or another,
you remind me of a guy that I hate.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.167
A damn idiot.

00:12:27.417 --> 00:12:31.583
This idiot... Is it the same
one Annie talked about?

00:12:33.292 --> 00:12:34.958
Hell if I know.

00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:36.708
Everyone's an idiot.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.542
Fortunately, we're both just as dumb.

00:12:44.542 --> 00:12:48.125
Marlo, I think you proved your dedication.

00:12:49.625 --> 00:12:53.125
That should be enough
to convince Captain Levi.

00:12:53.125 --> 00:12:55.458
We're counting on you.

00:12:59.042 --> 00:13:02.625
That over there is the least
manned checkpoint around.

00:13:02.625 --> 00:13:05.625
All right. We'll handle it ourselves.

00:13:05.625 --> 00:13:08.667
Get back to your squad before it's suspicious.

00:13:08.667 --> 00:13:09.917
Yes, sir.

00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:13.500
Marlo, Hitch.

00:13:14.833 --> 00:13:16.250
We're grateful.

00:13:17.708 --> 00:13:19.625
Sir!

00:13:19.625 --> 00:13:20.917
Let's go!

00:13:20.917 --> 00:13:23.125
It's our turn to pick a fight!

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:28.375
Hmm?

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:48.708
It's me.

00:13:51.667 --> 00:13:53.792
Captain, he's...

00:13:53.792 --> 00:13:55.917
With the Interior Police.

00:13:55.917 --> 00:13:58.875
I've got a few questions for him.

00:13:58.875 --> 00:14:00.375
Let's move.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
"Chancellery"
"An institution which unifies and supervises the various
public organizations of administration, justice, and
military which act under the royal government's will."

00:14:18.875 --> 00:14:24.625
How dumb can you be?
Running into a deserted dump like this...

00:14:24.625 --> 00:14:26.708
Shit!

00:14:26.708 --> 00:14:30.333
But I owe you one, Flegel Reeves.

00:14:30.333 --> 00:14:34.750
When you got away and
gave us the slip, I really...

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:39.208
I thought I was screwed!

00:14:44.083 --> 00:14:47.917
For a minute there, I thought they'd kill me.

00:14:49.125 --> 00:14:52.708
Nice knowing you, Flegel. Thanks a bunch!

00:14:52.708 --> 00:14:54.458
Ah, wait!

00:14:54.458 --> 00:14:56.333
Why was my old man killed?!

00:14:56.333 --> 00:14:58.167
Did the Interior Police do it?!

00:14:58.167 --> 00:15:00.875
Huh? What does it matter to you?

00:15:00.875 --> 00:15:04.375
You're about to be a fresh corpse.

00:15:04.375 --> 00:15:06.958
I-I wanna know before I die!

00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:09.667
What did he ever do to deserve being killed?!

00:15:09.667 --> 00:15:11.917
Eh? You don't know?

00:15:11.917 --> 00:15:16.667
He betrayed us and sided
with those damn Scouts.

00:15:16.667 --> 00:15:17.958
Betrayed?

00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:22.292
So you're saying it was the Interior Police
that made him kidnap those Scouts?!

00:15:22.292 --> 00:15:25.125
Except it was a different squad than us.

00:15:25.125 --> 00:15:27.958
Guess he didn't say a damn thing.

00:15:27.958 --> 00:15:31.125
Not to his dimwit son.

00:15:31.125 --> 00:15:33.750
And what if he would've refused?

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:38.917
Well, he'd have known a bit too much,
so he would've had to die.

00:15:38.917 --> 00:15:40.875
What a fool.

00:15:40.875 --> 00:15:44.583
Look where caring for the city
and workers got 'im.

00:15:46.542 --> 00:15:49.583
You would never understand.

00:15:49.583 --> 00:15:50.792
Hmm?

00:15:50.792 --> 00:15:53.917
Talking like you're smart shit...

00:15:53.917 --> 00:15:56.583
My old man taught me something.

00:15:56.583 --> 00:16:00.042
That merchants gotta follow their nose.

00:16:00.042 --> 00:16:02.375
And I'm damn glad that I did.

00:16:02.375 --> 00:16:05.417
Because I found the people
who could avenge my old man!

00:16:05.417 --> 00:16:06.917
And I side with them!

00:16:06.917 --> 00:16:11.000
What's the matter, Flegel? Go on and
oink like a pig to be slaughtered!

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.750
You had your time, but it's over!

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:15.958
Look above you, morons!

00:16:29.417 --> 00:16:31.083
Ouch!

00:16:31.083 --> 00:16:33.625
Section Commander! You're too wild!

00:16:33.625 --> 00:16:37.250
Hell yeah! Did you hear that, everyone?!

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:42.292
The... Scout Regiment...? Why?

00:16:45.417 --> 00:16:47.667
Not so deserted, eh?

00:16:47.667 --> 00:16:49.958
Perhaps it looks that way to you.

00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:51.375
But sorry.

00:16:51.375 --> 00:16:55.500
I know it doesn't look like much,
but we still live here.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.250
We heard everything.

00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:02.542
The Interior Police and their schemes...
Everyone here is a witness.

00:17:02.542 --> 00:17:05.125
S-So, what does it matter?

00:17:05.125 --> 00:17:08.167
It's the government that
decides what's the truth!

00:17:08.167 --> 00:17:12.208
You fools... Don't think you can
do this and get away with it!

00:17:12.208 --> 00:17:14.833
You're all in for a world of hu--

00:17:14.833 --> 00:17:17.917
Everyone... Don't worry.

00:17:17.917 --> 00:17:20.917
The Reeves Company will protect this city.

00:17:20.917 --> 00:17:23.625
As of today, I, Flegel Reeves...

00:17:23.625 --> 00:17:25.375
I'm the boss.

00:17:26.875 --> 00:17:33.583
So... from now... you can count... on me.

00:17:37.833 --> 00:17:39.875
We're counting on you, Boss.

00:17:39.875 --> 00:17:41.875
Speak up, man!

00:17:41.875 --> 00:17:43.750
Congrats on the job.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.708
Keep an eye on these Interior Police.

00:17:46.708 --> 00:17:47.958
Right.

00:17:52.375 --> 00:17:54.500
Stop it...

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.917
Where are Eren and Christa?

00:18:02.375 --> 00:18:04.000
Oh, you're so brave.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.792
That checkpoint back there was just recruits
who could barely wipe their own ass.

00:18:08.792 --> 00:18:13.042
You think you're some sort of hero,
beating them down?

00:18:13.042 --> 00:18:15.833
What an atrocious thing we've done.

00:18:18.333 --> 00:18:21.708
But what's more atrocious
is this mouth of yours.

00:18:21.708 --> 00:18:26.042
I recommend you start talking
while you're still able to use it.

00:18:26.042 --> 00:18:28.500
Where are Eren and Christa?

00:18:31.458 --> 00:18:33.583
It's no use!

00:18:33.583 --> 00:18:40.083
All that's left for you now is to run and hide
inside these walls, covered in mud and shit!

00:18:40.083 --> 00:18:45.208
If you don't turn yourselves in, every last
Scout we captured will get the noose!

00:18:45.208 --> 00:18:49.583
Starting with the one most
guilty of all, Erwin Smith!

00:18:52.708 --> 00:18:54.250
Shut up.

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:57.375
That's for not answering my question.

00:18:57.375 --> 00:19:00.708
Some Scouts' lives are
more valuable than others.

00:19:00.708 --> 00:19:04.958
Only those dumb enough
to acknowledge that join us.

00:19:04.958 --> 00:19:07.375
Tell me where Eren and Christa are at.

00:19:07.375 --> 00:19:09.125
I-I don't know!

00:19:09.125 --> 00:19:11.167
I'm not allowed to know!

00:19:11.167 --> 00:19:14.083
Kenny Ackermann is a very cautious man!

00:19:14.083 --> 00:19:16.167
Ackermann?

00:19:16.167 --> 00:19:19.125
I know Kenny... Is that his last name?

00:19:19.125 --> 00:19:20.875
It is, but...

00:19:22.417 --> 00:19:27.917
True, there's a lot of things he doesn't
divulge... Especially the important stuff.

00:19:27.917 --> 00:19:30.292
But you must have a rough idea.

00:19:30.292 --> 00:19:32.375
You best try to remember.

00:19:32.375 --> 00:19:32.958
--Stop it!

00:19:32.958 --> 00:19:33.625
--You still have plenty of bones left to break.
--Stop it!

00:19:33.625 --> 00:19:36.875
--You still have plenty of bones left to break.

00:19:36.875 --> 00:19:40.333
You... You're insane!

00:19:40.333 --> 00:19:42.042
Maybe I am.

00:19:42.042 --> 00:19:43.833
Someone's coming from that way!

00:19:46.375 --> 00:19:47.792
More than one!

00:19:49.375 --> 00:19:51.667
Told you so, Captain.

00:19:51.667 --> 00:19:54.208
It's no use.

00:19:54.208 --> 00:19:59.333
One way or another, the Scouts
will soon come to an end!

00:20:06.667 --> 00:20:09.583
I've seen you in better shape.

00:20:09.583 --> 00:20:13.417
And to think you were
lecturing me the other day.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.583
You're getting an audience with the King.

00:20:19.583 --> 00:20:24.750
They'll decide how to dismantle the Scouts
and announce your final sentence.

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:26.500
Nile, huh?

00:20:28.542 --> 00:20:30.750
Where was your house?

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:32.833
Stohess District, was it?

00:20:34.375 --> 00:20:40.458
Is Marie...? Is your family doing well?

00:20:42.292 --> 00:20:46.500
They're doing fine. Both Marie and the kids.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.458
I haven't been home in a while, but...

00:20:49.458 --> 00:20:52.250
...it's around Eastern Wall Rose.

00:20:53.375 --> 00:20:55.083
I see...

00:20:56.458 --> 00:20:59.333
What's with the odd questions?

00:21:00.292 --> 00:21:04.292
I entrusted something to Commander Pyxis.

00:21:04.292 --> 00:21:07.125
When, and if the time comes...

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:11.875
When it comes, I will only watch.

00:21:11.875 --> 00:21:16.583
It's up to you to decide. You... and them.

00:21:21.625 --> 00:21:25.708
So, I take it not much
came out of Erwin in the end.

00:21:25.708 --> 00:21:30.458
Indeed... He must not have learned
any secrets from Pastor Nick.

00:21:30.458 --> 00:21:36.250
Historia Reiss can make all the claims she wants
about her name, but they'll amount to nothing.

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:37.542
How silly.

00:21:37.542 --> 00:21:41.792
In any case, they're all nothing
more than birds in a cage.

00:21:41.792 --> 00:21:43.958
Just waiting to die...

00:21:45.833 --> 00:21:47.208
Excuse me.

00:21:47.208 --> 00:21:49.750
Erwin Smith has arrived.

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:53.167
Very well. We're coming.

00:21:53.167 --> 00:21:58.250
Once we finally execute him,
all will be according to plan.

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:02.250
And just like they always have,
the wall's secrets will stay safe.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:05.000
We'll protect the peace within the walls.

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.208
Forever...

00:22:16.417 --> 00:22:18.000
Erwin.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.083
Do you have any last words?

00:23:57.583 --> 00:24:00.167
In order to protect the kingdom...

00:24:00.167 --> 00:24:04.833
In order to protect the King,
they kept the truth hidden.

00:24:04.833 --> 00:24:09.875
However, in doing so, they invite
an uprising of the people.

00:24:09.875 --> 00:24:12.096
Next episode: "Reply."
