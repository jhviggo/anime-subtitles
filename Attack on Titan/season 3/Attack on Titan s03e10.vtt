WEBVTT

00:00:25.542 --> 00:00:27.958
We're good to go.

00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:29.958
All right! Drop it!

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.417
Captain Levi!

00:00:54.417 --> 00:00:58.750
What? You look like you're
about to shit your pants.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.333
We've found Kenny Ackermann!

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.083
Never imagined there was someone
stronger than me in the world...

00:02:53.083 --> 00:02:56.125
So this is a Titan...

00:02:56.125 --> 00:02:59.417
To think they really existed...

00:02:59.417 --> 00:03:02.083
What's more, within the walls...

00:03:06.792 --> 00:03:10.167
Uri! Hold him right there!

00:03:10.167 --> 00:03:13.333
Rod, wait. Don't shoot.

00:03:13.333 --> 00:03:18.833
Whoever it was who told him about us
is likely part of the council.

00:03:18.833 --> 00:03:21.292
We must discover who's responsible.

00:03:21.292 --> 00:03:25.208
In that case, use your power
and make the assassin talk!

00:03:25.208 --> 00:03:28.083
That's something I cannot do.

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:34.833
If I had to guess, this man is a
descendant of the Ackermann family.

00:03:34.833 --> 00:03:36.583
In which case...

00:03:36.583 --> 00:03:41.292
...his reasons for raising a blade
are within the man himself.

00:03:44.042 --> 00:03:45.250
Uri!

00:03:47.708 --> 00:03:50.292
If you won't do it, I'll kill him!

00:03:50.292 --> 00:03:54.208
Argh, shit! Forgive me, will ya?!

00:03:54.208 --> 00:03:56.792
You're the true King, ain'tcha?!

00:03:56.792 --> 00:04:00.167
Get yer hands off me! I gotta escape!

00:04:00.167 --> 00:04:03.125
Lemme go and gimme another chance!

00:04:03.125 --> 00:04:03.500
--Up against such overwhelming
might, I was powerless.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.583
--I'll do it right next time
and attack while you sleep!
--Up against such overwhelming
might, I was powerless.

00:04:06.583 --> 00:04:07.917
--You gotta admit stuffing your skull
with shit is such a nice idea!

00:04:07.917 --> 00:04:11.833
--You gotta admit stuffing your skull
with shit is such a nice idea!
--After all, he literally could've
crushed me to death.

00:04:11.833 --> 00:04:12.708
--You gotta admit stuffing your skull
with shit is such a nice idea!
--Violence was all that I had,
but even that had failed me.

00:04:12.708 --> 00:04:16.208
--I was gonna pack you so full of shit,
it'd blow a new hole in your ass!
--Violence was all that I had,
but even that had failed me.

00:04:16.208 --> 00:04:17.708
--I was gonna pack you so full of shit,
it'd blow a new hole in your ass!

00:04:17.708 --> 00:04:22.708
--It's not my fault!
I can't control my creativity!
--Now that I think about it, my family's
grudge never even meant much to me.

00:04:22.708 --> 00:04:24.167
--Now that I think about it, my family's
grudge never even meant much to me.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.542
Y-You're crazy!

00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:33.875
M-My legs!

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.042
Hey! Uri!

00:04:39.333 --> 00:04:42.458
What was that for?! He's an Ackermann!

00:04:42.458 --> 00:04:44.375
You can't erase his memory!

00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:46.250
We've gotta kill him!

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.625
Considering how the Ackermanns
have been persecuted in our name,

00:05:05.625 --> 00:05:08.875
your hatred is justified.

00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:13.875
However... I'm afraid I cannot die right now.

00:05:16.875 --> 00:05:19.250
Please, forgive me.

00:05:23.083 --> 00:05:28.542
Even within such tiny walls,
to be unable to build paradise...

00:05:28.542 --> 00:05:30.500
...I'm a fool.

00:05:32.208 --> 00:05:38.667
For a King that held so much power
to bow down to trash like me...

00:05:38.667 --> 00:05:41.292
His Titan alone shocked me plenty,

00:05:41.292 --> 00:05:46.958
but him doing that rattled something
inside me like nothing ever before.

00:05:48.292 --> 00:05:54.167
I said right there I wanted to
help him... and Uri nodded.

00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:03.458
At the very next council, missing was
the one who tipped me off to the Reiss,

00:06:03.458 --> 00:06:08.708
and in his place was the Reiss' new dog,
legs stretched up on the table.

00:06:09.667 --> 00:06:13.333
That was my new line of work.

00:06:13.333 --> 00:06:19.792
It was a bit pathetic for me, but it
ended the Ackermanns' persecution.

00:06:19.792 --> 00:06:25.417
Though walking around in broad daylight
was... something I wouldn't risk.

00:06:25.417 --> 00:06:27.792
But I had fewer enemies.

00:06:29.625 --> 00:06:33.917
Kuchel... Ah, if you mean Olympia...

00:06:33.917 --> 00:06:38.792
She's been sick for so long now,
she hasn't sold in ages.

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:50.958
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:56.292
Damn, you've lost a ton of
weight since last time, Kuchel.

00:06:56.292 --> 00:06:57.625
She's dead.

00:06:57.625 --> 00:06:58.875
Huh?

00:07:02.917 --> 00:07:04.417
And you?

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.125
Are you alive?

00:07:10.833 --> 00:07:13.458
Hey, hey, gimme a damn break...

00:07:13.458 --> 00:07:15.208
You hear me, don'tcha?

00:07:16.375 --> 00:07:18.792
Gotta name?

00:07:18.792 --> 00:07:21.125
Levi.

00:07:21.125 --> 00:07:23.208
Just Levi.

00:07:32.375 --> 00:07:35.417
I get it, Kuchel...

00:07:35.417 --> 00:07:37.833
That's true...

00:07:37.833 --> 00:07:40.625
Not worth using your name...

00:07:46.542 --> 00:07:48.417
I'm Kenny.

00:07:48.417 --> 00:07:51.083
Just Kenny.

00:07:51.083 --> 00:07:54.583
I used to know Kuchel.

00:07:54.583 --> 00:07:56.542
Nice to meetcha.

00:07:59.083 --> 00:08:02.083
An unfriendly brat on the brink of death...

00:08:02.083 --> 00:08:05.667
...is all Kuchel left behind.

00:08:05.667 --> 00:08:09.417
I wasn't so heartless that
I'd let the runt die, but...

00:08:09.417 --> 00:08:13.417
...I wasn't steppin' in as a parent, either.

00:08:13.417 --> 00:08:17.000
There wasn't much I could teach 'im, but...

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.292
First up was how to grip a knife.

00:08:20.292 --> 00:08:23.042
How to get along with people...

00:08:23.042 --> 00:08:25.208
...and how to say hello.

00:08:25.208 --> 00:08:27.417
How to swing a deal...

00:08:27.417 --> 00:08:29.958
...and how to swing a knife.

00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:35.417
Basically, all one needs to know
to survive in the underground.

00:08:35.417 --> 00:08:39.542
If he wanted to go above ground,
it was up to him.

00:08:39.542 --> 00:08:44.625
But, when that time came,
he had to do it himself.

00:08:48.042 --> 00:08:49.708
Let us pray...

00:08:49.708 --> 00:08:52.250
For true world peace...

00:08:54.208 --> 00:08:56.667
Interior Police?

00:08:56.667 --> 00:09:00.250
Ah, so that's who you're with?

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:03.750
Sorry about killing so many of your pals.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:08.958
But look at you now.
The King has made you obedient.

00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:12.792
His glory is boundless.

00:09:12.792 --> 00:09:18.042
Say, Sannes... Sounds like you
revere the King like crazy.

00:09:18.042 --> 00:09:21.917
That's why I'm able to do any job asked of me.

00:09:21.917 --> 00:09:24.375
Are you any different?

00:09:24.375 --> 00:09:26.750
Why do you abide by the King?

00:09:27.917 --> 00:09:29.417
I...

00:09:31.667 --> 00:09:33.708
Who knows?

00:09:33.708 --> 00:09:37.417
Probably 'cuz he's the strongest around.

00:09:37.417 --> 00:09:39.042
Yeah...

00:09:39.042 --> 00:09:45.792
In our world, the one on top is the one
who can show they're the strongest.

00:09:45.792 --> 00:09:48.792
Power is all you need.

00:09:48.792 --> 00:09:49.917
--At the least, it'll mean you don't
go out like my sister did.

00:09:49.917 --> 00:09:52.875
--Do you understand, idiot?!
--At the least, it'll mean you don't
go out like my sister did.

00:09:52.875 --> 00:09:54.958
--At the least, it'll mean you don't
go out like my sister did.

00:10:04.125 --> 00:10:07.042
I don't have long left...

00:10:07.042 --> 00:10:10.125
Anyone could tell that at a glance.

00:10:10.125 --> 00:10:14.500
Funny how you're a monster,
yet age and disease do you in.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:17.167
You disappoint me.

00:10:17.167 --> 00:10:19.042
It's not that.

00:10:19.042 --> 00:10:21.083
Eh?

00:10:21.083 --> 00:10:25.458
This power will be passed
down to Rod's children.

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:30.083
But I should live on inside of their memories.

00:10:30.083 --> 00:10:32.500
What's that mean?

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.083
You can pass down that power?

00:10:40.583 --> 00:10:46.792
Kenny... In the not too distant future,
this world will crumble.

00:10:46.792 --> 00:10:52.792
And in humanity's fading twilight...
I wish to build paradise.

00:10:54.375 --> 00:10:58.000
You believe in violence, do you not?

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.500
It's the unavoidable truth of our world.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.792
Though...

00:11:02.792 --> 00:11:07.792
When we were at each other's throats,
what was it that made us friends?

00:11:09.167 --> 00:11:10.750
Was it violence?

00:11:13.708 --> 00:11:16.083
No idea.

00:11:16.083 --> 00:11:20.500
But if you hadn't squeezed me
in that stupidly big hand of yours...

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:25.375
...I'd have stuffed your
skull full of shit for sure.

00:11:25.375 --> 00:11:28.750
Before we became "friends," you know?

00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:33.917
Yeah... It's the unavoidable truth...

00:11:35.792 --> 00:11:38.292
Even so, I...

00:11:38.292 --> 00:11:42.000
...I believe in the miracle
that happened back then.

00:11:44.875 --> 00:11:50.125
In the end, I never saw
eye to eye with him on that.

00:11:59.333 --> 00:12:04.250
Just like he said, the monster was passed on.

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:07.500
One look in her eyes,
and I knew he was in there.

00:12:08.542 --> 00:12:11.875
Rod's daughter preached
to anyone who would listen

00:12:11.875 --> 00:12:16.208
about love, peace, and all that,
just like he used to.

00:12:17.292 --> 00:12:21.500
How'd you find the time to talk
about such useless shit?

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:25.583
Is it because you're so powerful,
you have that luxury?

00:12:25.583 --> 00:12:30.292
If somebody obtains that power,
would they be the same way, too?

00:12:31.458 --> 00:12:33.708
For example...

00:12:33.708 --> 00:12:35.083
...even me?

00:12:36.292 --> 00:12:38.708
I'm Kenny Ackermann.

00:12:38.708 --> 00:12:42.708
If you like dumb names,
I'm known as Kenny the Ripper, too.

00:12:42.708 --> 00:12:48.667
I've slit so many Military Police throats
like yours that I'm bored of it, but...

00:12:48.667 --> 00:12:50.750
Well, a lot happened and...

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:55.958
...it seems I'll be captain of this new
Anti-Personnel Control Squad.

00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:57.542
Nice to meetcha.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:12:59.583
Hmm?

00:13:03.583 --> 00:13:07.333
Yeah, it don't make much sense.

00:13:07.333 --> 00:13:13.083
I'm sure you're all pissed off that a crazed
killer not from the military is your boss.

00:13:13.083 --> 00:13:14.292
Doesn't matter to me.

00:13:14.292 --> 00:13:15.417
Hmm?

00:13:15.417 --> 00:13:19.792
Two years since the wall fell, and
people have given up fighting Titans,

00:13:19.792 --> 00:13:23.417
squabbling over the land we have left instead.

00:13:23.417 --> 00:13:26.333
That's what we're here for, right?

00:13:26.333 --> 00:13:33.458
We followed the rules, climbed the ranks
of the military, and here we are.

00:13:33.458 --> 00:13:37.000
Doesn't matter to me.
It's all pointless anyways.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.417
Don't you worry!

00:13:44.417 --> 00:13:47.792
This squad to counter the
Scouts ain't even legit!

00:13:47.792 --> 00:13:51.042
It's nothin' more than a guise I thought up.

00:13:51.042 --> 00:13:55.000
Just to make those shits on
the council nod their heads.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.417
Then why are we here?!

00:13:57.417 --> 00:14:02.042
Well, I'll tell you why! It's all for a grand dream!

00:14:03.125 --> 00:14:05.625
Power rivaling a god...

00:14:07.458 --> 00:14:13.167
All who get their hands on that power
somehow become compassionate.

00:14:13.167 --> 00:14:16.500
Would it be the same for a shit like me?

00:14:17.625 --> 00:14:19.500
I gotta know.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.375
What does it feel like?

00:14:22.375 --> 00:14:26.542
From their point of view,
what do they actually see?

00:14:28.583 --> 00:14:31.083
Could trash like me...

00:14:33.292 --> 00:14:38.042
...see the world the same way you saw it?

00:14:44.083 --> 00:14:47.542
Well, Uri?

00:14:56.333 --> 00:14:57.583
Kenny...

00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:08.958
"Ackermann Family" "A family of warriors who once served
the royal government. They began to be persecuted after
distancing themselves from the royal family. Some
experience a mysterious 'awakening' and gain abilities."

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:18.708
With those burns and that blood loss...

00:15:18.708 --> 00:15:21.542
...there's no helping you now.

00:15:24.125 --> 00:15:25.833
Yeah?

00:15:27.167 --> 00:15:28.958
I wonder...

00:15:32.208 --> 00:15:37.667
I swiped this little one right out of Rod's bag.

00:15:37.667 --> 00:15:42.833
Seems if I inject this... I'll turn into a Titan.

00:15:44.083 --> 00:15:48.542
One of those dumb Titans... unfortunately.

00:15:48.542 --> 00:15:52.708
For a while... it should extend my...

00:15:52.708 --> 00:15:54.500
...life.

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:07.875
You've had the time and
strength to inject yourself.

00:16:07.875 --> 00:16:10.750
Why haven't you?

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:12.417
Yeah...

00:16:12.417 --> 00:16:14.625
I wonder...

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:19.000
If I don't inject it right...

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.375
...I might end up like he did...

00:16:22.375 --> 00:16:25.583
...all messed up.

00:16:25.583 --> 00:16:29.417
I know you're not sitting here waiting to die.

00:16:29.417 --> 00:16:32.333
Don't you have a better excuse?

00:16:33.583 --> 00:16:36.958
I... don't wanna die...

00:16:36.958 --> 00:16:39.417
...and wanted power.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.458
But... I see...

00:16:46.083 --> 00:16:51.958
I think I understand why
he did it, after all this time...

00:16:51.958 --> 00:16:53.167
Huh?

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:08.583
Everybody I've met... was all the same.

00:17:09.958 --> 00:17:12.250
Drinking...

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:14.333
Women...

00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:16.667
Worshiping God, even...

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:19.375
Family...

00:17:19.375 --> 00:17:21.083
The King...

00:17:21.083 --> 00:17:23.000
Dreams...

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.417
Children...

00:17:25.417 --> 00:17:26.958
Power...

00:17:28.292 --> 00:17:35.458
Everyone had to be drunk on
somethin' to keep pushing on...

00:17:35.458 --> 00:17:39.625
Everyone... was a slave to somethin'.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.500
Even him...

00:17:51.333 --> 00:17:54.375
A-And what are you?

00:17:54.375 --> 00:17:56.250
A hero?!

00:17:58.458 --> 00:18:02.208
Kenny. Tell me everything you know!

00:18:02.208 --> 00:18:06.292
Why doesn't the First King
want humanity to survive?!

00:18:06.292 --> 00:18:08.625
Beats me...

00:18:08.625 --> 00:18:12.083
But... we Ackermanns...

00:18:12.083 --> 00:18:16.208
...opposed him... for that reason.

00:18:18.292 --> 00:18:21.917
My last name seems to be Ackermann, too.

00:18:21.917 --> 00:18:26.625
You... What were you to my mother?

00:18:26.625 --> 00:18:28.875
Heh, you idiot...

00:18:29.917 --> 00:18:32.583
Just her brother.

00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:43.292
That day... why?

00:18:43.292 --> 00:18:45.458
Why did you leave me?

00:18:50.167 --> 00:18:52.458
Because...

00:18:52.458 --> 00:18:55.750
...I'm not meant to be...

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:58.333
...someone's father...

00:19:13.583 --> 00:19:15.000
Kenny...

00:19:42.417 --> 00:19:46.042
That girl toppled the Titan
bigger than the wall?!

00:19:46.042 --> 00:19:49.667
Yeah! All the people of
Orvud District witnessed it!

00:19:49.667 --> 00:19:53.625
She saved us from that Titan
with such a tiny body?!

00:19:53.625 --> 00:19:58.542
Her father ruled as King from the
shadows, but she ended his tyranny!

00:19:58.542 --> 00:20:01.167
She's our true ruler of the walls!

00:20:01.167 --> 00:20:03.667
Queen Historia!

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:08.792
Let me deal the killing blow to the Titan.

00:20:08.792 --> 00:20:14.250
That way, we can unite the walls
as one and stabilize the situation!

00:20:15.667 --> 00:20:18.708
To think she actually dealt the killing blow...

00:20:31.625 --> 00:20:34.750
Hold on... You're seriously doing it, Historia?

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:36.542
Yeah, I am.

00:20:36.542 --> 00:20:41.250
Mikasa was just joking about it! Right, Mikasa?

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:45.750
After you smack him, tell him this...
"I dare you to hit me back."

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:48.292
Damn you...!

00:20:48.292 --> 00:20:51.083
If it's not a real grudge, just forget it.

00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:54.000
If I can't do this,
how can I call myself Queen?

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.083
Hell yeah, Historia. That's the spirit!

00:21:14.458 --> 00:21:16.583
Whoa!

00:21:17.625 --> 00:21:20.292
How'd you like that?! I'm the Queen!

00:21:20.292 --> 00:21:21.750
If you got a problem--

00:21:25.167 --> 00:21:28.042
Thank you... all of you.

00:21:39.708 --> 00:21:40.958
Reiner!

00:21:52.917 --> 00:21:55.167
I won.

00:21:55.167 --> 00:21:58.708
Saving Annie can come later.

00:21:58.708 --> 00:22:03.250
Retrieving the Coordinate is
our priority, as it should be.

00:22:06.167 --> 00:22:10.667
If we just wait here, it'll come to us.

00:23:57.833 --> 00:24:01.333
They thought themselves special...

00:24:01.333 --> 00:24:08.917
When a certain man imparts old tales,
Eren learns the past of his father, Grisha.

00:24:08.917 --> 00:24:12.096
Next episode: "Bystander."
