00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:23.917
Levi and the Scouts clashed with Kenny's squad,
charging straight into their defense.

00:00:23.917 --> 00:00:28.042
All to reach and rescue Eren and Historia.

00:00:28.042 --> 00:00:29.375
However...

00:00:36.875 --> 00:00:39.125
Fall back to the final defensive post!

00:00:39.125 --> 00:00:41.500
Time to regroup!

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.125
I'm praying, Historia.

00:00:44.125 --> 00:00:48.208
For God to lead and guide humanity!

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.000
God, my ass!

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.667
You're just giving yourself an out
and manipulating other people!

00:00:54.667 --> 00:00:59.125
I've had it! I won't let you kill me!

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:00.917
That's the spirit!

00:01:00.917 --> 00:01:02.792
This is gettin' good!

00:01:02.792 --> 00:01:04.667
You escape from here.

00:01:04.667 --> 00:01:07.583
I'll destroy everything else!

00:01:07.583 --> 00:01:09.458
Father...

00:01:09.458 --> 00:01:11.208
Uri...

00:01:11.208 --> 00:01:12.833
Frieda...

00:01:12.833 --> 00:01:14.917
Wait for me...

00:01:14.917 --> 00:01:16.542
...now...

00:03:04.917 --> 00:03:08.417
It's gotta be a way through
if it's all plugged up.

00:03:08.417 --> 00:03:09.500
Shit.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.667
If only we had some gunpowder left...

00:03:12.667 --> 00:03:15.375
We cannot let them through!

00:03:15.375 --> 00:03:17.875
As long as we hold here, we're good!

00:03:23.167 --> 00:03:24.167
That's...

00:03:24.167 --> 00:03:25.625
A Titan transformed?

00:03:25.625 --> 00:03:26.875
Eren!

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.875
Here it comes! Hang on tight!

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.833
Th-This place is gonna collapse!

00:03:52.625 --> 00:03:54.333
Captain!

00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:55.625
The hole!

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.083
Armin! Moblit! Take Hange
and get the hell out of here!

00:04:05.708 --> 00:04:07.375
Rod Reiss!

00:04:07.375 --> 00:04:09.417
You bastard!

00:04:09.417 --> 00:04:11.083
Forget it, Historia!

00:04:11.083 --> 00:04:15.750
Since that Titan's from the Reiss family,
just let him come and eat me!

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.375
Get out of here!

00:04:17.375 --> 00:04:18.250
Hell no!

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.333
Why won't you listen?!

00:04:20.333 --> 00:04:25.083
I might be humanity's enemy, but I'm your ally!

00:04:25.083 --> 00:04:28.500
I can't be a good girl,
and I don't wanna be God either!

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.542
But...

00:04:29.542 --> 00:04:33.458
When I see people crying to themselves,
saying they're not needed...

00:04:33.458 --> 00:04:36.958
...I wanna tell those people
that's just not true!

00:04:36.958 --> 00:04:40.500
No matter who! No matter where!

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.042
I'll come to their rescue!

00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:48.500
Historia!

00:04:50.167 --> 00:04:51.250
You okay?

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.583
Mikasa!

00:04:55.708 --> 00:04:56.833
Give me the keys!

00:04:56.833 --> 00:04:59.042
Captain? You guys...

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.417
Conny, hurry!

00:05:04.417 --> 00:05:05.750
Forget about me!

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.667
Captain! Hurry and escape!

00:05:07.667 --> 00:05:10.417
Shut up already, you topless wimp!

00:05:10.417 --> 00:05:13.958
It's not just a Titan!
There're dudes with guns coming for us!

00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.208
He's loose!

00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.208
I think...

00:05:19.208 --> 00:05:22.458
That's way bigger than
the Colossal Titan, isn't it?

00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:28.208
The ceiling...? Look out!

00:05:28.208 --> 00:05:29.375
Get back!

00:05:36.458 --> 00:05:40.833
Hey, hey, Rod! Ya done goofed up big time!

00:05:40.833 --> 00:05:44.083
You thought ya knew Titans
more than the rest of us!

00:05:44.083 --> 00:05:47.292
Now I know you didn't, ya dumb shit!

00:05:47.292 --> 00:05:49.000
Captain Ackermann!

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.708
Idiots! Get away!

00:05:54.792 --> 00:05:57.458
Shit! There's no way out!

00:05:58.917 --> 00:06:00.625
Why?

00:06:00.625 --> 00:06:03.292
Wasn't he going to eat me?

00:06:06.083 --> 00:06:08.542
Should I transform?

00:06:08.542 --> 00:06:12.792
No... My Titan can't withstand all this...

00:06:18.792 --> 00:06:21.625
I'm sorry, everyone...

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.125
I've been nothing but useless...

00:06:29.125 --> 00:06:35.292
Ever since the very beginning,
I was never the hope of humanity...

00:06:39.083 --> 00:06:41.292
Armor?

00:06:41.292 --> 00:06:44.792
What's this? Think you're some tragic hero?

00:06:44.792 --> 00:06:49.000
When have you ever accomplished
anything by your strength alone?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.667
What a weakling.

00:06:50.667 --> 00:06:53.042
We've been through much worse than this.

00:06:53.042 --> 00:06:55.917
Not that I wanna get used to it!

00:06:55.917 --> 00:07:00.708
Still, it's going to suck trying
to navigate through all that.

00:07:00.708 --> 00:07:02.750
I'll take Eren.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.500
We can't go nice and slow for you,
so hold on for your life.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.000
Right.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.042
It's useless. We can't escape.

00:07:11.042 --> 00:07:12.500
So do nothing?

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.708
You wanna sit here and hold hands
till we're crushed or burn to death?

00:07:16.708 --> 00:07:19.292
Because we're enemies of humanity?

00:07:20.583 --> 00:07:24.583
You know, I hate doing this
to you every time, but...

00:07:24.583 --> 00:07:25.792
Eren.

00:07:26.833 --> 00:07:29.208
You've gotta make the choice.

00:07:33.375 --> 00:07:35.125
I'll go with you!

00:07:42.792 --> 00:07:44.417
Eren!

00:07:44.417 --> 00:07:46.458
I'm sorry...

00:07:46.458 --> 00:07:50.708
Since it's the end, just this once...
I want you to let me...

00:07:51.875 --> 00:07:54.333
Let me believe in myself!

00:08:14.167 --> 00:08:16.125
What... the...?

00:08:16.125 --> 00:08:18.792
Everyone! Get underneath Eren!

00:08:23.417 --> 00:08:24.667
Caven!

00:08:43.292 --> 00:08:44.708
The chapel!

00:08:52.208 --> 00:08:53.250
Not good!

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.042
Let's try to run!

00:09:04.417 --> 00:09:06.875
Section Commander! Are you okay?!

00:09:06.875 --> 00:09:08.333
Yeah...

00:09:08.333 --> 00:09:10.208
What in the world happened?

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.208
What the hell is that?

00:09:27.708 --> 00:09:29.958
If it's that big this far away...

00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:33.292
It's gotta be twice as big
as the Colossal Titan.

00:09:33.292 --> 00:09:35.750
The wall won't stand a chance...

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:37.708
Commander?

00:09:37.708 --> 00:09:39.208
Advance!

00:09:48.917 --> 00:09:50.167
Eren!

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.208
Eren!

00:09:55.042 --> 00:09:56.375
Eren!

00:10:00.208 --> 00:10:01.458
Eren!

00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:14.958
"Titan Hardening" "An ability used by the Armored
Titan and so forth, for a Titan to harden their body.
While in hiding, Eren Jaeger conducted experiments
to replicate this ability in order to plug Wall Maria."

00:10:22.792 --> 00:10:25.542
That's what I call hardening.

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:30.917
Even after cutting you away,
the Titan hasn't disappeared.

00:10:30.917 --> 00:10:33.167
Pretty impressive, yeah?

00:10:37.542 --> 00:10:39.417
That bottle...

00:10:39.417 --> 00:10:44.583
Oh, yeah! Right before I turned into
a Titan, I drank that "Armor" bottle...

00:10:44.583 --> 00:10:46.167
Yeah.

00:10:46.167 --> 00:10:50.625
You couldn't do it at all before now,
but you used the hardening power.

00:10:50.625 --> 00:10:52.833
And saved all of us.

00:10:52.833 --> 00:10:57.958
In the blink of an eye,
you devised and built all this.

00:10:57.958 --> 00:11:05.000
Yeah, the construction looks shoddy, but...
I bet that's how the walls were made, too.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.458
In other words...

00:11:07.875 --> 00:11:12.042
It's possible for us to plug
that hole in Wall Maria now.

00:11:13.083 --> 00:11:15.667
A lot of enemies and allies
have died on the way,

00:11:15.667 --> 00:11:19.250
and getting this far hasn't been pretty,

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:23.833
but for as ugly as it's been,
look at the position we're in now.

00:11:25.208 --> 00:11:27.375
Retaking Wall Maria...

00:11:27.375 --> 00:11:31.667
Once we do that,
we can investigate my basement.

00:11:31.667 --> 00:11:34.833
But, my dad was actually...

00:11:41.458 --> 00:11:43.667
Captain!

00:11:43.667 --> 00:11:46.167
We've secured an exit!

00:11:46.167 --> 00:11:47.875
Armin's safe!

00:11:47.875 --> 00:11:50.375
Hange and Moblit, too!

00:11:50.375 --> 00:11:51.792
Well done.

00:11:51.792 --> 00:11:53.167
Eren!

00:11:53.167 --> 00:11:55.042
You okay?

00:11:55.042 --> 00:11:57.583
We're all safe, thanks to you!

00:11:57.583 --> 00:12:03.042
But to be perfectly honest, when you ran
off prancing while crying like a baby...

00:12:03.042 --> 00:12:04.667
...I thought we were doomed!

00:12:04.667 --> 00:12:10.625
"It's over, over! Get it together, nincompoop!
Quit bawling like a snotty-nosed brat!"

00:12:10.625 --> 00:12:12.167
is what I thought.

00:12:12.167 --> 00:12:13.333
Hey...

00:12:14.625 --> 00:12:15.958
Let's go.

00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.500
We're going after that big-ass Titan.

00:12:20.583 --> 00:12:21.792
Eren!

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.125
It's no use! Stay back! We'll get burnt!

00:12:56.125 --> 00:12:58.833
Commander, we can't stop it!

00:12:58.833 --> 00:13:01.792
It's like an Abnormal and doesn't care about us!

00:13:01.792 --> 00:13:03.625
Enough! Fall back!

00:13:03.625 --> 00:13:07.833
All that matters for now is to find
out the direction it's heading.

00:13:07.833 --> 00:13:11.208
Commander Erwin! It's Squad Levi!

00:13:11.208 --> 00:13:14.500
Eren and Historia are with them!
They succeeded!

00:13:20.542 --> 00:13:21.625
Erwin.

00:13:23.167 --> 00:13:24.792
Everyone all right?

00:13:24.792 --> 00:13:26.875
Hange's our only casualty.

00:13:28.792 --> 00:13:31.125
Seems like nothing too serious.

00:13:31.125 --> 00:13:33.542
Well done, everyone.

00:13:33.542 --> 00:13:36.917
I've got a whole slew of things
to report, but first...

00:13:36.917 --> 00:13:38.833
What's that Titan?

00:13:38.833 --> 00:13:40.542
It's Rod Reiss.

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:45.750
I think we'll need your call on this, Commander.

00:13:50.292 --> 00:13:54.042
Regardless, we don't have time
to stand here and chat.

00:13:54.042 --> 00:13:55.958
Return to Wall Sina.

00:13:55.958 --> 00:14:00.125
You're going to let that big ass
crawl right up to the wall?

00:14:00.125 --> 00:14:02.500
To Orvud District, actually.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.542
That's most likely where it's headed.

00:14:33.208 --> 00:14:35.958
Let's put this all together...

00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:43.417
Basically, Rod Reiss was after the Founding
Titan, the Titan power inside Eren.

00:14:43.417 --> 00:14:49.292
However, unless it's in someone with Reiss
blood, you won't get its true potential.

00:14:49.292 --> 00:14:54.333
Though, even if a Reiss obtains
the Founding Titan's power,

00:14:54.333 --> 00:15:01.375
they're controlled by the First King's will and
refuse to liberate humanity from the Titans.

00:15:01.375 --> 00:15:05.167
Eh? Well, isn't that interesting...

00:15:05.167 --> 00:15:09.250
According to the First King, this is true peace?

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:13.125
Now that's a weird way to look at it.

00:15:13.125 --> 00:15:18.000
In other words... we still have an option.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.208
If that Titan eats me,
Rod Reiss will return to a human.

00:15:23.208 --> 00:15:28.042
Which means it's still possible
to have a true Founding Titan.

00:15:28.042 --> 00:15:29.792
You can't...

00:15:29.792 --> 00:15:32.750
Seems that way.

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:35.875
We could capture Rod Reiss
once he becomes a human.

00:15:35.875 --> 00:15:38.292
Undo the First King's brainwashing.

00:15:38.292 --> 00:15:43.083
If we could do that, it might open
a path to save humanity.

00:15:44.708 --> 00:15:46.792
Plus, Eren...

00:15:46.792 --> 00:15:50.500
Are you saying you're fully
prepared to let that happen?

00:15:52.875 --> 00:15:54.167
I am.

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:01.208
Eren, you can't...

00:16:01.208 --> 00:16:03.667
You're forgetting our other option.

00:16:04.708 --> 00:16:08.875
First of all, the current plan is full of flaws.

00:16:08.875 --> 00:16:14.417
One, there's no proof that you can
undo Rod Reiss' brainwashing.

00:16:14.417 --> 00:16:19.875
No matter how you restrain him,
if he alters humanity's memories, it's over.

00:16:19.875 --> 00:16:25.500
Basically, there's too many factors about
the Founding Titan that we just don't know.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.250
True...

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:35.333
Even if Rod Reiss eats Eren, we have
no guarantee that he'll return to normal.

00:16:35.333 --> 00:16:37.125
Mmm.

00:16:37.125 --> 00:16:40.917
On the other hand, all we've ever
known is destructive pacifists.

00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:44.417
But as it stands, the Founding Titan
was taken from them.

00:16:44.417 --> 00:16:47.625
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance for humanity.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:50.125
Yes...

00:16:50.125 --> 00:16:55.208
Your father was trying to save us
and humanity from the First King.

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.208
He stole the Founding Titan from my sister...

00:16:59.208 --> 00:17:02.333
...murdered all of the Reiss children...

00:17:02.333 --> 00:17:05.125
...because he had no other choice.

00:17:07.458 --> 00:17:11.500
If you want to save Mikasa,
Armin, and everyone else...

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:15.708
...you must learn to control this ability!

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:19.167
Dad...

00:17:19.167 --> 00:17:20.500
That's right!

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:25.333
The Dr. Jaeger I know wouldn't do
something like that for no reason at all.

00:17:25.333 --> 00:17:30.708
Right. Even without having Reiss blood,
there must be a way to save humanity.

00:17:30.708 --> 00:17:33.833
That's why he left you the key to the basement.

00:17:38.125 --> 00:17:39.583
What basement?

00:17:39.583 --> 00:17:43.583
Oh, that whole thing?
You mean it's actually important?

00:17:43.583 --> 00:17:45.167
Uh, yeah...

00:17:45.167 --> 00:17:49.333
We've finally got a way to plug up the wall.

00:17:49.333 --> 00:17:52.542
The way I see it, there's only one choice.

00:17:52.542 --> 00:17:55.458
That makes life a little easier.

00:17:56.458 --> 00:17:59.667
If it means anything, I agree with that choice.

00:17:59.667 --> 00:18:02.708
Though, are you sure about this, Historia?

00:18:02.708 --> 00:18:08.625
We can't exactly have a Titan like that
wandering around inside the walls.

00:18:08.625 --> 00:18:11.917
One that big, we can't restrain.

00:18:11.917 --> 00:18:13.250
Meaning...

00:18:15.417 --> 00:18:18.625
We'll have to kill your father
and there's no way around it.

00:18:40.917 --> 00:18:42.250
Eren.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:44.000
I'm sorry.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.125
Eh?

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:48.250
Underneath the Reiss chapel...

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:53.833
...I really considered becoming
a Titan and killing you.

00:18:53.833 --> 00:18:58.083
What's more, not even to save humanity...

00:18:58.083 --> 00:19:01.292
Only because I wanted to believe my father.

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:05.958
I didn't want my father to hate me...

00:19:11.333 --> 00:19:14.208
But now, it's time to say goodbye.

00:19:32.333 --> 00:19:35.042
Please gather your squad in the hall.

00:19:35.042 --> 00:19:37.792
The strategy meeting is about to begin.

00:19:37.792 --> 00:19:39.208
All right.

00:19:40.583 --> 00:19:44.000
Historia. Forgot to tell you...

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.250
We need you to do something.

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:47.583
Yes?

00:19:49.917 --> 00:19:52.167
Erwin's orders.

00:19:52.167 --> 00:19:56.833
When this battle is over, since you're
the true successor to the throne...

00:19:56.833 --> 00:19:58.542
...become the Queen.

00:19:58.542 --> 00:19:59.500
Eh?

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:00.375
Huh?

00:20:00.375 --> 00:20:03.750
Q-Queen?! Historia?!

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:09.458
The coup d'état was successful, but the people
won't follow a regiment sitting at the top.

00:20:09.458 --> 00:20:11.833
What we need is a story to spread.

00:20:11.833 --> 00:20:16.917
That a true heir retook
the crown from the fake.

00:20:16.917 --> 00:20:18.583
I...

00:20:20.875 --> 00:20:22.833
Um, Captain?

00:20:22.833 --> 00:20:26.250
I'm sure you heard what
Historia said earlier, but...

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:28.083
Well, uh...

00:20:28.083 --> 00:20:34.542
By leaving her father, she finally broke free
from that burden, I guess you could say...

00:20:34.542 --> 00:20:36.083
And yet, again...

00:20:36.083 --> 00:20:37.417
What?

00:20:37.417 --> 00:20:39.417
If you have something to say, say it.

00:20:39.417 --> 00:20:41.042
Uh, um...

00:20:41.042 --> 00:20:43.125
I-In other words...

00:20:43.125 --> 00:20:45.083
Conny's trying to say...

00:20:45.083 --> 00:20:50.875
Historia broke free from the Reiss
family and has finally found herself.

00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:56.250
And now you're forcing her
into another role? Isn't that...?

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:58.458
Isn't that... not fair to her?

00:20:58.458 --> 00:20:59.417
All right.

00:20:59.417 --> 00:21:01.000
Eh?

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.208
My next duty is to be Queen, right?

00:21:04.208 --> 00:21:06.458
Understood.

00:21:06.458 --> 00:21:08.667
Historia...

00:21:08.667 --> 00:21:11.083
Thanks for your concern.

00:21:11.083 --> 00:21:19.250
But whether or not it's forced on me
is up to me to decide, I think.

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:21.042
However...

00:21:21.042 --> 00:21:24.667
Captain, I do have one condition.

00:21:24.667 --> 00:21:26.417
Hmm?

00:21:26.417 --> 00:21:30.750
Since my fate is my own,
I want to lay it all on the line.

00:21:41.042 --> 00:21:44.250
When you're Queen,
you can punch that runt in the face.

00:21:46.833 --> 00:21:49.500
We've determined the location
of Rod Reiss' Titan.

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.708
It's southwest, approaching Orvud.

00:21:51.708 --> 00:21:55.500
At this rate, it should reach
Orvud District by dawn.

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:56.958
Understood.

00:21:56.958 --> 00:22:01.375
Commander Erwin, we'd all
like to hear what your plan is.

00:22:01.375 --> 00:22:04.625
How do you intend to evacuate
the citizens in time?

00:22:04.625 --> 00:22:06.458
We won't evacuate.

00:22:06.458 --> 00:22:08.208
Wh-What?

00:22:08.208 --> 00:22:12.167
We'll have the citizens remain in
Orvud District just as they are.

00:22:12.167 --> 00:22:13.750
Uh...

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.708
Are you insane?

00:23:57.625 --> 00:24:03.042
At Orvud District, Eren and the others
face off against Rod Reiss' Titan.

00:24:03.042 --> 00:24:08.542
Meanwhile, Historia is determined
to decide her own fate.

00:24:08.542 --> 00:24:12.096
Next episode: "Ruler of the Walls."
