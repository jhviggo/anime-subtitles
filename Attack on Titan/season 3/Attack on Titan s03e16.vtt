WEBVTT

00:00:37.917 --> 00:00:39.750
H-Hey...

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:45.875
Those houses will drop on us.

00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:49.583
You think one of those houses... is Eren's?

00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:51.333
Eren's house...

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:54.125
...is <i>eaves</i>dropping!

00:00:55.417 --> 00:00:58.333
Sasha, could you smack Conny?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.417
I don't think he knows our location.

00:01:02.417 --> 00:01:03.500
Yeah.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.708
He's making Shiganshina a sea of flames
by scattering burning debris.

00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.125
That bastard...

00:01:12.125 --> 00:01:16.417
This time, you think you can
burn down my city?!

00:01:18.083 --> 00:01:21.167
A-Armin! The fire! Your orders?!

00:01:21.167 --> 00:01:22.958
Hurry it up!

00:01:24.208 --> 00:01:25.708
I can tell.

00:01:25.708 --> 00:01:30.125
You're standing there shaking so much,
you can't do a damn thing.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.333
Jean, can you take my place?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.625
I just have no idea... what to do...

00:01:41.625 --> 00:01:45.583
I was wrong reading Bertholdt,
and look where it got us.

00:01:45.583 --> 00:01:48.667
Jean! You're better suited for this!

00:01:52.375 --> 00:01:55.125
The river! Move to the river!

00:01:55.125 --> 00:01:58.458
Everyone ride on Eren! Conserve our gas!

00:02:03.042 --> 00:02:04.125
Eren.

00:02:04.125 --> 00:02:07.167
At some point, we'll have to
get Bertholdt's attention,

00:02:07.167 --> 00:02:09.500
but until then, don't let him see you.

00:02:10.625 --> 00:02:11.750
Armin.

00:02:13.542 --> 00:02:15.500
I'm all right at reading situations,

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.333
but I'm coming up empty
with a plan to get us out of this.

00:02:19.333 --> 00:02:22.083
In the end, we're all counting on you.

00:04:07.417 --> 00:04:09.375
We're done cleaning up here.

00:04:09.375 --> 00:04:13.542
The only small ones left
are the ones way at the front.

00:04:13.542 --> 00:04:17.208
Still, how will we take down the Beast Titan?

00:04:17.208 --> 00:04:21.125
He's perfectly content sitting
way over there, not moving an inch.

00:04:21.125 --> 00:04:24.458
Yeah, it seems he's a coward.

00:04:24.458 --> 00:04:27.583
Not like he's ever had balls to begin with.

00:04:27.583 --> 00:04:29.333
You take a break.

00:04:29.333 --> 00:04:31.958
We'll mop up the rest of the small ones.

00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:32.958
Let's go!

00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:34.250
Roger!

00:04:36.875 --> 00:04:38.167
Shit...

00:04:38.167 --> 00:04:40.208
What was that explosion?

00:04:40.208 --> 00:04:42.458
What happened to those guys?

00:04:42.458 --> 00:04:45.167
Did Hange and the others avoid it?

00:04:45.167 --> 00:04:47.417
I've gotta hurry to that side and...

00:05:16.292 --> 00:05:18.250
Hmm...

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.042
That one was a little bit high...

00:05:22.042 --> 00:05:24.875
Oh, leave it right there.

00:05:28.625 --> 00:05:32.625
Well, the first pitch was a warm-up.

00:05:32.625 --> 00:05:36.417
I'm going for a perfect game!

00:05:37.542 --> 00:05:39.000
Frontal bombardment!

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.208
All troops, take cover!

00:05:41.208 --> 00:05:42.042
Huh?

00:05:42.042 --> 00:05:42.875
What was that?

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:46.167
Shit! You guys!

00:06:13.458 --> 00:06:15.792
What the hell was that sound?!

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:17.708
Does the enemy have cannons?!

00:06:17.708 --> 00:06:19.958
If so, there's a hundred of 'em!

00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.750
Calm down! You're scaring the horses!

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.750
The Titan's throwing boulders!

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.167
Captain Levi!

00:06:26.167 --> 00:06:29.917
All of you, retreat to the wall with the horses!

00:06:29.917 --> 00:06:31.042
Roger!

00:06:32.667 --> 00:06:35.708
Hurry! Stay outta the line of fire!

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.833
Hey, stand up! You wanna die?!

00:06:45.583 --> 00:06:47.500
Commander!

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.917
How's it looking?

00:06:48.917 --> 00:06:50.375
Terrible.

00:06:50.375 --> 00:06:54.208
His throws have destroyed
the front line of houses.

00:06:54.208 --> 00:06:57.833
If he keeps on throwing,
everything will get leveled.

00:06:57.833 --> 00:07:00.500
We won't have anywhere left to hide.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.542
We can't retreat to the other side of the wall?

00:07:03.542 --> 00:07:04.833
No...

00:07:04.833 --> 00:07:08.208
The Colossal Titan is already heading this way.

00:07:08.208 --> 00:07:11.833
Spreading fire all along his path.

00:07:11.833 --> 00:07:17.542
Supposing we scale the wall to evade
the stones, we'd have to leave the horses.

00:07:17.542 --> 00:07:21.208
If we retreat here, there's no hope for victory.

00:07:21.208 --> 00:07:23.167
What happened to Hange's group?

00:07:23.167 --> 00:07:25.458
Is Eren all right?

00:07:25.458 --> 00:07:26.875
I don't know.

00:07:26.875 --> 00:07:30.625
But the majority of them
were caught in that explosion.

00:07:30.625 --> 00:07:34.000
We've been dealt a serious blow.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.917
The Beast Titan directed the small Titans
so our soldiers would group up in one place.

00:07:39.917 --> 00:07:46.458
As such, while engaging the small Titans,
Dirk Squad, Marlene Squad, and Klaus Squad

00:07:46.458 --> 00:07:49.833
were all wiped out by the bombardment.

00:07:49.833 --> 00:07:53.708
In other words, our remaining forces
this side of the gate...

00:07:53.708 --> 00:07:59.667
...consists of you new Scout recruits,
Captain Levi, and...

00:07:59.667 --> 00:08:01.083
...me.

00:08:06.167 --> 00:08:07.958
We're doomed!

00:08:07.958 --> 00:08:11.417
Erwin... Do you have any sort of plan?

00:08:14.875 --> 00:08:16.208
Yell at him, Eren!

00:08:16.208 --> 00:08:19.167
Don't let Bertholdt get any closer to the wall!

00:08:27.917 --> 00:08:29.292
He noticed!

00:08:33.042 --> 00:08:36.042
What?! That bastard's ignoring us!

00:08:36.042 --> 00:08:38.958
Hey! What now, Jean?! At this rate...

00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.542
I know that!

00:08:40.542 --> 00:08:43.917
Eren! Go stop his lanky legs!

00:08:46.833 --> 00:08:50.000
But still! How the hell
are we gonna defeat him?!

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.792
His gusts of hot steam make
our ODM gear useless! Right?!

00:08:55.792 --> 00:08:58.042
You don't think I know that?!

00:08:58.042 --> 00:09:01.250
But right now, we've got no choice but to try!

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.708
We've gotta figure out his weakness!

00:09:03.708 --> 00:09:06.833
I'll do it. You guys distract him.

00:09:06.833 --> 00:09:08.750
Conny, your Thunder Spear.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.833
R-Right!

00:09:10.833 --> 00:09:14.542
Armin, we need you to observe him from afar.

00:09:14.542 --> 00:09:16.292
So quit your moping.

00:09:16.292 --> 00:09:18.958
We gotta believe there's a way to beat him!

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:20.083
Right!

00:09:22.042 --> 00:09:23.833
Now! Scatter!

00:09:26.625 --> 00:09:28.958
Don't you dare look down on me!

00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.583
You're nothing more...

00:09:30.583 --> 00:09:34.458
...than a big damn wretched oaf!

00:09:50.875 --> 00:09:52.458
H-He's shoving him!

00:09:52.458 --> 00:09:55.583
Go, Eren! Knock him over!

00:09:55.583 --> 00:09:58.792
There has to be some sort of way!

00:10:02.125 --> 00:10:03.333
What?

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:14.708
Eren!

00:10:19.083 --> 00:10:22.500
Hey... Is that Eren?

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.750
He got himself flung on top of the wall?

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.417
By him...

00:10:30.625 --> 00:10:32.083
Eren's not moving...

00:10:32.083 --> 00:10:36.250
He's not dead! Focus on the monster at hand!

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:39.042
That might have been pushing it too far...

00:10:39.042 --> 00:10:42.833
If we run at him without a plan,
that's what happens.

00:10:42.833 --> 00:10:44.542
Unless...

00:10:44.542 --> 00:10:50.458
Unless we can somehow turn the tables on him,
this recovery operation, all of our lives,

00:10:50.458 --> 00:10:53.708
and the future of humanity will be doomed!

00:10:53.708 --> 00:10:58.458
Having said that, I'm not about to sit
around while we all get slaughtered!

00:10:58.458 --> 00:11:00.625
Let's go on the attack!

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:06.833
He doesn't know about Thunder Spears yet!

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:09.583
Conny, Sasha, and I will distract him!

00:11:09.583 --> 00:11:11.667
Mikasa will strike in the opening!

00:11:11.667 --> 00:11:13.042
Roger!

00:11:14.083 --> 00:11:17.167
Hey, moron! I'll poke out your stupid eyes!

00:11:17.167 --> 00:11:19.083
You huge idiot!

00:11:19.083 --> 00:11:21.375
You massive pervert lord!

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.042
This distraction is so obvious...

00:11:25.042 --> 00:11:27.875
But if we nail him with a Thunder Spear...!

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:49.917
Guys!

00:11:50.917 --> 00:11:52.542
Is it useless?

00:11:52.542 --> 00:11:55.958
His hot steam even knocked
away the Thunder Spears!

00:11:57.583 --> 00:11:58.417
Conny!

00:11:58.417 --> 00:12:02.458
Shit! Breathing it in burned my throat!

00:12:02.458 --> 00:12:04.667
Mikasa! You're bleeding!

00:12:04.667 --> 00:12:08.458
I'm fine. A bit of shrapnel from
the Thunder Spears got me.

00:12:08.458 --> 00:12:11.000
Thought of anything yet?

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Huh?

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.167
Have any clues for a counterattack?

00:12:18.583 --> 00:12:19.958
Not one...

00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:41.958
"A Titan's special powers are produced by using its
own body as a resource. Thus, it is thought
the steam emitted by the Colossal Titan consumes
muscle tissue and therefore must be finite."

00:12:55.792 --> 00:12:58.750
The Beast Titan has a good
guess where we're at.

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:01.875
This place will look like a honeycomb soon.

00:13:01.875 --> 00:13:03.417
Erwin.

00:13:03.417 --> 00:13:09.292
If you're saying we've got no chance to
counterattack, let's get ready to flee.

00:13:09.292 --> 00:13:11.833
Wake Eren sprawled out up there.

00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:15.042
Ride him and flee with
as many people as possible.

00:13:15.042 --> 00:13:17.708
At least we'll have some survivors.

00:13:18.875 --> 00:13:21.417
Hey! The horse got away!

00:13:21.417 --> 00:13:23.000
That was your job!

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.333
Shut up! Like it matters!

00:13:25.333 --> 00:13:27.042
Excuse me?!

00:13:27.042 --> 00:13:31.333
Those Scouts were insanely strong
and they died in an instant!

00:13:31.333 --> 00:13:33.875
You know as well as I do!

00:13:33.875 --> 00:13:36.625
What good is protecting horses...

00:13:36.625 --> 00:13:40.042
...when there's nobody left to ride them home?!

00:13:44.833 --> 00:13:47.667
It all made sense at one point...

00:13:47.667 --> 00:13:50.333
If humanity just hid behind the walls,

00:13:50.333 --> 00:13:54.208
we'd someday get slaughtered
by Titans out of nowhere.

00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:58.000
Somebody has to bite the bullet
and risk taking action.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.458
In order for others to not become victims,

00:14:00.458 --> 00:14:04.542
we needed people to become
the victims themselves.

00:14:04.542 --> 00:14:07.125
Who will be that brave soldier?

00:14:07.125 --> 00:14:14.792
When I was asked that, I actually
believed I could be that someone!

00:14:14.792 --> 00:14:17.167
But I never thought...

00:14:17.167 --> 00:14:19.875
...that being sent to my death...

00:14:19.875 --> 00:14:24.917
...would turn out to be so
utterly meaningless in the end!

00:14:24.917 --> 00:14:26.458
Now that I think about it,

00:14:26.458 --> 00:14:31.250
I bet almost everyone ends up
saying the same thing as me.

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:34.667
Why did I ever think that I'd...

00:14:34.667 --> 00:14:37.333
...somehow be different?

00:14:42.375 --> 00:14:46.583
What if whoever's left of the recruits
and Hange's group scatter on horses...

00:14:46.583 --> 00:14:48.750
...and try to make it home?

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:53.542
By using them as a decoy,
you guys could escape on Eren.

00:14:53.542 --> 00:14:56.917
Levi. What would you do?

00:14:56.917 --> 00:15:00.292
I'm facing the Beast Titan.
I'll draw him away--

00:15:00.292 --> 00:15:01.625
Impossible.

00:15:01.625 --> 00:15:04.250
You won't even get close.

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:05.917
Probably not.

00:15:05.917 --> 00:15:11.125
But if you and Eren return
home alive, there's still hope.

00:15:11.125 --> 00:15:15.500
Isn't that the best we can
ask for at this point?

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.708
What a huge defeat...

00:15:17.708 --> 00:15:19.708
To be perfectly honest,

00:15:19.708 --> 00:15:24.167
I doubt a single one of us
is making it back alive.

00:15:24.167 --> 00:15:28.250
Yes, assuming we had no way to counterattack.

00:15:31.958 --> 00:15:33.792
Is there a way?

00:15:33.792 --> 00:15:35.375
Yes.

00:15:35.375 --> 00:15:37.708
Why didn't you say that sooner?

00:15:37.708 --> 00:15:41.083
Why'd you keep your shitty mouth shut?

00:15:41.083 --> 00:15:47.083
If the plan goes well, you may be able
to take down the Beast Titan.

00:15:47.083 --> 00:15:49.167
But it will take the recruits...

00:15:49.167 --> 00:15:51.625
...and myself to give our lives.

00:15:56.583 --> 00:15:58.917
It's like you said.

00:15:58.917 --> 00:16:01.958
Either way, most of us will die.

00:16:03.042 --> 00:16:07.833
No, it's almost guaranteed
we'll all be wiped out.

00:16:07.833 --> 00:16:13.458
In which case, we can stake our heroic
deaths on a slim chance of victory.

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:16.458
For this to work...

00:16:16.458 --> 00:16:19.000
To ask these young ones to die,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.875
it would take an expert con man
and a whole slew of lies.

00:16:23.875 --> 00:16:28.458
If I do not lead the vanguard,
none of them will follow.

00:16:28.458 --> 00:16:31.333
And I will die before anyone else.

00:16:31.333 --> 00:16:37.000
Without ever learning what's in the basement...

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.292
Huh?

00:16:45.458 --> 00:16:47.208
I...

00:16:47.208 --> 00:16:50.542
I want to go to the basement.

00:16:50.542 --> 00:16:53.000
Everything I've done till now...

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.917
...was because I thought this day would come.

00:16:56.875 --> 00:17:00.875
That someday, I could check if I was right.

00:17:02.167 --> 00:17:06.750
So many times... I thought death
would be so much easier.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:12.042
But always, the dream I shared with
my father flashed through my mind.

00:17:12.042 --> 00:17:17.667
And now, I'm close enough to the
answers to reach out and grab them.

00:17:20.125 --> 00:17:22.750
They're right there...

00:17:25.542 --> 00:17:27.292
But, Levi...

00:17:29.042 --> 00:17:32.292
Can you see them? Our comrades?

00:17:35.792 --> 00:17:38.750
Our comrades are looking at us.

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:42.875
They want to know what became
of the hearts they gave.

00:17:42.875 --> 00:17:45.792
Because the fighting isn't over yet.

00:17:52.542 --> 00:17:55.417
Is it all just inside my head?

00:17:55.417 --> 00:17:58.458
Nothing more than a childish delusion?

00:18:04.042 --> 00:18:06.958
You've fought well.

00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:10.625
It's all thanks to you that we've come this far.

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.375
I'm making the choice.

00:18:16.125 --> 00:18:18.792
Give up on your dream and die.

00:18:18.792 --> 00:18:22.125
Lead the recruits straight into hell.

00:18:22.125 --> 00:18:25.667
I will take down the Beast Titan.

00:18:47.333 --> 00:18:49.500
Charge!

00:18:53.875 --> 00:18:59.000
Well, I figured they wouldn't
lie down and die, but...

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.083
A suicide charge?

00:19:01.083 --> 00:19:05.292
Here I was thinking they
could do better than that...

00:19:05.292 --> 00:19:07.792
Now! Fire!

00:19:11.833 --> 00:19:13.708
Smoke?

00:19:13.708 --> 00:19:17.250
Oh, it's those signal things...

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:20.000
Tsk! It's coming, move!

00:19:23.792 --> 00:19:26.583
I'm announcing our final operation!

00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:28.458
All troops, line up!

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:32.500
We will be doing a cavalry charge.

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:35.542
Our goal: To rush the Beast Titan.

00:19:35.542 --> 00:19:39.625
Of course, we'll be making
ourselves ideal targets.

00:19:39.625 --> 00:19:44.458
So we'll wait until he's ready to throw
and fire our smoke signals together.

00:19:44.458 --> 00:19:47.875
That should reduce his accuracy somewhat.

00:19:47.875 --> 00:19:53.250
While we're acting as a decoy,
Captain Levi will kill the Beast Titan.

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:55.750
That is our plan.

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:57.125
What?

00:19:57.125 --> 00:20:00.583
You want me to go after him
with just ODM gear?

00:20:00.583 --> 00:20:02.833
He's standing in an empty area.

00:20:02.833 --> 00:20:05.833
There's not even a house or tree in sight.

00:20:05.833 --> 00:20:07.208
Wrong...

00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:12.250
There happens to be a line of
objects at just the right height.

00:20:13.833 --> 00:20:16.625
Sneak close using the Titans...

00:20:16.625 --> 00:20:19.083
...and assassinate the Beast Titan.

00:20:26.292 --> 00:20:27.917
I'm sorry...

00:20:35.417 --> 00:20:39.667
Standing and waiting just means
we'll be showered by more boulders.

00:20:39.667 --> 00:20:42.792
Get ready on the double!

00:20:42.792 --> 00:20:46.083
Are we all... heading...

00:20:46.083 --> 00:20:48.625
...to our deaths?

00:20:48.625 --> 00:20:50.458
Yes.

00:20:50.458 --> 00:20:53.750
If we're gonna die anyways,
you're saying it's better...

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:57.292
...if we die fighting?

00:20:57.292 --> 00:20:58.792
Yes.

00:20:58.792 --> 00:21:01.875
Wait... If we're gonna die anyways,

00:21:01.875 --> 00:21:06.042
no matter how we die,
even if it's disobeying orders,

00:21:06.042 --> 00:21:08.208
it all means nothing, right?

00:21:08.208 --> 00:21:10.292
You're precisely right.

00:21:11.292 --> 00:21:13.292
It's all meaningless.

00:21:13.292 --> 00:21:15.958
No matter what dreams or hopes you had...

00:21:16.958 --> 00:21:20.792
No matter how blessed a life you've lived...

00:21:20.792 --> 00:21:23.958
It's all the same if you're shredded by rocks.

00:21:23.958 --> 00:21:25.875
Everyone will die someday.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.417
Does that mean life is meaningless?

00:21:30.417 --> 00:21:33.833
Was there even any meaning in our being born?

00:21:34.958 --> 00:21:37.625
Would you say that of our fallen comrades?

00:21:37.625 --> 00:21:41.708
Their lives... Were they meaningless?

00:21:43.125 --> 00:21:44.667
No, they weren't!

00:21:44.667 --> 00:21:48.083
It's we who give meaning
to our comrades' lives!

00:21:48.083 --> 00:21:51.417
The brave fallen! The anguished fallen!

00:21:51.417 --> 00:21:55.792
The ones who will remember
them... are us, the living!

00:21:55.792 --> 00:22:01.125
We die trusting the living who follow
to find meaning in our lives!

00:22:01.125 --> 00:22:07.208
That is the sole method in which we
can rebel against this cruel world!

00:22:07.208 --> 00:22:09.375
My soldiers, rage!

00:22:09.375 --> 00:22:11.667
My soldiers, scream!

00:22:11.667 --> 00:22:14.667
My soldiers, fight!

00:23:57.458 --> 00:24:00.125
For friends who gave up their hearts...

00:24:00.125 --> 00:24:02.625
For friends who gave up their dreams...

00:24:02.625 --> 00:24:07.083
Until everything burns out,
they will continue running...

00:24:07.083 --> 00:24:09.917
...inside the chaos and panic.

00:24:09.917 --> 00:24:12.096
Next episode: "Hero."
