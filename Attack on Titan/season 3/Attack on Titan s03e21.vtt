00:00:26.083 --> 00:00:31.083
The soldiers had their lives squeezed
out of them like fruit being juiced...

00:00:31.083 --> 00:00:33.125
...and their scraps cast into the sea.

00:00:41.917 --> 00:00:45.500
I suppose I should explain what the sea is.

00:00:46.875 --> 00:00:52.333
The sea is a body of salt water that
covers 70% of our world's surface.

00:02:42.167 --> 00:02:44.917
Owl... Who are you?

00:02:47.458 --> 00:02:49.500
I am Eren Kruger.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.083
As you just saw, I possess
one of the Nine Titans.

00:02:54.083 --> 00:02:57.625
In other words, I'm a Subject
of Ymir, just like you.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.917
You pretended to be a Marleyan
and infiltrated Public Security?

00:03:02.917 --> 00:03:04.625
What about the blood tests?!

00:03:04.625 --> 00:03:08.292
That was easy enough with the help of a doctor.

00:03:08.292 --> 00:03:10.792
Doctors make good spies.

00:03:10.792 --> 00:03:14.000
In all honesty, you did very well.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.458
But in terms of results, Grice had
every right to grieve like he did.

00:03:20.042 --> 00:03:22.417
You're absolutely right...

00:03:22.417 --> 00:03:28.583
I was a useless father, a useless
husband, and a useless man.

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:33.500
And yet, why am I the only one
who remains as a human?

00:03:36.708 --> 00:03:41.833
Dina was someone special,
being a Subject of Ymir with royal blood.

00:03:41.833 --> 00:03:44.250
She can tap into a Titan's true power.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.042
If you hadn't jumped to keep
me quiet, Dina would--

00:03:50.292 --> 00:03:53.375
Answer me! Why did you let only me live?!

00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:58.042
Enough. Don't your fingers hurt?

00:03:58.042 --> 00:04:00.167
Thanks so much for your concern!

00:04:00.167 --> 00:04:03.958
You didn't seem to care so much
when you were chopping them off!

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.375
Well?! If you had gone on a rampage
as your Titan sooner,

00:04:08.375 --> 00:04:11.000
wouldn't the others not be Titans right now?!

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.375
What was the whole point of
letting them become Titans?!

00:04:17.667 --> 00:04:20.250
What's wrong? You look pale...

00:04:22.083 --> 00:04:25.375
It wasn't just fellow patriots...

00:04:25.375 --> 00:04:29.292
I've severed thousands of fingers
from Subjects of Ymir...

00:04:29.292 --> 00:04:32.292
...and made them into Titans.

00:04:32.292 --> 00:04:34.667
Women and children, too...

00:04:36.083 --> 00:04:39.708
All while believing it was for the sake of Eldia.

00:04:42.167 --> 00:04:44.750
I don't have much time, Grisha.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.375
I'm entrusting you with the final task.

00:04:47.375 --> 00:04:50.542
Not anyone else. Just you.

00:04:58.542 --> 00:05:02.583
That day... The day I first met you,

00:05:02.583 --> 00:05:04.875
if none of that had happened,

00:05:04.875 --> 00:05:10.167
you wouldn't have festered enough
hatred of Marley to come this far.

00:05:10.167 --> 00:05:14.875
Is that... the reason you chose me?

00:05:14.875 --> 00:05:17.542
That's part of it.

00:05:17.542 --> 00:05:21.167
The country... Your father... Yourself...

00:05:21.167 --> 00:05:27.500
The hate in your eyes was enough
to burn the world to ashes.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.917
I was once like that, too...

00:05:30.917 --> 00:05:34.625
The royal family that stayed
behind formed a revolution.

00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:37.917
My father was part of it.

00:05:37.917 --> 00:05:41.625
However, they accomplished nothing at all...

00:05:41.625 --> 00:05:44.167
...and were burned alive.

00:05:44.167 --> 00:05:50.333
I was so young, all I could do was peek
through the closet door and watch.

00:05:50.333 --> 00:05:56.917
Ever since then, I've sworn revenge
on Marley and the revival of Eldia.

00:05:56.917 --> 00:06:01.625
But all I've managed to do is cut
the fingers off my fellow patriots,

00:06:01.625 --> 00:06:05.500
kick them off this wall,
and turn them into Titans.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:11.042
It's because of the things I've done
that my true identity was never discovered.

00:06:12.208 --> 00:06:14.833
I'm no different than when I was little.

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:19.167
Perhaps I'm still looking at the world
through a crack from the closet.

00:06:22.833 --> 00:06:26.083
Tell me, Owl.

00:06:26.083 --> 00:06:29.125
What is this task left for me?

00:06:31.292 --> 00:06:36.250
It's to infiltrate the walls and
retake the Founding Titan.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.042
After you inherit my Titan, that is.

00:06:40.625 --> 00:06:42.125
What did you say?

00:06:42.125 --> 00:06:44.042
That would mean... you...

00:06:44.042 --> 00:06:47.042
I'll be eaten by you as a Titan.

00:06:47.042 --> 00:06:51.042
You'll take the Founding Titan
from its owner the same way.

00:06:51.042 --> 00:06:53.125
Why aren't you doing it?

00:06:55.125 --> 00:07:00.417
Those who inherit the power of
the Nine Titans perish in 13 years.

00:07:00.417 --> 00:07:04.083
I inherited this power 13 years ago.

00:07:04.083 --> 00:07:08.083
The Owl called it "the Curse of Ymir."

00:07:08.083 --> 00:07:12.000
The founder Ymir lived that long
after her powers awakened,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
so it's only appropriate we live that long, too.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.667
I've got 13 years left...

00:07:18.667 --> 00:07:20.292
And you...

00:07:20.292 --> 00:07:22.875
Eight years left... Not even.

00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:25.083
You're wrong.

00:07:25.083 --> 00:07:28.250
This has to be... a mistake.

00:07:31.375 --> 00:07:33.083
It's wrong.

00:07:37.375 --> 00:07:43.250
If one possessing the power of the
Nine Titans dies without passing it on,

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:49.958
the power is inherited by a baby
yet to be born by a Subject of Ymir.

00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:56.875
It's as if all the Subjects of Ymir are
connected by something we can't see.

00:07:56.875 --> 00:08:00.417
One inheritor said they saw paths.

00:08:00.417 --> 00:08:03.292
The blood and bones that form a Titan,

00:08:03.292 --> 00:08:08.250
and at times, even memories and
thoughts are sent through those paths.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:13.000
All the paths cross at a single coordinate.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.708
In other words, that's...

00:08:15.708 --> 00:08:17.917
...the Founding Titan.

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:25.833
Every single Subject of Ymir
is connected to that coordinate.

00:08:25.833 --> 00:08:29.917
Who was the founder Ymir exactly?

00:08:29.917 --> 00:08:33.167
Under Marley authority,
she's a pawn of the devil.

00:08:33.167 --> 00:08:38.042
During the Eldian Empire era,
she was a miracle of God.

00:08:38.042 --> 00:08:41.333
Some say she touched the
source of all living matter.

00:08:41.333 --> 00:08:43.292
Who's to say they're wrong?

00:08:43.292 --> 00:08:44.250
Huh?

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:48.458
The only truth in this world
is that there is no truth.

00:08:48.458 --> 00:08:51.958
Anyone can become a god or a devil.

00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:55.958
All it takes is for people to believe it.

00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:59.667
You're the one who said that
Dina had royal blood in her.

00:08:59.667 --> 00:09:02.458
Was that a "truth" of yours?

00:09:02.458 --> 00:09:06.833
Unfortunately, Dina having
royal blood was true.

00:09:06.833 --> 00:09:08.792
Then why abandon her?

00:09:08.792 --> 00:09:14.125
Precisely because she had royal blood.
I couldn't let the enemy have her.

00:09:14.125 --> 00:09:18.042
It had to be done before Zeke
told Marley everything.

00:09:18.042 --> 00:09:19.125
Even so...

00:09:19.125 --> 00:09:20.917
Even so?

00:09:20.917 --> 00:09:26.792
Would she be better off giving birth to
children for the enemy her entire life?

00:09:27.958 --> 00:09:32.292
I've done my duty. You do yours.

00:09:32.292 --> 00:09:39.042
Only someone with the Power of the
Titans is capable of reaching the walls.

00:09:39.042 --> 00:09:43.000
To be perfectly honest,
I don't think I'm fit for the job.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.917
You will do it.

00:09:46.042 --> 00:09:48.542
Look at that...

00:09:48.542 --> 00:09:51.917
He was eaten alive by a Titan.

00:09:51.917 --> 00:09:56.292
And you asked if watching
that was interesting?

00:09:56.292 --> 00:09:58.333
It wasn't interesting at all.

00:09:58.333 --> 00:10:02.000
His screams of agony were unbearable to hear.

00:10:03.167 --> 00:10:07.292
I... didn't know any better.

00:10:07.292 --> 00:10:12.250
If I had known this was the price
of freedom, I wouldn't have paid it.

00:10:17.167 --> 00:10:18.625
Stand.

00:10:18.625 --> 00:10:20.083
Fight!

00:10:21.792 --> 00:10:25.583
For the sake of restoring
freedom and dignity to Eldia...

00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:27.208
Stand!

00:10:27.208 --> 00:10:29.292
I...

00:10:29.292 --> 00:10:30.667
...can't.

00:10:33.333 --> 00:10:36.542
Look. I brought this from your home.

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.125
I can't look.

00:10:40.125 --> 00:10:43.292
You can't look. Can't stand. Can't fight.

00:10:43.292 --> 00:10:45.208
Have you no balls?

00:10:45.208 --> 00:10:47.583
Did Marley castrate you?

00:10:47.583 --> 00:10:51.875
It's pointless to try and
make me recall my hatred.

00:10:51.875 --> 00:10:53.917
All I have left now...

00:10:55.375 --> 00:10:57.458
...are my sins.

00:10:57.458 --> 00:10:59.708
That's more than enough.

00:11:00.833 --> 00:11:07.375
The main reason I picked you was
because you left the walls that day.

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:11.875
That day, if you hadn't taken your
little sister and gone past the walls,

00:11:11.875 --> 00:11:14.583
you would've taken over your father's clinic,

00:11:14.583 --> 00:11:19.667
your sister may have grown up,
married, and even had children.

00:11:19.667 --> 00:11:23.417
But you did go outside the walls.

00:11:23.417 --> 00:11:27.375
Ever since the first day I kicked
a patriot off this wall...

00:11:27.375 --> 00:11:31.000
Ever since that day you took
your sister outside the walls...

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.417
We must push forward until
the price of our actions is paid.

00:11:35.417 --> 00:11:38.292
Even in death and after death.

00:11:43.375 --> 00:11:44.875
This is...

00:11:46.208 --> 00:11:49.167
...a story that you began, is it not?

00:12:01.042 --> 00:12:05.292
There are names given
to each of the Nine Titans.

00:12:05.292 --> 00:12:09.458
That includes the Titan you will inherit.

00:12:09.458 --> 00:12:13.792
No matter which era this
Titan has found itself in,

00:12:13.792 --> 00:12:17.875
it has ever pushed forward,
seeking out freedom.

00:12:17.875 --> 00:12:21.000
For the sake of freedom, it fights.

00:12:22.917 --> 00:12:24.792
Its name...

00:12:24.792 --> 00:12:26.917
The Attack Titan.

00:12:26.917 --> 00:12:31.958
"The true identity of Intelligent Titans stemming from a
power exceeding human comprehension that sleeps in
Subjects of Ymir. Said power is inherited along with
memories through paths which transcend space and time."

00:12:35.542 --> 00:12:37.042
What are you doing?

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.917
The Attack Titan.

00:12:42.917 --> 00:12:45.042
Didn't you just do that?

00:12:45.042 --> 00:12:45.875
No.

00:12:45.875 --> 00:12:50.375
Huh?! He did that, right?
Didn't you two see it just now?

00:12:50.375 --> 00:12:52.542
Yeah, but that was...

00:12:52.542 --> 00:12:55.625
See?! What was that all about, Eren?

00:12:55.625 --> 00:12:57.167
No, it's nothing.

00:12:57.167 --> 00:13:01.500
It's the name of your Titan, isn't it?
What were you doing talking to yourself?

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.750
Enough, Hange. He's 15 years old.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.708
Everyone goes through a phase.

00:13:06.708 --> 00:13:08.875
Huh? What kind of phase are we talking about?

00:13:08.875 --> 00:13:12.917
Hange, I'll explain to you later.
It's not right with him here.

00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:15.167
Huh? What do you mean by that?

00:13:15.167 --> 00:13:17.042
What the hell did you come for?!

00:13:18.083 --> 00:13:19.708
Get out.

00:13:19.708 --> 00:13:23.000
I'm supposed to be disciplined
for ten more days.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.500
It's over.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:27.375
Hange just now was punishment enough.

00:13:27.375 --> 00:13:30.750
We had a talk with Premier Zachary,
so don't worry about it.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:34.250
If we jail the heroes who toppled
the Armored and Colossal Titan,

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:37.000
it kinda sends a bad message, you know?

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.375
Plus, you were defying us morons who let
the Beast and Armored Titan get away.

00:13:42.375 --> 00:13:44.042
That's not...

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.083
Did you lose some weight?

00:13:50.083 --> 00:13:52.458
We had plenty to eat, though.

00:13:56.375 --> 00:13:58.875
You seem... good.

00:13:58.875 --> 00:13:59.917
I guess...

00:13:59.917 --> 00:14:02.958
Let's go. Get dressed quick.

00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:04.917
Where are we going?

00:14:04.917 --> 00:14:06.542
To an audience.

00:14:06.542 --> 00:14:09.167
Her Majesty has come to Trost.

00:14:16.083 --> 00:14:18.417
To my dear Historia...

00:14:18.417 --> 00:14:22.167
As I'm writing this, Reiner stands next to me.

00:14:22.167 --> 00:14:25.917
It's pretty obvious that he's
sneaking peeks at this love letter.

00:14:25.917 --> 00:14:29.917
He can be such a creep.
No wonder he's single.

00:14:29.917 --> 00:14:35.292
However, he did promise me
he'd deliver this letter to you.

00:14:35.292 --> 00:14:39.708
He says it's payback for
saving them that one time.

00:14:40.667 --> 00:14:42.667
I'm sorry about then.

00:14:42.667 --> 00:14:47.458
I never imagined I would end up
choosing them over you.

00:14:48.458 --> 00:14:50.667
It won't be long till I die.

00:14:50.667 --> 00:14:53.708
But I have no regrets.

00:14:53.708 --> 00:14:58.250
That's what I'd like to say,
but there is one thing...

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:01.625
It's that I wasn't able to marry you.

00:15:01.625 --> 00:15:03.208
Sincerely, Ymir.

00:15:18.125 --> 00:15:23.333
All the paths cross at a single coordinate.

00:15:23.333 --> 00:15:26.208
In other words, that's...

00:15:26.208 --> 00:15:28.250
...the Founding Titan.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.708
What... was that?

00:15:36.125 --> 00:15:37.167
Something wrong?

00:15:37.167 --> 00:15:38.833
Uh, no...

00:15:40.708 --> 00:15:42.417
Is that all there was?

00:15:42.417 --> 00:15:43.667
Yes.

00:15:43.667 --> 00:15:48.542
Of course, I doubt she was able
to write anything beneficial for us.

00:15:48.542 --> 00:15:52.000
Was there any secret message
only you would know?

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.167
Like a code?

00:15:54.167 --> 00:15:55.917
I don't know.

00:15:55.917 --> 00:15:58.708
But I doubt she would do something like that.

00:16:01.833 --> 00:16:04.708
Ymir's such a dummy...

00:16:04.708 --> 00:16:06.458
Such a dummy.

00:16:07.667 --> 00:16:11.208
You'd play it off the second
you're embarrassed...

00:16:11.208 --> 00:16:13.458
I just never know with you...

00:16:15.583 --> 00:16:16.708
We're here.

00:16:16.708 --> 00:16:17.750
Come in.

00:16:25.583 --> 00:16:26.750
Your Majesty.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:27.917
--Your Majesty.
--Your Majesty.

00:16:27.917 --> 00:16:31.750
S-Stop it. It's not an official position yet.

00:16:33.958 --> 00:16:37.250
So much has happened, hasn't it?

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:41.542
But all I did was stare at the
south sky from within the walls.

00:16:41.542 --> 00:16:44.667
It's an important duty of yours
just to stay alive.

00:16:44.667 --> 00:16:47.042
Yeah, that's right.

00:16:47.042 --> 00:16:50.542
I'm glad to see you're all acting like usual.

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:53.208
Well, that's...

00:16:53.208 --> 00:16:56.708
It just hasn't sunk in for us yet.

00:16:56.708 --> 00:16:58.458
Shall we get this going?

00:17:02.542 --> 00:17:05.083
<i>The Early Life of Grisha Jaeger</i>.

00:17:05.083 --> 00:17:08.042
<i>The Extent of Our Knowledge</i>
<i>of Titans and Their History</i>.

00:17:08.042 --> 00:17:10.250
<i>Information About the World Beyond the Walls</i>.

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:13.333
The only people who know about
the existence of these books

00:17:13.333 --> 00:17:16.708
are those here in this very room.

00:17:16.708 --> 00:17:19.708
These were gained by the
efforts of nine living Scouts...

00:17:19.708 --> 00:17:23.958
...and the 199 others who are not here today.

00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:28.875
Today, and in the Queen's presence,
I would like to assess our situation...

00:17:28.875 --> 00:17:32.792
...and establish an agreement
in terms of our course of action.

00:17:34.292 --> 00:17:37.083
Scout Regiment Commander Hange Zoë.

00:17:37.083 --> 00:17:38.167
Sir.

00:17:39.375 --> 00:17:43.250
The Scouts have lost a great
deal, including Erwin Smith.

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:46.375
But in exchange for the many heroes that we lost,

00:17:46.375 --> 00:17:52.125
we have retaken Wall Maria and
stolen the Colossal Titan's powers.

00:17:52.125 --> 00:17:58.417
However, humanity that lives within the walls
remains in a precarious situation.

00:17:58.417 --> 00:18:03.250
It would be a relief were Titans
the only monsters we had for enemies.

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:06.042
--However, the true identity of
the enemies we've been fighting

00:18:06.042 --> 00:18:06.917
--Then who's the enemy?!
--However, the true identity of
the enemies we've been fighting

00:18:06.917 --> 00:18:07.667
--Then who's the enemy?!
--are humans. A civilization.
You could even say...

00:18:07.667 --> 00:18:09.792
--Enemy?
--are humans. A civilization.
You could even say...

00:18:09.792 --> 00:18:10.958
--If I said that, the--
--are humans. A civilization.
You could even say...

00:18:10.958 --> 00:18:12.542
--If I said that, the--
--...the world.

00:18:14.583 --> 00:18:15.875
According to these,

00:18:15.875 --> 00:18:20.500
we're a special race called Subjects
of Ymir who can turn into Titans.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:24.000
There's also a belief that we
may rule the world again.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.542
That's why the world wishes to
eradicate us Subjects of Ymir for good.

00:18:32.875 --> 00:18:38.083
If the Founding Titan falls into
Marley hands, Eldians are done for.

00:18:39.208 --> 00:18:42.667
The King in the walls wouldn't
allow that to happen.

00:18:42.667 --> 00:18:44.750
The King in the walls won't fight.

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:46.750
Huh?

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:52.917
"If once again Eldia is driven to sin,
we will perish as it's meant to be.

00:18:52.917 --> 00:18:57.125
I have made a vow renouncing war
with the Founding Titan."

00:18:57.125 --> 00:19:02.708
He said that to the royal family on the
continent and then closed the walls.

00:19:03.792 --> 00:19:09.250
Did he not warn that the Titans of
the walls would flatten the earth?

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:12.167
Those words were meant to deter an attack.

00:19:12.167 --> 00:19:15.250
It allowed for a brief time of peace.

00:19:16.833 --> 00:19:19.583
The King of the walls stole
his people's memories

00:19:19.583 --> 00:19:23.250
and made them believe humanity
perished beyond the walls.

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:28.667
He surrounded himself with the ignorant
and babbled about paradise.

00:19:28.667 --> 00:19:31.917
A King who can't protect his people is no King.

00:19:31.917 --> 00:19:37.083
You must find that cowardly King
and strip him of the Founding Titan.

00:19:37.083 --> 00:19:39.625
That is our mission.

00:19:41.042 --> 00:19:43.917
Mr. Jaeger later achieved his mission

00:19:43.917 --> 00:19:48.000
and entrusted the Founding
Titan to his son Eren.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.250
In order to wield the
Founding Titan's full power,

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:55.500
it must be possessed by
someone with royal blood.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:59.167
However, even if that person
possesses the Founding Titan,

00:19:59.167 --> 00:20:01.500
they're enslaved by the King's ideals,

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:05.792
which only leads them down
the path to humanity's downfall.

00:20:05.792 --> 00:20:09.208
That is the vow renouncing war.

00:20:10.292 --> 00:20:17.542
However, Eren was able to control Pure Titans
in the past to escape a dire situation.

00:20:17.542 --> 00:20:20.250
So it may be possible even
without royal blood

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:24.625
for Eren to wield that power as well.

00:20:24.625 --> 00:20:27.000
That's right...

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.333
Just for that split second,
it felt like everything connected.

00:20:32.625 --> 00:20:33.958
Why?

00:20:34.917 --> 00:20:36.833
Why just then?

00:20:39.792 --> 00:20:42.542
My name is Dina Fritz.

00:20:42.542 --> 00:20:45.292
I'm a descendant of the royal family.

00:20:45.292 --> 00:20:46.458
It can't be!

00:20:49.417 --> 00:20:52.333
You scared me. What was that about?

00:20:52.333 --> 00:20:56.167
U-Uh... I-I...

00:20:58.667 --> 00:21:01.750
Please continue, our Titan.

00:21:06.125 --> 00:21:07.625
It's... nothing.

00:21:07.625 --> 00:21:08.833
Huh?

00:21:09.917 --> 00:21:12.208
Sorry for interrupting the meeting.

00:21:17.042 --> 00:21:21.208
Oh? I see... Right...

00:21:22.625 --> 00:21:26.083
It would seem that he is
having a phase of sorts.

00:21:26.083 --> 00:21:29.667
One where he acts up
and randomly yells things.

00:21:29.667 --> 00:21:33.083
Ah, I see. That's unfortunate.

00:21:33.083 --> 00:21:35.208
He's that age, I guess.

00:21:35.208 --> 00:21:36.833
Eren?

00:21:36.833 --> 00:21:40.417
I haven't told those two about it, either...

00:21:40.417 --> 00:21:43.375
That the Titan who killed my mom and Hannes

00:21:43.375 --> 00:21:46.917
was actually someone my dad
was married to before.

00:21:48.042 --> 00:21:51.833
What's more, if I talk about it...

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.708
If someone with royal blood
is made into a Titan that I touch,

00:21:56.708 --> 00:22:01.292
it might be possible for me to use
the Founding Titan's powers.

00:22:01.292 --> 00:22:04.708
That's right... It's just a possibility...

00:22:04.708 --> 00:22:10.250
But if they knew of that possibility,
what would the military do to Historia?

00:22:17.125 --> 00:22:19.000
Have a family.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:19.917
Huh?

00:22:19.917 --> 00:22:22.750
After you enter the walls, build a family.

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:26.500
What are you talking about? I have Dina...

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:31.458
Won't I forget the things you tell me
just before I become a Titan anyways?

00:22:31.458 --> 00:22:33.417
That's not always the case.

00:22:33.417 --> 00:22:35.625
And someone may see it later.

00:22:35.625 --> 00:22:36.542
Eh?

00:22:36.542 --> 00:22:40.000
Your wife, your child,
your neighbors if need be...

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.417
Love someone inside the walls.

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.417
If you can't do that, it'll only repeat.

00:22:47.417 --> 00:22:52.375
The same history... The same
mistakes... Over and over...

00:22:52.375 --> 00:22:58.000
To save Mikasa, Armin, and everyone else,
you must see it through.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.667
Mikasa? Armin? Who is that?

00:23:04.958 --> 00:23:08.458
Who knows? I'm not sure...

00:23:08.458 --> 00:23:10.542
Whose memories are those?

00:23:57.833 --> 00:24:01.250
They believed freedom
would come if they fought.

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:04.167
After viewing the sea of the outside world,

00:24:04.167 --> 00:24:08.833
what runs through their minds now,
knowing the truth of humanity?

00:24:08.833 --> 00:24:12.096
Next episode: "The Other Side of the Wall."
