00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.950
Me?

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.960
I'm just a guy who's a hero for fun.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.140
What kind of hero looks like that?

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.390
You

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.640
You're gonna pay for that.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.480
Do you have all of my money yet, mister?

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.650
Not quite

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.190
What will you do?
It's due tomorrow, you know.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.780
You do know what'll happen tomorrow

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.280
if you don't have my money?

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:09.460
Damn it!

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.800

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.270
Could you please give me just a little more”

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.400
Are you busy?

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.490
No, we were just wrapping things up.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.320
Bye, old man.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.780
See ya tomorrow!

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.420
Sorry about that.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.130
Don't worry about it.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.840
You're probably low on funds yourself.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.130
Sort of

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.590
Lately, I haven't been getting many clients.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.260
If I don't do anything,
my arms are gonna get flabby.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.260
But seriously, what did you do this time?

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.270
Did you run into someone really powerful?

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.480
Yeah.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.270
He was a little bit stronger.

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.770
He almost beat me.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:33.900
I see.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.530
Sorry, but I can't get this done today.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.440
I'll have to hold on to it.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.900
Oh, I'll count on you then.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.950
Oh yeah! There's something I have to show you.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.540
You're always tearing up that tracksuit, right?

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.290
So I wanted to make a special one
from a special material.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.000
Heroes are all about the
transformation, you know!

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.170
Oh!

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.880
A hero suit?

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.800
Exactly!

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.260
A suit that won't tear apart, a super suit!

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.770
<i>Man, this sucks!</i>

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.270
The idea came from the Montsuki Hakama.

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.520
<i>He gave it a name?!</i>

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.030
Montsuki Hakama

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:19.030
Well?

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.490
<i>How should I put it?</i>

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.240
<i>He obviously included his own tastes</i>

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.990
Nah, but thanks for the offer.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.540
You don't need to
worry about the money.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.290
This has been my childhood dream.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:36.920
<i>Crap</i>

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.290
<i>I don't really know</i>

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.050
<i>What should I say?</i>

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.590
Could it be that

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.760
you already asked a different tailor?

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.800
Hmm? Eh, umm

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.180
I see how it is

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.430
No, that's not it!

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.560
It's just that, uh, I thought I'd decide about it
after I've made a name for myself as a hero.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.570
<i>He's done so much for me
There's no way I can turn him down.</i>

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.820
Look

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.620
Do you know why I always
wear that same tracksuit?

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.410
It's because I don't want
to forget about my origin.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.920
Until I've made a name for myself,
that tracksuit will remind me where I came from.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.920
I see, so that's how it is.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.760
<i>Nice! He's buying it!</i>

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.390
On top of that, it's too early
to call me Montsuki Hakama.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:30.970
Is that so?

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.640
When I'm a professional hero,
I'll come to you myself.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.820
You're right¦ right now,
you only do this as a hobby.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.490
Tailor Shop

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.490
Anyway, I'll be back tomorrow.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:45.610
See you.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.490
Ah, one more thing!

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.740
I know it's just a hobby, but try not to
get too deep into this "hero" work.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.780
{=18}Tailor Shop

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.210
Lately, things around here
have been really rough.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.500
Really?

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.250
Yeah.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.540
Just have a look around.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.420
All these shops

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.090
All closed down due to lack of business.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.890
He told me he still doesn't have the money.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.890
I see

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.230
In that case, that store will be mine.

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.900
But boss, why do you want that old store?

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.230
It's not like it'd get you any business.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.610
I'm well aware of that.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.780
I'm not concerned about the money.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.580
The impulse

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.710
There's something inside me,
driving me to destroy everything I can.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.960
Boss, I got the papers for that candy shop.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.470
Nice, good work.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.470
I feel so good.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.350
I can tell it's close

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.600
Just a little more

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.480
<i>The tailor was right earlier.</i>

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.360
<i>A lot of stores have gone out of business.</i>

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.530
<i>And now that I think about it,
crime is really common around here.</i>

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:15.830
<i>On the streets,</i>

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.200
<i>in a house,</i>

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.950
<i>and that store earlier today.</i>

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.710
<i>In just a week, I captured three delinquents.</i>

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:27.210
<i>Is this area really not safe anymore?</i>

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.720
<i>What you see here is
the transformation of a rhinoceros beetle.</i>

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.140
<i>Wow, it's already started
to transform, professor!</i>

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:38.970
<i>Didn't I tell you that it looks
totally different in its larva form?</i>

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.970
How Beetles Transform

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.230
Oh, really?

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:43.060
Didn't know about that.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.230
Who is it at this hour?

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.230
What a bother

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.990
Do you have the rent?

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:01.330
You do realize you haven't
paid in 3 months, right?

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.420
Uh, you see, the thing is,

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.040
I don't have the money right now

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:08.460
I don't know if you're a hero or what

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:12.380
but I'm sure there's a way
you can make money with that.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.090
Don't say stuff like that.

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:18.850
Anyway, if you don't pay
the rent by tomorrow

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:21.100
I'll kick you out for sure.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.520
Crap.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.150
Tailor Shop

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.360
You're still young,
why don't you work part time?

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.320
It's not that simple.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.990
Don't beat yourself up.
After all, it's cheap, right?

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.570
Here you go.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:37.740
Your tracksuit.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:39.490
Oh, thanks!

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:44.960
But this tracksuit makes you look
less like a hero and more like a hobo.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.000
Try and be more careful.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.130
I won't be able to help you anymore.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.630
Today's the day, old man.

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:04.020
Alright then, I'll take this as payment.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.150
See ya later!

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:07.940
Who was that guy just now?

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.070
I'll have to close down now.

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:13.900
I mortgaged this shop for a loan.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.860
He's from the Niya Niya Loan group.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.530
For some time now, they've been
taking money to insure the shop.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:26.500
I can't keep up with the
fees and interest anymore.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.790
So you were cheated?

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:30.920
In any case,

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.210
the shop closes today.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.380
Why don't you go
to the police for help?

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.680
The police wouldn't be able to help.

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:41.310
They operate out of <i>that</i> apartment

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:45.600
where even the police can't interfere.

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.060
You've probably heard about it.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.110
Nope, what is it?

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:51.110
Huh?

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:52.570
You haven't?

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:58.320
<i>Go straight along this shopping district,</i>

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.740
<i>and you'll see a sign that says "Stop, Danger."</i>

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:06.290
Turn left at the junction where you see that sign.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.210
Keep going and you'll see a supermarket.

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:09.040
Got it?

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.960
Yeah.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:17.050
<i>The place is at the end of the narrow
street next to that supermarket.</i>

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:18.680
Listen,

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.140
Stay away from those apartments.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:27.230
That apartment building, now the resting den
of some evil organization, is also known as

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:28.890
the house of crime.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.640
<i>Just as I thought.</i>

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.150
<i>This is where I live.</i>

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.490
<i>No wonder the rent's so low.</i>

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:40.490
You do know what happens
if you can't repay your debt, right?

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:43.280
Hey! Do you know where
to find Niya Niya Loan?

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.290
Huh, you need a loan or somethin'?

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:47.750
No, that's not it
I have business with them.

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:50.420
What the”?
Then find it yourself.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.540
I'm busy right now, dumbass!

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:55.710
Oye, didn't you hear what I just said?!

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.100
Is this their base of operations?

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:13.610
Huh? Who is it?

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:16.360
Did you come to pay the rent?

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:22.570
That was close!

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:26.580
I had no idea who was in that room!

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.080
Niya Niya Loan, you said?

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.120
Yeah.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.330
I heard they operate
from these apartments.

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:34.840
Well, not from this room.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:39.920
Hey, you!

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.260
I don't know whoever it is you're after.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.220
But be careful which room you visit.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:51.190
Not everyone in this building is as nice as I am.

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:52.690
O-Okay.

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:53.650
I see.

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:56.070
<i>Time to check the other side.</i>

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:01.570
No one's home?

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.200
Hold on a second.

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:08.660
Who are you?

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.410
I'm a tenant here.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:13.080
Tenant? Of these apartments?

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.000
Yeah.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.710
I live on the other side.

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:17.460
I'm a hero for fun.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:22.050
Really? Keep at it, then.

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:24.180
Wait, did you say hero?

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.010
Crap. This is bad, big bro!

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:32.310
I think he realized we're counterfeiting!

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:34.100
I get it.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:39.780
You want to beat us up for the bounty, right?

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.950
<i>Bounty?</i>

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:45.990
I don't know if you're a hero or what,

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:50.080
but I'm sure there's a way
you can make money with that.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:52.290
I see.

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:55.080
So there's a bounty!{?}

00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:01.340
No doubt about it, I can see it in his eyes
that he wants to catch us!

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.590
Fine

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:06.090
Catch us if you can!

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.480
Huh? That guy

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:29.530
What?

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.000
That guy

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.420
is kinda freaking me out.

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:42.670
I've gotta warn the boss!

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:46.090
Oh, it's you.

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:48.680
Do you have my caramel macchiato?

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:51.930
Who is that guy? Police?

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:57.600
No, but he beat up a bunch of our guys!

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.230
What did you say?

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:03.110
I think he's here.

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:03.150
{=12}Money

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.860
Is it you?

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.870
The dangerous guy that's
been beating my men up?

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:15.370
You why are you dressed like that?

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:18.790
Are you really the boss of
those Niya Niya Loan guys?

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:21.040
What's it to you?

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.500
This is about the tailor shop.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.510
I've come to ask that you return
the store papers to its owner.

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:28.880
I'll be in trouble if there's
no one to fix my clothes.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.590
Don't fuck with me, kid!

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:33.220
You think I'm gonna return them
just because you asked?

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.810
Looks like you're pretty
confident in your strength.

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:38.640
But do you really think
brute force can solve everything?

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:41.400
That won't be necessary.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:43.690
What do you mean?

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:48.150
I think I pretty much get it.

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:51.030
I'll go and talk to them about this now.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:54.490
Hey, did you hear what I just said?

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:59.370
Yeah. That's why I said that
I'll bring back your papers.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.090
After all, if you close down,
who'll fix my clothes?

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:07.090
Hey, that's not why I brought it up.

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:08.470
Don't worry about it.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:11.260
I know what I'm doing.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:13.300
Look at this.

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:15.760
Listen.

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:19.140
If we're talking about the
maximum legal interest rate,

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:22.230
the tailor{ shop}'s debt has already been paid.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:28.860
Also, if it goes over the legal maximum,
it's called "overpayment."

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:33.780
In that case, you'll need to return the overpayment back to the shop.

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:40.790
Besides, there's no law that says
you can just take his store.

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:47.170
So please, give back the papers.

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:50.880
You beat up all of my men,

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:54.760
just to tell me this shit?

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:55.800
Huh?

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:56.970
Oh, no.

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:59.520
That was just an accident.

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:05.520
Interesting, isn't it?

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:11.700
Not bad Not bad at all!

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:25.080
I have a bad feeling about this

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:28.340
I really should've stopped him.

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:32.720
But, they're not the kind of people
who will understand these things.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.800
Well, I'll see how things go.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:38.350
And what if something happens to you?
I won't be able to forgive myself.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:41.100
Like I said, I'll see how things go.

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:44.310
Don't worry.

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:47.860
It may be a hobby, but I'm still a hero.

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:49.860
See ya!

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.120
Don't do anything reckless.

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.040
Haven't you heard about it?

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:11.380
People like me, who take evil to a whole
new level, we transform into monsters.

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:17.010
Finally, the moment has come-<i>gyu!</i>

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:19.640
Are you speechless from fear?

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:21.560
I see.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.850
I've never seen this before.

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:28.270
I've transformed into
the super strong monster of the sea!

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:30.400
I've become the Fish of Darkness!

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.190
No, you haven't transformed.

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:33.860
You're just a pervert.

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:37.490
I learned yesterday.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:46.160
<i>The caterpillar that hatches from the egg
becomes a pupa until adulthood.</i>

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:46.750
How Beetles Transform

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:46.750
<i>We call this</i>

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:48.750
Did you say pervert?

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:51.590
Yes, scientifically speaking.

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:53.840
Me? The Fish of Darkness?!

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:58.390
But you were already
a pervert to begin with.

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:00.800
And when a pervert
gets even more perverted

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.890
You just become a total pervert.

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:04.220
A total perv”

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.140
In other words

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:06.890
A hardcore pervert.

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:10.860
Don't fuck with me-<i>gyu!</i>

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:14.070
I'm a badass villain, not a pervert!

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.670
You're not half bad!

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:31.210
Right back at ya.

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.170
<i>I think I've reached my limit.</i>

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:39.090
It's not for nothing that I've got an
A-class bounty on my head.

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:42.390
A-class?

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.270
What's with that look?

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:54.440
Did you come to pay the rent?

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.110
I don't have money.

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:58.110
But I can give you these guys.

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:01.490
Money laundering,
underwear theft, and counterfeiting.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:04.240
In any case, they all have
high bounties on their heads.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.040
I've already called the police.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.120
That should be enough to pay the rent.

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:15.630
You, do you realize what you've done?

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:18.630
They were my main source of income

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:25.390
If I wanted the damn police,
I would've called them myself, jackass!

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:32.150
<i>That old lady</i>

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:35.270
<i>really kicked me out.</i>

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:43.370
I'm glad you're okay, Saitama.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:45.990
I see.

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:47.910
Well, I'm sorry about that.

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:50.370
I didn't like that place anyway.

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:53.290
I only liked the rent.

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:55.420
What are you gonna do now?

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:58.550
Well, for starters,
I have to find a new place to stay.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:01.550
There's a rumor going around

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:08.640
At the edge of City Z, there's a "ghost town"
that's so dangerous it's practically deserted.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:13.020
Nobody wants to live there anymore.

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:18.320
People say that all the
utilities still work, though.

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:20.400
I see.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.820
That's good.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.070
Saitama!

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:27.080
Thank you for protecting the store.

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:29.660
Yeah, you can count on me.

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:31.080
I'm still closing the store.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.170
For a while now, I've been thinking.

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:38.880
I'm too old for this.

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:40.800
I see.

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.390
I know it won't change muchвЂ¦

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.970
Of course, you don't have to
wear it if you don't want to.

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:52.730
But I want you to have this.

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:54.140
This is

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.150
I can finally feel satisfied with my work.

00:20:58.150 --> 00:20:59.360
Now that I think about it,

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:03.030
I was looking for an excuse to retire.

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:08.740
This is my greatest achievement.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.950
My masterpiece!

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:22.050
<i>I can already see a real hero in you.</i>

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:26.510
<i>You inspired me to make this suit.</i>

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:37.100
Won't I look like a weirdo in this?

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:42.030
So that's how it happened.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:47.820
For a while, I was embarrassed to wear it,
so I wore my tracksuit over it.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.620
But I got used to it.

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:53.700
Anyway, it's something important to me.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:00.420
I see!

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:05.380
So, in order to become a true hero,

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:12.220
you need to have something very
important to you, like you do.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:14.600
What?

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.140
However, Master,

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:19.310
I think it is about time for a new suit.

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:24.530
If it's okay, I'd like to give one
to you as a present, Master.

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:26.240
I don't want it!

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:29.320
Seriously, were you even listening?

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:38.790
Hey, come back home soon

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:38.790
nee hayaku kaette kite ne

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:52.010
When my worries keep me awake under the crescent moon

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:52.010
tameiki ga mikazuki wo yurasu yoru wa

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:58.180
All I can do is close my eyes and think of you

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:58.180
me wo tojite kimi no koto kangaete bakari

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:01.190
I want to see you, I feel like crying
