WEBVTT

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.540
Though my true power
has been unleashed...

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.510
...you are still able to keep up.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.180
Yeah.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.180
You're pretty strong too.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.160
<i>Putting City A back together</i>
<i>might be impossible.</i>

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.790
<i>Well, right now I should be</i>
<i>focusing on the battle.</i>

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.600
<i>She may be Rank 2 or whatever...</i>

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.230
<i>...but I can't leave it to one little girl.</i>

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.240
<i>I've got my own ways</i>
<i>of fighting enemies in the air.</i>

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.470
<i>Like this!</i>

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.350
Hey!

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.320
What do you think you're doing?

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.120
This area's got some nice rubble.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.750
Hurry up and get out of my way.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.160
<i>She's using her psychic power?</i>

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.490
<i>I give up!</i>

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.740
We're under attack again!

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.270
Return fire!

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.340
The guns are jacked!

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.340
Seriously? We're dead meat!

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.250
This planet's too tough!

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.450
Lord Boros!

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.250
I wanna go home.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.720
<i>Such incredible power.</i>

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.830
<i>Tornado may actually bring it down</i>
<i>on her own.</i>

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.130
I have errands to run.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.760
I will head out now.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.470
Things appear to be under control.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.430
Sure, go ahead.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.740
Some heroes have already left.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.810
Before I go, Genos,
have you got a second?

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.780
There's something I wish to tell you.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.880
<i>Drive Knight, Class S, Rank 9.</i>

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.680
<i>This is a first.</i>

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.650
Listen.
Metal Knight is your enemy.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:39.860
Be careful.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.620
What do you mean?

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:43.490
You will know soon enough.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.260
But for now, stay away from him.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.720
Bastard.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.920
You sure make things interesting.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.420
I'm beginning to taste victory.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.360
<i>The stiffness in my shoulders is gone.</i>

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.330
<i>But I suppose I'm a little rusty.</i>

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.700
You live--?

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.500
Hey, forget something?

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:27.970
ATOMIC SLASH

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.440
Atomic Slash!

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.240
Insolence....

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.640
Such complete insolence!

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.450
You move your heart-thing
around your body to hide its location.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.290
But your regeneration
always begins with your head...

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.320
...and in the center lies your heart.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.560
After seeing it so many times,
even a monkey could figure it out.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.530
See? Checkmate.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.230
No!

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.270
Silverfang!

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.670
All I needed was one more swing.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.680
Keep your hands to yourself,
Silverfang.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.280
Goodness, I really do need
to do more full-body workouts.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.320
We got all the heads.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.990
That means victory is ours!

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.590
Yeah, but there's still
that big ship up there.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.570
All right, this is the last
of the reported survivors.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.670
-Let's move!
-Right.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.980
Mumen!
Quit your staring and come on!

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.380
Yeah, okay.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.700
Nice moves.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.570
Just as I thought, you are strong.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.710
Of all the myriad beings
I have fought, only you...

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.610
...have survived this long!

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.590
Now to release the destructive energy
held within me!

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.660
Any normal creature hit by it
would find their bones vaporized!

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.410
Behind you!

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.950
You were a worthy opponent...

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.720
...but the outcome
of this battle is clear.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.590
<i>My species won the struggle</i>
<i>to survive...</i>

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.430
<i>...amidst the harsh environment</i>
<i>of our home world.</i>

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.630
<i>We possess the ultimate</i>
<i>in regenerative abilities.</i>

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.170
<i>I, in particular,</i>
<i>have self-healing power...</i>

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.810
<i>...physical prowess and latent energy</i>
<i>beyond your conception.</i>

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.170
<i>A deep wound</i>
<i>that would be fatal to you...</i>

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.510
...heals itself on me in mere moments.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.410
By focusing all my energy
on my destroyed arm...

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.480
...I can explosively speed up
the healing process.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.150
Good as new.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:08.060
You, on the other hand,
will only get injured more...

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.590
-...while your stamina gradually decreases--
-Shut up.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.100
Blah, blah, blah. Are you done...

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000
...with this?

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.840
Not yet!

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.220
Meteoric Burst!

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.750
<i>The energy shunted from my body</i>
<i>transforms into a propelling force...</i>

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.880
<i>...elevating speed and power</i>
<i>to a level beyond the limitations...</i>

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.920
<i>...of living flesh!</i>

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.950
<i>Doing this places</i>
<i>enormous stress on my body...</i>

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.880
<i>...similar to anaerobic exercise.</i>

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.620
<i>As a result, it shortens my life.</i>

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:16.990
<i>Therefore...</i>

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:21.120
<i>...it should only be used as a trump card</i>
<i>for settling fights quickly.</i>

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.200
It's listing!

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.030
You're doing it!

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.130
Awesome, Tornado!

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:47.080
I made it.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.850
<i>This man...</i>

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.330
<i>...makes me want to go all out!</i>

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.250
That's the way, Saitama.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.620
You are indeed worth defeating!

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.820
Consecutive Normal Punches.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.970
I will defeat you!

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:42.000
All my energy will be released...

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:47.380
...blasting you and this planet to hell!

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:59.820
Collapsing Star, Roaring Cannon!

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.060
In that case,
I'm using my final move too.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.330
Killer Move: Serious Series...

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.700
...Serious Punch.

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:43.160
Did I lose?

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.070
You're still conscious?

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:50.070
You really are strong.

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:52.070
The prophecy held true.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.180
The battle was hard-fought.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.480
Yeah. It sure was.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.990
You lie.

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:07.890
You had strength to spare.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.160
I never stood a chance.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.200
It wasn't even a battle.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:20.370
So much for prophecies.

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:24.210
You were too strong....

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:30.810
Saitama.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:40.020
THE STRONGEST HERO

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:49.860
<i>It's crashing?</i>

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.230
<i>Is this Master's doing?</i>

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.370
We're done!
The power sphere's been broken!

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.540
We're going down!

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:00.010
Lord Boros went wild!

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:01.440
Get out, get out!

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.240
-Run!
-Stop shoving, stupid!

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:07.050
I wanna go home, Mommy!

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.250
It's coming down.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.050
Hey, we better get out of here!

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:15.860
This is bad.
Run for the Association HQ.

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:17.790
Iai, hold on to me!

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:19.190
I'm okay, Master!

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:22.800
Damn. How'd Silverfang get so fast?

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:24.930
Now's not the time to be competitive.

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:26.470
Angel Dash!

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.500
Hey, pansy, don't you run
in front of me! You're too slow!

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.010
Angel Dash!

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.270
Don't just say it, move!

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:37.280
-We're gonna crash!
-We're gonna crash!

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:48.190
It's down.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.020
All right, let's go.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:05.310
How did City A end up like this?

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:06.910
HANDSOME KAMEN AMAI MASK
CLASS A RANK 1

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.840
All of Class S was meeting today....

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:15.980
Care to explain, Metal Bat?

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.420
Explain it so I can understand.

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.420
Handsome Kamen Amai Mask.

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:25.460
Where the hell did you pop up from?

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.960
I was filming a TV drama
in the next town.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.000
There was a roar and tremors...

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:35.870
...so I came and found City A wiped out.

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:39.270
Monsters on a huge ship attacked us.

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:42.480
They fired artillery at us
and did all this.

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:44.550
But we took care of it.

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:49.220
"Took care of it," you say?

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:51.890
You call this victory?

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:54.460
Such incompetence.

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:57.260
I'm completely appalled at all of you!

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:58.890
Hey.

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.360
You didn't even get here in time,
so don't go acting all high and mighty.

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.030
It's true I didn't make it in time...

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:08.200
...but you all were right here.

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:11.270
You didn't save a single brick!

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:15.180
We were having a meeting
inside the HQ building.

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:18.650
We went outside as soon as
the enemy attacked...

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:21.080
...but the city was already in ruins.

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:23.150
So what?

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:26.990
You think if you tell them that,
the media will just let all this go?

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.120
You....

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.290
Whose side are you on?

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:32.490
We did our best.

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:35.630
I'm on the side of justice.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.100
Having Class S heroes this pathetic...

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.270
...is an embarrassment.

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:47.040
Anybody this useless
should voluntarily retire.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:50.380
Hey! Don't start talking crap with us!

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:54.580
Who's gonna care about a pop idol
with a face busted all to hell?

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.320
Do you have any idea
why I don't move up to Class S?

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:01.390
I remain Class A, Rank 1
so I can prevent...

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:06.360
...weak, good-for-nothing pissants like you
from moving up to Class S.

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:23.440
Metal Knight, you skip the meeting
and only show up now?

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.120
This is...

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:31.220
...magnificent!

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:32.390
Metal Knight!

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:35.120
What are you doing here?

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.630
The battle is already over.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.430
Metal Knight is your enemy.

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:43.530
Genos, right?

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:46.300
Do not tell me you have come
to recover the spaceship.

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:48.600
Are you here...

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:51.370
...so you can create more powerful
weapons with the alien technology?

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:53.610
Precisely.

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:56.540
Powerful weapons are a necessity...

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.550
...for the sake of peace.

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:02.650
Even with powerful weapons...

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:05.020
...in the hands of heroes like this,
they'd be wasted.

00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:08.660
You're mine later, pretty boy.
Watch your ass.

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:10.260
Hey!

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.260
I found some alien survivors!

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:18.600
I thought Lord Boros never lost.

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:20.470
Are we going to be killed?

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.600
Maybe we can talk our way out of this.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.610
I'm so hungry!

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:28.110
Idiot! Now's not the time for--

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:30.610
Someone's coming.

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:40.820
Amai Mask! What the--?

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.720
They did not deserve to live.
They were evil.

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:47.400
I swiftly implemented justice,
that's all.

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:50.330
I'm sure you understand...

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:52.630
...Genos.

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:54.500
You've been busy since the exam.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.840
But from what I saw of
the Deep Sea King incident and today...

00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:00.210
...you've mostly been a disappointment.

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:05.080
Best leave it.

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:06.810
Do not worry. I am fine.

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:11.220
<i>He reminds me of how I was</i>
<i>before I met Master.</i>

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:14.620
<i>A man on edge...</i>

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.760
<i>...too eager to eliminate evil.</i>

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:18.630
<i>Just like me...</i>

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.530
<i>...he must have gone through</i>
<i>something terrible in his past.</i>

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.470
<i>Wait!</i>
<i>Where is Master Saitama?</i>

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:39.310
Oh, I'm out!

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:41.720
Hey!

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:45.190
Why would a Class B like you
be inside the ship?

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.320
Master!

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:48.590
You are safe!

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.890
Hey, Genos!

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:51.460
We're done here. Let's go.

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:53.430
Did you defeat their leader?

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:56.230
Yeah, he was really strong.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:57.630
Maybe the strongest I've faced.

00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:58.770
I see.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.540
So without you, Master,
the prophecy...

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:03.200
...about the Earth's destruction...

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:04.810
<i>-They're ignoring me?</i>
-...would have come true.

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:08.510
No. Turns out you can't trust
prophecies to begin with.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.140
Hold it right there!

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.910
I don't know how you did it,
but you went in the ship on your own?

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.180
You're just a Class B.
How dare you butt in like that?

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.750
I didn't need you. I could have
handled it on my own!

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:21.660
Baldy! Octopus! Boiled egg!
Light bulb! Avocado!

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:22.860
-G-- Genos.
-Lame face! Goblin! Bug! Baldy!

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:24.360
-Say something.
-Ping-pong ball! Rice grain! Beanhead!

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:26.230
-Yes, sir.
-Kettle! Baldy! Kneecap!

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:27.430
Listen, spoiled brat.

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:30.330
Shut up and get lost,
or get beat down.

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:31.700
That's it! Yeah!

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.670
Unforgiveable. Me, a brat?

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.940
I'm older than you!

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:40.270
Genos?

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:42.440
You're next, Class B!

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:43.910
Cut it out, Tornado.

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:47.850
You're part of the Association,
a hero, right?

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:51.620
Whatever.

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:57.320
Why are there so many troublemakers
amongst the elite heroes?

00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:00.900
Genos, your joints
are all bent the wrong way.

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:02.760
Here, I'll fix you up.

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:05.530
Oh, sorry, your arm came off!

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:07.670
My back is killing me.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.470
<i>City A was wiped off the map</i>
<i>that day.</i>

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.310
<i>The arrival of aliens...</i>

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.750
<i>...and City A's annihilation</i>
<i>were history-making events...</i>

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.310
<i>...the top stories for days.</i>

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.520
<i>But eventually the coverage died down...</i>

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:26.450
<i>...and no one mentioned the city</i>
<i>that had disappeared.</i>

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:31.230
<i>Metal Knight salvaged</i>
<i>the spaceship.</i>

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:33.260
<i>Soon after,</i>
<i>the Hero Association headquarters...</i>

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.760
<i>...was reconstructed,</i>
<i>stronger than before...</i>

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:37.830
<i>...and it became an impenetrable</i>
<i>fortress of steel.</i>

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:43.300
<i>The infrastructure was rebuilt</i>
<i>with new roads leading out of HQ.</i>

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.670
<i>Heroes were able</i>
<i>to deploy quickly to every city.</i>

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:49.940
<i>And heroes Class A and above</i>
<i>were given the option...</i>

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.750
<i>...to live at headquarters.</i>

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:34.450
<i>You can see it clearly!</i>

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:37.120
<i>The entire building has been ripped out</i>
<i>down to the foundations.</i>

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:41.560
<i>The monster appeared in City Z,</i>
<i>but now City Y is in--</i>

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.670
PLUTON, KING OF THE UNDERWORLD

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:58.070
THREAT LEVEL: DRAGON

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:02.140
You humans waste your existence
in gluttony...

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:05.110
...littering the Earth
with worthless objects.

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:08.880
Now you shall boil and rot
in the depths of the underworld...

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:10.920
...that spreads below my mighty snout!

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.120
Who do we have here?

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:19.490
A great man who is a hero for fun...

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:21.630
...and profit.

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:23.700
A great man?

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:33.440
And his disciple.

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:43.050
Back to one punch again.

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:47.020
Goddamn it!
