00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.300
THE OBSESSIVE SCIENTIST

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.240
<i>Long ago,</i>
<i>there existed a brilliant young scientist.</i>

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.510
<i>By dint of his astonishing genius...</i>

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.720
<i>...he was able to make a number</i>
<i>of contributions to human knowledge.</i>

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:30.030
<i>Eventually, however,</i>
<i>he became disillusioned with the world.</i>

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.670
<i>Though constantly showered with praise</i>
<i>for the subtlety of his mind...</i>

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.640
<i>...none of his ideas or theories...</i>

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.140
<i>...ever received even the slightest support</i>
<i>from the scientific community.</i>

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.210
<i>"We should not be striving</i>
<i>to advance human civilization...</i>

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.450
<i>...but rather the artificial evolution</i>
<i>of humans as a species."</i>

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.390
<i>That was the only dream</i>
<i>he had ever had.</i>

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.190
<i>But not a single person came forward</i>
<i>to help him fulfill that dream.</i>

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.620
Damn these apes.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.160
"Dangerous ideas"?
Writing about me as if I were some freak?

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.200
Do they really think humans have come
this far by avoiding risks?

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.740
Idiots who think
they no longer need to evolve...

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.810
...have no right to pass on their genes!

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.780
Of course,
this plan was always for my own sake.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.780
I will carry it out,
even if I must do it all myself.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.660
<i>Thereafter,</i>
<i>he devoted himself to research.</i>

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.430
<i>It was only after he turned 70</i>
<i>that his efforts began to yield results.</i>

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.740
<i>First, the scientist regained his youth.</i>

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.640
<i>Next, he began cloning himself.</i>

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.450
<i>He named his laboratory</i>
<i>the House of Evolution...</i>

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.250
<i>...and together with his clones...</i>

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.420
<i>...he conducted countless experiments</i>
<i>with animals to create new species.</i>

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.290
<i>Eventually, his experiments shifted</i>
<i>to human subjects.</i>

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.560
This is taking too long.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.630
What's this got to do with me?
You're just trying to act cool again.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.270
Just get to the point, okay?

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.840
My master is a busy man.
Summarize it in 20 words or less.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.740
I-- I'm sorry.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.240
So in other words, my boss has become
very curious about your body.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.480
I'm not interested in dudes.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.450
I think you misunderstood, master.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.290
He plans to use your body, which
surpasses normal human limitations...

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.790
...for his research on evolution.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.630
If we don't do something,
I'm sure he'll try again.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.330
We cannot allow him a free hand.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.970
Our move should be to attack him.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.500
Sure, let's go.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.500
Okay.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.540
-Now?
-Yeah. There's a sale on tomorrow.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.310
Can't do it then.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.650
Master.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.580
<i>This doesn't sound good.</i>
<i>Better tell the doctor.</i>

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.950
-Hey, you.
-Yes?

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.820
I have one last question.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.590
Was the House of Evolution developing
cyborgs prior to four years ago?

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.690
How many more cyborgs are there?

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.060
Have any of them destroyed towns
in the past?

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.470
I'm not sure...

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.800
...but at the House of Evolution,
I'm the only combat cyborg.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:12.610
Impossible.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.040
Our elite force...

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.480
...formed for the extermination
of these obsolete humans, wiped out?

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.880
According to Armored Gorilla's report,
the two responsible are on their way here.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.320
If they come, all our research...

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.790
...everything we've been working on,
could be destroyed.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.030
This is a serious matter.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.930
The only option is
to use our trump card.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.870
Begin preparations
for the release of Carnage Kabuto.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.540
-What?
-No, not him.

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.610
-That's crazy.
-He'll finally be released?

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.980
-He's right. That might be the only way.
-But maybe we should stop him.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.720
-It's too dangerous.
-I have a bad feeling about this.

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.490
-Is that the only way?
-Be calm. He will be our last resort.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.850
But....

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.390
First, from the first to the eighth floor,
we'll activate all our traps.

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.100
If we're lucky,
they will take care of the intruders.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.100
I'm fully aware
of what will happen to me...

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.500
...should we fail.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.470
I didn't think we'd be running
the whole way.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.410
How else are we gonna get there?

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.750
I was sure you could fly or something.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.880
Humans can't fly, you know.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.790
It's amazing that you are never late.
You are a true hero.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.160
Actually, I hardly ever arrive on time.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.590
We're here.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.160
This is the place Gorilla told us of.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.730
So this is the House of Evolution.

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:50.810
One, two, three, four, five, six....
Looks like it's about eight stories high.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.890
What was that all of a sudden?

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:12.590
Yes, I decided it would be most efficient
to destroy them all in one swoop.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.430
Well, that's true but...

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.700
...we could have at least seen
what the bad guys had in store for us.

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.100
That was kind of mean.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.580
Looks like there's a basement.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.990
S-- Stop!

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.680
Hey, Carnage Kabuto.

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:04.850
Are you well?

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:08.850
It appears you've killed
a bunch of my clones again.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.650
Satisfied?

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:16.690
Fool. Why would I be satisfied?

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:20.130
I've been kept locked up
deep beneath the earth.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:26.570
Me, the strongest warrior in the entire
House of Evolution.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.540
You are mentally unstable.

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:33.140
We couldn't control you.
There was no choice.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.640
Control?

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.750
You moron.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:43.280
I am the culmination of the new human
you guys have sought for so long.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:48.560
My intelligence and physical strength
and your own are incomparable.

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:54.530
You should be the ones obeying me.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.670
<i>No. You're a failure.</i>

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:02.040
<i>It's true you perform at unheard of levels,</i>
<i>but it is humanity you lack.</i>

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:06.540
Go ahead, kill me.
Plenty of clones could take my place.

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.550
But I have a favor to ask first.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.120
There's a specimen I must have.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:19.150
He is extremely strong.
Only you can defeat him.

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:22.290
I want you to catch him for me...

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:28.300
...dead or alive.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.930
This basement is huge.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.700
I'm getting kind of fired up.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:40.580
I sense living beings deeper in.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:45.050
Master, two of them are approaching.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.620
Oh, here we go!

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.590
There are two. Which one is it?

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.760
The one on the right.

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:57.330
In that case,
you don't need the one on the left.

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:00.900
Genos?

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:05.630
Hey.

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:09.340
I am Carnage Kabuto.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:12.340
We got a combat
experimentation room.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:15.910
Let's do this in there.

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:19.110
You turned Genos
into a piece of modern art.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.820
Fight's on.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.660
Pretty big, eh?

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:35.800
It's the biggest room in the facility.

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:41.840
This is where they make us fight
to test our combat abilities.

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:47.240
Well then, let's start the killing.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.910
Still alive, huh?

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:17.210
You fool.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.040
Machine-gun Blow.

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.020
He got me.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.890
Let me...

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.690
...take him.

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:42.960
Your face is all cracked.
Don't push yourself.

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:52.270
With his breath? Impossible.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.180
Genos, you okay?

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:00.080
Yes.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.490
No, you're not. Look at your head.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:14.500
You've gone and gotten my hopes up.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:30.210
<i>I have always been critical of humans</i>
<i>and their inferior abilities.</i>

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:35.220
<i>The entire species, aside from myself,</i>
<i>can be viewed only as dumb animals.</i>

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.250
<i>That realization was agony for me.</i>

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:42.060
<i>If memory serves,</i>
<i>I was 15 when it occurred to me.</i>

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:45.390
<i>A plan to evolve the human animal...</i>

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:49.260
<i>...and create a world</i>
<i>where I could live contentedly.</i>

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:53.500
<i>A utopia of my own, created by me.</i>

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.900
<i>A world made up of only us...</i>

00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:00.270
<i>...the new human breed</i>
<i>that will transcend humanity.</i>

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.120
<i>I must see it through.</i>

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:17.390
<i>Compared to my anguish back then,</i>
<i>this physical pain I feel now is nothing.</i>

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.200
What's the hold up? Let's go.

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:23.900
Bring everything you've got.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.170
<i>Carnage Kabuto, a demon incarnate.</i>

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:29.300
<i>The strongest and most brutal creation</i>
<i>of the House of Evolution.</i>

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.310
<i>Let's see how you, at your archaic stage</i>
<i>of human development...</i>

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.940
<i>...fare against a monster that is</i>
<i>the final form of artificial evolution.</i>

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:41.520
<i>Or will you be the trigger</i>
<i>for a new evolution?</i>

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.820
<i>I can't wait to find out!</i>

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:53.030
Oh, I see it. I see it.
You're supposed to be strong.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.560
Don't disappoint me now.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.930
You're this place's ultimate weapon,
right?

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:01.000
You're clearly not the same
as the guys from this morning.

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:04.310
Look at you,
just oozing with confidence.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:10.510
<i>Such speed.</i>

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:21.060
What are you doing?

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.190
Hey.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.300
He just backed off?

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:30.300
Carnage Kabuto?

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:34.340
<i>If I'd attacked him just now,</i>
<i>he'd have killed me.</i>

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.310
<i>Who the hell is this guy?</i>

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:39.940
<i>He's leaving himself wide open...</i>

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:44.950
<i>...yet all my instincts are screaming,</i>
<i>sending out danger signals.</i>

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:47.480
You bastard!

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:53.490
How the hell did you get that strong?

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.260
So you wanna know too?

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.000
Okay, fine.

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:11.040
Genos, you listen carefully too.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.640
<i>He's going to tell us right now?</i>

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:17.210
<i>The secret to master's power?</i>

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:18.650
I'd like to know too.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.420
-Who are you?
-I am Genus.

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:30.060
Well, fine. Listen up.

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:35.230
<i>It's too risky.</i>
<i>He can't let these guys know his secret.</i>

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:41.700
First, what's important is to make sure
you stick to this intense training regimen.

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:46.710
<i>Training? Not modification surgery</i>
<i>or genetic enhancement?</i>

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.510
Training?

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.180
What training?

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:55.380
Listen, Genos.

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:58.320
You just have to keep doing it.

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:01.490
No matter how hard it gets.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.630
It took me three years to get this strong.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.100
One hundred push-ups!

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:11.370
One hundred sit-ups!

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:14.000
One hundred squats!

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:16.200
Then a 10 kilometer run!

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.610
Every single day!

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:30.750
<i>And of course,</i>
<i>make sure you eat three meals a day.</i>

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:34.360
<i>Just a banana in the morning is fine.</i>
<i>But the most important thing is...</i>

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:37.490
<i>...to never use the a.c. or heat</i>
<i>in the summer or winter...</i>

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:39.490
<i>...so that you can strengthen the mind.</i>

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:46.030
<i>In the beginning,</i>
<i>you'll wish you were dead.</i>

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:50.400
<i>You might start thinking,</i>
<i>"What's the harm of taking a day off?"</i>

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:57.040
<i>But for me, in order to be a strong hero,</i>
<i>no matter how tough it was...</i>

00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:00.250
<i>...even if I was spitting blood,</i>
<i>I never stopped.</i>

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:04.250
<i>I kept doing squats even when my legs</i>
<i>were so heavy they refused to move.</i>

00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:07.660
<i>Even when my arms started making</i>
<i>weird clicking noises...</i>

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:10.560
<i>...I kept doing push-ups.</i>

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:14.530
<i>A year and a half later,</i>
<i>I started to notice a difference.</i>

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.130
<i>I was bald...</i>

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:20.030
<i>...and I had become stronger.</i>

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:25.340
<i>In other words, you gotta train like hell</i>
<i>to the point where your hair falls out.</i>

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:29.510
<i>That's the only way to become strong.</i>

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:34.650
The guys that are fooling around with
the "new human race" and evolution junk...

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:37.290
...will never make it this far.

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:41.520
Human beings are strong because
we have the ability to change ourselves.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:44.330
<i>W--? What?</i>

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:47.090
<i>Is this guy for real?</i>

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.200
Master...

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:52.100
...you are so...

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.240
...full of crap!

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:59.270
That is nothing
but standard strength training!

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:01.480
And it's not even that intense!

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.250
It's just a normal level!

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:09.420
I-- I have to get stronger.
I didn't ask to study under you...

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:12.190
...just to hear jokes!

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:17.390
Master Saitama.,
your power is clearly stronger...

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.830
...than what you'd get
from just training your body!

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.630
<i>That's right. I want to know your--</i>

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.470
We want to know your true secret!

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.570
Genos...

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:34.240
...you may not believe me,
but that's really all I did.

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:36.180
Oh, yeah?

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:41.380
No. Carnage Kabuto.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:47.760
If you don't wanna tell us your secret,
so be it.

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.330
Stop. You'll go on another rampage.

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:55.330
I bet you aren't stronger than me
anyway.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:03.840
But since you pissed me off...

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:06.610
...I'm gonna annihilate you.

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.180
Carnage Mode!

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:21.260
When I get like this,
I lose control for a whole week...

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:24.260
...and my lust for death
cannot be quelled!

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:27.230
After I kill you, I'll head into town...

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:32.730
...and go on a killing rampage
until next Saturday!

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:38.740
If you are indeed a strong hero,
then try and stop me!

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:54.590
<i>No way. It can't be.</i>

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:02.630
Master?

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:08.270
<i>Damn it.</i>
<i>I may have made a horrible mistake.</i>

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:13.910
<i>This guy's in Carnage Mode.</i>

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:18.580
<i>He said he'll be on a rampage</i>
<i>for a whole week?</i>

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:21.720
Death, death, death...

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:24.390
...death, death, death!

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:27.520
<i>He'll be like this till next Saturday?</i>

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:30.990
<i>One whole week from today.</i>

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:34.430
<i>Next Saturday.</i>

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:38.500
<i>In other words, today is Saturday too.</i>

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.870
<i>That means...</i>

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.940
<i>...it's all over.</i>

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:46.740
<i>There's no one in this world</i>
<i>that can stop him.</i>

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.510
<i>That means today is...</i>

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:57.920
...bargain day at the supermarket!

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.560
<i>Who the hell is this guy?</i>

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:13.500
I screwed up!

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:14.700
<i>What is he?</i>

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:19.440
I'm pretty sure he's upset about this.

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.010
SATURDAY ONLY!!!
GIGANTIC SALE!

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:24.510
Master, the store closes at 10:00 p.m.

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:29.880
That is about four hours away.
If we really hurry, we can make it.

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.890
-I'll make it if I hurry?
-Yes.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:35.320
-Let's go, Genos!
-Yes, master!

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:40.900
<i>I think I'm done with evolution.</i>

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:44.400
<i>It appears...</i>

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:46.630
<i>...I am the one who must change.</i>

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:26.900
Yes, the on-site investigation
is underway.

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:29.440
Yes, that's correct.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:33.670
Just like the other cases, the area has
been thoroughly burnt by intense flames.

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:38.650
Everything points to the young cyborg
being responsible for this.

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:41.920
Yes, understood.

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:46.190
Such a devastating amount of power.

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:49.520
Yeah.

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:52.090
NEXT EPISODE: THE MODERN NINJA

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:55.500
<i>Yo, this is Carnage Kabuto.</i>
<i>In Japanese my name is "Ashura Kabuto."</i>

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:59.700
<i>The kanji comes from "shell," "field trip,"</i>
<i>and the Sanskrit word </i>"aum."

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:02.500
<i>What do you think?</i>
<i>You don't give a damn!</i>

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:06.840
<i>Coming next on </i>One-Punch Man
<i>is episode four, The Modern Ninja.</i>

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:10.640
<i>So the guy is finally gonna show up?</i>
