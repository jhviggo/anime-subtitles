WEBVTT

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.370
Why are we forced to work?

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.740
<i>Why must we pay money</i>
<i>in order to eat?</i>

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.770
<i>Can't we all just share?</i>

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.140
<i>The rich get fat while the poor die.</i>

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.350
<i>Where is the true freedom in this world?</i>

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.220
<i>We are all slaves to our work.</i>

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.350
<i>And is work fun?</i>

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.690
<i>No! How could it be?</i>

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.690
We do not want to work, period!

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.290
That's why I, Hammerhead,
will change our society into one...

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.500
...where only those who want to work
will work, while the rest are supported!

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.300
We will create a utopia!

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.700
The Paradisers, led by me, Hammerhead,
will make all this a reality!

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.110
Boss, no one's listening.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.510
What?

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.420
These civilians are idiots.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.350
Let's go!
Zeniru's the richest man in town.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.560
We'll wreck his posh penthouse
and show them we're serious!

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.430
High-rise apartments are symbols
of inequality!

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.430
This whole building is Zeniru's home.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.660
There's no way he made
so much money legally.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.170
Unforgivable. Bring it down.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.520
Target destroyed.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.890
These experimental battle suits
sure pack a wallop.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.490
It was definitely worth risking our lives
to steal them.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.530
Wait, that was the wrong building.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.430
My bad, boss.
Zeniru's house is a little further up.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.970
Everyone makes mistakes!

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.700
The important thing is to learn from them,
am I right?

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.280
-Yes, you're right!
-All right, then onward to Zeniru's!

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.990
Thanks, bicycle guy.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.980
Don't come asking
to play rock, scissors, paper...

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.750
...with a booger on your finger!

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:20.560
A dream?

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.930
<i>The terrorist group responsible for the riots</i>
<i>call themselves the Paradisers.</i>

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.560
<i>They have destroyed</i>
<i>a high-rise building in City F.</i>

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.530
<i>The situation seems to be</i>
<i>spiraling out of control.</i>

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.570
<i>We have just learned the identity</i>
<i>of their leader.</i>

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.870
B-CLASS CRIMINAL
HAMMERHEAD

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.710
<i>Hammerhead is a B-class criminal...</i>

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.280
<i>...who has been involved in several</i>
<i>violent incidents in the past.</i>

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.980
<i>He is a man of large stature,</i>
<i>standing 2.15 m tall and weighing 210 kg.</i>

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.820
<i>According to one report,</i>
<i>he once fought 20 men in a street brawl...</i>

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.320
<i>...and sent them all to the hospital.</i>

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.390
<i>The Paradisers sent</i>
<i>the following message to this TV station.</i>

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.400
<i>"We will continue to riot until food,</i>
<i>clothing and shelter...</i>

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.300
<i>...are provided free of charge</i>
<i>to those who do not work"...</i>

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.940
<i>-Sounds boring.</i>
<i>-...amongst other unintelligible demands.</i>

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.040
<i>Like Hammerhead, the group is made up</i>
<i>of unemployed young men...</i>

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.780
<i>-No need for me to get involved.</i>
<i>-...with no motivation to work.</i>

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.080
<i>Also, the group members</i>
<i>all have shaven heads...</i>

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.380
<i>...making them quite intimidating.</i>

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.350
<i>Those who encounter</i>
<i>any shaven-headed men on the street...</i>

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.750
<i>...are advised to leave the area</i>
<i>immediately.</i>

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.760
What?

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.760
<i>But that's-- They stole my look!</i>

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.330
<i>I spend all this time trying to be a hero...</i>

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.370
<i>...but if they keep acting up,</i>
<i>I'll be treated like a villain!</i>

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.800
I'm gonna smash them!

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.410
-Run!
-It's them!

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.710
The Paradisers are coming!

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.710
They aren't backing down.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:54.950
This is too dangerous!

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.450
Stop right there, you pack of thugs!

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.400
The bicyclist for justice,
Mumen Rider, is here!

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.070
Mumen Rider has come to save us.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:18.970
There's nothing to fear if he's here.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.880
A hero? What a joke.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.450
Here I go.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.580
Somebody call an ambulance!

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.020
Mr. Zeniru, you must flee.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:39.860
But running away from terrorists
would hurt my reputation.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.460
There's no need to leave.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.900
You're a lucky man...

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:50.110
...having this occur
while I'm still under contract.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.540
-But you're a bodyguard.
-Oh, Sonic.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.550
Can I leave this to you?
The men coming are--

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.080
Of course.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.750
It's their lives you should worry about.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:08.560
But please do think of a way
to dispose of the pile of dead bodies.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.890
The Paradisers...

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.530
...a bunch of upstarts equipped with
some new type of battle suit.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.500
And B-class criminal Hammerhead.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.170
He might have some backbone.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.770
THE MODERN NINJA

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:32.980
Boss, you can see Zeniru's building
across the woods.

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.950
People call it the Golden Turd.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.590
All right, let's go!

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.760
Something's here.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.770
I've been waiting for you, Hammerhead.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.500
Zeniru sent me.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.110
Let me start out by saying...

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.610
...no opponent of mine
has ever escaped alive.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.580
I plan on keeping it that way.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.250
When it comes to my job,
I'm a perfectionist.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.990
But if you surrender right now,
I'll let you live.

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:16.730
So, what will it be?

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:47.090
<i>What is this?</i>

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:51.990
<i>What's going on?</i>

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:53.190
Why is every--?

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.000
No!

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:03.940
Bastard!

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.650
What's this now?
Trying to intimidate me?

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.990
You can't see me, can you?

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:19.750
There you are!

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.060
It's a terrorist!

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:26.630
No, I'm not!

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.600
<i>So he decided to fight instead of run.</i>

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:47.820
<i>There goes my bad habit again.</i>

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:51.820
You're just a little dog
bought by Zeniru's money.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:55.020
You think someone like me,
who fights for a noble cause...

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.930
...can lose to a dog?

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.360
<i>Yes, I see what he's up to.</i>

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.930
<i>Just as I thought, he's a complete fool.</i>

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.940
<i>Couldn't he have at least tried to</i>
<i>arrange the rocks in a less obvious way?</i>

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.110
There are plenty more rocks
where those came from!

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.910
If you don't stop me,
they'll keep coming.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.250
You think you'll be able
to deal with my speed...

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.280
...if you know which direction
I'm coming from?

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:24.290
How pathetic. But I'll play along.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.960
In fact, I'll take you...

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:29.760
...straight on!

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.400
<i>He's too fast. I can't see him.</i>

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:42.140
<i>But it doesn't matter if I can't,</i>
<i>because of this!</i>

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:46.240
Gotcha!

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.780
Think about how stupid you were
to face off against me...

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.710
...on your way down to hell!

00:10:56.250 --> 00:11:00.360
It's over. Unfortunately,
I couldn't go easy on them.

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:04.760
Yes, Hammerhead's body is here too.

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:06.860
I'll head back now--

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:10.770
The body disappeared?

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:18.040
<i>That was close.</i>
<i>Good thing he hit my head.</i>

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:23.040
<i>My skull always was several times</i>
<i>thicker than normal.</i>

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.710
<i>Damn it,</i>
<i>I don't know who that bastard was...</i>

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:27.720
<i>...but one day I'm gonna kill--</i>

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.950
<i>Now what?</i>

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.700
Oh, there you are.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.830
As with the mosquito monster...

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:49.300
...I once again underestimated
my opponent's power.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.240
I let my guard down
and Kabuto took advantage of that.

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:56.780
If Master Saitama had not been there...

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:59.750
...I would certainly have been destroyed.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.780
I see. Well, I'm glad you're okay.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.020
Doctor.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.020
Master Saitama saved my life twice.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:10.360
You, Dr. Kuseno, restored my life to me.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:13.430
Later, this same life was saved
by Master Saitama...

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.200
...who now has saved it again.

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:19.030
Yes, I get the picture, Genos.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:24.440
What you're trying to tell me is
how amazing this Saitama fellow is, right?

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:25.840
Yes.

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:29.210
Genos, they're not ready just yet...

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:32.480
...but I am developing
a new series of augmentations.

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:35.320
<i>When I replace your existing parts</i>
<i>with these new ones...</i>

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:37.820
<i>...you may be able</i>
<i>to surpass this Saitama.</i>

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.820
I imagine he must possess
an enormous amount of strength...

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:45.530
...for you go on about him so.

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:47.460
Yes.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:52.070
What's your deal?
You here to sign up with the Paradisers?

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:56.100
No, no. I'm just a guy
who's a hero for fun.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.140
For personal reasons,
I'm here to smash your heads in.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.280
So, where are your followers?

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:04.410
Then, die!

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:14.820
I better get out of here, quick.

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.190
<i>I thought I punched him.</i>

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:21.900
What a letdown.

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:25.200
I was all excited
about these battle suits.

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:27.240
But the design is lame...

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:30.170
...and all they do
is give you superhuman strength.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:36.510
You have no idea how hard it was
to get hold of these things!

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.950
How could you know their value?

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:48.290
I've been looking for someone
to test the full power of this suit on!

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.570
Spin Attack!

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:04.370
<i>I used to use that move all the time</i>
<i>when I was a kid.</i>

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.610
No way.

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:15.850
<i>Hammerhead, huh? He's a lot like me.</i>

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:19.220
What the hell are you?

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:32.600
W-- Wait.
I just wanted to get out of working.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:38.010
Don't be bad anymore, okay?

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:40.340
So you're not going to kill me?

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.880
-Get out of here.
-Okay!

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:52.650
Guess I'll go home.

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.360
Where did Hammerhead go?

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:01.360
There's no one left but you.

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:13.240
Hammerhead went that way,
buck-naked.

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:19.010
What's this?

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:26.420
Hey, you got it wrong.

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:29.020
I got what wrong?

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:32.230
I'm not one of the Paradisers.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:34.560
You're lying.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:38.000
No, no, no. Don't be dumb. Look at me.

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:39.270
I don't need to.

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:42.970
With that bald head,
there's no denying it.

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.570
No. Look, it's me. Me.

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:50.280
-You know, the guy who's a hero for fun.
-Never heard of you.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.280
Oh, I see.

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:58.350
Either way, it doesn't matter.

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:04.160
You read my attacks, twice.
That's the real problem.

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.330
Born in a ninja village...

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:10.570
...I've been perfecting my techniques
since childhood.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:14.200
Yet you saw right through them.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.370
This I cannot allow.

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:19.570
<i>What's he talking about?</i>

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:22.480
My pride won't have it.

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:27.010
I don't care who you are,
I can't let you simply walk away.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.280
Oh, come on.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.050
You just want to try out
your moves on me.

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:36.320
I can tell by that innocent smile of yours.

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:48.170
What do you think of this speed
that beats sound?

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.740
Of these shock waves?

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:51.770
Can you even see me?

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:58.380
How can you possibly keep up with me?

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:05.120
Can I go home?

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:07.720
<i>Bastard.</i>

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:09.490
Wind Blade Kick!

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:15.200
Checkmate.

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:23.270
Sorry. That wasn't on purpose.
I meant to stop before hitting you...

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.640
...but your momentum carried
my fist into your....

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:32.350
I've worked every job
from assassin to bodyguard.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.480
No ninja is more deadly.
I am Speed-o'-Sound Sonic!

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:38.220
But I'm putting my work on hold.

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:40.560
Now that I've found
such a formidable opponent...

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:43.660
...I'm dedicating myself to training
until we settle this.

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:47.160
Let me know your name.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.400
It's Saitama.

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:53.830
Saitama, next time we meet,
it'll be your demise!

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.100
Okay.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.070
I, Speed-o'-Sound Sonic,
the ultimate ninja...

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:02.310
...will bring you down without fail!

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:04.680
Train hard.

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:10.120
Speed-o'-Sound Sonic? Who is that?

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:13.090
And who would possess
such a redundant name?

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:14.320
I don't know.

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.590
He suddenly appeared,
declared we were rivals, and took off.

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:22.100
-If he is a nuisance, I will get rid of him.
-Well, you're hardly different.

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:26.100
Actually, why are you here again?
Go home. It's not like we're related.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:29.700
-Master, I must become stronger--
-Shut up!

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:35.880
I'm now aware of a serious problem
and am reeling from shock.

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:38.610
So I beg you, go home for today.

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:40.510
A serious problem?

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:44.190
What could cause a problem
for someone as great as you?

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.320
Please, share with me.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.130
No one knows who I am.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:01.700
It's been three years
since I first became a hero.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:06.510
<i>I've defeated many monsters</i>
<i>and evil organizations during that time.</i>

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:11.150
<i>I've never heard of any other heroes</i>
<i>doing as much as me.</i>

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.550
<i>Everyone in the world should</i>
<i>know me by now.</i>

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.920
<i>Isn't it weird that I don't have any fans</i>
<i>or anything?</i>

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.360
You know what he said to me today?

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:24.560
"Never heard of you."

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:28.660
Plus, everyone in town took me
for a terrorist.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.570
They've all forgotten
how I beat those monsters for them.

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:34.400
<i>He's right.</i>

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:40.680
<i>The news report did not mention</i>
<i>Master Saitama or Speed-o'-Sound Sonic.</i>

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:43.580
<i>Instead, the credit for defeating</i>
<i>the Paradisers...</i>

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:45.650
<i>...went to a hero called Mumen Rider.</i>

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:47.780
Wait.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.520
Master.

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:52.290
Are you listed with the Hero Registry?

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:54.620
HERO ASSOCIATION
OFFICIAL HOMEPAGE

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.230
"Take a test at any local branch
of the Hero Association.

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:02.200
If you score better than the cut-off,
you'll be registered in the Hero Registry...

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:04.870
...and will be allowed to officially
call yourself a hero.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.300
Once you are recognized
by the association, you're deemed a pro...

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.610
...and will get paid from donations
collected by the association.

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:16.980
All heroes in the public eye
are registered, professional heroes.

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:20.480
You may be doing plenty of hero work,
but self-proclaimed heroes...

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:22.520
...are really just weirdos--"

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:27.760
"Weirdos spouting nonsense
viewed with suspicion."

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.290
I had no idea.

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:33.290
Genos, are you registered?

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:35.530
No. I feel no need to.

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:42.600
Let's register! Register with me
and I'll make you my disciple.

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:44.610
Let's go.

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:53.010
P-- Please, f-- Forgive me.

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:58.850
Pleading for his life after stealing
battle suits from the organization?

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:00.820
He truly understood nothing.

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:03.960
Of course,
we did let the theft take place...

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:06.990
...in order to collect data
from the suits in the field.

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:10.430
-And the body?
-Leave it.

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:15.770
<i>Thanks for giving me my thick skull,</i>
<i>Mommy.</i>

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.770
<i>I promise I'll get a job.</i>

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:19.270
APPLICATION FOR HERO TEST

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:20.880
<i>Our guest today is Mr. Majimeda...</i>

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:24.410
<i>...an expert on the labor issues</i>
<i>confronting young people today.</i>

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:25.950
<i>Thank you for having me.</i>

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.480
<i>As we saw with</i>
<i>the Paradiser incident recently...</i>

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:32.350
<i>...there's an increase in young people</i>
<i>who lack all motivation to work.</i>

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:34.520
<i>Can you comment</i>
<i>on this phenomenon?</i>

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.060
-I'm not so different--
<i>-In the case of the Paradisers...</i>

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:41.330
<i>...I think they've been influenced</i>
<i>by irresponsible lyrics...</i>

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.530
--from those unemployed guys.

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.900
<i>...in songs like</i>
<i>"Don't Give Up on Your Dreams"...</i>

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:47.940
<i>...and "Make Your Dreams Come True."</i>

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:51.540
<i>People who believe that make excuses</i>
<i>for themselves and get discouraged.</i>

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:55.810
<i>One wrong step</i>
<i>and I could've been one of them.</i>

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:37.610
Ready to go, master?

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:40.410
Y-- Yeah.

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:45.820
HERO TEST LOCATION 6

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:47.660
NEXT EPISODE:
THE ULTIMATE MENTOR

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:49.560
<i>I'm the recently reformed Hammerhead.</i>

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:54.860
<i>Before I introduce next week's episode,</i>
<i>I'd like to do a little PR for myself.</i>

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.530
<i>Oh, you won't allow that?</i>

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:59.630
<i>Next time on </i>One-Punch Man:
<i>Episode five, "The Ultimate Mentor."</i>

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:05.840
<i>Yeah, if I'd had a mentor like him,</i>
<i>maybe my life would've been different.</i>
