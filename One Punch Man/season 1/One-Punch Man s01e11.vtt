WEBVTT

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.570
Th-This can't be happening!

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.570
Even Groribas, our best warrior, defeated?!

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.750
What manner of creature is he?
And how'd he get aboard?

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.180
Damn it!

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.050
Melzargard was supposed
to be guarding the ship!

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.190
Now he and I are
the only elite fighters left!

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.360
I bet he's just mucking about...

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.660
I need him now!
Curse the bastard!

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.060
Geryuganshoop,
what is the problem?

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.500
Lord Boros!
I-I'm terribly sorry.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.270
I've allowed one of the natives
to infiltrate the ship.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.510
In the mere four minutes
since coming aboard,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.810
he has damaged 23%
of the ship.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.740
It seems he is alone,

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.610
but he has managed
to instantly kill

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.780
every warrior sent to
intercept him.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.320
Do not panic.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.550
As long as the power sphere
is safe,

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.690
the ship will not go down.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.360
The damage so far is limited to
the crew's living quarters.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.530
But minnows won't be enough.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.400
Geryuganshoop...

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.230
you, Groribas and Melzargard,
my top lieutenants,

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.870
will go eliminate this intruder.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.170
Groribas has fallen, sir...

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.340
What?

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.280
Let me get Melzargard
back here!

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.350
He and I together will wipe out
the intruder without fail!

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.760
THE DOMINATOR OF THE UNIVERSE

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.610
ONE PUNCH MAN

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.270
MYSTERY CRAFT IN SKIES ABOVE CITY A

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.800
We have more information on
the enormous flying object

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.240
that suddenly appeared
in the skies over City A.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.370
I'm here at the scene.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.010
As you can see, all the main roads
leading to City A have been closed,

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.420
and officials
are on high alert.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.720
According to survivors,

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.590
City A has been almost
entirely demolished.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.330
EMPLOYMENT APPLICATION
NAME: HAMMERHEAD

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.540
This image of the giant flying object
was captured with a telephoto lens.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.540
What are your thoughts?

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.440
Most likely, this is the act of an alien
or extraterrestrial being.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.010
Or perhaps
it's an unidentified life-form

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.810
that has a highly advanced civilization
unbeknownst to us.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.650
Of course, other possibilities
exist as well.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.320
I see.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.620
Also, there have been
eyewitness accounts of

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.490
very powerful life-forms

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.860
descending to the ground
from the spacecraft.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.400
Several Class S heroes are presently
at the location tackling the issue.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.790
He pummeled that thing with
nothing but his bare fists.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.420
That's a Class S for you.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:27.960
But even so...

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.530
It's no good!

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.860
It possesses incredible
regenerative powers.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.500
And don't let it hit any part of you.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.470
A single blow instantly
tore my arm off.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.340
Dodge its attacks at all costs!

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.010
If I may cut in...

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.760
Shall we use a bombardment
to finish them off?

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:06.030
That is good.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.000
Contact the ship.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.370
I will go.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.500
Get back here!

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.540
You scum!

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.640
Best mind your manners!

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.450
I hope ya like mincemeat, freak!

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.650
Melzargard! What are you doing?!

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.820
I'm in battle.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:28.950
We have an intruder!

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:30.820
Ridiculous.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.720
It's true. Finish them off
and get up here!

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.030
This one's locked too...

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.140
Hey, open up!
You've got a visitor!

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.540
Oops... I broke it.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.720
I've decided.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.180
I'm going to rip your limbs off,

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:05.420
then keep you as
the ship mascot.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.060
That is good.

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.730
Put yourself together again, eh?

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.870
I'm gonna keep you
for batting practice!

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.460
Comrades! It may be that
direct physical attacks

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.560
have no effect on it!

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:44.030
Let's withdraw for now...

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:47.660
and think of a way to destroy it,
like heat or something!

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.970
Smashing is all I can do! Forget it!

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:54.740
This is all I know, too.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.870
Can't teach an old dog new tricks.

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.580
Me, too. Sorry, sweet Lairon!

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.680
Lai, don't you have faith in me?

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.780
There's nothing I can't cut down.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:10.820
It's pointless...

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:15.590
These guys aren't the type to listen.

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:21.500
Melzargard!

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.670
Look, I really need you
on the ship.

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:25.770
Getting rid of the intruder
takes priority.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.910
I'd love to, but I'm busy.
These creatures are persistent.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:32.540
What the hell?

00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:36.680
The life forms down there are proving
tough to handle too?

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:38.950
Nothing tough about them.

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.880
What's with the ship?
Is it going down?

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:44.950
It's not going down,

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:47.990
but more than half the crew
have been killed.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:49.190
What?!

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:55.160
Listen. Begin cleansing my location

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.170
with a bombardment from the ship!

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:00.240
I've got my hands full right now.

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:03.540
Besides, artillery bombardment is
the job of the lower ranks.

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:06.710
Well, I'm in a situation where
I can't return to the ship.

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:08.310
All right.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:10.980
I'll notify the artillery crews.

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:13.680
Don't get caught up in
the barrage and die.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.120
Hey, wait!

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.860
You should come down here
and help me.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.290
That'd be much faster.

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:26.760
Oi! Geryuganshoop!

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.130
Damn him. How tough is this intruder?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.600
How about another one?!

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:40.740
More futile attacks.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.110
Although you are exhausting
yourself. That is good.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.580
The hell is this?

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.060
A marble? Why've you got this?

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.690
Give it back!

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:00.200
Sure thing.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:06.700
Damn!

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:10.170
That's nasty, ya nasty bastard!
You dead?

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:15.040
Hey, this guy's got marble-looking
things inside him.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.980
That's where ya hurt him!

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.350
Oh!

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:21.720
Nice work.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:27.060
So I just have to keep slicing
until I hit a vital marble!

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:32.860
Impossible!

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:35.760
I've been growing that head
for a hundred years!

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:37.770
It died in a dump like this?

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.700
But you scum are all dead
when the shells hit.

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:45.710
They're on their way!

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.920
Attention, intruder!

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.920
Stop your destructive acts
and leave this instant.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.120
Attention, intruder!

00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:59.790
Leave immediately.

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:03.990
Otherwise, we will unleash
all our forces against you!

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:05.390
That's weird.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.660
I hear a voice right
inside my head.

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:11.100
Take one more step...

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.830
...and you're dead!

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.370
Even if I wanted to get out,

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.700
I can't. I've lost my way!

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:19.210
Really? You'll leave?

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:21.210
All right, I will guide you.

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:25.950
Take a right, then go
up the stairs there.

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:27.950
A right?

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.420
Exactly, a right.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:33.690
I guess I'll go left!

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.890
No, wait! Not that way!

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:39.360
W-W-Wait...
Hang on! You can't...!

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:41.700
All right, that was my fault!

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.100
I'll come to you.
Please stay right there.

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:48.140
Ahhh! Noooo!

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:54.910
Now this place looks like
a control room or something.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.480
You...

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:01.150
An octopus?

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:08.190
You dare go around
busting up our ship?

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.360
Hey! The debris is all flying at me!

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:19.430
Now Geryuganshoop, the supreme
telekinetic power in the universe,

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:21.440
will grind you
into blood sausage.

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:40.150
Just about there.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.960
Lord Geryuganshoop, preparations
for the bombardment

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:45.230
are nearly complete.

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:46.830
Shall I proceed?

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.530
Maybe he went to the bathroom...

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.370
Hey, Lord Geryuganshoop!

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:01.940
Telekinetic power...like a psychic?

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.180
You leave me no choice.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.180
Super Telekinetic Gravitational Wave!

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:11.220
Die, Earthling!

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.330
My unparalleled telekinetic
powers allow me

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:22.400
to manipulate even
the forces of gravity!

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:26.030
Have you any idea
what a black hole is, you ape?

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.300
Inside one, the gravitational effects
are so strong

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:31.310
even light itself cannot escape!

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:33.240
Wait...?

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.420
Now what?

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.890
Take this!
Telekinetic Shower of Rubble!

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:01.140
I got him!

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.840
What a waste of psychic powers.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:08.180
I mean, all you're doing
is tossing pebbles around.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.380
Anyone can do that.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:13.950
How...could...

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.220
I...Geryuganshoop...

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.550
be...

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:22.290
Excuse me—

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.290
Can I ask...

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:28.000
...where your boss is?

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:34.300
This looks bad.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.310
Is that confirmed?

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:46.010
Yes, Child Emperor said that
the energy level in

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:49.250
the spaceship is rapidly rising.

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:51.620
Yes, but the civilians—

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:54.460
Recall the search and
rescue teams for now.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.060
Have everyone take cover.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:59.030
You'll be taking fire soon!

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:12.410
Hop on!

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:18.450
There we go.

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:21.280
Geryuganshoop still hasn't
gotten back to me...

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:22.450
but whatever.

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:24.420
Let's see...

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:27.260
I believe the order was
to concentrate fire

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:31.260
around the enemies on
the surface near Melzargard.

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:38.530
Two heads to go!

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.370
I'll bust 'em wide open!

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:42.000
Is it time?

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:44.370
Ship, bombardment, coming...

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:48.410
There they are.

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:49.940
All right...

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:51.250
click!

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:57.450
It's over.

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.120
Evasion, impossible.
Instant death.

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.140
Huh... What happened?

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.440
What on Earth?

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:17.970
They stopped.

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:22.180
All of you would
be dead without me.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.280
Can't you even finish
one small fry?

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:27.480
Maybe try starting over
from Class C.

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:35.390
You can have...

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.090
your shells back.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:47.570
Th-This is...

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:57.280
I wanna go home.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:04.250
I didn't expect you to be here.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.790
Thank you, Mumen Rider.

00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:10.260
Which areas are likely
to have survivors?

00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:12.660
There must be more out there.

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:14.260
But you...

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:16.330
I'll go rescue them right now.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:19.200
We want to know, too.

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:22.370
Yeah, can't let him hog the limelight.

00:17:23.340 --> 00:17:25.170
Stinger, Lightning Max...

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.340
Mind if we borrow this?

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:29.340
You guys...

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.060
Nice catch.

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:55.540
Found it...

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.640
Smush.

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:00.270
One left!

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:08.280
Silverfang!

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.490
A...direct hit.

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.790
Weak, weak!

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.560
You are all so very weak.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:24.430
Dead after a single hit!

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.640
A change of tactics
was all I needed.

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:31.540
If I forget defense and
focus on attack,

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:33.570
this will all be over quickly.

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:35.310
And you're next!

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:41.550
I will spring past that sword and
squeeze your skull until it pops.

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:45.120
Think so? Then be my guest.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:57.870
So he's come.

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:29.560
This planet's finest warrior...

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:32.570
I can sense no limit to his energy.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.640
You the boss of these invaders?

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:38.870
Wonderful!

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:43.640
Before we fight,
let us exchange names.

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:50.750
I lead the pirate band known
as Dark Matter,

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:53.850
and I am Dominator of the Universe.
I am Boros.

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:57.220
I'm a hero for fu—I mean,

00:19:57.290 --> 00:19:58.790
a professional hero.

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:00.290
My name's Saitama.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.360
Saitama...

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.230
Look, I don't know what
the Denominator of the Universe

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:06.500
wants with Earth...

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:09.700
...but you sure trashed City A.

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:12.810
What I want with Earth?

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:17.510
There exists a prophecy.

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:19.910
Prophecy? You mean...

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.990
Once, I traveled the universe,
ravaging everything in sight.

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:28.820
But I was too strong.

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:33.260
Eventually, there were none left
who could face me.

00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:37.470
I came to know the torment of utter,
all-encompassing boredom.

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:41.640
Then one day, a seer told me...

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.000
On a faraway planet,

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:46.010
a being exists who is my match,

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:48.740
one who could rekindle
my passion for battle.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.850
That was nearly twenty years ago.

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.920
Have you any idea the distance
I have traveled to get here?

00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:00.650
My men thought the prophecy
was a ruse,

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.490
made up to lure me away...

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:05.930
But now I am certain.

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:09.730
Come. Give stimulation
to my existence.

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:11.870
That is why I am here!

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:18.610
Are you stupid?

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:21.710
You can't just go around
attacking other planets

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:23.480
just to liven up your boring life.

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:25.550
Even telemarketers wouldn't think that.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.370
This set of armor, used to seal
in my immeasurable, irresistible power...

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:48.840
...has been broken.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:50.840
OK.

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:18.430
It is time!

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:52.690
THE STRONGEST HERO

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:56.630
The next...and final episode of
<i>One-Punch Man</i> is...

00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:59.570
"The Strongest Hero."

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:02.700
What does it mean to be "strongest,"

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:04.040
Saitama?

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:07.710
You must tell me too...
