WEBVTT

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.720
What on earth!

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.790
Look at that!

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.050
It's closing in!

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.820
Who's available?

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.320
We have word that Lightning Max
and Smile Man are on their way.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.790
Get me that threat level assessment!

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.500
As you can see, loud explosions
are going off behind me!

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.170
The damage left by the monster
is at an unprecedented scale.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.240
HUGE EXPLOSION IN CITY A

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.170
<i>The Hero Association is currently</i>
<i>analyzing the threat level.</i>

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.480
Guess I'll go.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.560
JUSTICE ENFORCEMENT

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.270
Daddy! Mommy!

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.850
And who do we have here?

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.760
Just a guy who's a hero for fun.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.630
What kind...

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.530
of half-assed backstory is that?

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.300
I was formed from
the constant stream of pollution

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.500
with which you humans
have suffused the earth.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.470
I am Vaccine Man!

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.780
The Earth is a single living organism.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.250
You humans are nothing
but a disease-causing bacteria

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.280
eating away at her life force.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.590
In order to obliterate humans
and their evil civilization,

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.720
the Earth has given birth to me!

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.430
You say you do this for fun?
For fun?

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.200
How dare you confront me,
Mother Earth's apostle,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.730
for that inane reason?!

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.530
Yet, what more could be
expected from a hu--

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.820
<i>Not again.</i>
<i>All it took was one punch!</i>

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.320
Damn it!

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.680
THREE YEARS EARLIER

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.650
–A monster!
–Run!

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.020
Huh?

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.560
You sure you don't want
to run away?

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.000
I bet you're a newly employed
businessman already tired of work.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.640
I ate too much crab
and transformed into this, Crablante!

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.840
Why aren't you running?

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.440
You've got a death wish.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.080
Is that it?

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.680
Well, not quite.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.990
I'm no businessman. I'm unemployed.
Right now, I'm looking for a job.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.090
I had another interview today
and got rejected royally.

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.400
I couldn't care less about anything.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.530
So I'm in no mood to run

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.070
just because the mighty Crablante
has appeared.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.910
So, what'll happen if I don't run?

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.580
Your eyes are lifeless, just like mine.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.620
From one set of lifeless eyes
to another, I'll let you go.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.750
Besides, right now...

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.690
I'm hunting different prey.

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.590
A big-chinned brat.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.630
And when I find him,
I'm gonna rip his arms off!

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.580
What're you looking at?

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.480
<i>A big-chinned brat...</i>
<i>If he's caught, he's dead!</i>

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.820
Hey, kid. Were you messing
with a big crab monster?

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.520
Huh?

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.660
He was asleep in the park,

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.120
so I drew some nipples on him
with my marker.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:37.760
<i>It's definitely him.</i>

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:43.470
<i>He has no idea what he's done.</i>
<i>What do I do? I could still help.</i>

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:46.970
<i>But man, this kid isn't cute at all.</i>

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.040
<i>It's none of my business.</i>
<i>I should just walk away.</i>

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.610
<i>Right. I mean, who really cares?</i>

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.150
I found you!

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:04.850
<i>What the hell am I doing?</i>

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.790
Huh!

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.660
Kid, he's after you!
Get out of here!

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.530
Don't worry about me. Just go!

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.770
But...

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.040
-My soccer ball...
-Your ball?!

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:26.510
Hey, what's the big idea?

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.710
Don't tell me you're gonna
protect that stinking brat!

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:33.820
Come on, you're gonna kill him
over some harmless prank?

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:36.080
Think about this!

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.790
I've already mutilated lots of people.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:42.520
Whoever makes fun
of the way I look pays the price.

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.090
No exceptions.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:51.470
By the way, that brat drew
nipples on my body.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.970
With a permanent marker!

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.040
Look at these claws!
I can't even use a towel to wipe it off!

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:02.180
Get in my way, and I'll make sure
you never go job hunting again!

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.220
It just came to me.

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.590
You look exactly like a villain
from this anime I used to watch!

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:28.840
Die.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.540
Hold it right there.

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:39.210
In this age of declining birth rates,
I can't just let you kill a kid.

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:43.150
You know what?

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:46.620
When I was a little boy,
I wanted to be a hero.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.060
Not a businessman,

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.690
but a hero who could send
rotten villains like you flying

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.130
with one punch.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:55.630
Screw looking for a job!

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:58.530
Bring it on!

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.670
Some hero you are!

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.040
You're pathetic!

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.080
You don't stand
a chance against me.

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.910
Your life ends... now!

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:40.180
<i>Has it really been three years</i>
<i>since then?</i>

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:49.650
<i>After that day,</i>
<i>I trained so hard I went bald.</i>

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.020
<i>I became so powerful,</i>
<i>no one can beat me.</i>

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:54.920
<i>I'm the hero I dreamed of becoming.</i>

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:58.930
<i>So, what is this? What's wrong?</i>

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.230
<i>Why does my heart feel so empty?</i>

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.670
482 yen, please.

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:07.800
Okay.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.210
Oh, hang on.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.280
I have 82 yen.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.340
Incredible...

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:46.740
This is incredible, little brother!

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.110
<i>I never thought it would work so well.</i>

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:56.380
<i>Yes, it's more than</i>
<i>I ever imagined, big brother.</i>

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:01.320
<i>My goal was to become</i>
<i>the strongest man in the world.</i>

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:04.960
<i>The strongest man.</i>

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.960
<i>That was my dream.</i>

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:13.840
At last, the ultimate steroid,
"Biceps King," is complete!

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:17.240
Little brother!

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:20.240
Drink this and you will obtain
the power you've been seeking!

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:23.910
What? Drink that?

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:28.150
Indeed! I added strawberry flavoring,
to make it go down easier.

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:30.050
Brother...

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:38.990
Yes, this will do!

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.900
<i>My brains and your brawn!</i>

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:46.100
<i>By combining the greatest of minds</i>
<i>and the strongest of bodies,</i>

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:50.770
<i>we brothers will conquer everything</i>
<i>on earth</i>

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.070
<i>and rule as kings!</i>

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.080
Incredible!

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.790
Well done, little brother.
Thousands have perished!

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.490
Now, on to the next town
to destroy it as well!

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:14.400
This! This is it, big bro.
This is what I was looking for...

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.800
To be the strongest man.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:20.130
This is an emergency
evacuation warning.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:24.510
A giant creature
has appeared in City D.

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:28.980
The creature is currently
heading towards City B.

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:33.350
All residents of the area,
please evacuate immediately.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.950
I repeat, the giant creature
is currently heading for--

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:40.320
Yes, that's right! Scatter like rats!

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:41.920
Get them!

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:43.860
I'm the strongest man,

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:47.330
I'm the strongest man,
I'm the strongest man.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.500
What do you think, brother?

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.100
Yeah, how's it feel
being the strongest?

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:54.540
What?!
There's someone on your shoulder!

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:56.940
Put some pants on.

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.880
That guy on your shoulder! Kill him!

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:13.320
Brother!

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:19.930
How did this happen?!
I just wanted to be strong!

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:23.400
And I finally am
the strongest man, but...!

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:32.440
I don't know who you are,
but it's your fault my brother is dead!

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.580
The strongest!

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:47.560
Behold our brotherly power!

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.910
<i>I am the strongest.</i>

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:13.950
<i>So, what if I am?</i>

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:16.380
<i>I feel empty.</i>

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:18.350
Right?

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:31.070
Having overwhelming strength is...

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:33.200
<i>...pretty boring.</i>

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.870
Oops.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.950
<i>There's no sign that the evils</i>
<i>of the world are disappearing.</i>

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:50.450
<i>This hasn't changed since</i>
<i>before I became a hero.</i>

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:54.960
<i>In other words, you could say</i>
<i>that I haven't made any impact.</i>

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:58.190
<i>I'm not necessarily sad about that.</i>

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:02.900
<i>But there's something</i>
<i>bothering me lately.</i>

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:06.200
<i>As the days pass,</i>
<i>my emotions grow more distant.</i>

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:11.970
<i>Fear, tension, joy, anger...</i>
<i>I feel none of them anymore.</i>

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:14.310
<i>In exchange for power,</i>

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:17.450
<i>maybe I've lost something</i>
<i>that's essential for a human being?</i>

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.490
Vroom, vroom?

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:28.320
No sense hiding if you saw me.

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:32.290
I'm Super Custom YO649Z Mk. II!

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.630
I love...

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:36.130
<i>–I used to feel all kinds of emotions</i>
–building custom cars so much...

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.970
<i>–whirling inside me when I fought.</i>
–I decked myself out.

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:41.040
<i>–Fear. Panic. Anger.</i>
–I'm a custom car-loving monster!

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:43.400
If you're thinking of getting in my way,

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:47.410
I'll put a shine
on that big headlight of yours!

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:55.550
<i>But now, all I need</i>
<i>is one punch to end it.</i>

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.290
<i>Guess I'll have eggs over rice tonight.</i>

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:08.530
<i>Each day...</i>

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.270
<i>I come home uninjured</i>
<i>and wash my gloves.</i>

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:16.970
<i>When I'm out fighting monsters,</i>
<i>I never feel as if my heart's really in it.</i>

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:22.280
<i>I mean, I just do the hero-thing</i>
<i>as a hobby.</i>

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.150
<i>In other words,</i>

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:27.750
<i>as long as I get a kick out of it,</i>
<i>that's all I care about.</i>

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:51.140
My house?!

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:06.450
<i>He's tough!</i>

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:09.490
What the hell are you?

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:14.660
"What" am I? That's rude.
We are the true earthlings.

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.360
We?

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.300
I believe you call us
"Subterraneans."

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:23.500
We suffer from overpopulation.

00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:27.240
Therefore, we must now
claim the world aboveground.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:31.350
I understand that there are
many people on the surface too.

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:33.710
As it stands, you are in our way.

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:39.320
That is why we have decided
to eradicate you all.

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:42.760
<i>Since our invasion commenced,</i>

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:46.330
<i>70 percent of the surface dwellers</i>
<i>have been killed.</i>

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:48.200
<i>This is a battle for survival.</i>

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.070
I hope you can understand that.

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:54.740
However, this is unexpected.

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:56.770
We have encountered
no surface dwellers

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.140
-whom our punches would not kill.
-Same here.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.710
<i>It's been too long since</i>
<i>I've come across such worthy opponents,</i>

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:05.510
Subterraneans!

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.480
We are earthlings!

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:19.490
But how?!

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:21.560
You bastard!

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.100
Die!

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:20.250
It's over.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.160
What was that surface dweller?

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:26.630
I'm...

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:29.900
just a guy who's a hero for fun.

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:32.830
I do not lose!

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:35.340
And the surface...

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.440
is under my protection!

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:42.180
Big talk for a race of vermin!

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:59.360
<i>What is this feeling?</i>

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:02.600
<i>This wild throbbing in my heart?!</i>

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:09.270
<i>This rush, this tension!</i>

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.710
<i>It's been so long, I forgot</i>

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:23.420
<i>the exhilaration of a real fight!</i>

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:40.330
<i>It's coming back to me.</i>

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:41.900
<i>This is it.</i>

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:43.440
Well, well...

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:48.840
Looks like you've been taking
good care of my children.

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:50.640
<i>This is it!</i>

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:54.350
<i>I, the Subterranean King,</i>
<i>will take you on.</i>

00:20:55.850 --> 00:21:00.450
This is the very feeling
I've been looking for!

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.810
The surface is ours!

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:21.610
You surface dwellers must die!

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.480
I am the Subterranean King!

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:26.910
Surface dwellers,
prepare yourselves for--

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:34.790
All right, bring it on!

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:39.490
SORRY ABOUT THAT

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.910
<i>I've become too strong.</i>

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:57.510
THE STRONGEST MAN

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:49.490
NEXT EPISODE:
THE LONE CYBORG

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.860
<i>How'd you like seeing me</i>
<i>get ripped apart this week?</i>

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:53.190
<i>Now it's time for me,</i>
<i>the mighty Crablante,</i>

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:55.430
<i>to tell you what happens next week.</i>

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:56.700
<i>Huh? There are no visuals?</i>

00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:00.700
<i>Well, next week this guy appears</i>
<i>in Z City where Saitama lives!</i>

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:02.640
<i>What now? Time's up?</i>

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:06.110
<i>Well next week will be episode 2,</i>
<i>"The Lone Cyborg."</i>

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:07.510
<i>I hope you all--</i>
