WEBVTT

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.350
But this....

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.150
Initiating docking procedures.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.720
Roger.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.370
Elevating from six to nine
on the Torino Scale.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:45.710
CITY A â€“ HERO ASSOCIATION HQ

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.280
The course suddenly shifted?

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.440
I see.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.120
Then we will discuss how best
to deal with the situation.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.520
Should I go now?

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.090
All right.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.290
Master...

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.590
...for some reason the Hero Association
wants me to come in. I will be back later.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.200
Okay. Maybe you're getting fired.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.740
THE ULTIMATE DISCIPLE

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.400
CITY Z HERO ASSOCIATION BUILDING

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.810
You would be Genos?

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.580
My name is Bang. Nice to meet you.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.920
<i>Bang, Class S, Rank 3,</i>
<i>a.k.a. Silver Fang.</i>

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.180
<i>He possesses true skill.</i>

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.290
The association called me in.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.320
Everyone's at headquarters.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.730
This little branch office is empty now.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.530
Each of the Class-S heroes
got the call to come here...

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.200
...but we're the only ones
who showed up.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.200
Why is that?

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.870
Too far away, or perhaps they're busy.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.480
Of course, some of the more
cold-blooded ones simply don't bother.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.680
After all, we're called up only...

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.950
...when there's some impossible problem
they want us to take care of.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.450
Today's no exception.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.260
<i>The threat level is Dragon,</i>
<i>a worst-case scenario.</i>

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.660
<i>Thirty-five minutes from now,</i>
<i>a huge meteor will strike City Z.</i>

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.770
They are asking if nearby Class S heroes
can do anything about it.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.230
A meteor?

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.670
Apparently, it suddenly changed paths.
That means the end for us.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.410
<i>The impact will wipe out City Z.</i>

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.410
I'm afraid there's nothing
we can do this time.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.550
You too should think about evacuating
with your loved ones.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.020
Do the citizens know?

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.520
I was told they would estimate
the impact area...

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.360
<i>...and issue evacuation orders</i>
<i>30 minutes before it hits.</i>

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.500
<i>Attention! This is an announcement</i>
<i>from the Hero Association.</i>

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.370
People are sure to panic.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.570
-And you, old fellow?
-"Old fellow," is it?

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.740
Call me Bang.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.670
You are not evacuating?

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.610
My dojo has been in my family
for generations.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.780
I cannot abandon it.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.420
Fist of Flowing Water Crushing Rock.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:49.680
Heard of it?

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.290
He left.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.790
<i>Emergency evacuation warning.</i>

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.960
<i>The threat level is Dragon.</i>

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.870
<i>Evacuate immediately.</i>

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.440
<i>Twenty-one more minutes</i>
<i>until meteor impact.</i>

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.010
It's huge.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.380
No way we can escape that.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.650
<i>So many people have given up</i>
<i>hope of survival.</i>

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.820
<i>It is not just City Z that is in danger.</i>

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.950
<i>Neighboring cities will</i>
<i>sustain damage too.</i>

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.560
<i>It is too late to evacuate.</i>

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.090
I did not expect to be testing
this prototype so soon!

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.550
<i>Let's see if an attack</i>
<i>from my incineration cannon...</i>

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.090
<i>...at full power will do the trick.</i>

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.960
<i>Master Saitama lives here too.</i>

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.720
<i>I cannot possibly evacuate without him.</i>

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:08.460
Is that--?

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.740
You are Bofoi, correct?

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.950
<i>And you are the new boy, Genos.</i>

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.120
<i>-Come to stop the meteor?</i>
-Yes.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.890
<i>Class S, Rank 7.</i>
<i>A hero who uses intense firepower...</i>

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.490
<i>...to obliterate his opponents,</i>
<i>along with everything in their vicinity.</i>

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.660
<i>Does he also live in City Z?</i>

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.160
<i>Or did he rush here,</i>
<i>putting his life at risk?</i>

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.500
Bofoi, I need your help.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:44.670
<i>I refuse.</i>

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.070
Why?

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.940
<i>I only came to field-test</i>
<i>my new weapon.</i>

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.870
<i>The meteor is a perfect target.</i>

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:53.640
A test?

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.110
If that meteor hits, you too will die.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.110
<i>-I will not.</i>
-What?

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:03.120
<i>What you are talking to right now</i>
<i>is a remotely-controlled drone.</i>

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.020
Sorry to disappoint you,
but my life's not at stake here.

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.830
<i>Also, I am not Bofoi. I am Metal Knight.</i>

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.000
<i>Heroes call each other</i>
<i>by their hero names, not real names.</i>

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.000
<i>Everyone knows that.</i>

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.700
<i>Looks like it's time to end our little chat.</i>

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:27.910
All right.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.850
<i>Firing missiles!</i>

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:36.820
<i>Metal Knight?</i>

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:42.190
<i>I cannot fire with his missiles in the way.</i>

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:58.110
<i>Amazing. Such destructive power.</i>

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.510
<i>This hero is dangerous. I must be wary.</i>

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.920
<i>Not quite potent enough, eh?</i>

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:19.030
<i>Thirty-three seconds left until impact.</i>

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.060
<i>To fire my incineration cannon</i>
<i>at full power...</i>

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.930
<i>...I need five seconds to charge it</i>
<i>with my body's energy.</i>

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:28.670
<i>But the target is already close.</i>

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.540
<i>And if I do take it out, what then?</i>

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:34.680
<i>The meteor may break apart</i>
<i>and still cause a disaster.</i>

00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:37.910
<i>But even before that, will my weapons</i>
<i>be powerful enough to stop it?</i>

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:42.050
<i>Even Metal Knight's countless missiles</i>
<i>had no effect.</i>

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.920
First off, be calm.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.620
I see you've lost composure.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:51.130
You are far too young
to be worried about failure.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.030
When your back's up against the wall,
just muddle through.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.230
The outcome won't change,
so that's what is best.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.040
<i>Muddling through is best?</i>

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.810
<i>He's right.</i>

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:16.650
<i>If the outcome won't change...</i>

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:22.120
<i>...then I how can I die</i>
<i>without giving it my all?</i>

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.290
Bang, get down!

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.130
<i>I will no longer think about</i>
<i>failure or repercussions.</i>

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:35.570
<i>I will just pour everything I have</i>
<i>into one last shot!</i>

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.320
Damn it, it's not working.

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:52.050
No. I think I see the meteor
being pushed back.

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:53.820
Really?

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.860
-Oh, no, it was just my imagination.
-You old fool!

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:02.630
<i>So this will be my grave.</i>

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.740
Nine more seconds.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.750
Get out of here, Bang.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.120
Old man, take care of Genos.

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:30.160
Who--? Who are you?

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.730
I'm a hero.

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:47.110
Master?

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:51.710
You're not...

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.920
...gonna fall...

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:58.120
...on my town!

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.970
He shattered it!

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.770
Unbelievable! But....

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:25.750
It's collapsing.

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:27.950
It's not just this building.

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:33.150
The destruction is spreading
through the whole city.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.430
Guess that settles that.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.470
THREE DAYS LATER

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:51.170
<i>Although City Z was able</i>
<i>to avoid total destruction...</i>

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:53.840
<i>...the city was still devastated...</i>

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.880
<i>...with the effects of the meteor fragments</i>
<i>visible everywhere.</i>

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:03.890
If only the Hero Association had called you
to help instead of me, master.

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:09.290
If you had worked with Metal Knight,
the damage could have been minimized.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.930
But that Metal Knight guy
wasn't interested in helping, right?

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:16.360
So stop worrying about it.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.770
I think we kept the damage
to a minimum.

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.800
After all, no one died.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.770
<i>He is right.</i>

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.410
<i>Master's punch killed</i>
<i>the meteor's momentum.</i>

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:29.910
<i>Theoretically,</i>
<i>the shock waves from the meteor...</i>

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.250
<i>...would have annihilated everything.</i>

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.820
<i>Stopping it was nothing short</i>
<i>of a miracle.</i>

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:38.490
<i>I would not be surprised if people talk</i>
<i>about master for years to come...</i>

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.160
<i>...praising him as a man of courage.</i>

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:44.060
<i>But master has no idea.</i>

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:47.760
<i>Some of the public is even making him out</i>
<i>to be the bad guy...</i>

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.830
<i>...for causing the partial destruction</i>
<i>of City Z.</i>

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.770
<i>No, I should not mention it.</i>

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:59.070
By the way,
do you think we moved up in ranking?

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:00.910
Yes, we did.

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:04.050
I went from Class S Rank 17 to 16.

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.950
Metal Knight also moved up
from Rank 7 to 6.

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:11.850
Master, you shot up
from Class C Rank 342 to 5.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.160
Number 5?

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:18.830
From 342 to 5? What the hell?
That's crazy!

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:24.130
Not at all. Your performance was worthy
of Class A or even Class S.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:27.200
After all, it was threat level Dragon.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.040
-Yeah?
-If there had been no damage...

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:33.440
...I am sure you would be
at Class S Rank 5.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:39.150
Smashing the meteor alone
was worthy of Class A.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:46.220
But I think the Hero Association assumed
that Metal Knight and I played a big role.

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:49.020
By the way,
they always report threat levels...

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.160
...as Demon or Tiger or whatever.

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.590
Does all that mean anything?

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.360
It does.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:59.170
<i>Tiger: A crisis threatening</i>
<i>massive loss of life.</i>

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:02.570
<i>Demon: A crisis threatening to halt</i>
<i>the functioning of an entire city...</i>

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.170
<i>...or its destruction.</i>

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:07.880
<i>Dragon: A crisis threatening</i>
<i>the destruction of multiple cities.</i>

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.880
<i>God: A crisis threatening</i>
<i>human extinction.</i>

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:12.250
GUIDE TO THREAT LEVELS

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:13.450
Wow, I had no idea.

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:16.320
I believe heroes often consider
threat levels...

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:20.220
...when deciding
whether to respond or not.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.960
But I guess they do not matter to you.

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:24.560
Well, of course not.

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:28.000
If the heroes run away,
who's left to help?

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:33.400
What are you doing?

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:36.100
I must record your words.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:41.610
Anyway, it wasn't all that much
for such a huge jump in rank.

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:42.980
All right.

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:46.510
I'll be out for a bit.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.880
You are going out, master?

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.420
I will come with you.

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:55.590
You stay here. If something happens,
you'll get all the credit again.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.030
This place has been wrecked.

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:10.470
My favorite supermarket got smashed.

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:13.910
And the crappy apartment building
I got kicked out of is...

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.240
...just fine. Damn.

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.380
Hey.

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:21.080
You cheating bastard.

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:24.290
Who are you?

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:27.290
You know damn well. I'm Tanktop Tiger.

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.490
Brother!

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:33.960
-It's that guy!
<i>-Seriously, who is this guy?</i>

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.470
You called me, little bro?

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:39.530
Brother!

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:43.470
The hero Tanktop Black Hole is here!

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:47.280
So you're the fraud who takes credit
for work done by Class S heroes...

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:49.040
...in order to jump the rankings?

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.180
What the--?

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:54.450
No one could move up to number five
so quickly without cheating.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.050
What do you guys want?

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.190
Isn't that obvious?

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.460
To beat you up so bad
you'll never be able to--

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:04.130
Hang on, little bro.

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:08.530
Bastards like him don't learn
from that kind of lesson.

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:15.440
Let's make him really pay
with the most brutal method there is.

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:18.540
Are you the one?!

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:23.110
The jerk-off responsible
for destroying this city?!

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:25.410
<i>I get it.</i>

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:28.980
<i>There are tons of people in this city</i>
<i>who are angry with him.</i>

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:32.590
Unbelievable!
How can you show your face?!

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:36.390
<i>I see what he's doing.</i>
<i>He's going to use their anger...</i>

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:40.730
Do you feel nothing
at the sight of this devastation?!

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.230
<i>...to break his spirit.</i>

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:48.600
You're gloating, thinking you've actually
saved these people!

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:52.510
Why else would you be walking around
so shamelessly?

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:58.050
Thanks to your screw-up,
these citizens have nowhere to go!

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:00.680
If you were gonna fail this hard,
why'd you butt in?

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:04.550
The other heroes would have
done a way better job!

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:09.120
And yet you still wanna play hero,
even after causing such a huge disaster?

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.490
Look at this place!

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:14.400
All this destruction is your doing!

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.570
That's right.

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:19.300
It-- It's your fault!

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:22.200
<i>They took the bait.</i>

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.240
You hear that?

00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:27.280
The heart-wrenching cry
of someone who lost his home!

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:33.150
Look at them all,
victims of your thoughtless actions!

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.220
-That's right!
-Yeah, you tell him!

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:38.390
Haven't you even thought
to take responsibility?

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.060
-Yeah!
-You're inhuman!

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:43.560
Give up being a hero!

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:46.730
<i>Give it up! Give it up! Give it up!</i>

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:50.130
<i>-Give it up! Give it up!</i>
<i>-Give it up!</i>

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:53.300
<i>Give it up! Give it up! Give it up!</i>

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:55.340
-Go on, get out of here!
-Get lost!

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:57.240
-Beat it!
-Scram!

00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:00.680
<i>Give it up! Give it up! Give it up!</i>

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:04.810
<i>Give it up! Give it up! Give it up!</i>

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:09.150
<i>Give it up! Give it up! Give it up!</i>

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:12.320
<i>Give it up! Give it up! Give it up!</i>

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:14.420
<i>Give it up! Give it up! Give it up!</i>

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:18.630
<i>We got him.</i>
<i>His pride should be shattered by now.</i>

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:22.660
<i>That's what he gets for cheating.</i>
<i>That idiot.</i>

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:24.470
CITY Z FORUM

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.100
IS IT TRUE A CLASS-C HERO
DESTROYED THE TOWN?

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:36.210
<i>Give it up! Give it up! Give it up!</i>

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:38.210
<i>Give it up! Give it up!</i>

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:40.750
<i>Is this what you call mob mentality?</i>

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.180
<i>They're all chanting in unison.</i>

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:47.320
<i>Give it up! Give it up! Give it up!</i>

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:52.390
<i>Saitama, without a doubt,</i>
<i>you saved this city.</i>

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.530
<i>Yet look how the city treats you.</i>

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:57.600
<i>This is reality, though.</i>

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.370
<i>You're strong,</i>
<i>the strongest man I've ever seen.</i>

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:05.410
<i>That's why I refrain</i>
<i>from saying anything.</i>

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:10.140
<i>I'd hate to see you rotting away</i>
<i>in this industry.</i>

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:12.610
<i>Resigning is also an option.</i>

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:15.420
<i>Time to finish him off!</i>

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.520
Hey! He's getting ready to fight!

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:21.320
-What are you talking--?
-No way!

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:24.660
You're gonna take out your frustration
on these people here...

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:26.860
...just like you destroyed their city?

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:28.930
Do you just kill everyone you don't like?

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:30.830
I won't let you do that!

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:34.540
We, the Tanktop Brothers, will not
stand by and let you resort to violence!

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:38.710
If you're a hero,
then fight us fair and square.

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:41.940
<i>So they're out to crush a rookie...</i>

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.650
<i>...and perform a publicity stunt</i>
<i>at the same time.</i>

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.750
<i>I'd say they've gotten a little greedy.</i>

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:51.550
<i>No wonder they can't rise</i>
<i>above Class B.</i>

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:53.220
-Yeah!
-Go, Tanktop!

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:54.360
Do it!

00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:00.960
Tanktop Tiger,
who fights like a true tiger, and....

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:06.330
Tanktop Black Hole, who crushes all
with a grip strength of 2,800 psi!

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:10.970
We brothers will punish all who stray
from the path of the hero!

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:17.880
Damn it!

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:20.410
I'll rip you apart!

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:24.790
I give up! I give up!

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.490
You're crushing my hand!

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:29.360
You're kidding, right?

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:31.990
I give up for real! I'm sorry!

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:34.830
I'm sorry for lying!

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.570
No, you weren't lying.

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:40.570
I'm the one who smashed the meteor!

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:44.740
Anyone with a complaint, let's hear it.
Speak up!

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:49.410
Because of you, my brand-new car was--

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:51.480
You can shut up!

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:54.320
Why would I give a crap
about your problems?

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:56.820
Tell it to the meteor, jackass!

00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:02.390
Listen up!
I don't do this hero thing for admiration!

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.530
I do it because I want to!

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.330
So if you wanna blame me, go ahead,
you baldies!

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:08.960
You're the baldy.

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:11.430
What'd you say?!

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:13.030
Master.

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:15.400
Oh, it's you, Genos.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.610
-Hang on. These guys--
-Let's go home...

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:20.840
...master.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.020
Yeah?

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:32.050
Damn it, that guy's face
is burned into my brain.

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:34.860
I'm gonna remember this.

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:36.460
Master.

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:41.060
I have never met any person
as incredible as you, Master Saitama.

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:44.670
What brought that on?
You're creeping me out.

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:47.670
Even if the public
doesn't appreciate you...

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.670
...I will still follow you.

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:54.480
You don't have to butter me up. Really.

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:36.980
I heard there's some amazing hero
in Class C right now.

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:38.550
Class C?

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:40.750
The guy who says
he smashed the meteor, right?

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:41.920
That's just a rumor.

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:46.090
Going after weak guys,
then calling yourself a hero?

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:50.820
Just shows that there's no hero
you can really count on.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.460
NEXT EPISODE:
THE DEEP SEA KING

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:54.060
<i>My name is Bofoi.</i>

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:58.870
<i>You all may know me better</i>
<i>as Metal Knight.</i>

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.740
<i>Next time on </i>One-Punch Man:
<i>Episode 8, "The Deep Sea King."</i>

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:07.940
<i>Oh, the king of the sea, eh?</i>
<i>Pretty cocky.</i>

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.810
<i>Wonder what he's like.</i>
