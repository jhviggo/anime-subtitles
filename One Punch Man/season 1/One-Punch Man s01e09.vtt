WEBVTT

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.130
You are one of
the Seafolk, correct?

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.300
What if I am?

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.770
You must be another soldier.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.510
I am here to eliminate you.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.800
Was that...

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.600
the last of them?

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.200
Wow!

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.640
– Awesome!
– Amazing!

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.070
<i>They must have been desperate.</i>

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.410
Now I'm angry.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.820
I will tear you to shreds.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.490
I let my guard down again.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.660
I never learn.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.590
<i>Saitama.</i>

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.730
You're Class C, rank 2.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.560
Are you sure?

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:08.630
<i>Yeah.</i>

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.070
Hurry it up. It's raining.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.240
<i>He burst through every record</i>
<i>during the fitness exam.</i>

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.410
<i>And he worked with some Class S</i>
<i>heroes to destroy that meteor.</i>

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.550
<i>But because he came out of nowhere,</i>
<i>people are saying he's a fraud.</i>

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.780
<i>Any other class C hero I'd stop.</i>

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.820
This may be our chance
to see how strong he truly is.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.260
Saitama, here's the location.
Head there immediately.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.710
UNYIELDING JUSTICE

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.270
Those who can walk,
leave the shelter now!

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.510
I cannot promise I will win.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.410
Run, while I keep him busy!

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.690
None of you monkeys
will escape me!

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.810
Lightning Eye!

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.520
I can't see.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.320
Machinegun Blows!

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.600
You do like combo attacks,
don't you?

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.680
You can do it!

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.480
Quiet!

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.980
Now you melt, girl.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.520
If you'd focused on me,

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.690
you could have easily dodged
my little ball of acid.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.460
Instead, you chose to sacrifice yourself
to save a runt.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.060
You're a fool, but I give you credit
for giving me a few scratches.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.930
Of course, they've already healed.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.070
Now, die.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.540
Justice Crash!

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.550
The Cyclist for Justice,
Mumen Rider is here!

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.650
The top hero in Class C?

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.790
Don't...

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.560
It's Mumen Rider!

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.390
Mumen Rider came for us.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.500
But he...

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.070
I'm bored already.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.790
Oh, my apologies.
I nearly forgot to kill you.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.760
Justice Tackle.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.540
No one expects much...

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:53.910
...from me.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.950
They think a Class C hero
won't be much help.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.760
I know that better than anyone!

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.460
I'm not good enough for Class B.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.960
I'm weak. I know that much.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.470
No one has to tell me I have
no chance of beating you.

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.770
I already know that!

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:28.180
What are you babbling about?
Begging for your life?

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:31.210
And yet, I must try.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.480
It's not about winning or losing!

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:40.920
It's about me taking you on
right here, right now!

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:49.630
Enough of your rambling.
Time to finish you off.

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:52.670
You can do it!

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.640
Mumen Rider, you can do it!

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:02.680
You're the Cyclist for Justice!

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.480
Beat that weird monster, beat him!

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.190
You can do it!

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:12.720
Yeah, get him!

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:14.220
Beat him up!

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:16.930
We're counting on you, Mumen Rider.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:18.930
–You can do it!
–Beat him!

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:20.660
Good luck!

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:41.520
I think not!

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.090
You did fine. Nice fight.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.000
Yet another piece of garbage
washed up on my shore?

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:58.930
Hey, Genos!

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.240
Are you still alive?!

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.940
Master.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:08.210
Hang on for a second.

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:11.310
I've gotta pound this Seafreak
or whatever it's called.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.620
I heard that!

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:24.190
Impressive. You're still on your feet
after one of my punches.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.030
Clearly you're different
from the rest of this trash.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.300
Huh? Your punch
was too weak, that's all.

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:35.940
Hey, someone else is over there.
Who is that? A hero?

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.340
That head...

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:39.210
I remember it from
the Hero Registry.

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:41.840
I know him! He's a Class C rookie.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.680
I think he's Rank 2.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.050
Class C?

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:48.220
So we're still gonna get killed.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:51.590
But that punch
didn't hurt him at all.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:53.020
That's your imagination.

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:55.720
You saw how many heroes
were blown away

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:57.360
by that thing's punches, right?

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:03.870
I am the King of the Deep,
Lord of the Seas.

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:08.170
All life on Earth comes from the sea,
as if she were our mother.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.970
In other words, as ruler of the seas,

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.210
I am the pinnacle of a pyramid

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:16.780
that includes every living organism
on this world!

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.620
–To defy me, means--
–Yeah, yeah, I got it.

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:22.880
It's raining out, so let's do this.

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:48.910
What!

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.040
Awesome!

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.250
That was amazing!

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:54.780
–Thank goodness!
–He did it!

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:07.760
Well, that was lame.
I kind of had my hopes up too.

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.670
I'm back with my weapons.

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.840
But damn you, Deep Sea King.
You got away.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.750
Hey, what's that?

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.020
It is the mail.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:36.120
The post office cannot come here,
so the drone now delivers the mail.

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:37.730
The post office's drone?

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:41.130
No, it belongs
to the Hero Association.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.300
I see.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:49.070
The public sends these to the heroes,
much like fan letters.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.340
Seriously? Are there any for me?

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:54.110
TO C CLASS HERO SAITAMA

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.980
–There are.
–Oh! Let's go in and open them!

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:01.020
Mr. Genos, I've been a huge fan of yours
since I first laid my eyes on you!

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.050
I think you are a true hero. I even joined
your fan club. I'm just crazy about you.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.300
No one cares about you,
you cowardly, cheating bastard.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.800
Damn it...
I'll find out who sent it.

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:21.000
Here's a guy with free time.

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:30.180
All it took was one punch!

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.380
One punch! Just one!

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:34.320
Is he really Class C?

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:35.450
He's too strong!

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.120
Or maybe,

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:41.060
the monster wasn't really that tough?

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.490
Yeah, but so many heroes went down.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:48.260
That just means those heroes
were weaklings.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.930
Maybe. I suppose the monster didn't
look all that tough when he killed it.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:58.040
After all, a Class C hero
took it out with a single punch!

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:00.270
What's that say about
the heroes it beat?

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.540
They may call themselves
Class A or Class S,

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:06.010
but their titles
don't mean a thing.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:11.050
Hey, enough of that.
They risked their lives for us.

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:14.490
Risked their lives?
Anyone can do that.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.960
But a "hero" has to beat monsters.

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.290
It all ended well this time,
so whatever.

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:24.930
But it's annoying when heroes
who are really just average Joes

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.330
show up and try to save you.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.400
If you're gonna call yourself
a hero, then--

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:30.140
Shut your fat mouth!

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.170
Why are you getting mad at me?

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:36.540
The Hero Association gets their funds
from our donations, right?

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:40.920
As long as we're paying for it,
they'd better protect us.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.850
The fact of the matter is

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.820
that bald guy pretty much took care
of it all by himself.

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:48.520
So all the other heroes
died for nothing.

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:51.960
Anyone can come up with a way
to buy a little time.

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:56.260
In the end, the other "heroes"
didn't do anything heroic.

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:57.430
I said shut up!

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:00.270
We were all saved.
Just leave it at that.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:01.940
Exactly!

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:07.940
Today's my lucky day!

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:13.610
The other heroes wore the monster down,
so beating it was kid's play!

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.050
Good thing I was late.

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:19.350
I barely did a thing
and now I get all the credit.

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:22.560
Hey, spread the word, all of you!

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:25.490
I'm the one who finished
the monster off!

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.460
I'll beat the snot out
of anyone who says

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:30.160
it's only 'cause I got here late!

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:31.570
What's he mean?

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:33.400
The monster was already weak?

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:34.940
Huh...?

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.240
Hang on a sec. That's Saitama!

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:38.370
Saitama?

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:42.410
He's the hero from City Z
that everyone calls a cheat.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.080
What? A cheat?

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:48.080
He appeared out of nowhere
and climbed the ranks super-fast.

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:49.320
Yeah, pretty fishy.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:50.650
Hey, you guys!

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.990
Look after the fallen heroes, okay?

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:55.960
If they die on me,

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.030
how am I gonna cash in
on their work?

00:14:58.090 --> 00:14:59.430
He is a cheat!

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:00.660
Man, that's no fair.

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:02.430
So he's just taking the credit?

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:06.300
<i>Compared to him, the other heroes</i>
<i>seem a little more heroic.</i>

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:09.640
<i>Where would we be now...</i>

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.670
<i>if the other heroes hadn't fought?</i>

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:15.240
<i>Yeah, I feel so grateful to them all.</i>

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:20.620
<i>Master Saitama.</i>

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.250
<i>Is this really what you want?</i>

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.550
<i>Hey, it stopped raining.</i>

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:31.960
<i>If this is the path you choose to walk,</i>
<i>I will not interfere.</i>

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:37.700
<i>But in the future, if you are ever</i>
<i>forced into a corner by this,</i>

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:40.670
<i>at that moment, I will--</i>

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:42.700
Hey, there's one more.

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:48.540
TO THE HERO SAITAMA: THANKS!!

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:51.180
Someone's thanking me.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.050
It must be someone you saved.

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:56.980
I see. Any left?

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:00.050
There is one from the Hero Association.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.420
The Association?

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:03.220
Are they firing me?

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:04.660
Well, whatever.

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:10.600
What's this? I'm Class C, rank 1?

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:12.530
CITY Z - HERO ASSOCIATION OFFICE

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.500
So, why'd you call me in?

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.640
When you registered
with the Hero Registry,

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:21.210
you were given
the Association handbook.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:26.710
Haven't you read it?
It lists all our rules and regulations.

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.520
Yeah, I guess I've got it somewhere.

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:34.260
No matter. Congratulations
on attaining rank 1 in Class C.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.260
Hm? Oh, I see.

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:39.430
So you guys are the ones
who decide the hero rankings.

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:43.030
There are more members
on the review board,

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.000
but the four of us here today
will be handling your interview.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.470
Interview?

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:53.040
The top ranking Class C hero is given
the option to be promoted to Class B.

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:56.640
However, if you wish to remain
in Class C, that's fine too.

00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:58.550
How about it, Mr. Saitama?

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:00.520
Do you want to move up?

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.620
Although if you do, you'll be ranked
at the very bottom again.

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:07.590
Either way's fine,
but I guess I'll try moving up.

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:10.560
There'll be no more weekly quotas
that way.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:16.260
<i>Besides, I can't stick to Class C forever</i>
<i>with Genos in Class S.</i>

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:19.530
I see, so you want a promotion.

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.670
First, we'll need you to answer
some questions

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.670
and undergo a psychiatric analysis.

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.110
This Saitama...

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:31.150
He's the one who finished off
the Deep Sea King.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.510
What do you think?

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.480
Some say he's a fraud.

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:37.720
He set new overall records
in the fitness exam,

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:39.820
so his physical ability is solid.

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:45.160
Well, according to rumors,
he cheated on the exams, too.

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:47.300
Rumors are just rumors.

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.670
No sense in doubting him now.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.670
The bottom line is,
he wants to move up.

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:56.640
Why not let him go for now?

00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:59.570
If he's for real,
he'll make it in Class B.

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:05.210
But if he's a fake, he'll soon regret it.

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:09.080
He is entering a cruel and callous world.

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.450
We'll cross that bridge when we must.

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:14.260
Promotion to Class B?

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.230
You interrupted my filming for this?

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:20.560
It's not something
that needs my attention.

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:23.360
This is a decision
for the executive committee.

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:24.570
Listen.

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:28.800
I only want input on managing heroes
Class A and above,

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:31.410
since they have a strong impact
on society.

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:33.370
As a hero in the same class,

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:36.110
if they're inadequate,
it hurts my image too.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.410
Especially this last incident...

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:41.650
It was beyond inadequate—
it was appalling.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.720
Don't you agree?

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:48.490
Speaking of social impact,
the hero now wanting to move up

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.390
is the one who finished off
the Deep Sea King.

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:09.140
UNKNOWN HEROES SNATCH VICTORY

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.380
Why the sour pusses?

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.650
That's no way to show off
those cute faces!

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.720
You?!

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:21.560
I thought you were in prison!

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:24.890
I escaped just to see you!

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:28.430
Now it's time for your Angel shots!

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:33.300
You guys! You need your meds!

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.270
A "CLASS S" FAILURE!

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:49.680
So I'm Class B now.

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:52.520
Those tests took long enough.

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:55.260
Meh, not like I had to be somewhere.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:57.930
Something smells good.

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:00.960
Welcome.

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:04.700
Assorted oden, please.

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:05.830
All right.

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:07.440
Want a drink?

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.440
If you're not drinking,
let me buy you a plate.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.710
-Why?
-That.

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:16.580
You were at the Association?

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.210
Let's celebrate your promotion.

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:27.990
Thanks for giving me a ride.

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:32.230
Should I walk?

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:35.000
No, I can handle it.

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:39.600
Hey, are you scared?

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:44.340
You got separated from
the Class S hero, Genos, right?

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.410
The enemy is threat level Demon.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.010
A monster so formidable that even if

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.510
the Class S and Class B heroes all
ganged up on him, they'd never win.

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:53.980
So if you wanna run...

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:55.750
Are you Class S too?

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:58.490
No, I'm Class C.

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:02.020
Laugh if you want to.

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:03.660
I'm not laughing.

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:09.930
It sure is tough making those
weekly quotas for us Class C's...

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.500
You're a funny guy.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:19.940
I'm Mumen Rider.
A hero, just like you.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.040
Huh?

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:24.450
Hey! Watch it!

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:28.880
Oh! You're that guy!

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.950
I've been looking for you.

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:34.390
I couldn't say everything in my letter.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.560
Oh, yeah.

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.700
Maybe some mozuku then?

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.070
Hey! Give us your best mozuku!

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.640
Coming right up.

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:31.640
It approaches!

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:34.140
Madame Shibabawa?
What's wrong?

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:37.040
A violent catastrophe draws near.

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:39.480
Madame Shibabawa!
Get a hold of yourself!

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:42.020
This is the end!

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:47.820
The Earth is doomed!

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:52.090
NEXT EPISODE:
UNPARALLELED PERIL

<i>I am the Deep Sea King!</i>

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.670
<i>If I made one misstep,</i>
<i>it was not fighting the battle at sea.</i>

00:23:58.730 --> 00:23:59.800
<i>An away game!</i>

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:02.600
