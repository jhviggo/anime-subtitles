WEBVTT

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.070
Humans!

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.570
If you wish not for annihilation,
take heed!

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.540
I bear a message from the depths!

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.620
You will surrender the surface to us,
the Clan of the Seafolk!

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.430
Thereafter you shall become
our nourishment, human scum—

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.730
Nice head! Are you related to
an octopus by any chance?

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.810
I heard it was that same guy again.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.680
What was his name?

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.780
I forget, but he's super-strong.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.420
HE TAKES EVERY OPPONENT
OUT WITH A SINGLE PUNCH.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.360
BUT PEOPLE SAY
HE STEALS OTHERS' CREDIT.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.560
I MEAN, HE'S CLASS C.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.130
Class C?

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.060
Never seen him before.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.170
I've got to keep up.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.720
THE DEEP SEA KING

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.290
Help! Somebody!

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.330
We, the Clan of the Seafolk,
now rule the surface!

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.370
It is useless to resist!

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.340
You'll pay for that, human!

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.280
The Class A hero Stinger,

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.780
rising in popularity and currently
11th in the rankings, is here to help.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.520
At your service, everyone!

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.780
It's Stinger!

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:02.850
We're saved!

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.120
Go for it!

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.660
Well now...

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.230
Anyone who needs a new blowhole
drilled into their torso, step right up!

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.610
ONE PUNCH MAN

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.390
Master...

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.920
You have moved up to
rank 2 in Class C.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.360
You are on the verge of
entering Class B!

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:53.900
Class B, huh?

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.400
That means I won't have any more
weekly hero quotas, right?

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.500
Correct.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.500
Oh, excuse me...

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:01.770
Hello?

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.840
City J? It is a bit far.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.480
Are there no
competent heroes nearby?

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.910
Busy guy.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:10.750
Master!

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.750
The monster you defeated
on your way home the other day

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.280
called itself one of
the "Seafolk," right?

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:17.650
I forget.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.020
<i>Several monsters calling themselves</i>
<i>the "Clan of the Seafolk"</i>

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.860
<i>have appeared in City J and</i>
<i>are attacking anyone in sight.</i>

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.400
A Class A hero fighting them
all alone and on the brink of defeat.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.340
<i>His extreme fatigue</i>
<i>and pain are apparent</i>

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.370
<i>A prompt response from</i>
<i>the Hero Association</i>

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:37.640
<i>is desperately needed.</i>

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:38.840
Hang on!

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.340
<i>The threat level is Tiger.</i>

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.350
<i>All citizens are asked to</i>
<i>stay out of the area.</i>

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.020
You've got spunk,
you slimy bastards.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.020
My beloved Bamboo Shoot here

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.620
is happy to be battling enemies
with some grit for a change.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.030
But it's time to end this.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.930
You can quit your boasting, human!

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.330
Your foolish fan club has run off.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.870
But your death will not be easy.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.410
For the taking of our brothers' lives,
long will we cause you to suffer.

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.070
Four fish to go!

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.310
It's a lot easier
without an audience!

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.510
Sing, Bamboo Shoot!

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.760
Gigantic Drill Stinger
Quadruple Thrust!

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.390
I did it...

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.060
I did it!

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.600
These monsters were probably
a God-level threat...

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.500
and I defeated them all by my—

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.370
You know,
when something's so annoying,

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.410
it is a pleasure to watch it die.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.350
How much farther is City J?

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:52.950
We are almost there.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.650
But I am getting no readings.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.380
I will scout ahead.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.990
Once I have confirmed their location,
I will let you know.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:00.960
Oh...hey!

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.560
<i>This is an announcement</i>
<i>from the Hero Association.</i>

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.930
<i>The threat level is Tiger.</i>

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.000
<i>All citizens,</i>
<i>please stay clear of the area.</i>

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.570
CITY A - HERO ASSOCIATION HQ

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.670
Was the warning issued?

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.810
The request just went out.

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.110
We'll need to update it
and re-issue.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:23.980
What do you mean?

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.480
Stinger is down.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.020
Mumen Rider here. I'm heading in.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.620
Give me the location.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.160
All lines are busy at this time—

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.790
– Where are they?
– Hey, best forget it!

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.030
Class C heroes
can't handle this one.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.430
– Huh?
– The word just came down.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.140
<i>Emergency evacuation warning.</i>

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.810
<i>The threat level has been</i>
<i>raised from Tiger to Demon.</i>

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.710
– <i>All residents of City J,</i>
– See what I mean?

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.440
<i>please evacuate immediately.</i>

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.080
Hey!

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:01.680
<i>I repeat. All residents of City J,</i>
<i>please evacuate immediately.</i>

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:03.820
Evacuate?

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:05.590
How foolish.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.820
As if I'd allow even one
of these apes to escape.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.960
So that's the one that got Stinger...

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.530
But he's the last of 'em.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:18.970
Should I wait for backup?

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.170
If it's one-on-one, maybe I can—

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.210
That smarts.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:33.780
Why would you do this?

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.450
Dammit, how'd he get behind me?

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.720
I was so surprised my voice
went all funky.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.690
Plus, my gunpowder-charged
lightning kick had zero effect!

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.760
I can't win.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.090
Who are you?

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:46.700
I am...

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:49.660
Lightning Max, the hero...

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.070
Fight me.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:52.700
Fight you? Of course.

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:54.000
I'll run for it as soon as—

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:00.580
What happened?

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:03.880
I can't feel my body...

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:11.620
Dammit.

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:13.620
You arrogant...

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:19.560
Lightning Flying Backwards
Roundhouse Kick!

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.050
Class S hero,

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.020
Puri-puri Prisoner.

00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:44.750
I escaped from prison...
just to see you!

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.920
Well, well.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.720
A hero serving time in prison?

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:54.200
I tagged along and
was able to escape too.

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:55.930
My thanks.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:00.070
Prisoner number 4188, Sonic, right?

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.140
Surprised I know?

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.740
You see, I check up on
all the boys who catch my eye.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:10.280
I'm serving a life sentence because
I can't resist attacking beautiful men.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:12.110
Oh, my.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:16.320
More soldiers come for me?

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.320
Goodness!

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.790
I feel the strength about to
erupt out of him!

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.630
Sonic, dear, you hang back.

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:29.000
Class A rank 11, sweet Stinger.

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.830
Class A rank 20, Lighting Max.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.670
I fancied them both.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:38.070
And yet you ruined them!

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:41.710
Now that Genos has passed me,
I am the lowest in rank...

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.580
but I am still Class S!

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.350
I am unlike either of them.

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:50.320
I'll begin at half-power,
to gauge how much you can take.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:02.900
You made me rip the hand-knit
sweater my boyfriend made!

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:09.370
I will never, ever forgive you!

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.080
A delectable slab of meat,
quite prime.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.240
My appetite's up!

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.120
Huh?

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:26.190
Oh my...

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:35.300
I felt that...

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.300
just a little.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.400
I felt that too...a little.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:46.310
Puri-puri Prisoner is acting tough,
but he's hurting...

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.940
So this is what a fight between
a demon-level monster

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:51.650
and a Class S hero looks like?

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:53.280
It's almost comical.

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:56.280
Neither one could defeat me.

00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:00.390
Dammit... His punch was stronger
than I expected.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.160
But I must not lose to him.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:07.400
I can't have any more of my boys
destroyed by this monster...

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.200
I have no choice.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.100
I'll have to transform.

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:13.870
Ready...

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.700
Transform!

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:22.210
Puri-puri Prisoner Angel Style!

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:24.410
He's naked.

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:26.780
And he's definitely no angel.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.380
Nor is he human.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:30.180
Nor do I want to watch.

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:31.290
I'm out.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:35.220
No one has ever seen my Angel Style
and lived to tell about it.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.460
All the more reason to leave.

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:39.730
Quite unsightly.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.730
Are those...your last words?

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:53.270
Angel Rush!

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.150
Elevated energy levels nearby.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:05.790
That must be it.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.460
Damn it! I have no way
to reach Master!

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:13.390
It cannot be helped.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.840
Done with your combo?

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:30.950
I felt that...a little.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:39.150
Hear me.

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:43.760
The objective of a combination move
is to finish your opponent.

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:47.100
Each separate attack must be
delivered with intent to kill.

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.800
Like this.

00:12:58.070 --> 00:12:59.510
Isn't this fun?

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:01.980
Just who are you?

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.210
I am the Deep Sea King.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.550
As lord of the Clan of the Seafolk,
this world is mine to rule.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.990
Do you dare defy me too?

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:16.420
You think you have the strength
to rule the surface all alone?

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:17.790
That's pathetic.

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:19.030
Oh?

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.430
Then I suppose you must die.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.960
That's my line.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:28.040
I would have let you live if you'd
shown me the respect I'm due.

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:31.540
I'm no hero, but I will eliminate you.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.140
The rain...is falling.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.180
Too slow.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.280
Wind Blade Leg!

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:47.190
Deep Sea King,
I see right through your moves.

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:50.560
Are you sure of that?

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.600
Once it bites,
my little moray here never lets go!

00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:58.170
Let me be clear.

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:00.870
There's no way I'd ever lose to you.

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:07.480
It's useless.

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:09.040
You may have power...

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:16.080
but you're too slow to fight me.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.220
I'm glad, Deep Sea King!

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:23.460
Fighting something like you just
confirms how strong I really am!

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:27.560
You see, my moves are
the fastest and the strongest!

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:33.970
Now what, lost your mind?

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:38.870
He's faster!

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:42.410
Stronger too?!

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.250
What happened to him?

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:48.350
He's huge!

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:52.120
The air of the surface
shriveled me up a bit,

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:55.890
but thanks to this rain,
I feel like myself again.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.630
Your attacks don't hurt me...
even a little!

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:09.100
<i>At this time, the whereabouts of the Seafolk</i>
<i>that attacked City J are unknown.</i>

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.270
<i>Several heroes</i>
<i>who tried to stop them</i>

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.580
<i>have been found</i>
<i>unconscious at the scene</i>

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:17.250
<i>and remain in critical condition.</i>

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.980
Of all the times to hit a red light...

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:24.090
Where'd he run off to?

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:27.420
Wait, you're...

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:29.290
Class C, rank 2.

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:31.290
You a hero too?

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:33.430
Have you seen Genos?

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:34.660
Genos?

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:39.630
Today, as our guest, we have
the top-ranked, Class A superhero

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.440
who has also been number one
in popularity rankings

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.140
for 28 weeks straight.

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:47.480
He's also a successful model,
actor and singer.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:52.010
Let's welcome
the handsome Mr. Amai Mask!

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:54.680
Thank you for having me.

00:15:56.150 --> 00:16:00.420
We are currently facing
a threat level of Demon.

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.260
How do you assess the situation?

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.960
That is a difficult question.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:06.660
Why is that?

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.600
I'm only a hero when I confront evil.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:14.470
The rest of the time, I'm focused on
my career as an artist.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.040
I see.

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:19.570
I'm only here today
to promote my new song.

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:21.410
My apologies.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.280
In that case, let's discuss your song.

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:28.420
Let me just say this.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:32.090
To assuage the public's fears
and worries,

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:35.490
heroes need to be
both tough and strong

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:42.060
so that they can defeat evil
with speed, grace, and brilliance.

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:45.100
I find it regrettable that
there were heroes

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:47.640
who were completely beaten
by evil this time.

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:51.540
So that no hero ever dies in vain,

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:54.510
I hope each will continue
to train his hardest.

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:58.080
My attacks have no effect.

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:00.010
Could I be lacking in power?

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.650
I can't kill him unarmed.

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.590
I need to retreat for now
and find a weapon.

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:08.090
Caught you!

00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:11.590
Crack crack, snap snap.

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:14.760
Huh?

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.100
Wait there.

00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:21.200
The next time we meet
will be your demise.

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:24.740
No matter.

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:27.240
The small fry can be let go.

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:33.710
Who are you?

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:35.150
What are you doing here?

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.550
There were orders to evacuate.

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:39.690
A hero?

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:42.360
If you're after the Deep Sea King,
better forget it.

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:43.790
Deep Sea King?

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:46.690
You heroes could all jump him
at once and still lose.

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.700
You're fine at playing make-believe,

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:52.100
but against true power
you don't stand a chance.

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:53.530
You can't protect a thing.

00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.270
Who was that pervert?

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:02.180
The Seafolk?!

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.750
I sense numerous
life signals nearby.

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:06.680
With so many...

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.220
The evacuation shelter!

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:15.360
Daddy, are the scary monsters
still outside?

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:20.160
Don't worry. As long as
we're in this shelter, we're safe.

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:21.800
Besides...if it comes down to it,

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:25.230
I'm sure all of us together
can beat a monster or two.

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:29.640
I sense them...

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.570
Yes, so many!

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:34.480
It's coming from...

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.580
over there!

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.190
Greetings...

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:47.390
and goodbye.

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.230
Please wait!

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.690
We surrender!

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:56.430
We will comply with
any demands you have.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.430
But please do not attack. I beg you.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:04.270
I'm only Class C, so I evacuated.
Now I'm trapped.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.440
I'm no hero. I'm a failure...

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:08.810
Surrender?

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:13.850
I've come to kill you.
Your deaths are inevitable!

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.690
And as for my demands...

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:21.860
How about I demand you scream
nicely as I slaughter you?

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:23.820
I can't win...

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:25.560
I know it won't amount to much,

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:28.630
but all I can do is buy time for
the Class S heroes to get here.

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:31.330
But look at this monster...

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.870
Who am I kidding?

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.800
I can't buy time just by
talking to him.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:39.840
I pissed my pants...

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:41.910
I'm pathetic.

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:44.880
I'll fight with you!

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:46.310
Heroes?

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:47.880
There are others in here too?

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:51.550
I may be the lowest ranking at 38,

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.220
but I'm still a Class A hero.

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:55.320
We can do this.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:57.730
I-I'm a hero too!

00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:59.390
Allback-man is here!

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:00.730
Heroes?

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.460
The heroes are here?

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:03.530
Heroes!

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.600
They'll save us!

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:07.540
I feel better with a Class A around.

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:08.870
Yeah...

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.870
Two Class C's,
one Class B and one Class A...

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:14.610
We can do it!

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.680
We can win!

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.750
You sure this is the way?

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:24.450
Yes, since residents
are fleeing from this direction,

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:25.890
we'll find monsters further up.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.660
Did you see a butt naked guy
run past?

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:31.730
What?

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:33.930
Maybe he was taking a bath
and was left behind.

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:35.700
I'll check it out.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.300
Go on without me.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.600
Got it!

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:41.600
Mumen Rider here.

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:44.410
Yes, we're on our way.

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:46.640
What! The shelter?

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:49.240
It was the other way!

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:01.320
All right. When I give the signal,
charge him.

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:05.660
One...

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:08.330
Two...

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.300
That's weird.
I know I saw him...

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.680
Why so quiet all of a sudden?

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.920
Are you one of the Seafolk?

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:36.490
Mumen Rider went in?

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:38.560
Yes. I couldn't stop—

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:39.790
Mumen Rider?!

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:40.930
What's your location?

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:43.030
This is beyond you.

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:45.530
The monster even took out
a Class S hero!

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:48.940
We need to assemble
a subjugation squad.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.040
A Class S hero was defeated?

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:52.710
Who is this?

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:54.380
Where's Mumen Rider?

00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:58.610
Stand-up Peddling Mode!

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:00.950
Roar, Justice!

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.050
Is this the Hero Association?

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:06.420
Yes. Who are you?

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:09.320
Give me the owner of
that cell phone right now!

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.430
This is the hero Saitama.

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:13.560
Saitama?

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:51.460
NEXT EPISODE:
UNYIELDING JUSTICE

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:53.830
Hey, how'd you like
my Gigantic Drill Stinger?

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:56.800
By the way, I nailed ten
of those Seafolk things!

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:57.930
You're pretty upbeat.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.500
Oh, Lightning Max?

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:01.640
I won't ask how many
Seafolk you defeated,

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:02.940
but I'm sure you did great.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.840
Next time on One-Punch Man:
Episode 9,

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:05.940
"Unyielding Justice."

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:07.540
I'm not sure who'll mete it out,

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:09.810
but make sure our sacrifices
weren't in vain!
