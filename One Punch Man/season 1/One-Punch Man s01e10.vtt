WEBVTT

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.450
Long have I awaited this moment,
human filth.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.020
With the Subterranean
and Deep Sea kings gone...

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.430
...the Terror Lizard Clan can
at last reclaim rule of the Earth!

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.770
Now leading target towards point Bravo.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.370
Roger.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.580
We are inbound and on schedule.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.310
We'll be on top of Bravo shortly.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.740
UNPARALLELED PERIL

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.430
And who are you?

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.240
Hello? What is it?

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.310
What do you mean, come back?!

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.540
You're the one who said
some weirdo monster was waking up...

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.810
...and flew me out here!

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.580
Weirdo...?

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.510
That's right.
I was just about to start.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.250
Listen well!
I am the Ancient King.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.780
-As ruler of the dinosaurs
-"Trouble?" So what?

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.450
-...who once ruled this planet...
-It's not my problem.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.820
-...I stand above all other lifeforms.
-Hey, shut it!

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.260
Can't you see I'm on the phone here?!

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.190
I'm so tired of this.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.430
Who's he think he is,
ordering people about?

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.500
Are you done?

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.770
What's with the chin?
Trying to be scary?

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.870
Should I be intimidated?

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.910
Act brave while you still can, little runt.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.310
Runt?! How dare you!

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.950
So you aren't helpless!

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.590
But if you intend to destroy me,
a giant meteor is about the only way.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.990
Fine. I'll do that then.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.500
Don't make me laugh.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.440
How about another
300,000,000 year nap?

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.920
Fist of Flowing Water, Crushed Rock.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.830
It goes something like that.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.840
Want to try?

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.910
You both look like quick learners.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.840
I bet you'll get the hang of it in no time.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.680
This is the cool thing you said
you wanted to show us?

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:44.950
A sales pitch?

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.580
I'll pass. You do it, Genos.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.550
No, I will pass too.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.720
What I seek is not
the art of self-defense...

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.520
...but absolute destructive power.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.930
You punks!
You dare mock our fighting style?!

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.390
I, Charanko, the top disciple,
challenge you--

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.630
I give up!

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.770
Is he really your best?

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.770
Yeah....

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.570
I heard your dojo was
full of skilled fighters.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.380
Well, one of my disciples went wild.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.310
He beat my most skilled students...

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.650
...so badly they're all out of commission.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.780
The rest got scared and quit.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.690
He's that strong? What's his name?

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.390
Garo....

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.330
He was my top disciple at the time...

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.030
...but I gave him a good beating
and expelled him.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.970
You must pack a punch, old man.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.400
Hey! This is the famed hero "Silverfang"!

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.100
Class S hero, rank 3.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.570
He toys with opponents
as he flows like water...

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.680
...then delivers a blow like
a raging river smashing huge rocks!

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.380
A master of martial arts!

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.480
You only became a hero recently, right?

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.090
You'll regret taking Master Bang lightly!

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.490
Enough, Charanko! Do not disgrace us.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.960
Saitama is many times stronger than me.

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.700
Master, you can't be serious....

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.000
Mr. Silverfang!

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.600
The Association sent me.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.700
An emergency summons has been
issued to all Class S heroes!

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.870
Please come to Association Headquarters.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.610
Is that you, Mr. Genos?

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.380
Since all Class S heroes have
been summoned, please come too.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.820
Is it threat level Dragon?

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.650
Here we go....

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.450
Charanko, look after the dojo.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:32.620
Be careful, master!

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.760
If Class S is being summoned,
they may need your help too, master.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.630
Will you come?

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.630
I will, since I got nothing to do.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.030
HERO ASSOCIATION HQ

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.410
Oh, Silverfang!

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.410
It's been a while, Atomic Samurai.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.750
I knew you'd come.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.120
And this is the cyborg Genos and....

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:02.420
Who's this?

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.050
This is the Class B hero Saitama.

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.420
His exceptional talent will one day
place him atop Class S, I'm sure...

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.160
...so we asked him to come.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.160
Hi, middle-aged hero dude!

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:14.000
Put it there!

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.100
No handshakes.
I acknowledge only the strong.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:22.500
Once you've climbed up to Class S,
I'll greet you properly.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.910
Besides, I'm not middle-aged yet.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.710
I'm only 37.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.110
<i>Thirty-seven isn't middle-aged?</i>
<i>I had no idea.</i>

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.880
Hey, who brought
a Class B nobody along?

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.690
Don't you think it's beneath us?

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.060
And even if you were invited,
a polite person would decline. The nerve!

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.090
I bet you're only here
for some creepy reason...

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:44.730
...like getting close to us Class S heroes.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.000
You disgust me. Leave.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:51.630
What's with this sassy.... lost child?

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:54.540
That is Tornado. Class S, rank 2.

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.840
-"That"? I am not an object!
-She defeats monsters...

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.170
...with her psychic powers.

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:00.580
-She is an ESPer.
-Oh, yeah...?

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:02.680
It appears everyone is here.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.150
We should join them.

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:06.480
Hey....

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:07.750
Stop ignoring me!

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:21.060
CLASS S RANK 17
PURI-PURI PRISONER

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.770
<i>Maybe this will be my chance</i>
<i>to get closer to Genos.</i>

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:25.970
CLASS S RANK 16 GENOS

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.240
<i>It must be serious.</i>
<i>Almost everyone is here.</i>

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:29.840
CLASS S RANK 15 METAL BAT

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:31.840
Demon or Dragon, bring it on!

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:33.680
CLASS S RANK 14 TANK-TOP MASTER

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:35.840
<i>Saitama? The name rings a bell....</i>

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:38.250
CLASS S RANK 13 FLASHY FLASH

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:40.080
CLASS S RANK 12 WATCHDOG MAN

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.050
<i>Somebody farted.</i>

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.520
CLASS S RANK 11
SUPERALLOY BLACKLUSTER

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:46.050
<i>They're all checking out my guns.</i>
<i>Hell yeah!</i>

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.060
CLASS S RANK 10 PIG GOD

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.090
CLASS S RANK 9 DRIVE KNIGHT

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.660
CLASS S RANK 8 ZOMBIEMAN

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:58.070
<i>No one looks particularly enthusiastic.</i>
<i>And does that pig ever stop eating?</i>

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:01.640
CLASS S RANK 7 KING

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.670
CLASS S RANK 6
METAL KNIGHT (ABSENT)

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.140
CLASS S RANK 5
CHILD EMPEROR

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:10.010
<i>Rank 1 is a no show again?</i>
<i>I was hoping to see him.</i>

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:11.810
CLASS S RANK 4 ATOMIC SAMURAI

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:15.550
<i>Is Silverfang going to take</i>
<i>those youngsters on as students?</i>

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:16.950
CLASS S RANK 3 SILVERFANG

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:19.820
So why are we all here?

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:21.590
CLASS S RANK 2
TERRIBLE TORNADO

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.130
Who knows? I had to drop everything
and then was kept waiting for two hours.

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:28.130
CLASS S RANK 1
BLAST (ABSENT)

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.830
CLASS B RANK 63 SAITAMA

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.930
Can I have some tea?

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.010
My apologies for being late.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.580
We do not know the whereabouts
of Metal Knight or Blast...

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.240
...nor can we reach them.

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:46.210
No sense waiting any longer,
so let's begin this emergency meeting.

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:48.080
You can call me Sitch.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:51.790
I'm with the Association.
I will be briefing you.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:54.120
Let's get right down to brass tacks.

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:57.960
You heroes are here because
you're the best of the best.

00:09:58.090 --> 00:09:59.130
And now....

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.260
We're asking you to save the Earth!

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:09.370
However, even with your Class S skills,
there is no guarantee of survival.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.970
Walking away also takes courage.

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.680
Should you choose to do so now,
you will retain Class S status.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:21.150
But those who stay and hear me out
will not be allowed to walk away.

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:25.220
You will be confined here
until the incident is over...

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:27.120
...in order to avoid a general panic.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:31.130
Are you all willing to hear this?

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:33.090
Whatever's going on...

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:37.100
...it better be worth calling
all of us here.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.940
I skipped out on my little sister's
piano recital for this.

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.300
If it's a load of crap...

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.970
...I'm gonna tear
this whole building apart.

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:48.780
Like you could do that
with that skinny stick.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:52.010
Yeah? How about I bust
your head open instead?

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.220
If you think you can,
go on and try, pillbug head!

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:58.020
Hurry up and get on with it.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:01.020
Otherwise Mr. Pompadour here
is going to die.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.830
Hey, bobby pin,
you siding with the girls?

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.360
The great seer, Madame Shibabawa,
is dead!

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.000
Shibabawa? Was she killed?

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:13.300
No.

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.870
While looking into the future
for the next six months...

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.340
...she became agitated and
had a coughing fit.

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:21.080
She popped a cough drop
in her mouth...

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:23.380
...and ended up choking on it.

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.110
I get it!

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:27.280
So we have to figure out
how to prevent disasters...

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.150
...without the help of predictions.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:31.750
That's the focus of this meeting.

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:35.960
No. Madame Shibabawa
had only been able to predict...

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:37.360
...a handful of disasters.

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:38.830
Excuse me!

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:40.700
Hey, you there.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.330
Who's this Shibabawa? A hero?

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:46.270
You don't know?

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:48.900
<i>She's a seer. A great one at that.</i>

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:52.110
<i>She correctly predicted earthquakes</i>
<i>and monster attacks.</i>

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:56.840
We've gotten through many crises
without Madame Shibabawa's predictions.

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.480
But even so,
we provided a bodyguard...

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:01.450
...and gave her special treatment.

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:06.250
Yes, because her few predictions
were 100 percent accurate.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:08.890
The crux of the problem, though...

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:12.460
...is her last, greatest prophecy.

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.800
Even as she choked on
that final cough drop...

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:17.400
...she managed to leave this note.

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:23.400
It is a prophecy that will absolutely
come to pass. Here it is!

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:25.970
Can you read it?

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:27.380
-"The earth...
-"The earth...

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:28.940
-...is in trouble?!"
-...is in trouble?!"

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.410
THE EARTH IS IN TROUBLE

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:34.280
What? That's so dumb.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.480
Can I go? I have to cram for school.

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:40.090
I know you are a prodigy, Child Emperor...

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:44.890
...but if you cannot grasp the danger,
it reveals how immature you still are.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:46.190
What'd you say?!

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.760
Listen up!

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:52.300
Madame Shibabawa's predictions
are 100 percent accurate!

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:56.340
<i>She has predicted many catastrophes</i>
<i>in the past.</i>

00:12:56.470 --> 00:13:01.040
<i>A few of them resulted in</i>
<i>the loss of countless lives.</i>

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:06.980
But not once did Madame Shibabawa
use the word "trouble."

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.150
Something more dangerous
than a Dragon-level catastrophe...

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.520
...or monster is on its way.

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:13.920
And it will occur...

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.190
...in the next six months!

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:24.030
Okay, but we have no idea
when in the next six months.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.530
Yeah, hard to plan for that.

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:28.570
You are correct.

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:33.210
But I want you all to be ready
for a fight in the next six months.

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:38.010
In the next six months means
it could be tomorrow, or even today.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.820
That's true. Who are you, anyway?

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:45.090
Good thing I'm here.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.160
The building is under attack!

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:50.990
That's impossible!

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:53.030
This is the Hero Association HQ!

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:06.040
A formidable fortress, to be sure!

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:08.540
Time to attack.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.380
Hawk, Eagle, Falcon, Kite!

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:16.180
Wipe out these so-called heroes
and the land will belong to us!

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.190
We will dive straight in!

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.090
Follow me, the Sky King!

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:23.960
Father! Above us....

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:26.630
Escape....

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:32.600
Me, the Sky King,
killed like some worthless insect.

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:34.270
Who could have--?

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:38.010
What was that?

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:40.410
-Who knows?
-It flew, so we killed it.

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:41.940
That is good.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.380
Duty, to protect ship.

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:59.590
<i>Emergency power activated.</i>

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.660
What was that?

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.100
What's going on out there?

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:05.230
I don't know.

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.970
All communications have been cut off.

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:09.240
Damn it....

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:13.110
Impossible!

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:21.180
Dad!

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.520
We're okay now. Grab on to me.

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:25.020
That's the way.

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:27.220
Good job.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.270
What is this?

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:46.070
There are survivors?

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:49.180
-Ship failed to kill all.
-Then we kill.

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:50.650
That is good.

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.150
Get away now!

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:07.730
You think I don't sense
your thirst for blood?

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.400
I accompanied Master Atomic...

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:13.270
...and was waiting for
the Class S meeting to end...

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.640
...only to meet thunder and destruction.

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:18.170
Is this your doing?!

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:22.610
Destruction levels at 99.8 percent?

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:26.610
City A was destroyed in an instant!

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:31.220
Who could have known her prediction
would come true this soon?!

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:34.020
Hey! Why was this building spared?

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:37.120
We assigned Metal Knight
to construct this building.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.230
That's why it's stronger
than the average shelter.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.630
So that's why there are no windows.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:47.670
We should go outside and see.
To be sure it's the prophecy.

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:49.770
Master! Will you--?

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:54.380
Master....

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:59.410
That's big! Are they aliens?

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:13.360
So that's what blew the city to pieces.

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:19.800
Go back to...

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:21.570
...your planet!

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.380
A militant creature.

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:31.410
Also cautious.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:33.610
Hurry. Let us hurry and kill.

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:35.350
That is good.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.220
Can it be killed?

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:44.760
Each of its strikes is lethal!

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:47.330
I can't beat this thing....

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.830
Such a weak species.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.730
Easily killed.

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:53.100
That is good.

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:54.570
It's splitting?

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.700
Damn, not now....

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.070
I will dispose of this.
You handle the rest.

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:01.280
Very well.

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:04.080
I will go kill those that ran.

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:06.250
That is good. I--

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:10.380
Master!

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:13.290
Iairon, you okay?

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:15.690
You know, your left arm....

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:19.090
Master! Swords have no effect
on this monster.

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:20.800
Forget me! Retreat!

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.330
Out of my way!

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:32.410
Iai! The path of the sword does
not end for you yet!

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:33.640
Stop bleeding!

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.440
Yes, master!

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:48.160
So there is a life-form on this planet
that can fight.

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:49.390
Excellent!

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.160
Try to withstand our invasion!

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:56.200
Planet? You from outer space?

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.230
And you got friends up in that floaty toy?

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.140
Yeah, that's it.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:06.570
I doubt you alone have the power
to do all this to the city.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.580
Atomic Samurai, count us in.

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:12.180
You the bastard that smashed this town?!

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:14.820
And if I am?

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:17.280
For all the beautiful men you killed....

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:18.590
I claim vengeance!

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:25.530
<i>Each separate attack must</i>
<i>be delivered with the intent...</i>

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.290
<i>...to kill!</i>

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:30.330
Dark Angel Flash!

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:39.170
Issue an evacuation warning to City A
and all neighboring cities.

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:40.440
Right now!

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:44.880
And expand the System M vitals monitor
to cover all of City A.

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:47.580
We need an accurate count
of the survivors.

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:48.820
What's the threat level?

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:50.480
"Dragon," without doubt.

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:53.520
No....

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:56.560
This might be "God."

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:02.400
Four Class S heroes can take care
of the enemy on the ground....

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.330
The problem is that...

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:05.900
...we can't reach it.

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:09.270
Any aircraft would be
shot down in seconds.

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:12.870
King, you're one of
the top fighters in Class S.

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:14.680
Give us your take.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.210
<i>King, Class S rank 7.</i>

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:20.310
<i>Said to be the strongest man on Earth...</i>

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:23.280
<i>...and I see he is well respected</i>
<i>by the other heroes....</i>

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:26.690
There's nothing I can do.

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:31.690
It's too high in the sky.
There's no way to attack it.

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:35.730
But the mysterious craft
is currently dormant.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.500
We should use this opportunity
to call in Metal Knight.

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:40.800
What the--?! That's pathetic!

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:42.940
Aren't you supposed
to be the strongest man?

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:44.840
Hey, Tornado.

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:47.310
-This city's been blown away...
-If you piss King off, he'll kill you.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.240
...and you're just going
to give them a free pass?

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:50.680
Unbelievable!

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:55.780
Well, forget it!
I'll take care of this myself.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.720
Wait, I will go too.

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:02.820
I do not know how effective I can be,
but I will attack from the ground.

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:05.590
Maybe you didn't hear me.

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:07.030
I said forget about it!

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:10.530
Take it easy, Genos.

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:13.600
I understand how you feel,
but if you piss her off, she'll kill you.

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:15.540
<i>Very well....</i>

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:17.940
<i>There is no need to team up anyway.</i>

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:22.480
<i>Master has already boarded</i>
<i>the enemy ship.</i>

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:24.680
<i>Whether this is the prophecy or not...</i>

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:27.410
<i>...there's not a single evil</i>
<i>master cannot defeat.</i>

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:30.680
<i>If such an evil existed...</i>

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.890
<i>...then I assume the human race</i>
<i>would have perished long ago.</i>

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.560
Well done making it this far, intruder!

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.660
But this is the end.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:47.640
You see, there is no way
you can defeat me, Groribas!

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:51.070
My Acid Breath will melt you away!

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:07.790
<i>Isn't it about time the boss showed up?</i>

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.360
<i>Well, if he's alive....</i>

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.830
THE DOMINATOR OF THE UNIVERSE

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.630
<i>I, Groribas, control this preview!</i>

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:56.760
<i>I perfected some new moves.</i>
<i>Now I have like 20!</i>

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:58.870
<i>But I couldn't show them off...</i>

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.440
<i>...because, you know,</i>
<i>they killed me off first!</i>

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.710
<i>Next time on </i>One Punch Man:

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.440
<i>Episode 11,</i>
<i>"The Dominator of the Universe."</i>

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:10.440
<i>It's your fight now, Lord Boros!</i>
