WEBVTT

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.540
It's been five days since I debuted
as a professional hero.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.670
There haven't been
any serious incidents so far.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.440
However, for some reason Genos
is staying at my house.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.650
What are you writing over there?

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.720
I'm recording the details of
your lessons and training regimen.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.090
Crap. He's raising the bar again.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.420
I can't think of a single thing
I can teach the guy.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.230
I feel bad, like I'm scamming him
or something.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.100
Come on, think. Or just make up
some techniques or a spiritual theory.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.100
Strength training is all I've got!

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.570
I know Genos won't be satisfied
with that, plus the dude's a cyborg!

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.440
By the way, at the seminar
they said if you're a Class C hero

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.040
and you have no hero activity
for a week,

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.540
your name will be removed
from the Hero Registry.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.510
Will you be all right, Master?

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.150
They said that?!

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.220
Yes.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.390
But I was watching TV and
there wasn't anything going on.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.520
The news only reports
major incidents,

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.820
like natural disasters, terrorism
and dangerous monsters.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.160
You always fight
the most powerful enemies,

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.360
so you probably do not know it,

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.530
but Class C heroes primarily
take care of purse snatchers,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.770
robberies and random attacks.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.570
With Class C so full of heroes,

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.370
to survive they must actively
look for cases to resolve.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.810
I hear many of them get discouraged
and change careers.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.110
Like a salesman doing cold calls,

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.150
nothing will come your way
without legwork.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.420
This is no time to be reading manga!

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.750
-So we're going?
-You stay here!

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.220
If I'm with a Class S hero,

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.190
a Class C like me
won't get any credit!

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.590
But as your disciple—

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.130
Genos, from the beginning
my intense desire to be a hero

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.400
was what drove me
to strength training.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.630
That's how I made it this far.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.340
For you, perhaps things will change
if you aim higher as a hero.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.110
Frankly speaking, you're a cyborg,
so training your body won't do.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.110
Instead, a change in mindset
may lead you to greater strength.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.250
Damn, I'm just making
all this crap up.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.760
So in other words,

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.520
HOW I DEVELOPED INDOMITABLE WILL
BY S CLASS HERO KING

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.130
it's not about having
raw power or technique.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.330
It's about training your mind.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.670
To do that, you must first fight your way
through the professional hero industry.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.200
Aim to break into the top ten
of the Class S heroes.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.900
That will be your goal for now.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.680
I understand. I will try!

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.580
He bought it. Sweet.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.920
After that, I sped around town

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.520
while frantically looking
for bad guys.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.790
I ran.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.230
And ran.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:45.490
And ran.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.360
But!

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.700
The city was quiet!

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.570
I give up.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.170
Just one more day left.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.440
Guess I'll head home.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.180
I'll leave tomorrow's problems
to tomorrow's me.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.510
THE FOLLOWING DAY

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.550
It's quiet today too!

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.650
There's nothing to do!

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.920
I'm gonna lose my registration!

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.860
Hey! You're that guy.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:00.660
What was it?

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.060
Seed-on-the-Ground?

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.530
No wait, Lost-and-found?

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.800
Jack-o'-lantern Panic!

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.400
It's Speed-o'-Sound Sonic.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.570
I've finally found you, Saitama.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.710
Today is the day we—

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.080
Sorry, I'm busy. See you around.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.720
You think...

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.350
...you can run from me?!

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.990
What the—?
I didn't see what happened.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.100
His face should have been
sliced open, but the blade...

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.730
I told you. I'm busy.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.700
Plus I'm pissed,
so anyone in my way...

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.110
...gets punched.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.680
That's him!

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.080
He's very, very dangerous.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.680
Please stop him.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.380
So you're the offender?!

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.650
Well, the hero Tank-Top Tiger
is here now!

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:00.860
Hero?

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.630
Sonic, they think you're
some sort of criminal.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.430
Maybe getting tossed in a cell
will cool off your hot—

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.470
She means you, cue ball.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.000
He's been running around town

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.510
with this scary look on his face
since yesterday!

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.110
But I'm a hero too!

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.140
I've never heard of a hero like you.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.080
So what? I just started!

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.620
In any case, you're causing
problems for everyone.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.490
If you're really a hero, then don't
go around frightening people.

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.120
You're hurting
all the other heroes reputations.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.690
Hey, isn't that Tank-Top Tiger?

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.860
Oh yeah, it is Tank-Top Tiger.

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.460
-No way!
-Awesome, he's the real deal!

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.610
Even Class C heroes get recognized
if they're in the top 10.

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.810
So how about it, new guy?

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.810
Wanna go a little wild here
and make me look good?

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.510
Exploding Shuriken.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.450
EXPLODING SHURIKEN

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.090
Tank-Top Tiger?!

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.560
Is this really happening?

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.990
What are you doing, Sonic?

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.030
He was interfering,
so I put him to sleep.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.800
Hey, call a hero!

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.800
-A hero!
-Run!

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.040
Saitama...

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:26.680
So you too have become one of
these worthless heroes?

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.210
Then all I have to do
is create a situation

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.620
where you have no choice
but to fight me, Saitama the hero!

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:37.820
Hail of Carnage!

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.560
Hey! Cut it out!

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.570
Saitama, come stop me!

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.040
You're a hero!

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.570
I'll kill them all!

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:03.510
Damn it.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.180
Can't everyone
just let me do my job?

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.080
I don't have time for this!

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.590
I gotta find a bad guy to take down.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:17.760
A bad guy?

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.000
If you're not coming, I'll go to you!

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:22.700
I'm right here.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.810
I wonder if this will count as work?

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:40.150
The man apprehended in City Z
by the Class C hero

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:43.180
is suspected of being involved in
several heinous crimes,

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:44.720
including assassination.

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:47.620
City Z...

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.790
What's the status of
the investigation I requested?

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.530
-The one for the ghost town?
-Yes.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:56.770
Let's see...

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.170
We've submitted an official request.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.110
Well now,
doesn't that sound interesting.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.810
Want me to go?

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:08.540
Tornado?

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.880
Where'd you come from?

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.750
-Why? Aren't I allowed in here?
-Of course.

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:16.220
But for City Z,
the investigation is just a formality.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.290
What?

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.560
You think I'm not good enough?

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.990
Not at all.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.100
The Association decided that
this was not a Class S matter.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.170
Yes, exactly right.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.570
You'd better tell me if you find
anything that looks like it can fight.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.180
It'd be so much faster
if I just went myself.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.680
You're such an idiot.

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.730
CITY A –
HERO ASSOCIATION HQ

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.600
Reports have come in from
each location being investigated.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.340
First is Watchdog Man,
Class S hero, investigating City Q.

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:16.610
"Nothing unusual."

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:17.850
Nothing unusual?

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:19.910
-That's right.
-That's hard to believe.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:22.720
We all know City Q is a hot zone

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:26.390
with more casualties and monsters
than any other area.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:29.290
Knowing him,
I'm sure he's implying that,

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:33.060
"Whatever occurs,
I'll be able to take care of it."

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.730
Though he has focused
his efforts on City Q,

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:40.000
his track record at
monster elimination is top-notch.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.640
Class S heroes don't
pay much attention to details.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.270
They're not cut out
for writing reports.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.140
Next, City W.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:50.010
Class A hero Heavy Kong reports:
"Nothing unusual."

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:54.350
For City H, reports from Mushroom,
Class B, and Horsebone, Class C:

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.420
"Nothing unusual."

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:58.050
For City D, Lightning Genji,
Class A:

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.920
"Slow restoration after
the devastation caused by"

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.660
"the gigantic creature aside,
nothing unusual."

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:07.160
Cities B and D
both sustained extensive damage.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.430
The Association took
a lot of heat for that.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:12.200
In order to prevent
more such disasters,

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:16.770
we must detect any covert activity
that could threaten the community.

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:20.980
Well, this investigation was
requested for that express purpose.

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:24.110
But early detection of monsters
is proving difficult.

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:27.850
City F, Class A hero,
"Snakebite" Snek.

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.750
"Hammerhead, former leader
of the Paradiser terrorist group,"

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.260
"has been spotted
in a suit and tie."

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:36.120
"Further investigation
is being conducted."

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:37.460
No other reports.

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:39.260
What of City Z?

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.760
I hear rumblings of
a potential disaster brewing

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:44.300
in the abandoned area there.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:46.000
No reports available.

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:50.200
However, two highly capable
Class A heroes

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:53.310
have been sent to the area
to investigate.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.950
Here we are in City Z.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.420
CLASS A, RANK 33 –
SPRING MUSTACHIO

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.820
Shall we begin our little inquiry?

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:04.150
CLASS A, RANK 29 –
GOLDEN BALL

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:05.490
Yeah, let's get on with it.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:14.460
City Z is quite expansive,
but further ahead lies

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:17.500
the uninhabited area
we were told about.

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:19.100
Compared with other areas,

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:20.170
BEWARE OF MONSTERS!!

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:23.370
City Z has an abnormally high rate
of monster-related incidents.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:27.810
The frequency has been gradually
increasing over the past 10 years,

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:29.940
while the last few have seen
more and more

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:31.410
highly advanced monsters appearing.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:35.020
The residents have entirely fled
for the city center.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.380
I know all that.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.290
The place is a real ghost town,

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:41.260
just with the water and electricity
still intact, yeah?

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:43.790
On the lookout for a cheap house?

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:45.030
Come off it.

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:48.200
People say something
real nasty's living around here.

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:50.000
Even you must have heard.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:51.470
But of course.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:55.870
I assume that's why we have been
assigned this investigation.

00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:00.880
Once we hit the abandoned area,
we better be ready to fight.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:04.450
Indeed,
we mustn't let our guard down.

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.780
But why here?
Why the increase in monsters here?

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:11.850
That's the mystery.

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:15.790
Many theories have been advanced,
but my own is this:

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.430
A colony of monsters here is
naturally producing more of them.

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:22.430
Or perhaps a queen exists,
birthing more of her kind.

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.940
Of course I have no proof yet,

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.940
but there is something
to this ghost town.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.010
Or rather, something in it.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.010
Of that you can be sure.

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:40.920
The proximity alarm?

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.080
If we can hunt down
this mysterious being,

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:45.590
we'll go straight to
the top of the rankings.

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:47.060
That's true.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:49.920
We can't let Mr. Amai Mask
remain first for—

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:51.230
-Something's there!
-Something's there!

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:52.860
Was that a monster?

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.360
No way to be sure.

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:58.300
But it's hard to imagine a human
still living in these conditions.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.200
Let's pursue it!

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:05.870
Seems they are not after us.

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:10.550
Can this be the place
I heard about?

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.610
Sure doesn't seem like it.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:18.320
Oh, man, I came all this way.
Isn't anyone around?

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:24.190
A monster.
It popped up out of nowhere.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:26.960
Golden Ball, are you ready?

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.100
Hell yes.

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.000
Victory to the swift!

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.470
Hey, people!

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:34.340
I can blast through
a 20mm steel plate

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.970
with one of my shape-memory
golden bullets!

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:38.270
Eat this!

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:48.280
He flicked it away like nothing.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:02.300
Golden Ball!

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.170
Tomboy...

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:48.610
...thrust!

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.950
It slipped past my Tomboy?

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:02.490
Not bad.

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:04.560
Those tentacles...

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.130
From the way they react,
they're tough as steel.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:10.230
A monster that can use
its infinite number of tentacles

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:11.630
like steel whips...

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:14.070
Such power!

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.640
I must call in reinforcements
from the Association.

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:26.650
May I ask if you were born
in this neighborhood?

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.220
No, I'm from out of town.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:34.560
I heard a bunch of crazy strong monsters
were all getting together here.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:38.760
Looks like it was
just a rumor though.

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:40.390
But now,

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:47.770
I feel like it'd be kinda fun to
stick around and make the rumor true.

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:50.370
"The Ghost Town Monster."

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.540
It's got a nice ring to it!

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.780
We have a backup request from
the heroes dispatched to City Z.

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:01.320
Class A rank 29, Golden Ball,
has been knocked out.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:04.120
Class A rank 33,
Spring Mustachio, is in trouble.

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:05.620
They're in the abandoned city.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:08.560
Call in all nearby heroes
for immediate assistance!

00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:10.160
Class A and above!

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.190
See the monster alert for City Z?

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.630
The threat level seems to be
Tiger or higher.

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:17.700
Is it the ghost town monster?

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:19.670
They're not sure yet.

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:21.270
I'll go.

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.710
I want to catch the tiger
by its tail.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.720
Now I see.

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:42.160
If it means running into monsters
like this all the time,

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.290
I wouldn't want to
live here either.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.370
Man, boring. This is boring me!

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:56.270
I finally kick a hero's butt
and I don't get even a single scream.

00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:00.510
Now that I think about it,
even if I start living here,

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:02.810
I'll never be famous
if there are no people.

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:07.850
Guess I'll keep going.
Gotta find where they live.

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.120
There's somebody.

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:13.320
Another hero?

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:15.520
Or a regular guy?

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.160
I thought all the humans
cleared out.

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:20.800
If all those monsters
were really around,

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:22.830
there's no way he could live here.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.370
I guess that means
it was just a rumor.

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:30.170
Shoot...

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:33.470
I forgot to buy konbu soup stock.

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:41.380
Master, I saw a lot of konbu
right outside the door.

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:43.520
Oh yeah, I just--

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:48.860
Just happened to get it for cheap.

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:55.500
Yes, people say that konbu
is good for hair growth,

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:57.430
but since there is
no real scientific proof,

00:18:57.530 --> 00:18:59.770
its real effects
are yet to be confirmed.

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:02.640
I did some research,
so I am sure, Master.

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:05.470
For example,
according to this site--

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:07.170
No one said anything about hair!

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:09.380
City Z Investigative Report.

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:13.450
"Nothing noteworthy about
the downtown or residential areas."

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:15.250
"During our investigation,"

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.690
"we encountered a ferocious monster
in the abandoned area,"

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:20.350
"but were unable to
exterminate it."

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:22.290
"We escaped death,"

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:24.390
"but the monster
we encountered disappeared"

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.160
"and it is possible that
it still roams the area."

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:30.670
"Also, according to this monster,
there's a rumor"

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:34.570
"that powerful monsters
already exist in this area."

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:38.410
Sounds like it was pretty brutal.

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:40.170
A monster?

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.380
Yes.

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.580
I think I'll pass this time.

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:49.280
See? I told you I should have gone!

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:50.350
But...

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:52.490
faced with this,

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:56.490
I'm sure even you would
have had a tough time.

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.760
I would have been fine, idiot!

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:08.800
The rumor has not been confirmed,
but the reinforcements saw signs

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:12.310
that point to the existence
of some horrible monstrosity.

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:14.780
Holy crap, what is this?

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.410
What kind of monster could
cause such violence?

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:20.580
I'd hate to face off
against this thing.

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.220
Hey, what's this?

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:27.290
Is it a part of the monster
Spring Mustachio fought?

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:29.320
There may have been
a territorial dispute

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:30.460
between the monsters.

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:34.460
Seems like there's definitely
"something" here.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:40.000
We must continue our investigation
and maintain vigilance over City Z.

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:43.740
Hey, did you hear?

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:46.840
There are monsters living
in the City Z ghost town.

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:51.380
Yeah, rumor has it the toughest ones
are secretly plotting something.

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:55.950
No, no. Not that rumor.
It's about a more dangerous monster.

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:57.350
What's that?

00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:58.420
You didn't hear?

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:00.620
I hear the place
has now become terrifying

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:02.860
for both humans and monsters.

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:08.530
THE TERRIFYING CITY

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:42.920
Master, I filled in the holes
in front of the house.

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.660
Oh, thanks!

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:45.890
Also,

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.900
MYSTERY MONSTER DEFEATS
CLASS A HEROES

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.860
your rank has gone up
from last place, 388th, to 342nd.

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:53.830
Oh? Because of that Panic guy?

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:55.440
He boosted my ranking.

00:22:57.570 --> 00:22:59.040
So it's been a week now.

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:00.710
Have you done anything?

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:02.880
No, not yet.

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:04.510
I guess it's only been a week.

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:08.650
I'm still ranked last in Class S
for ability, in 17th place.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:12.150
Sounds like you've still got
a lot of training to do, Genos.

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:17.790
But in the public polls,
for popularity I rank number six.

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:19.760
Why?!

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:23.460
"A genius who, at the tender age
of 19, made his debut in Class S."

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.600
"He'll do great."

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:25.800
"He's so handsome."

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:28.870
"Love how he refuses to do
media interviews. Very cool."

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.170
Those kinds of comments.

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:33.710
You're not embarrassed
to read those out loud?

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:37.040
These comments are based on
impressions from my photo,

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:39.410
not evaluations of me.

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.650
I think nothing of them.

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:41.880
Oh yeah?

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:42.980
They continue.

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:44.420
"The Cyborg Prince."

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:46.850
"Behind the steely exterior,
I feel his fragile self."

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:48.520
"Among the top five
handsomest heroes."

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:49.660
Enough already!

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:51.960
NEXT EPISODE:
THE SURPREME DISCIPLE

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:55.430
This is Blizzard. Perhaps you know me better
as "Blizzard from Hell?"

00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:59.070
Well, I only had a bit part
this episode.

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:01.470
Next on One-Punch Man
is episode 7,

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:02.770
"The Ultimate Disciple."

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:06.470
The Blizzard Bunch will
finally make its appearance.

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:09.040
Miss Blizzard, we're not scheduled
to go on next week!

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:10.210
That can't be right!
