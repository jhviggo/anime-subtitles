00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.100
What could be the cause of the massive
mosquito outbreak this year?

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.670
We ask Mr. Kafetch,

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.640
a mosquito expert who has written
several books on the subject.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.340
Thank you for having me.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.580
Well, let me come right to the point.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.710
These mosquitos belong
to an entirely new species.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.550
Therefore, I know nothing about them.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.650
Get out!

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.580
Ah, excuse me.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.290
Now, let's take a look at the areas

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.490
– Man, City Z's in their path.
– likely to be hit hardest by the outbreak.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.060
Now we've got a mosquito outbreak?

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.560
We interrupt this program
for breaking news.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.730
A large swarm of mosquitos
has been sighted in City Z.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.400
Mummified remains of attacked
farm animals have also been found.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.610
If you encounter a swarm of mosquitos,
flee immediately.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.860
This is an emergency evacuation warning.
Threat level: Demon.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.840
No resident is to go outside
under any circumstances.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.580
I repeat, no City Z resident
is to go outside…

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.340
Acquiring target.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.620
THE LONE CYBORG

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.350
Thanks to that warning,
they're all empty!

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.580
Like someone's gonna die
from a mosquito bite.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.290
What's losing
a little blood if I get all this?

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.390
The wind…?

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.670
What the—?!

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.940
Come on, you guys.
That wasn't nearly enough.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.910
Go get some more for me!

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.450
Target acquired.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.850
I see.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.020
You make them suck the blood,
then take it all for yourself.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.690
You must be controlling the mosquitos
via some sort of signal.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.900
That would explain
their mysterious behavior.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.430
So if I were to get rid of you,
the leader,

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.840
would the swarm disperse too?

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.780
Our next meal is here.
Go drain him dry.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:20.820
Incinerate.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.590
I am about to eliminate you.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.500
Stay where you are.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.970
You, eliminate me?

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.070
Go on and try!

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.110
Got you.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.560
Damn…mosquitos!!

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:30.590
Incinerate.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.470
Maybe a leg next?

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.510
Wait, where are my legs?

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.920
Impossible.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.460
You cannot escape from me.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.730
What the hell is that guy?

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.900
He's gonna get me
if I don't do something.

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:19.900
The townspeople may
all be hiding,

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.900
but there are plenty
of animals around.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.040
Come here, little ones.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:31.210
Empty all your stored juices into me!

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.750
So many.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:42.690
If she's been collecting blood
from the whole town and beyond,

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.560
then it may not simply be
a food source for her.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.970
I should put an end to this
as soon as possible.

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:51.530
Get back here, dammit!

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.670
You and I aren't done yet!

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.040
What's with this guy?

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:00.910
It's in my mouth!
Pft! Pft! You little—!

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:02.010
Huh?

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:03.550
What's that squirming over there?

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:04.950
It's...mosquitoes?!

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:07.950
You over there.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.150
Evacuate now.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.150
That swarm is conscious.

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.690
If it senses you,
it will immediately attack.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.030
Seriously?

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.490
That's bad. I gotta get—

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:58.100
Since you spoke, I thought you would have
at least human-level intelligence.

00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:59.970
But you were just a bug.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.940
You brought all the mosquitos together
into one, easy-to-burn swarm.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:06.740
When I spotted you,

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:10.750
I confirmed there were
no living beings within 500 meters,

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.620
so I should have been free to fire away.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.250
Wait, that guy might have—

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.890
Man, you saved me.
You're amazing.

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:23.060
What was that just now?
You totally made them bug out!

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:24.230
Ba-dum-dum-tsh.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:30.770
Oh, I was just trying to make a joke
about the mosquitos being bugs, and…

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.770
Idiot!

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.940
I no longer need the tiny ones.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:42.340
I mean,

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:49.680
look…

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:52.590
how strong I've become!!

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:12.970
Can't your punches
kill a little mosquito?

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:18.680
Weakling!

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:20.010
I see.

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:24.350
The more blood she consumes,
the more powerful she becomes.

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:28.160
I think I'll have your head next!

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:32.960
I let my guard down.
There's no chance of winning.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.200
All I can do is self-destruct.

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:40.840
Forgive me, Doctor...

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.780
Mosquitos…suck!

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:56.350
Hold on!

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:00.090
Please tell me your name!

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.190
Oh. It's Saitama.

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:05.730
I'd like to be your disciple.

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:07.860
Oh, okay.

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:12.400
Huh?

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:20.380
Sensei!

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:29.420
You really showed up.

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:31.250
Uh...

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.390
It's "Genos," Saitama-sensei.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.260
Can you not call me sensei?

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.330
Master!

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:38.830
Not Master either!

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:43.030
Go on home after your drink.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.130
I'm not looking for disciples.

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:47.100
Wait—you're back in one piece?

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.000
Yes, my body is mostly mechanical.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:51.870
As long as there are parts,
repairs are quick.

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:53.310
You're an odd one.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:56.340
What kind of parts
do you use, Master?

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:57.450
Don't use any.

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:00.420
Then what about the
skin-colored armor on your head?

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:02.020
Yeah, that's my skin.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.290
But that would mean you're bald
despite being so young.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.860
So I'm bald—what's your problem?!

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.290
Me? You'll listen to my problems?

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.060
No thanks, I'm good.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.030
Actually, four years ago, when I was 15,
I was still a real human being.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.500
Did you hear what I just said?

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:23.840
Although we had to pinch pennies,

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:28.110
my family and I lived
a peaceful and fairly happy life.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:33.820
But one day, a crazy cyborg went out of
control and attacked our town.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:35.780
The insane cyborg...

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:39.990
Most likely, a failed body modification
generated an irregularity in his brain.

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:42.320
He destroyed everything in sight.

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:45.790
Parks, schools, buildings, my house...

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:48.460
He even took my family's lives.

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:52.400
Miraculously I survived,
but being only a weak 15-year-old,

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:55.770
I was alone and at the end of my strength
in a ruined town.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.840
That's when Doctor Kuseno happened
to pass through.

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:01.910
Doctor Kuseno, a scientist for justice,

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:05.550
was on a mission to stop the destruction
caused by the rampaging cyborg.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:10.550
I asked Doctor Kuseno to perform
body modification surgery on me.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.020
That's how I was reborn as a cyborg
who fights for justice.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:18.960
I promised Doctor Kuseno that one day
I would terminate the evil cyborg.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:20.190
I see—

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.230
It's been four years since that day.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:27.270
I'm now 19 and I've been wandering
from town to town eliminating evil.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.300
The number of monsters and criminal
organizations I have destroyed

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:30.840
are too many to count.

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:34.540
But I have been unable to find any clues
about the insane cyborg

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:36.980
and have become increasingly
frustrated and restless.

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:39.150
I find myself chasing a virtual image
of that cyborg

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.250
whenever I square off against
my enemies.

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:44.320
Then last week, when that mosquito
monster appeared,

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:46.320
I let my concentration slip.

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:49.890
I was convinced I could not lose to anything
but the rampaging cyborg,

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:53.490
so I neglected to even analyze the data
on my opponent and rushed to confront her.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.060
The result, as you know,

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:57.500
was that an opponent
with immense strength bested me.

00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:59.870
If you, Master Saitama,
had not been in the area,

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:01.540
I would have undoubtedly
been destroyed.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.270
Master, you saved my life.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.440
My life that was once saved by
Doctor Kuseno

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.910
has now been saved again by you,
Master Saitama.

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.050
I feel the weight of that responsibility.

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:14.920
I must not die before
destroying that cyborg.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:18.490
And to do that, I must continue
fighting evil as a righteous cyborg

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:20.520
until he appears before me one day.

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:22.120
I need to get stronger.

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.490
Last week,
when I saw your punch,

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.130
I knew I had to study under you
as your disciple.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.630
If only I could be
as strong as you, Master Saitama!

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.130
I have an old enemy to defeat,

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.970
and the battle is not for me only.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.440
It's for my hometown,
and for Doctor Kuseno too.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.510
I realize I am still inexperienced.

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:40.610
But right now,
I need enormous power

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.510
so I can eradicate
the greatest of evils!

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:43.580
Doctor Kuseno is—

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:47.420
Enough, you idiot!
Shorten it to 20 words or less!

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:52.050
Mosquito Girl was defeated?

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:54.120
With one punch, you say?

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.930
Well, she was merely
a prototype, after all.

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:03.260
Why is he naked?

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.600
Unknown.

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:06.270
Well, whatever.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.600
He'll make an excellent specimen.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.340
We shall study his physiology—
by force if necessary.

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:15.540
Send a messenger
and invite him here,

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:17.950
to our "House of Evolution."

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:22.420
Master, here's the short version:

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:27.660
Please teach me the way to become
strong like you.

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:31.490
– Genos…
– Yes!

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:33.430
How old are you?

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:34.530
19.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.030
So young…

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.470
I'm sure you'll surpass me in no time.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.100
Do you mean that?

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:44.670
I'm 25 now, but I was 22
when I started training in the summer.

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:47.440
Sure, I'll teach you.

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.510
But it won't be easy.
Can you handle it?

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.320
Yes, sir!!

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:58.990
Object approaching at high speed—
It's here!

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:00.420
What?

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.390
My name is…huh?

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.660
Pay for my ceiling!

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:11.600
So...

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:12.670
Hm?

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:16.240
It seems our advance agent,
Kamakyuri, is down.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.440
I can't sense him
with my telepathy anymore.

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:21.680
What? Wasn't he one of
our stronger guys?

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:24.050
There are two more outside.

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:26.410
Master, leave them to me!

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:30.990
Don't bust people's ceilings!

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:32.420
Oh, never mind.

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:35.590
Can't you guys just
come through the door?

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:41.060
M-Master!

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.630
No, I'm fine.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:46.470
I kinda feel like a…bamboo shoot.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.240
Elevated energy levels detected.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:54.380
A cyborg?

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.640
Could it be...?

00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:00.050
You are not the target.

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:02.050
What's going on? I can't see.

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:03.280
You are in the way!

00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:16.560
I have a few questions for you.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.610
It would appear you're in
what they call a "tight spot."

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:29.080
Well done, Ground Dragon!

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.350
GROUND DRAGON

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:34.150
It complicates things
if they put up a fight.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.480
Master!

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.350
You dare look away?

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:40.120
Quite courageous!

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:01.610
I am the pinnacle of
the House of Evolution's science.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.710
I am Armored Gorilla.

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.550
Your attacks have no effect.

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:08.250
The "House of Evolution"?

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.450
What does it want with my master?

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:12.850
It is none of your business.

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:17.760
And it is our rule that any who
oppose us be eliminated without fail.

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:23.660
I must destroy you.

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:29.600
Hey, jerk-off!

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:31.540
What's with that look?

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.180
Being underground keeps you cool,

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.280
but at the same time,
it’s nice and warm.

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:41.720
I'm sleepy. Could you get lost?

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:47.760
I see I need to
teach you your place.

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.460
Listen up! I'm gonna slice
your eyes out with these!

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:53.330
Then we'll see if you resist!

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:58.270
The Beast King never
lets anyone off easy.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.800
Well, enough fooling around.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:07.170
If you wanna apologize,
now's your chance.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.710
You guys smashed my ceiling!

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:13.580
Humph. Fine.

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.650
Then behold the true power

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.190
– Aw man…
– of the Beast—

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.520
I got dirt in my special place.

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:22.660
Hey, are you listening?

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.190
Let me just shake this out.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.160
You done?

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:29.330
One sec.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:32.800
I'm done.

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:39.170
Okay, then behold the true power
of the Beast King!

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.510
Lion Slash!

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.420
You okay, Frog Man—

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.250
Outta the way, pissants!

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:56.520
Such is the law of the jungle!

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:58.360
And you're next!

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.230
Wait! Don't kill him yet!

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.800
Lion Slash: Meteor Power Shower!!

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:23.680
Consecutive…

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:26.350
Normal Punches.

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:44.940
Oh.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.540
N-No one told me
he'd be like that!

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:51.450
It's best we retreat now and regroup...

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:54.350
Found you!

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:57.280
No waayyy!

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:07.700
Huh?

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:20.440
Answer the question or be eliminated.

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:21.510
Your choice.

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:24.550
It is you who will be eliminated.

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:25.710
You fool.

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:29.850
I am the third most powerful
fighter in the "House of Evolution."

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:31.790
At your power level,

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:35.390
you will never beat the Beast King,
the second most powerful.

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:37.630
You will be destroyed.

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:40.390
Is this who you mean?

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.900
Apparently so.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.340
Look, I'm really sorry.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.670
I'll tell you everything,
just don't kill me!

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:54.640
What the—?
What happened to your robot voice?

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:57.780
Sorry, I was just trying
to sound cool.

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.910
What do you mean?
The hit team wiped out?

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:36.840
– How did this happen?
– Wait, don't jump to conclusions yet.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.480
– It may be a mistake.
– Verify the report immediately!

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:41.180
– Right away.
– Be careful!

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.450
What's all the commotion?

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:52.590
NEXT EPISODE:
THE OBSESSIVE SCIENTIST

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:54.800
Okay, time for Mosquito Girl's
episode preview!

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:58.130
Next week's story will be about
my birthplace.

00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:02.070
I was born—what?!
Time's up already?!

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:03.670
Oh, all right.

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:07.010
The next episode of One-Punch Man
is episode 3, "The Obsessive Scientist."

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:09.840
Scientist, huh? Who could that be?
