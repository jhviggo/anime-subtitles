00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.730
CITY A - HERO ASSOCIATION HQ

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.240
Then it is decided that Mumen Rider
will remain the top-ranked Class C hero.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.380
Understood. I will let him know.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.080
I simply cannot understand why he has
no desire to move up to Class B.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.190
Our next agenda item is
the 55th Hero Certification Exam.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.790
For this exam,
the total number of candidates is....

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.460
11,684, with the exam offered
at six different venues.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.360
That is an increase of more than
22 percent over the previous exam.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.200
We mustn't be happy
with simple quantity.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.300
Even with more candidates...

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.570
...if the quality of the heroes is reduced...

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.540
...the numbers are meaningless.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.450
Therefore, we ought to be even more
critical during evaluations.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.820
Also, I hear that
a certain person of interest...

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.150
...is taking the exam this time.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.160
Yes, it hasn't been confirmed yet...

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.460
...but it seems very likely
that he will.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.760
HERO TEST LOCATION 6

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.240
Candidates, please form
two lines for registration.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.730
Next!
Side-to-side jumps for 30 seconds!

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.330
Ready....

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.900
Go!

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.770
Next, the 1500-meter run. Go!

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.750
Next, weightlifting!

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.620
Next, shot put!

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.520
Vertical jumping!

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.290
Whack-a-Mole!

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.230
Punching machine!

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.740
I'm going home.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.310
THE ULTIMATE MENTOR

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.010
Finally done with all the tests.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.520
Now I just wait for the results.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.790
-Oh, you done too?
-Yes.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.460
Hey, is there a point
in you taking fitness tests?

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.660
I mean, can't you just give them
the data on your specs?

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.540
Well, whatever. So how was it?

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.640
Both the written and fitness tests
were far too simple.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.040
Right? Is that really all there is
to becoming a hero?

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.750
We should get our results soon.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.320
Seventy points is a passing grade.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.690
The written test was so easy
anyone could get full points on it.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.890
That just leaves the fitness test...

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.390
...which for us should not have
posed any problems.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.290
ONE HOUR LATER

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:00.930
I got 100 points.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.060
Seriously?

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.530
Yes.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.670
It says I'm certified as a Class S hero.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.040
Class S? What's that?

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.440
I am sure these rankings mean little.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.310
How did you do, Master?

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.720
Oh, the letter says I'm also....

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.980
Class S.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.590
I am not surprised.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.420
On top of that, the font size
is bigger than mine.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.060
I expected nothing less, Master.

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.360
By the way, what did they ask you
at the interview?

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.530
Interview?

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:37.800
Yes.

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:42.570
Just one final question, Genos.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.570
Does this building
look familiar to you?

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.480
We've been secretly investigating
a group of troublemakers...

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.380
...that call themselves
the "House of Evolution."

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.020
Just when we identified
its center of operations...

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:00.720
...we found the building had been
mysteriously destroyed.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.760
And with overwhelmingly
intense firepower.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.930
Are you responsible for this?

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.900
I am. Why?

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.510
CERTIFIED S CLASS

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.610
I see....

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.010
I suppose it must be that...

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.480
...they felt no need to go through
the trouble of interviewing you.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.850
Master?

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.090
Yeah, after all...

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.390
...I'm just a Class C hero
with a score of 71 points.

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.130
I see.

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:46.030
So I mistakenly thought the top half
of the "C" was part an "S."

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:47.770
Stop analyzing it!

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.940
It must be a mistake.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.910
I will talk to the person in charge.

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.410
No, don't!
You'll just embarrass me!

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.010
<i>Mr. Genos, Mr. Saitama...</i>

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.180
<i>...there will be a seminar</i>
<i>for successful candidates at 4:00 p.m.</i>

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.750
<i>Please come to Lecture Hall Number 3.</i>

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.820
All right, come on.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.620
All that really matters is we passed.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.530
Let's get it over with and go home.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.030
<i>We finally found the cyborg</i>
<i>we've been looking for.</i>

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.430
So I've heard.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.470
<i>In consideration of his past,</i>
<i>we made an exception...</i>

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.170
<i>...and certified him as a Class S hero.</i>

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:29.080
<i>I just wanted to make sure</i>
<i>you were notified of this.</i>

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:32.710
Yes, I approve.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:39.520
Genos, huh?

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.960
LECTURE HALL 3

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.760
First, congratulations on passing.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.530
Now, one of you
only made it on a fluke...

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:53.900
...so unless you want your luck
to go to waste...

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.870
...I better see you giving it your all.

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:59.240
And don't get all puffed up!

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:04.680
From here on, keep your hero status
in mind and act modestly!

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:10.550
After all, your faces will be placed on
the Hero Association website.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:14.020
Did you hear me?

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.690
That goofball head of yours
is gonna be shown to the whole world.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.000
If you don't want to humiliate yourselves....

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:28.700
Aspire to be a fine hero like me!

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.080
Master!

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:41.120
As a Class A hero, I have
some influence over the Association.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.590
I'll make sure those who
behave irresponsibly...

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.790
...lose points and get demoted.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.760
Don't you forget it!

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.930
<i>What should I have for dinner?</i>

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:57.630
Apparently, the Hero Association
was formed about three years ago.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.770
So it's only been three years?

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:04.610
It was after the grandchild of a millionaire
was attacked by a monster.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.640
The child was saved by a passerby.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.710
When Agoni heard
what had happened...

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.580
...he came up with this system...

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:15.220
...and used his fortune
to establish the Hero Association.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:18.220
Well, they put on
some pretty boring seminars.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:24.760
In any case, as new heroes,
we'll be known around the world.

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:27.700
Now we can work with
our heads held high.

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:31.700
Master....

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.300
I guess I'm now officially your disciple.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:41.740
Please continue to guide me
as my mentor.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.910
Yeah....

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.110
All right, Master. Good night.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:48.320
Yeah, see you.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:51.990
<i>Crap....</i>

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.120
<i>Maybe I shouldn't have been so quick</i>
<i>to say I'd take a disciple.</i>

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:58.960
<i>Especially this guy.</i>

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.160
Those two newcomers today,
did they really pass the exam?

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.070
Their attitudes were awful!

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:10.610
I'm Class A, Rank 38, damn it,
and they had no idea who I was.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.110
Plus, they don't know
how the world works.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.880
Damn amateurs!

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:16.780
They'll be dirt-napping in no time.

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:18.350
No.

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:22.620
Genos got perfect scores
on both the written and physical exams.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:23.950
He's a phenomenal rookie...

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:26.320
...who gained a Class S ranking
right off the bat.

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:30.930
The other one, Saitama,
had terrible scores on the essay...

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.330
...but scored a perfect 50
on the physical.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.630
That's how he was able to
pass at all.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.230
<i>But in practically every activity</i>
<i>on the fitness exam...</i>

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:44.210
<i>...he broke the Hero Association's</i>
<i>test records by inconceivable margins.</i>

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.310
<i>It's as if there's a god</i>
<i>residing in that body.</i>

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:57.890
Snek, you've already been
outranked by Genos.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:02.260
And Saitama may catch up with you
soon enough.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.660
That jackass?

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:12.200
<i>If I get to the top of Class C,</i>
<i>then I'll get promoted to Class B.</i>

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:17.940
<i>And Class A is above that,</i>
<i>with Class S even above that.</i>

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:22.210
<i>I guess Genos is actually pretty amazing.</i>

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.150
<i>I don't know...</i>

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:30.450
<i>...but maybe this isn't</i>
<i>the kind of hero I wanted to be.</i>

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:36.220
The newcomer seminar isn't over yet!

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.760
In this business, there's a thing
called rookie crushing.

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:43.360
A lot of us heroes
hate to be outranked.

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:48.070
So we crush newbies early on,
like this!

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:14.760
Hero Registry?

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:20.100
Yes, I am a Class S hero
and you are a Class C hero.

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:22.500
We are both ranked last
in our classes.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:27.010
Right now, we are still listed
as Genos and Saitama...

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:30.350
...but as we perform more heroic acts,
we will acquire hero names.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.750
Hero names? What are those?

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:39.020
I believe they are like nicknames
that capture a hero's characteristics.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.820
For example,
I might be the "Blond Cyborg."

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:46.330
Wait, if that's how it works,
won't I be like the "Caped Baldy?"

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.260
Aside from being ranked by ability...

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.000
...you can also be ranked by popularity.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:54.900
There are some heroes
that have fan clubs.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.510
-Well, no one cares about that.
-Wha--?!

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:02.940
Thank you for agreeing to
my unreasonable request today.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:08.120
Yeah, well I did promise
to make you my disciple....

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:09.850
Is right here good?

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.320
Yes.

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:14.960
So we're just having a practice bout, right?
Not fighting for real?

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:16.560
Yes, that's what I have in mind.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:23.060
But I want you to go all-out,
so I, too, will give it my all.

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:30.970
Please grant my request.

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:07.510
That was close.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.940
My clothes could have got burnt up again.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.350
I need more speed!

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.410
<i>He's gone?</i>

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:45.210
<i>Have I been chasing his afterimage</i>
<i>this whole time?</i>

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:52.620
<i>There!</i>

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:00.330
Incinerate!

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.470
<i>I got him this time.</i>

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.140
<i>Master will have to take me</i>
<i>more seriously now....</i>

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:09.070
<i>Behind--</i>

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.270
Okay, I win.

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:17.040
-Master....
-Yeah?

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.250
Have you forgotten
the rules of the bout?

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:24.650
Dodge any attack
you are able to dodge.

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:27.050
Take it seriously
and no fooling around.

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:29.220
Do not hold back.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.130
And...

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.330
...keep fighting until
I am no longer able to fight.

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:41.200
<i>Even Master Saitama himself</i>
<i>cannot explain the secret to his power.</i>

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.410
<i>This fight may give me</i>
<i>some insight into it.</i>

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:47.510
Show me no mercy.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.350
Those were the rules, Master--

00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.350
What the--?!

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:00.720
DEATH

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:15.570
I'm starving. Time for lunch.

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:17.240
Let's grab some udon noodles.

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:21.640
Okay....

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:29.120
<i>I am prepared to do anything</i>
<i>in order to become stronger.</i>

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:30.250
<i>But....</i>

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:34.260
<i>I can't picture myself</i>
<i>even approaching Master's power.</i>

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.430
<i>Not at all.</i>

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.370
<i>He's on a different level.</i>

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:49.570
What's the matter?
You don't like udon?

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:58.010
I see, that's his location?
Thanks, I'll head there now.

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:01.220
No, don't worry.

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:04.350
I'm just going to let him know
what the industry expects of him.

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:08.790
I'm glad you like udon.

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:12.130
Yes, I'm not very picky.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:16.460
Well, I'm also kind of
low on funds right now....

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.770
Hey, how about another match, Genos?

00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:22.800
SUPER-SPICY MEGA-MONSTER
UDON CHALLENGE

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.140
PRIZE: ¥50,000
FAILURE: ¥10,000

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:27.170
That's insane!

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:28.310
No way!

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:33.380
I give up...

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.350
Is that it?

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:44.430
Man, you're awesome!

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:48.330
Welcome?!

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.700
You must be Genos.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.710
I'm Amai Mask, Class A, Rank 1.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:00.370
I'd like to talk to you.

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:02.680
Class A, Rank 1?

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:04.150
It's Amai Mask!

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.280
He's so gorgeous!

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:08.080
Talk?

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.650
He might be a rookie crusher.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:12.650
Be careful, Genos!

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:16.220
I see. Please wait here, Master.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:18.390
Very well.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:21.360
I was just thinking about
taking a walk to digest my food.

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:29.600
I hear you were certified Class S
by special exception.

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.170
What of it?

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:40.250
I wonder if he's all right.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.590
-Done already?
-Yes.

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:53.630
You really are Class S.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:57.260
To have the top-ranked Class A hero
come to personally crush you....

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.430
That's not it.

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:02.840
So he wasn't here to fight?
Then what gives?

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:04.640
In short....

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:07.310
He came to welcome me.

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:10.510
What's that mean?

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:11.710
Excuse me!

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:14.880
You're friends with Amai Mask, right?

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:17.650
May I shake your hand?

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.320
Thank you very much!

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.390
Shake mine too!

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:31.430
Class S and Class C heroes
sure get treated differently.

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:34.640
If you think about it, though,
isn't that like fraud money?

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:35.770
WELCOME GIFT

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:38.240
-I mean, you're a cyborg, right?
-Yes.

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:42.640
Never mind. In any case, now we're
even with a win and a loss apiece.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.450
Starting today
we're professional heroes.

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:48.550
Let's do our best, okay?

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.450
Yes.

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:57.530
<i>A professional hero must always be</i>
<i>a beautiful symbol of justice.</i>

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:00.630
That is my philosophy.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.430
It's especially true
if you're a Class S hero.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:07.740
Come on,
there's no need to glare at me.

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:10.740
I came all the way here
just to see you.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.440
How was the Certification Exam?

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:16.840
It was nothing but rubbish.
An exam like that is a waste of time.

00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:23.520
If you came to fight, get on with it.
This, too, is a waste of time.

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:30.460
Being hot-blooded is fine,
but if you take it too far...

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:33.660
...you'll get burnt.

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:40.300
I'll forget your criticism
of the Association.

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:41.900
Thank you for your time.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.770
I welcome you to the team.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:47.010
We expect great things from you...

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:48.810
...Genos.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.490
Master....

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.700
I will be back later.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.470
Oh, okay....

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.730
I'll see you.

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:16.040
Yes, goodbye.

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:45.770
A waste of time?

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:49.970
Such an interesting fellow.

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:29.070
So when you said, "I'll be back,"
this is what you meant?

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:32.940
Yes. I went home to gather my things.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.580
May I live here?

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:39.510
Absolutely not.

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:41.520
I have rent money.

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:47.720
Did you bring a toothbrush?

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:49.490
Yes!

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:51.960
NEXT EPISODE:
THE TERRIFYING CITY

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:53.860
<i>I am Snek, Class A, Rank 38!</i>

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:58.700
<i>A lot of guys think my name is "Snake,"</i>
<i>but it's Snek, so don't forget it!</i>

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:00.630
<i>Next on </i>One-Punch Man
<i>is episode six:</i>

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:01.900
<i>"The Terrifying City."</i>

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:05.210
<i>There's time left?</i>
<i>Well, I'm fully aware of that.</i>

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.010
<i>That's right! In this industry...</i>

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:10.180
<i>...there's such a thing as killing time</i>
<i>with episode previews!</i>
