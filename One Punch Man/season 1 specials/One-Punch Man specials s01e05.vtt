WEBVTT

00:00:06.555 --> 00:00:08.015
There's nowhere 10 run to.

00:00:08.974 --> 00:00:12.102
The Blizzard Bunch from
the Hero Association has you surrounded!

00:00:12.728 --> 00:00:14.230
Surrender quietly!

00:00:14.605 --> 00:00:15.898
Going in for the kill!

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:16.732
Hold on—!

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.785
Dammit, who told you to do that, Lilly?

00:00:28.536 --> 00:00:30.538
Never act on impulse.

00:00:30.746 --> 00:00:33.207
We're the Blizzard "Bunch"
for a reason.

00:00:34.583 --> 00:00:35.626
Miss Blizzard!

00:00:36.752 --> 00:00:38.587
Good work, everyone.

00:00:38.921 --> 00:00:40.297
Miss Blizzard is here!

00:00:40.464 --> 00:00:43.008
All right, we're behind you 100%!

00:00:43.384 --> 00:00:46.262
They're all so lost without me.

00:00:47.805 --> 00:00:50.057
HELLSTORM

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:53.727
This is sure to get
the Blizzard Bunch's name out there.

00:00:56.063 --> 00:01:00.484
THE SISTERS WITH
700 MUCH GOING ON

00:01:00.568 --> 00:01:02.152
THE FOLLOWING DAY

00:01:02.152 --> 00:01:03.195
THE FOLLOWING DAY
What is this?

00:01:03.195 --> 00:01:03.320
THE FOLLOWING DAY

00:01:03.862 --> 00:01:05.990
Not a single word about
the Blizzard Bunch!

00:01:07.032 --> 00:01:08.450
Well, Miss Blizzard,

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.245
| think in our own way,
we did our duty...

00:01:11.453 --> 00:01:12.454
That's true.

00:01:12.454 --> 00:01:12.746
DEEP SEA KING VANQUISHED
That's true.

00:01:12.746 --> 00:01:12.955
DEEP SEA KING VANQUISHED

00:01:12.955 --> 00:01:14.540
DEEP SEA KING VANQUISHED
The big news this time was about

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.623
DEEP SEA KING VANQUISHED

00:01:14.623 --> 00:01:17.501
DEEP SEA KING VANQUISHED how the lower-ranked
heroes ganged up to beat a monster

00:01:17.501 --> 00:01:17.585
DEEP SEA KING VANQUISHED

00:01:17.585 --> 00:01:19.378
DEEP SEA KING VANQUISHED
that even Class S couldn't defeat.

00:01:19.378 --> 00:01:19.461
DEEP SEA KING VANQUISHED

00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:23.507
Yeah, even Stinger only got
a passing mention.

00:01:27.511 --> 00:01:29.388
Miss Blizzard, where are you going?

00:01:30.472 --> 00:01:31.724
Oh, don't worry.

00:01:32.141 --> 00:01:33.309
This is nothing new.

00:01:33.934 --> 00:01:34.560
But...

00:01:35.352 --> 00:01:37.021
| understand her frustration.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.940
Her little sister got a big write up,

00:01:39.982 --> 00:01:42.359
even though she didn't do anything.

00:01:43.652 --> 00:01:44.862
You don't know then?

00:01:45.821 --> 00:01:48.657
Miss Blizzard is actually
the younger sister.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.745
It's not fair.

00:01:53.287 --> 00:01:55.289
They didn't even mention us/

00:01:57.416 --> 00:01:59.126
And she did absolutely nothing.

00:02:13.307 --> 00:02:14.433
| believe that is...

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.694
Top-ranked Class B hero,
Hellish Blizzard.

00:02:26.278 --> 00:02:28.906
Founder and leader of
the Blizzard Bunch.

00:02:29.198 --> 00:02:32.076
A hero rumored to practice
'newbie crushing.”

00:02:33.452 --> 00:02:34.536
But why is she...?

00:02:36.372 --> 00:02:37.414
Allergies maybe?

00:02:44.046 --> 00:02:44.797
Crabs.

00:02:46.715 --> 00:02:47.925
Crabs for my master.

00:02:49.551 --> 00:02:51.762
Isn't this guy from Class S?

00:02:53.555 --> 00:02:54.765
Yes, it is me.

00:02:55.516 --> 00:02:57.101
What, a bomb?!

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.438
Yes, we just got word
from Heavy Kong.

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:04.316
He apprehended a Class A criminal
called The Serial Bomber.

00:03:04.483 --> 00:03:06.652
The miscreant said
he'd planted a bomb

00:03:06.694 --> 00:03:08.445
on a train headed for City Z.

00:03:08.904 --> 00:03:10.114
City Z?

00:03:10.572 --> 00:03:12.116
Do you know the exact train?

00:03:12.908 --> 00:03:16.787
<i>The limited express, departed
at 2:22, bound for City Z.</i>

00:03:17.788 --> 00:03:19.331
He's tampered with the control panel

00:03:19.373 --> 00:03:21.417
so that the bomb will go off
right in the terminal.

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.502
His plan is for a mass killing,

00:03:23.544 --> 00:03:26.130
wiping out everything
around the station.

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:29.967
We have already issued an evacuation
order to the area residents,

00:03:30.008 --> 00:03:32.094
but the most crucial part,
the bomb, is...

00:03:33.762 --> 00:03:34.888
Hey, Genos?

00:03:35.472 --> 00:03:37.474
Everyone, evacuate immediately!

00:03:37.975 --> 00:03:39.935
There is a bomb on this train.

00:03:40.644 --> 00:03:42.604
Please exit as quickly as you—

00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:44.982
Dammit.

00:03:45.023 --> 00:03:46.900
There is no place to escape to.

00:03:47.818 --> 00:03:50.112
Hey, what do you mean, a bomb?

00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:52.197
Hellish Blizzard,

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.074
if I remember correctly,
you are an Esper, correct?

00:03:57.453 --> 00:03:59.121
What's going on?

00:03:59.163 --> 00:04:00.497
Let me off now!

00:04:01.582 --> 00:04:04.084
Do something! I don't wanna die!

00:04:04.293 --> 00:04:06.003
Stop this train!

00:04:14.261 --> 00:04:15.763
Everyone stay calm.

00:04:16.138 --> 00:04:18.474
I'll move you all off safely,
one at a time.

00:04:20.142 --> 00:04:21.852
You're amazing, Miss Blizzard!

00:04:25.856 --> 00:04:27.608
Me take care
of the passengers?

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.692
Yes.

00:04:29.109 --> 00:04:31.195
This express makes
no stops until the station.

00:04:31.653 --> 00:04:33.530
Our priority Is rescuing
the passengers.

00:04:34.281 --> 00:04:36.033
I will stop the ram.

00:04:37.534 --> 00:04:38.494
What is it?

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.621
<i>Cannot handle it without
your underlings?</i>

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.082
No. I just don't appreciate
being ordered around.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.710
What about the bomb?

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.046
<i>No time to search for it.</i>

00:04:49.087 --> 00:04:50.130
Um...

00:04:51.173 --> 00:04:53.091
I can look for it

00:04:53.717 --> 00:04:56.345
I'm a hero foo...

00:04:56.804 --> 00:04:58.388
though I'm just Class C.

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:03.560
Stop staring and find that bomb!

00:05:03.894 --> 00:05:05.270
<i>Yes, ma'am!</i>

00:05:21.745 --> 00:05:23.121
You're the last one.

00:05:29.753 --> 00:05:32.172
That's odd...are we going faster?

00:05:32.673 --> 00:05:34.007
What the hell's he doing?

00:05:34.049 --> 00:05:35.050
| found it...

00:05:35.092 --> 00:05:36.385
the bomb!

00:05:38.554 --> 00:05:42.432
The bathroom showed as occupied,
but no one responded when I knocked,

00:05:42.891 --> 00:05:44.184
so I broke in...

00:05:48.438 --> 00:05:50.566
<i>| know he froze the controls,</i>

00:05:50.607 --> 00:05:53.485
but it seems he removed
the limiter on the engine!

00:05:54.278 --> 00:05:56.321
<i>Approximately 40 seconds
to the terminal.</i>

00:05:56.738 --> 00:05:58.615
! must stop it before then!

00:06:07.416 --> 00:06:08.584
What do we do?!

00:06:08.625 --> 00:06:09.501
We're out of—!

00:06:09.543 --> 00:06:10.669
Shut up!

00:06:11.712 --> 00:06:14.131
Whining won't change anything!

00:06:15.591 --> 00:06:17.050
Prepare yourself.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.269
If I can just contain the bomb,

00:06:27.311 --> 00:06:29.062
I can minimize the damage.

00:06:35.694 --> 00:06:38.572
The explosion will cause
a rapid expansion of gas.

00:06:38.614 --> 00:06:40.449
If I can suppress It...

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:44.286
But can / do that?

00:06:45.454 --> 00:06:46.788
Am [ strong enough?

00:06:54.296 --> 00:06:55.339
All right!

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.340
Outta the way.

00:07:06.016 --> 00:07:08.518
The only thing I know that could
move a mass like that is...

00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:13.190
My sister!

00:07:29.206 --> 00:07:30.040
Man...

00:07:30.207 --> 00:07:32.125
Why didn't you just get out of there?

00:07:36.296 --> 00:07:37.756
None of your business, is it?

00:07:45.722 --> 00:07:47.057
She did it...

00:07:47.391 --> 00:07:48.266
again...

00:07:55.315 --> 00:07:56.775
Excuse me!

00:07:59.361 --> 00:08:02.531
Thank you so much for saving me!

00:08:02.781 --> 00:08:03.615
It's nothing.

00:08:03.949 --> 00:08:05.200
You were just in the way.

00:08:05.951 --> 00:08:09.913
Um... You're Hellish Blizzard,
the top-ranked Class B hero, right?

00:08:10.539 --> 00:08:11.415
Hmm?

00:08:12.124 --> 00:08:13.625
So you know me.

00:08:14.251 --> 00:08:16.461
Well, I'm a hero too, more or less.

00:08:17.045 --> 00:08:18.088
Oh, right.

00:08:19.339 --> 00:08:21.758
But I'm ranked at
the very bottom of Class C.

00:08:22.342 --> 00:08:24.761
It's getting tough to fulfill
the weekly quotas of heroic acts,

00:08:25.053 --> 00:08:26.930
so I'm thinking of quitting...

00:08:28.181 --> 00:08:30.851
Today, I jumped on the train
to go look at the ocean,

00:08:30.892 --> 00:08:32.602
just to take my mind off things.

00:08:33.687 --> 00:08:36.606
But once again, I was useless.

00:08:37.274 --> 00:08:39.818
| figured I'm not cut out
to be a hero, after all.

00:08:42.988 --> 00:08:43.822
| see.

00:08:44.698 --> 00:08:45.782
That's a wise decision.

00:08:46.783 --> 00:08:50.037
But then I decided
I'd try being a hero

00:08:50.078 --> 00:08:51.580
for just a little longer.

00:08:53.415 --> 00:08:55.042
| won't whine anymore.

00:08:56.043 --> 00:08:58.879
So, one day,
when I've moved up to Class B,

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.338
please let me join

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.007
the Blizzard Bunch!

00:09:03.842 --> 00:09:04.885
Is that a no...?

00:09:05.761 --> 00:09:10.557
Isn't that a question you should ask
after you make it to Class B?

00:09:12.059 --> 00:09:13.602
I'm sorry, Blizzard.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:16.938
"Miss" Blizzard.

00:09:19.608 --> 00:09:23.153
That's what members of
the Blizzard Bunch call me.

00:09:23.653 --> 00:09:25.405
You'd better start getting used to it.

00:09:26.782 --> 00:09:27.657
Right!

00:09:32.329 --> 00:09:33.371
Sister...

00:09:34.122 --> 00:09:36.374
I won't give up either/

00:09:39.294 --> 00:09:40.212
Doctor Kuseno...

00:09:41.088 --> 00:09:43.256
Beyond power, speed, range—

00:09:44.049 --> 00:09:46.176
Now there is another element I lack.

00:09:46.468 --> 00:09:47.969
This is quite sudden.

00:09:48.136 --> 00:09:49.096
What is it?

00:09:49.304 --> 00:09:50.347
Supernatural powers.

00:09:51.973 --> 00:09:55.185
My technology cannot
help you with that.

00:09:56.895 --> 00:09:59.147
Must have been quite
a formidable opponent.

00:09:59.731 --> 00:10:00.857
What happened?

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.527
| failed at shopping.

00:10:04.611 --> 00:10:06.113
If only I possessed supernatural powers,

00:10:06.446 --> 00:10:08.657
the crabs would not have exploded...

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:11.535
He must be tired.

00:10:13.787 --> 00:10:15.705
He sure is taking his time...

00:10:20.127 --> 00:10:21.211
(Ah, that's the way)

00:10:23.964 --> 00:10:25.006
(Ah, let's go)

00:10:30.512 --> 00:10:32.889

<i>No need to sugarcoat it,</i>

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:56.079
<i>Time for you to disappear.</i>

00:10:56.204 --> 00:10:59.708
We may look very different

00:10:59.749 --> 00:11:04.004
But we are sisters

00:11:04.045 --> 00:11:06.089

"You call yourself a man? Pathetic!
You digust me. Leave!"

00:11:30.071 --> 00:11:31.573
