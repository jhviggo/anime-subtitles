WEBVTT

00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:05.137
THE FAR TOO IMPOSSIBLE
CASE OF MURDER

00:00:05.804 --> 00:00:08.140
His guard may have been down,

00:00:08.432 --> 00:00:10.726
but even so,
there aren't many humans

00:00:10.768 --> 00:00:13.020
who could take out a Class S hero.

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:16.565
Indeed. The killer is probably...

00:00:17.316 --> 00:00:18.484
one of us here!

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:24.657
But which one?

00:00:25.574 --> 00:00:27.993
THE ZOMBIEMAN MURDER FILE

00:00:28.077 --> 00:00:29.161
THE PRIOR DAY

00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:31.288
THE PRIOR DAY
The story begins a day ago.

00:00:31.288 --> 00:00:31.539
THE PRIOR DAY

00:00:31.622 --> 00:00:34.208
We were honored as persons
of distinguished service

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.669
for saving the Earth
from alien invasions

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.420
and preventing the largest disaster
in history.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.754
WELCOME HERO ASSOCIATION MEMBERS and
preventing the largest disaster in history.

00:00:38.754 --> 00:00:38.796
WELCOME HERO ASSOCIATION MEMBERS

00:00:38.796 --> 00:00:42.091
<i>WELCOME HERO ASSOCIATION MEMBERS In appreciation,
the Hero Association took us on an overnight trip.</i>

00:00:42.091 --> 00:00:42.591
WELCOME HERO ASSOCIATION MEMBERS

00:00:44.718 --> 00:00:46.387
That feels good...

00:00:46.595 --> 00:00:49.640
It was very generous of
the Association to take us

00:00:49.932 --> 00:00:51.642
on a hot springs trip
to celebrate our victory.

00:00:51.976 --> 00:00:55.271
Though some of us left
the field without fighting...

00:00:55.437 --> 00:00:56.564
You're right.

00:00:56.647 --> 00:00:58.899
How come we're sharing this place
with a pack of jerks

00:00:58.941 --> 00:01:00.734
who didn't lift a finger?!

00:01:01.443 --> 00:01:03.153
We had other tasks.

00:01:03.362 --> 00:01:06.740
What's more important
than fighting aliens?

00:01:07.116 --> 00:01:09.159
It's none of your business.

00:01:09.618 --> 00:01:12.580
They were taking down violent criminals
and monsters

00:01:12.621 --> 00:01:15.249
with bounties on their heads
in other towns.

00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:16.834
It's all been confirmed.

00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:18.711
They left because they figured

00:01:18.752 --> 00:01:22.715
the rest of us could handle things
without them.

00:01:23.132 --> 00:01:25.384
Yeah, well, it all worked out.

00:01:25.968 --> 00:01:28.512
| left because I was hungry.

00:01:28.846 --> 00:01:31.974
| just want to protect my own town.

00:01:32.516 --> 00:01:36.186
I've always got a pile of requests
to get rid of monsters.

00:01:36.312 --> 00:01:38.355
| can't lie around all day like you.

00:01:39.023 --> 00:01:40.733
What'd you say?!

00:01:41.317 --> 00:01:44.528
| had to skip
my little sister's piano recital!

00:01:44.653 --> 00:01:47.865
Come on, guys.
Let's try to get along today.

00:01:48.657 --> 00:01:51.410
| could have handled it all
by myself.

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.622
Hey! You're not supposed to wear
swimsuits in a hot spring!

00:01:54.997 --> 00:01:56.665
W-Who cares...?!

00:01:57.041 --> 00:01:58.125
Jeez...

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.465
| doubt that the danger Madame Shibabawa
prophesied has passed.

00:02:05.132 --> 00:02:08.260
I've asked you all here today
under the pretext

00:02:08.344 --> 00:02:10.387
of discussing this matter.

00:02:10.846 --> 00:02:12.806
But be that as it may,

00:02:13.015 --> 00:02:16.435
| am deeply grateful for your heroic acts
the day of the attack.

00:02:16.935 --> 00:02:21.774
I'd like you all to let loose
and enjoy yourself tonight.

00:02:22.691 --> 00:02:23.317
All right!

00:02:23.567 --> 00:02:24.401
Cheers!

00:02:24.902 --> 00:02:26.445
Cheers!

00:02:28.697 --> 00:02:30.574
| believe this is “Dragon Killer!”

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:32.409
A truly great sake!

00:02:32.701 --> 00:02:35.204
Yeah. Easy to drink, but strong.

00:02:35.871 --> 00:02:39.124
Who is it? Who's number one?

00:02:39.416 --> 00:02:42.086
Muscle...pose!

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.132
Are they ever not
putting on a muscle show...

00:02:47.174 --> 00:02:49.259
Having fun, Child Emperor?

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.303
Oh yeah, kind of.

00:02:51.762 --> 00:02:53.639
| see. That's good.

00:02:55.808 --> 00:02:58.644
No one would have believed it
at the time,

00:02:59.395 --> 00:03:02.064
<i>but our peaceful party was
about to turn into</i>

00:03:02.106 --> 00:03:04.983
<i>a gruesome crime scene...</i>

00:03:10.823 --> 00:03:13.534
Let's start with the weapon
that was used.

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:15.869
Yeah, that's mine.

00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:18.914
But I left my sword
in the banquet hall.

00:03:19.373 --> 00:03:22.209
Someone must've taken it.

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:25.003
You don't believe me?

00:03:25.087 --> 00:03:26.547
To begin with,

00:03:26.672 --> 00:03:29.466
we were drinking over there
till just a moment ago, right?

00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:30.384
True.

00:03:33.262 --> 00:03:37.683
What? You think we're all
conspiring together?

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.810
Atomic Samurai is innocent.

00:03:40.185 --> 00:03:41.019
What?

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:43.564
Sitch and I were there too.

00:03:45.733 --> 00:03:47.484
You can ask him.

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:51.405
| suppose he can't be a suspect,
so his testimony would be credible.

00:03:51.613 --> 00:03:54.491
Besides, we have no motive.

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:56.577
A motive, huh...

00:03:56.785 --> 00:04:00.080
Speaking of motives,
| just remembered, Prisoner...

00:04:01.123 --> 00:04:04.293
You were staring at Zombieman
rather suspiciously!

00:04:04.501 --> 00:04:06.336
Yeah...I was thinking
it'd be so great...

00:04:06.378 --> 00:04:07.379
What would?

00:04:07.838 --> 00:04:10.841
If little Zombie here were mine.

00:04:11.216 --> 00:04:15.262
However, I restrict myself
to violent criminals.

00:04:15.637 --> 00:04:18.682
Even then, I never kill them!
What a waste!

00:04:19.141 --> 00:04:23.479
But you're the only “convict'
amongst us.

00:04:23.812 --> 00:04:26.064
Although you escape from prison
like it's nothing.

00:04:26.482 --> 00:04:28.609
So society would say
the least trustworthy is—

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.027
That's discrimination!

00:04:30.152 --> 00:04:33.071
| am reasoning via the process
of elimination.

00:04:33.322 --> 00:04:35.699
In that case,
| have someone in mind too.

00:04:36.158 --> 00:04:39.745
| overheard an ominous remark
when he and Zombie were talking.

00:04:41.246 --> 00:04:43.248
You asked dear Zombieman

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.751
if he really wouldn't die
even if you punched him.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.504
Yeah, Genos told me

00:04:48.545 --> 00:04:51.590
there's a rumor going round
that he's immortal.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.716
Don't tell me

00:04:52.758 --> 00:04:55.260
Master Saitama is a suspect?

00:04:55.511 --> 00:04:59.973
I'm just looking at different possibilities
from a rational perspective.

00:05:00.307 --> 00:05:03.227
We don't know much about Saitama.

00:05:03.435 --> 00:05:05.896
He could be a spy from
another organization—

00:05:06.522 --> 00:05:08.607
Well, maybe not with that face.

00:05:09.316 --> 00:05:13.070
Look, even if Master Saitama wanted
to kill Zombieman,

00:05:13.362 --> 00:05:14.822
He would not need weapons.

00:05:14.863 --> 00:05:15.948
A single punch—

00:05:17.032 --> 00:05:17.741
Wart

00:05:18.575 --> 00:05:21.119
<i>If Master wanted to
test Zombieman's immortality,</i>

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.915
<i>he might have used a weapon
to go easy on him.</i>

00:05:26.124 --> 00:05:27.709
That would make sense!

00:05:29.044 --> 00:05:30.337
Master, do not worry.

00:05:30.838 --> 00:05:32.089
| will defend you at your trial.

00:05:32.381 --> 00:05:34.007
| didn't do it!

00:05:34.049 --> 00:05:38.512
Now, now. The others haven't been
cleared yet either.

00:05:39.304 --> 00:05:42.349
Flash has fallen silent
as he stares at the dead body.

00:05:42.558 --> 00:05:44.601
<i>Pig God is eating breakfast.</i>

00:05:45.227 --> 00:05:47.396
Watchdog Man is still sleeping.

00:05:47.896 --> 00:05:49.314
And as for Metal Bat...

00:05:49.356 --> 00:05:50.732
| didn't do it.

00:05:51.358 --> 00:05:54.611
Unlike the others, I'm a minor,
so I didn't drink.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.906
So I couldn't have gotten drunk
and made a mistake...

00:05:58.156 --> 00:05:59.533
W-What?

00:05:59.741 --> 00:06:02.119
You're unusually quiet today.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.330
Lay off! I'm just not
a morning person, that's all!

00:06:05.372 --> 00:06:06.832
Now, now...

00:06:07.332 --> 00:06:10.043
So who first discovered the body?

00:06:10.085 --> 00:06:11.920
Wouldn't they be the prime suspect?

00:06:12.421 --> 00:06:15.215
It was the waitress here,
so that's a dead end.

00:06:15.757 --> 00:06:19.469
Well... I just ran over
because someone told me...

00:06:20.095 --> 00:06:22.973
What? So someone else discovered
the body first?

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.642
King!

00:06:25.726 --> 00:06:26.643
You...

00:06:27.436 --> 00:06:29.730
Why didn't you say anything?

00:06:29.855 --> 00:06:31.607
No one asked me.

00:06:32.316 --> 00:06:34.818
Please tell us how
you found the body.

00:06:35.485 --> 00:06:38.530
| was on my way to the vending machine
to get a drink

00:06:38.697 --> 00:06:40.449
when I saw a body on the ground.

00:06:40.657 --> 00:06:42.159
| let the front desk know.

00:06:42.743 --> 00:06:43.577
That's it.

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:47.289
King, what were you up to last night?

00:06:47.956 --> 00:06:52.169
| soaked in the bath in my room,
then went to sleep.

00:06:52.794 --> 00:06:56.673
What? This inn is known for
its large outdoor bath.

00:06:56.715 --> 00:06:59.217
Why would you use the bath
in your room?

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:01.803
Such decisions are mine to make.

00:07:02.471 --> 00:07:06.767
There was always something sketchy
about this King guy...

00:07:07.142 --> 00:07:10.020
I'm not trying to hide anything.

00:07:10.145 --> 00:07:11.355
That sound...

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:13.690
You call it the “King Engine,” right?

00:07:14.274 --> 00:07:17.069
Am I to assume
you are ready to fight?

00:07:17.653 --> 00:07:20.447
If my innocence is under suspicion,

00:07:20.489 --> 00:07:22.032
I'm left with no choice.

00:07:25.577 --> 00:07:26.411
Jeez!

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.330
You're still at it?

00:07:28.664 --> 00:07:31.208
If you're all under suspicion,

00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:33.710
then I'll just restrain
all of you!

00:07:37.714 --> 00:07:38.966
Hang on, Tornado!

00:07:40.592 --> 00:07:42.886
Restrain? What's going on?

00:07:47.766 --> 00:07:49.559
Could someone pull this out?

00:07:51.353 --> 00:07:54.398
Who attacked you, Zombieman?

00:07:54.815 --> 00:07:58.735
Well, I drank quite a bit last night,
so I don't really remember.

00:07:59.736 --> 00:08:00.904
But, if I'm not mistaken,

00:08:01.196 --> 00:08:04.908
that sword came flying
through the air and impaled me.

00:08:05.701 --> 00:08:09.162
Then, because I was drunk,
| must have fallen asleep.

00:08:09.871 --> 00:08:12.791
So you're saying my sword
was floating in the air?

00:08:12.833 --> 00:08:15.961
Yeah, surrounded by a green light.

00:08:16.586 --> 00:08:17.921
Just like that.

00:08:20.132 --> 00:08:21.925
W-What?

00:08:22.718 --> 00:08:25.721
Tornado, what were you doing
after dinner last night?

00:08:25.887 --> 00:08:27.472
| don't remember!

00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:29.433
Were you perhaps drinking?

00:08:29.891 --> 00:08:33.228
| don't know.
| said, I don't remember!

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:36.481
You think you're gonna get away
with a lame excuse like that?

00:08:36.523 --> 00:08:37.441
What?!

00:08:37.482 --> 00:08:41.695
Look, I know Zombieman doesn't die
when he gets killed!

00:08:41.737 --> 00:08:45.449
If I wanted him dead,
| wouldn't do something this half-assed.

00:08:46.116 --> 00:08:47.576
Let's just forget it already.

00:08:47.993 --> 00:08:50.787
Zombieman is fine
as we can all see.

00:08:50.912 --> 00:08:53.415
Yeah, doesn't bother me.

00:08:53.915 --> 00:08:56.251
Stuff like this happens all
the time when you drink.

00:08:56.626 --> 00:08:57.627
- Huh?
- Huh?

00:08:58.587 --> 00:09:00.422
Nah. Not really.

00:09:01.089 --> 00:09:03.050
Okay, let's break it up.

00:09:03.091 --> 00:09:04.801
Let's hit the baths, lai.

00:09:05.177 --> 00:09:06.470
Oh.. .right!

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.097
Child Emperor...

00:09:09.931 --> 00:09:10.974
Have a minute?

00:09:13.477 --> 00:09:14.978
T-This is...

00:09:15.771 --> 00:09:18.231
| knew Tornado did it.

00:09:22.778 --> 00:09:25.322
She looks pretty drunk.

00:09:27.032 --> 00:09:29.659
But why on earth would
she do this?

00:09:30.869 --> 00:09:35.499
<i>| know Zombieman doesn't die
when he gets killed!</i>

00:09:35.999 --> 00:09:37.250
Oh, I get it!

00:09:37.709 --> 00:09:39.920
She knew about
Zombieman's regenerative abilities

00:09:39.961 --> 00:09:41.088
and was just enjoying herself...

00:09:41.963 --> 00:09:43.673
Then again,

00:09:43.924 --> 00:09:46.468
what would cause Tornado
to drink to that point?

00:09:51.056 --> 00:09:53.767
So the little brat caused
all that trouble?

00:09:54.392 --> 00:09:57.062
But why would
she do something like that?

00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.231
That ls...

00:10:00.148 --> 00:10:02.526
<i>...likely your fault, Master.</i>
