WEBVTT

00:00:17.983 --> 00:00:19.527
What would have happened

00:00:19.568 --> 00:00:21.862
<i>if I had used my Fist of
Flowing Water, Crushed Rock...?</i>

00:00:22.571 --> 00:00:23.948
Saitama, huh?

00:00:24.573 --> 00:00:27.576
<i>It'd be a shame to just
leave him to his own devices.</i>

00:00:28.577 --> 00:00:33.082
THE EXCESSIVELY PUSHY BANG

00:00:35.417 --> 00:00:36.961
Maybe there's some way—

00:00:39.713 --> 00:00:40.965
<i>Hm? Genos?</i>

00:00:41.757 --> 00:00:43.008
<i>Why are they together?</i>

00:00:43.592 --> 00:00:45.177
<i>Come to think of it...</i>

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.054
Master!

00:00:47.846 --> 00:00:50.599
Are they teacher and student?

00:00:51.475 --> 00:00:53.936
But their rankings are
Class S and Class C.

00:00:53.978 --> 00:00:55.354
So what's going on?

00:00:57.106 --> 00:00:58.899
What should we have for dinner?

00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:01.318
| think we've got some cabbage left.

00:01:01.485 --> 00:01:03.320
Cabbage alone will not be enough.

00:01:04.113 --> 00:01:05.698
Shall I purchase some meat?

00:01:06.115 --> 00:01:08.284
There you go again.

00:01:08.742 --> 00:01:11.370
Listen, don't underestimate cabbage!

00:01:11.745 --> 00:01:14.290
Stir-fried in yakiniku sauce,
it goes great with rice.

00:01:15.207 --> 00:01:18.919
<i>Hmm...so they are indeed
teacher and student.</i>

00:01:19.086 --> 00:01:22.631
| see. So preparation is what
truly dictates the results.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.302
Even a powerful weapon can be junk
in the hands of the incompetent.

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:29.096
Is that the lesson, Master?

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.515
| wouldn't go that far.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.183
You teach me so much, Master!

00:01:34.351 --> 00:01:35.352
Incredible!

00:01:35.811 --> 00:01:39.523
<i>He preaches the principles of
martial arts with leftover cabbage!</i>

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.194
And a disciple so quick fo pick up
on his master's lessons...

00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:46.280
Such a far cry from Charanko.

00:01:50.993 --> 00:01:52.328
If I don't do something,

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.872
the Fist of Flowing Water,
Crushed Rock ends with me.

00:01:55.414 --> 00:01:56.332
All right.

00:01:57.666 --> 00:02:02.338
Aw man! All your talk about meat
made me hungry for some!

00:02:02.504 --> 00:02:03.380
Hello!

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.549
Quite impressive.

00:02:06.175 --> 00:02:07.676
Who's this old guy again?

00:02:08.177 --> 00:02:09.261
Silverfang.

00:02:09.845 --> 00:02:11.639
The Class S hero, Master.

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:13.390
Just call me Bang.

00:02:14.683 --> 00:02:17.811
Up close, he appears to be
no more than an ordinary guy.

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:21.106
Genos looks superior
in every respect.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.359
<i>Yet, Saitama is the one guiding him.</i>

00:02:23.525 --> 00:02:27.529
In terms of rank,
Genos is placed much higher.

00:02:28.364 --> 00:02:30.532
But if Saitama has mastered
a fighting style

00:02:30.574 --> 00:02:33.077
that can surpass rankings,
it's a different story.

00:02:33.744 --> 00:02:36.538
What's with the old guy?
He's gone all quiet...

00:02:36.747 --> 00:02:39.249
There are many eccentrics in Class S.

00:02:39.416 --> 00:02:43.337
<i>I suppose that means this Saitama
is an outstanding teacher.</i>

00:02:44.588 --> 00:02:46.090
— Ready?
—Yes.

00:02:47.508 --> 00:02:48.926
So Saitama...

00:02:49.718 --> 00:02:51.428
do you have a teacher?

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.970
Huh?

00:02:52.388 --> 00:02:55.683
Where did you learn martial arts?
Which style do you practice?

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.936
So we go from silence to
a barrage of questions?

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.231
Even if your style isn't mainstream,
don't be embarrassed—

00:03:02.272 --> 00:03:03.857
Nah, I don't have a teacher.

00:03:04.108 --> 00:03:06.944
But then.. how did you
become so strong?

00:03:07.403 --> 00:03:10.280
Um...weight lifting...| guess?

00:03:10.364 --> 00:03:11.240
What!

00:03:11.365 --> 00:03:13.200
So you're saying that
you smashed that meteor

00:03:13.242 --> 00:03:14.702
using pure physical ability?

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:16.203
Yeah, sure.

00:03:16.537 --> 00:03:19.081
This kid has so much potential!

00:03:20.874 --> 00:03:23.961
How about stopping by
my dojo one day?

00:03:24.128 --> 00:03:25.796
It might be interesting.

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:27.214
No, I'm good.

00:03:27.256 --> 00:03:29.341
Master Saitama is a busy man.

00:03:29.508 --> 00:03:31.385
Come on, don't be like that.

00:03:32.136 --> 00:03:34.263
This is the address for my dojo.

00:03:34.304 --> 00:03:35.848
I'll be there all day tomorrow.

00:03:35.973 --> 00:03:37.433
Were you listening?

00:03:37.474 --> 00:03:38.976
— Master is—
— All right, old man.

00:03:39.476 --> 00:03:40.310
See you tomorrow.

00:03:40.477 --> 00:03:41.812
Oh, Master!

00:03:44.523 --> 00:03:48.068
<i>| can't wait to see their faces
lit with enthusiasm.</i>

00:04:00.414 --> 00:04:02.124
Why hasn't he come?!

00:04:04.877 --> 00:04:07.713
| thought for sure you were
going to the dojo.

00:04:07.963 --> 00:04:11.133
Yeah, old dudes like that
can be persistent.

00:04:11.508 --> 00:04:13.552
Humoring them,
then blowing them off

00:04:13.594 --> 00:04:15.345
is the only way
to avoid big headaches.

00:04:17.723 --> 00:04:19.349
Not a care in the world.

00:04:20.309 --> 00:04:22.728
But one should never
let his guard down.

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:24.813
You're wide open!

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.027
I could've defeated him 200 times
while he was shopping.

00:04:30.152 --> 00:04:33.697
<i>He's so very vulnerable
and inexperienced.</i>

00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:40.162
Master!

00:04:44.917 --> 00:04:48.045
| thought it was a cat,
but it was just a plastic bag.

00:04:48.754 --> 00:04:50.506
And now all my delicious meat

00:04:50.631 --> 00:04:53.050
has been run over by a truck...

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.385
Such physical prowess!

00:04:55.511 --> 00:04:58.222
<i>No wonder he walks around
So open to attack.</i>

00:04:58.347 --> 00:05:01.391
This changes all of
my mental simulations.

00:05:02.518 --> 00:05:04.895
You two look like
you're in need of some protein.

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:08.732
At my dojo,

00:05:08.774 --> 00:05:12.569
| have some premium meat that
the Martial Arts Association sent over.

00:05:13.612 --> 00:05:14.988
That's quite a coincidence.

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.407
| happen to have
some yakiniku sauce!

00:05:17.741 --> 00:05:19.576
Where's your dojo?

00:05:20.202 --> 00:05:21.537
ADVANCE FEARLESSLY
TOWARDS ONE'S GOAL

00:05:21.537 --> 00:05:22.120
ADVANCE FEARLESSLY TOWARDS ONE'S GOAL But, before I give
you the meat, there's something I'd like you to see.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.749
But, before I give you the meat,
there's something I'd like you to see.

00:05:32.214 --> 00:05:33.215
What do you think?

00:05:33.298 --> 00:05:35.342
| was hoping I could open your eyes
to how marvelous

00:05:35.384 --> 00:05:36.510
the martial arts are—

00:05:37.052 --> 00:05:39.346
Yeah, I get it.
Now hurry up and give us the meat.

00:05:39.596 --> 00:05:41.807
What is it that you want?

00:05:42.474 --> 00:05:46.645
<i>Looks like I'll have to
make them understand...</i>

00:05:47.062 --> 00:05:48.647
— But if I fight them,
— We were promised meat.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.315
— There's a possibility
— Why are we breaking bricks?

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:52.442
— They may get hurt. All right...
— Ahh, this is becoming a pain.

00:05:52.693 --> 00:05:53.235
KARUTA FOR
GOOD BOYS AND GIRLS

00:05:53.235 --> 00:05:54.862
KARUTA FOR GOOD BOYS AND
GIRLS Let's have a game of karuta!

00:05:54.862 --> 00:05:54.945
KARUTA FOR
GOOD BOYS AND GIRLS

00:05:55.153 --> 00:05:57.447
Hey, what about the meat?

00:05:57.573 --> 00:05:59.616
Win the game and it's yours.

00:06:00.534 --> 00:06:02.327
Charanko, you read the cards.

00:06:02.452 --> 00:06:03.412
Yes, sir!

00:06:08.417 --> 00:06:09.543
Nu...

00:06:10.294 --> 00:06:11.503
What the—!

00:06:12.713 --> 00:06:13.630
How's that?

00:06:13.672 --> 00:06:15.716
By sharpening every nerve
in my body,

00:06:15.757 --> 00:06:17.759
| can react instantaneously.

00:06:17.926 --> 00:06:20.220
That is the essence of martial arts.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.474
Ro...

00:06:27.936 --> 00:06:28.979
Got it.

00:06:29.104 --> 00:06:33.650
| see. The one who can flick
more cards wins.

00:06:34.192 --> 00:06:35.819
All right. Hurry up and
read the next one.

00:06:35.944 --> 00:06:38.822
Wait a moment!
You can't neglect the rules.

00:06:39.489 --> 00:06:43.327
These guys aren't the type to
quietly play games inside.

00:06:44.453 --> 00:06:45.621
Apparently so.

00:06:46.204 --> 00:06:47.122
In that case...

00:06:48.415 --> 00:06:52.044
This is an old training method
passed down in our dojo.

00:06:52.294 --> 00:06:54.504
It's a kind of freestyle sparring.

00:06:54.671 --> 00:06:56.423
First, the two players must decide

00:06:56.465 --> 00:06:58.592
who will attack and
who will defend.

00:06:58.675 --> 00:07:03.263
This is decided via
shitao, jiandao and—

00:07:03.305 --> 00:07:04.348
You mean "rock-paper-scissors."

00:07:05.807 --> 00:07:07.643
The winner then has the right to

00:07:07.684 --> 00:07:10.062
pick up the weapon and
hit the other guy.

00:07:10.187 --> 00:07:12.773
Hit, cover, rock-paper-scissors, right?

00:07:13.023 --> 00:07:15.859
Yeah, generally that's the idea...

00:07:16.026 --> 00:07:18.654
But in a competition such as this,
martial arts can work

00:07:18.695 --> 00:07:19.947
to your advantage—

00:07:19.988 --> 00:07:21.907
Master, I'll do it.

00:07:22.157 --> 00:07:23.867
You understand the rules?

00:07:23.951 --> 00:07:26.161
Yes. I figured the explanation
would take forever,

00:07:26.203 --> 00:07:27.537
so I looked them up myself.

00:07:28.038 --> 00:07:29.748
Very well.

00:07:29.831 --> 00:07:31.333
ROUND ONE

00:07:31.667 --> 00:07:34.211
— Hit! Cover! Rock, paper, scissors!
— Hit! Cover! Rock, paper, scissors!

00:07:40.425 --> 00:07:41.969
First blood.

00:07:42.344 --> 00:07:44.179
Still just a rookie, eh?

00:07:45.347 --> 00:07:48.225
Maybe this is too advanced
for you kids?

00:07:49.017 --> 00:07:50.727
Looks like fun.

00:07:51.061 --> 00:07:52.854
Tag out, Genos!

00:07:53.021 --> 00:07:55.232
ROUND TWO

00:07:55.232 --> 00:07:56.191
ROUND TWO — Hit! Cover! Rock, paper,
scissors! — Hit! Cover! Rock, paper, scissors!

00:07:56.191 --> 00:07:57.818
— Hit! Cover! Rock, paper, scissors!
— Hit! Cover! Rock, paper, scissors!

00:08:04.783 --> 00:08:06.910
Damn. Let's go again!

00:08:07.577 --> 00:08:08.787
Fine.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:09.454
ROUND THREE

00:08:09.454 --> 00:08:10.414
ROUND THREE — Rock, paper,
scissors! — Rock, paper, scissors!

00:08:10.414 --> 00:08:10.914
— Rock, paper, scissors!
— Rock, paper, scissors!

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:12.040
ROUND FOUR

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.041
Scissors!

00:08:13.208 --> 00:08:14.918
Scissors! Scissors!

00:08:15.043 --> 00:08:16.712
Scissors! Scissors! Scissors!

00:08:16.753 --> 00:08:20.382
Scissors! Scissors! Scissors!
Scissors! Scissors! Scissors!

00:08:23.552 --> 00:08:25.095
Again!!

00:08:25.387 --> 00:08:26.054
ROUND 22

00:08:26.054 --> 00:08:27.973
ROUND 22 — Hit! Cover! Rock,
paper, — Hit! Cover! Rock, paper,

00:08:27.973 --> 00:08:28.015
ROUND 22

00:08:28.015 --> 00:08:28.098
ROUND 22 — scissors! — scissors!

00:08:28.098 --> 00:08:29.099
— Scissors!
— scissors!

00:08:38.191 --> 00:08:40.193
Brings back memories...

00:08:43.905 --> 00:08:49.286
<i>To bring back that
lively energy to the dojo...</i>

00:08:49.745 --> 00:08:53.457
<i>I'm going to need the power
and strength of youth.</i>

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:58.336
Wart, he's... 2/

00:09:07.054 --> 00:09:09.264
Such power!

00:09:09.598 --> 00:09:12.309
No fair! You're not allowed to dodge!

00:09:13.185 --> 00:09:14.561
That would've settled it otherwise!

00:09:15.103 --> 00:09:16.938
Those aren't the rules!

00:09:17.064 --> 00:09:17.898
Enough.

00:09:17.939 --> 00:09:18.482
Huh?

00:09:19.775 --> 00:09:21.443
| lost.

00:09:21.985 --> 00:09:24.613
If we'd been fighting for real,
how would it have ended?

00:09:24.946 --> 00:09:26.114
All right then!

00:09:26.281 --> 00:09:28.575
The next hit wins!

00:09:29.076 --> 00:09:33.497
You fool. I have no intention of engaging
in mortal combat with you.

00:09:33.663 --> 00:09:34.331
Huh?

00:09:34.372 --> 00:09:36.249
What about the meat?

00:09:36.541 --> 00:09:38.668
| was always going to give it to you.

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:39.461
Huh?

00:09:39.711 --> 00:09:41.880
So what'd you think?

00:09:41.922 --> 00:09:44.341
Maybe you understand now
that you've had a match.

00:09:44.716 --> 00:09:46.259
Especially you, Saitama.

00:09:46.301 --> 00:09:49.513
Before you knew it,
you were enjoying the competition.

00:09:49.805 --> 00:09:52.390
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have gotten so serious.

00:09:53.141 --> 00:09:54.810
— You listen too, Charanko.
—Yes.

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:57.437
Martial arts is appealing
in this way,

00:09:57.479 --> 00:10:00.482
a way that you can never get
from merely fighting.

00:10:00.816 --> 00:10:03.652
It's true, Master was getting serious...

00:10:04.152 --> 00:10:07.489
Exactly. That is the essence
of martial arts.

00:10:08.281 --> 00:10:09.574
Bang-sensei!

00:10:09.825 --> 00:10:10.992
Well?

00:10:11.034 --> 00:10:13.829
Perhaps you're now interested
in attending my dojo?

00:10:13.995 --> 00:10:15.038
Nah...

00:10:15.455 --> 00:10:16.456
Not at all.

00:10:20.961 --> 00:10:22.879
Oh, really?

00:10:24.214 --> 00:10:27.592
Whatever, let's go
one more round and finish this!

00:10:27.759 --> 00:10:29.970
Master, shall I play you
next round?

00:10:30.178 --> 00:10:31.513
What? Why?

00:10:35.183 --> 00:10:36.309
(Ah, that's the way)

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.063
(Ah, let's go)

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.904
(Ah, that's the way,
that's the way)

00:10:48.238 --> 00:10:49.739
"My name is Saitama.

00:10:50.198 --> 00:10:53.034
I'm just a guy
who's a hero for fun,

00:10:53.076 --> 00:10:55.412
and I can beat
all the evils of this world. "

00:10:55.495 --> 00:10:59.416
Never miss a day of training

00:10:59.541 --> 00:11:03.420
<i>No air conditioning was pretty hard</i>

00:11:03.461 --> 00:11:06.965
But I was finally rewarded
with this fist

00:11:07.048 --> 00:11:11.178
Of overwhelming power

00:11:11.303 --> 00:11:14.764
Things you can't forget,
like garbage day

00:11:14.848 --> 00:11:19.144
And sale day at the supermarket

00:11:19.227 --> 00:11:21.146
(Ah, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap)

00:11:21.229 --> 00:11:24.608
Come on, seaweed,
make my hair grow

00:11:24.649 --> 00:11:29.487
One-Punch Folk Song

00:11:29.571 --> 00:11:32.282
I can't stand guys
who are long-winded.

00:11:32.908 --> 00:11:36.995
<i>Shorten it to 20 words or less
and get back to me!”</i>

00:11:45.128 --> 00:11:46.630
(Ah, that's the way,
that's the way)

00:11:46.713 --> 00:11:50.133
One attack, one kill, ONE PUNCH

00:11:50.217 --> 00:11:54.638
One-Punch Folk Song

00:11:54.679 --> 00:11:57.974
Dance! Sing! Fight!

00:11:58.016 --> 00:12:02.854
One-Punch AH Folk Song
