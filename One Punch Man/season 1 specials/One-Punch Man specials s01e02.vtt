00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:05.137
THE DISCIPLE WHO STINKS
AT STORYTELLING

00:00:06.972 --> 00:00:09.892
Just out shopping for dinner,
you say?

00:00:10.017 --> 00:00:13.938
And you expect me to
believe that load of crap?!

00:00:14.563 --> 00:00:17.399
My apologies, but I am in a hurry.

00:00:21.111 --> 00:00:24.031
This...is Don Pacino.

00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:28.452
You're gonna tell me everything
you know about this man.

00:00:29.286 --> 00:00:32.831
Until you do,
I'll have to hang on to this.

00:00:33.457 --> 00:00:35.084
You will return it if I talk?

00:00:35.417 --> 00:00:37.711
Of course. You have my word.

00:00:38.212 --> 00:00:39.630
Very well. I will talk.

00:00:39.964 --> 00:00:42.800
Suddenly you're very reasonable.

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:45.970
This must mean a lot to you.

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:49.848
Yes, it is very important.

00:00:55.271 --> 00:00:57.982
You know, when you're
soaking in a hot bath

00:00:58.065 --> 00:01:00.025
everyone says, "ahh."

00:01:00.276 --> 00:01:02.945
| wonder why everyone says that.

00:01:02.987 --> 00:01:04.363
That is true.

00:01:05.114 --> 00:01:09.326
| mean, wouldn't "eee" or "uuu"
or "ohhh" work too?

00:01:09.618 --> 00:01:10.661
IIEeell?

00:01:10.911 --> 00:01:13.664
Yeah. Try it.

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:15.207
Say "eee" for me.

00:01:15.624 --> 00:01:16.667
Eeee...

00:01:17.876 --> 00:01:18.919
How's that?

00:01:19.086 --> 00:01:22.840
Don't ask me.
How was it for you?

00:01:23.424 --> 00:01:24.466
| am sorry...

00:01:24.842 --> 00:01:26.927
| feel no difference.

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:29.013
Eee...

00:01:29.138 --> 00:01:30.180
How was it?

00:01:30.472 --> 00:01:33.851
Hmm... I can't really get into it.

00:01:34.226 --> 00:01:36.228
It's gotta be that "ah" sound.

00:01:36.687 --> 00:01:38.814
Then how about "sahh"?

00:01:39.148 --> 00:01:40.274
"Sahh"?

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.152
Doesn't feel right either...

00:01:43.193 --> 00:01:45.487
Oh, I know!
"Fahhh."

00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:47.406
Not bad, huh?

00:01:47.781 --> 00:01:49.074
"Fahhh."

00:01:49.158 --> 00:01:50.868
Yeah, not bad at all!

00:01:51.493 --> 00:01:53.162
"Fahhh..."

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:54.371
Master.

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.042
<i>Technically speaking,
that sound isn't "fan."</i>

00:01:59.418 --> 00:02:03.047
Truth be told, I am equipped with
a perfect pitch function.

00:02:04.548 --> 00:02:05.841
Really?

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.346
Yes. That "fah" sounded
a little off.

00:02:10.888 --> 00:02:12.181
If you want "fah" then,

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:14.475
| think "fahhh" is better.

00:02:14.683 --> 00:02:17.394
Yeah? Fahhh...
Like that?

00:02:17.561 --> 00:02:19.313
That "fah" was sharp, Master.

00:02:19.521 --> 00:02:21.106
Fahh?

00:02:21.273 --> 00:02:22.691
That would be "me."

00:02:22.733 --> 00:02:24.693
Okay then, "meeee."

00:02:24.943 --> 00:02:27.154
That's "me," Master.
That's the note for "me!"

00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:30.908
"Meeee..."

00:02:34.078 --> 00:02:37.247
You know, you can take off
without me.

00:02:42.044 --> 00:02:43.921
Wouldn't want you to get
a chill after your bath.

00:02:45.214 --> 00:02:47.257
But hey, don't lose that.

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:49.009
These are crazy times.

00:02:49.051 --> 00:02:51.261
Losing your keys will
only lead to trouble.

00:02:54.723 --> 00:02:57.393
That is how important the key is.

00:02:57.685 --> 00:02:59.770
Your stories are terrible.

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:03.941
No one gives a crap
about "fah"!

00:03:04.066 --> 00:03:06.777
Your "fah" is wrong.
It should be "fahhh."

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.782
In any case, the key is important
and I'd like it back.

00:03:12.157 --> 00:03:15.744
I'm sure you must have one
or two things important to you.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.999
My family is important to me.
I'd do anything for them.

00:03:21.583 --> 00:03:25.587
As I would do anything
for Master Saitama.

00:03:25.963 --> 00:03:27.047
Saitama?

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:28.507
Never heard of him.

00:03:28.674 --> 00:03:30.968
Master Saitama has given me
a job to do.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.887
Is that right? A job, huh?

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:36.640
Let's hear more about this "job."

00:03:37.307 --> 00:03:39.393
So you decided to wait, after all?

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.270
It's so cold, too...

00:03:42.646 --> 00:03:43.939
Are you okay, Master?

00:03:45.023 --> 00:03:46.442
It's freezing.

00:03:46.775 --> 00:03:48.277
The chill's getting to me.

00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:51.822
Did you just look at my head?

00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:53.282
No, I never do that.

00:03:53.323 --> 00:03:54.324
Hey!

00:03:56.702 --> 00:03:58.662
A hot pot? Sounds good!

00:03:58.787 --> 00:03:59.997
Really warms you up.

00:04:00.122 --> 00:04:01.957
It appears the ingredients
are on sale.

00:04:03.167 --> 00:04:04.501
Dinner target acquired.

00:04:05.461 --> 00:04:07.004
What kind should we have?

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:10.966
There's Yosenabe, /shikarinabe,
Tori no Mizutaki...

00:04:12.217 --> 00:04:13.343
Crap!

00:04:14.011 --> 00:04:14.887
What's wrong?

00:04:15.596 --> 00:04:18.140
Not this one, not this...

00:04:18.932 --> 00:04:19.933
Here it is!

00:04:21.351 --> 00:04:24.646
Premium chicken sale...
for a limited time?!

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.190
| totally forgot!

00:04:26.315 --> 00:04:28.692
Master, this store's sale
is still going.

00:04:28.817 --> 00:04:29.818
What?

00:04:29.943 --> 00:04:32.446
Hmm... We can just make it.

00:04:32.821 --> 00:04:34.907
Oh! But at this store
the cabbage is—

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.035
Master, if we split up,
we can do it.

00:04:38.285 --> 00:04:40.788
So when you said "a job,"

00:04:40.829 --> 00:04:44.541
you actually meant
"running errands"?

00:04:44.958 --> 00:04:48.128
Like I said before,
| am in the middle of shopping.

00:04:49.213 --> 00:04:52.090
Now I have told you about the errand
| am on for my master.

00:04:52.132 --> 00:04:53.550
I've had enough of your—

00:04:53.592 --> 00:04:55.302
And that is where
| met this man.

00:04:57.387 --> 00:04:59.473
Master asked me to go to...

00:04:59.973 --> 00:05:01.016
two supermarkets.

00:05:04.269 --> 00:05:05.395
There it is.

00:05:09.525 --> 00:05:12.069
An alert from a shopping district
five kilometers away.

00:05:12.778 --> 00:05:14.655
It is four kilometers to the store.

00:05:14.947 --> 00:05:16.782
The disturbance is
in the wrong direction,

00:05:16.824 --> 00:05:18.450
but only six klicks separate them.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:19.993
If I end the trouble quickly,

00:05:20.118 --> 00:05:20.828
| will make it!

00:05:22.204 --> 00:05:23.580
| see.

00:05:23.872 --> 00:05:26.750
And that's when you bumped into us.

00:05:27.292 --> 00:05:28.627
Not quite.

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:29.253
What?

00:05:33.131 --> 00:05:35.217
I'm done for...

00:05:39.429 --> 00:05:41.515
| am only two seconds late.

00:05:42.224 --> 00:05:43.767
Please make an exception.

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:45.769
| understand, but—

00:05:45.811 --> 00:05:47.604
You still have the merchandise!

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:51.108
But a limited time sale
is just that: limited...

00:05:52.276 --> 00:05:53.986
The attitude of that clerk!

00:05:54.736 --> 00:05:57.781
Have you any idea how
| felt at that moment?

00:05:57.865 --> 00:06:01.201
What the hell are you talking about?

00:06:01.994 --> 00:06:06.373
What I want to hear is how you
and this idiot know each other!

00:06:06.665 --> 00:06:09.835
Cut to the chase and tell me
what you have to do with him,

00:06:09.877 --> 00:06:12.754
the number two guy
in the Typhoon Family!

00:06:12.754 --> 00:06:13.630
Be patient.

00:06:14.256 --> 00:06:16.758
There is an order to things.

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:20.012
| missed the limited time sale
at the first market.

00:06:20.262 --> 00:06:22.514
So I went on to the second market.

00:06:23.098 --> 00:06:25.934
And that's where I ran
into you guys.

00:06:28.854 --> 00:06:31.106
NOTICE: SHOP CLOSING DOWN.
THANKS FOR YOUR LOYALTY.

00:06:35.986 --> 00:06:38.614
Hey, why is this place closed?

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.911
There is supposed to be
a sale here today.

00:06:46.121 --> 00:06:47.372
They skipped out.

00:06:47.414 --> 00:06:49.291
I'm sure Don Pacino's behind it.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.669
He recently drifted into
this area

00:06:52.711 --> 00:06:55.088
and has been poking his nose
into our business.

00:06:55.672 --> 00:06:58.008
He must've demanded
a huge sum of protection money

00:06:58.008 --> 00:06:59.509
and forced them to leave.

00:06:59.968 --> 00:07:01.803
Protection money?
What is that?

00:07:03.972 --> 00:07:04.848
Hey!

00:07:05.057 --> 00:07:05.849
What is wrong?!

00:07:07.351 --> 00:07:08.477
This here is...

00:07:08.977 --> 00:07:10.354
Don Pacino.

00:07:10.938 --> 00:07:13.899
That's a nasty look you got
in your eyes.

00:07:17.736 --> 00:07:18.654
Hey!

00:07:21.198 --> 00:07:22.366
Hold on!

00:07:22.824 --> 00:07:25.160
| can't just give this back to you.

00:07:25.744 --> 00:07:28.121
Are you with him?

00:07:29.331 --> 00:07:32.167
Come on,
| wanna word with you.

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:36.088
So...you're telling me that
there's no connection

00:07:36.129 --> 00:07:38.382
between you and him?

00:07:38.674 --> 00:07:39.424
That is right.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.886
There is zero connection
between us.

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:45.055
In other words, we are strangers.

00:07:45.472 --> 00:07:50.185
You mean you've been
running your mouth all this time

00:07:50.185 --> 00:07:52.104
just to tell me that?!

00:07:52.187 --> 00:07:53.355
Well, you asked.

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:55.482
And now that I have
told you everything,

00:07:55.607 --> 00:07:57.901
give me back the key
as you promised.

00:07:57.943 --> 00:07:59.361
You wise-ass!

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.322
Don't you know
who you're dealing with?

00:08:02.364 --> 00:08:05.492
We're the Pacino Family,
with a Class C bounty on our heads!

00:08:07.411 --> 00:08:08.745
Is that how it is?

00:08:09.371 --> 00:08:11.456
| thought something was off.

00:08:11.581 --> 00:08:12.582
Huh?

00:08:13.083 --> 00:08:16.336
| assumed you were going
to do the right thing

00:08:16.378 --> 00:08:18.380
and report the lost key
to the police first,

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:22.968
then return it to me,
the rightful owner.

00:08:24.219 --> 00:08:25.929
But you are all wanted men.

00:08:26.513 --> 00:08:28.306
You would never do
anything so honest.

00:08:30.475 --> 00:08:31.685
In other words,

00:08:31.727 --> 00:08:34.813
you had no intention of
returning it in the first place.

00:08:35.063 --> 00:08:38.400
You fool, how stupid
can someone be?

00:08:39.026 --> 00:08:41.945
| cannot go after
law-abiding citizens,

00:08:42.654 --> 00:08:44.322
but with you,

00:08:44.698 --> 00:08:46.783
| do not have
to hold anything back.

00:08:47.743 --> 00:08:49.286
Take him down, boys!

00:08:55.667 --> 00:08:57.169
Do not move.

00:09:16.605 --> 00:09:20.317
And that is how I was able
to get the key back.

00:09:20.942 --> 00:09:22.402
But I missed the sale.

00:09:22.819 --> 00:09:23.695
Well...

00:09:24.071 --> 00:09:26.698
| had a spare key
so I was okay.

00:09:27.282 --> 00:09:30.327
It sure sounds like
you had a lot to deal with.

00:09:30.786 --> 00:09:35.290
Master, I am still too incompetent
to even run your errands!

00:09:35.957 --> 00:09:37.501
No big deal.

00:09:37.709 --> 00:09:40.629
We'll just have
a tofu hot pot tonight.

00:09:40.921 --> 00:09:42.380
This will not make up for it...

00:09:42.798 --> 00:09:43.590
Huh?

00:09:43.924 --> 00:09:46.093
...but I went by another store
on the way home.

00:09:46.468 --> 00:09:47.177
Huh?

00:09:47.844 --> 00:09:51.014
But this is
the super-expensive meat!

00:09:55.936 --> 00:09:57.646
Good thing we had eggs.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.565
Let's dig in. I love sukiyaki.

00:10:01.566 --> 00:10:02.359
Okay!

00:10:09.157 --> 00:10:10.242
(Ah, that's the way)

00:10:12.994 --> 00:10:14.037
(Ah, let's go)

00:10:19.459 --> 00:10:21.962
(Ah, that's the way,
that's the way)

00:10:22.003 --> 00:10:26.049
"I am Genos, a cyborg
fighting for justice alone!

00:10:26.633 --> 00:10:29.302
Object approaching at high speed—
It's here!”

00:10:29.344 --> 00:10:33.390
To avenge the killing of my family

00:10:33.431 --> 00:10:37.352
<i>This body was given to me
by Doctor Kuseno.</i>

00:10:37.394 --> 00:10:40.772
<i>Now is the time to rid the world
of all bad guys</i>

00:10:40.856 --> 00:10:45.110
With my passionate fire.

00:10:45.193 --> 00:10:48.738
