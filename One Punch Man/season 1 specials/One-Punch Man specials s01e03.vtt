WEBVTT

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.613
Everything okay?

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.949
| heard you moaning.

00:00:25.908 --> 00:00:28.702
Yeah, I had another nightmare.

00:00:29.453 --> 00:00:33.374
What manner of monster
is this Saitama?

00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:37.628
You kept repeating "Saitama, Saitama"
in your sleep.

00:00:39.171 --> 00:00:43.717
THE OVERLY-COMPLICATED NINJA

00:00:48.597 --> 00:00:50.808
Nothing like this
has happened before.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.769
Losing a fight is one thing,
but for some reason,

00:00:53.811 --> 00:00:55.938
I no longer "feel the wind."”

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.940
This is unprecedented.

00:00:59.108 --> 00:01:00.526
<i>It was just one fight.</i>

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.862
<i>And it was just bad luck
that caused me to lose.</i>

00:01:03.904 --> 00:01:06.865
<i>There should be no difference
in ability between us.</i>

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.411
So...why?

00:01:34.393 --> 00:01:36.186
<i>No matter what strategy I use...</i>

00:01:36.228 --> 00:01:38.606
I can't picture myself winning/

00:01:43.235 --> 00:01:44.445
Why...?

00:01:46.155 --> 00:01:47.448
Well that's how it is.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.868
That's how psychological trauma works.

00:01:51.535 --> 00:01:53.454
You've been so good to me, Hunter.

00:01:53.787 --> 00:01:55.164
Don't mention it.

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:57.124
We're birds of a feather.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.044
My work puts my life at risk, too.

00:02:00.336 --> 00:02:02.171
Up in the mountains,

00:02:02.212 --> 00:02:05.215
sometimes I come across
horrible monsters on my hunts.

00:02:06.425 --> 00:02:08.218
Just like you...

00:02:09.178 --> 00:02:12.056
I've got an enemy of
my own to defeat.

00:02:12.848 --> 00:02:14.308
Is he tough?

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:18.604
Yeah, he's the master
of this mountain.

00:02:31.867 --> 00:02:34.578
He's the one who gave me
these scars.

00:02:35.245 --> 00:02:36.288
A bear?

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:40.334
Fortunately, my life was spared
when I ran straight towards a cliff,

00:02:40.376 --> 00:02:41.960
but only because I fell off.

00:02:42.002 --> 00:02:44.922
It hurt like hell.

00:02:45.381 --> 00:02:47.675
Ever since,

00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:51.261
the hand I hold my gun
with trembles...

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.805
...from fear.

00:02:53.597 --> 00:02:56.725
What if my gun fails me again
like it did that time?

00:02:57.393 --> 00:03:02.606
The thought makes my hand shake
and I can't get off a good shot.

00:03:02.731 --> 00:03:04.400
But if I can defeat him,

00:03:04.441 --> 00:03:06.944
I'm sure my hand will tremble no more.

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.072
If you want to overcome
your own fear,

00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:12.616
the only way to do it
is to defeat your enemy.

00:03:13.784 --> 00:03:14.785
Where'd he go?

00:03:19.957 --> 00:03:23.210
Who says I'm afraid of him?

00:03:23.961 --> 00:03:26.296
Ludicrous!
There's no way...

00:03:41.103 --> 00:03:42.604
Sure, why not?

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:45.566
It'll be good training.

00:03:55.117 --> 00:03:56.160
Damn it!

00:03:58.787 --> 00:04:00.038
Wind Blade Kick!

00:04:09.006 --> 00:04:11.341
| see. So that's how it is.

00:04:12.342 --> 00:04:14.386
I'll admit it, Saitama...

00:04:14.595 --> 00:04:17.431
| was afraid.

00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:29.860
| owe you one, little boar.

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:34.323
Thanks to you,
I might get my strength back.

00:04:36.116 --> 00:04:37.910
What a treat tonight!

00:04:38.494 --> 00:04:40.871
Snake meat isn't all
that bad, you know.

00:04:48.003 --> 00:04:49.463
Looks like this uribo

00:04:49.922 --> 00:04:52.174
has taken a liking to you.

00:04:52.216 --> 00:04:53.217
Uribo?

00:04:53.842 --> 00:04:56.970
Yeah, boars found in the wild
rarely take to humans—

00:04:57.012 --> 00:04:58.639
Why'd you call him "uribo"?

00:04:58.931 --> 00:04:59.765
Huh?

00:05:01.266 --> 00:05:02.851
No reason.

00:05:03.268 --> 00:05:04.937
That's the word
for wild boar piglets.

00:05:04.978 --> 00:05:06.772
Isn't that normal?

00:05:06.855 --> 00:05:09.233
He'll have a name,
and I'll decide it.

00:05:09.441 --> 00:05:10.734
O-Okay.

00:05:13.821 --> 00:05:14.613
"Ino."

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.740
From /inoshishi,
the word for wild boar.

00:05:17.407 --> 00:05:18.408
How's that?

00:05:18.867 --> 00:05:21.203
"How's that?" Well...

00:05:21.578 --> 00:05:24.414
Sounds pretty normal, but...

00:05:24.581 --> 00:05:25.749
then again...

00:05:27.334 --> 00:05:31.880
<i>From that day on, I devoted my days
to training for Saitama's defeat.</i>

00:05:46.562 --> 00:05:51.525
And, by the time [ finished,
I'd come to a conclusion.

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:58.699
[ Decided I would not
run away from fear,

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.368
but would admit that I feared.

00:06:05.664 --> 00:06:08.000
<i>By doing so,
it becomes possible to</i>

00:06:08.041 --> 00:06:10.502
prevail over and control fear.

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.131
And if I can do that ..

00:06:23.098 --> 00:06:25.142
Wind Blade Kick!

00:06:42.784 --> 00:06:43.744
Moving on?

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:46.788
Yeah, thanks for everything, Hunter.

00:06:47.247 --> 00:06:49.166
Call me Frank.

00:06:49.416 --> 00:06:50.876
Frank Hunter, huh?

00:06:51.126 --> 00:06:52.252
Good name.

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:53.170
Huh?

00:06:53.295 --> 00:06:55.839
It's a fine name for a man who hunts.

00:06:56.089 --> 00:06:57.090
| won't forget it.

00:06:57.132 --> 00:07:00.010
No, I'm no Hunter...

00:07:00.761 --> 00:07:02.763
You're not a hunter?

00:07:03.263 --> 00:07:05.641
Well yeah, I am a hunter,

00:07:05.682 --> 00:07:07.017
but that's not my name...

00:07:07.225 --> 00:07:10.520
It's, you know, my job.
Let's see...

00:07:10.562 --> 00:07:14.274
maybe you'd understand it better
if I say it's more like "Hunter Frank."

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:15.692
Ah, I get it.

00:07:16.151 --> 00:07:20.113
So "Hunter" is the same
as "Speed-0'-Sound" in my name.

00:07:20.656 --> 00:07:21.615
So,

00:07:21.657 --> 00:07:23.200
you plan to stay here?

00:07:23.659 --> 00:07:24.868
Yeah.

00:07:26.453 --> 00:07:27.579
| see.

00:07:34.336 --> 00:07:35.671
Listen, Hunter.

00:07:36.505 --> 00:07:37.381
Yeah?

00:07:37.714 --> 00:07:40.217
If you're defeated even
before you fight,

00:07:40.258 --> 00:07:42.719
the results will be the same
no matter how often you try.

00:07:50.686 --> 00:07:54.106
Any idea what he meant, Ino?

00:07:55.357 --> 00:07:58.318
Ino? What's wrong? You miss him?

00:08:00.028 --> 00:08:04.491
I'm sure he'll be back
when he loses...again.

00:08:14.376 --> 00:08:15.919
Just as I thought...

00:08:16.586 --> 00:08:17.796
It is you.

00:08:17.838 --> 00:08:20.674
Here's some payback for my scars.

00:08:44.531 --> 00:08:45.824
Listen, Hunter.

00:08:46.241 --> 00:08:48.201
If you're defeated even
before you fight,

00:08:48.243 --> 00:08:50.871
the results will be the same
no matter how often you try.

00:08:50.912 --> 00:08:53.665
/get it. That's what he meant.

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:56.543
Sonic, what you were saying is...

00:08:56.752 --> 00:08:58.295
| win!

00:09:07.721 --> 00:09:09.347
Run, Ino...

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.189
Oh. A bear.

00:09:19.149 --> 00:09:21.985
Well, bear's not bad but...

00:09:22.444 --> 00:09:24.154
| could go for wild boar too...

00:09:29.785 --> 00:09:30.786
Hey...

00:09:33.997 --> 00:09:35.999
Whatever. Bear will do.

00:09:44.508 --> 00:09:47.052
So this is a bear hot pot, Master?

00:09:47.427 --> 00:09:48.178
Yeah.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:50.013
You heard those rumors about

00:09:50.055 --> 00:09:52.140
the giant bear causing
all that damage, right?

00:09:52.974 --> 00:09:54.726
You can eat bear?

00:09:54.851 --> 00:09:57.687
Yeah, you can eat most animals.

00:09:57.854 --> 00:09:58.855
| see!

00:09:59.106 --> 00:10:02.359
Oh, and I hear
wild boar's pretty good, too.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.069
| learn so much from you, Master!
