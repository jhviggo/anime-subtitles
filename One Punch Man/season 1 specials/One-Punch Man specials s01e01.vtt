WEBVTT

00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:05.137
THE SHADOW THAT
SNUCK UP TOO CLOSE

00:00:08.057 --> 00:00:11.685
Could she have checked
my call history without asking ?!

00:00:11.727 --> 00:00:15.147
Dammit. We've lost
the alien's location.

00:00:17.858 --> 00:00:20.903
There it is, standing in front
of the spacecraft!

00:00:20.945 --> 00:00:22.321
This is trouble!

00:00:22.363 --> 00:00:25.032
Your mom got
a call from someone

00:00:25.074 --> 00:00:27.284
saying she was your fiancée!

00:00:27.451 --> 00:00:28.953
No, it can't be!

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.829
And the alien's been taken out.

00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:32.831
<i>She contacted me too!</i>

00:00:32.998 --> 00:00:34.708
"Everyone in my way
has been eliminated.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.627
<i>| can't wait for
our date tomorrow."</i>

00:00:36.752 --> 00:00:38.462
<i>I never agreed to any dates!</i>

00:00:38.546 --> 00:00:40.673
The woman's more dangerous
than the aliens!

00:00:48.764 --> 00:00:52.142
Man... Stalkers really are scary.

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:56.480
SOY SAUCE

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.898
<i>SOY SAUCE
Come to think of it,</i>

00:00:57.898 --> 00:00:58.190
<i>Come to think of it,</i>

00:00:58.607 --> 00:01:02.069
lately I've been feeling
eyes on me, foo.

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:11.662
<i>I've defeated a lot of
bad guys in the past.</i>

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:15.874
<i>Maybe someone's got
a grudge against me.</i>

00:01:16.625 --> 00:01:20.170
<i>It's no big deal if it's just
someone with a grudge.</i>

00:01:20.921 --> 00:01:24.258
But if that grudge or anger

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.304
<i>turned into some kind of
warped love, like that movie,</i>

00:01:28.887 --> 00:01:32.266
how should I handle it?

00:01:38.522 --> 00:01:40.774
This place is
getting pretty messy.

00:01:44.862 --> 00:01:46.405
It has beer three days

00:01:46.447 --> 00:01:50.534
<i>since I started investigating the secret
of Master Saitama's power.</i>

00:01:51.493 --> 00:01:53.412
<i>I have yet to
gain any information</i>

00:01:53.704 --> 00:01:55.331
and time is ticking away...

00:01:56.915 --> 00:01:59.960
Is he purposely being cautious
so no one can find out?

00:02:02.087 --> 00:02:05.549
| hope I come up
with something soon.

00:02:20.814 --> 00:02:22.691
As / suspected,
he is on guard.

00:02:23.484 --> 00:02:24.485
! must hurry.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.623
Investigation: Day 4.

00:02:38.165 --> 00:02:40.292
<i>He is eating out for the first time.</i>

00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:42.044
I see.

00:02:42.461 --> 00:02:45.255
Perhaps the secret of
his power lies in his food.

00:02:50.511 --> 00:02:52.763
Right now we have
specials on steak.

00:02:53.138 --> 00:02:55.099
They're all very good!

00:03:02.272 --> 00:03:05.109
Uh... I guess...just give me...

00:03:05.901 --> 00:03:07.361
whatever's cheapest.

00:03:07.778 --> 00:03:09.279
The 150 gram steak?

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:10.781
Uh, no...

00:03:13.367 --> 00:03:14.076
This.

00:03:14.535 --> 00:03:16.537
One side order of French fries.

00:03:22.042 --> 00:03:23.502
Oh, that's all.

00:03:30.926 --> 00:03:32.970
Looks like it's time for a job again.

00:03:33.554 --> 00:03:34.722
Damn it.

00:03:40.102 --> 00:03:41.311
Enjoy.

00:03:45.107 --> 00:03:46.984
Seriously?
The portion's so small.

00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:49.153
This is ¥3007?

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.407
Plus there's only one long,
soft one like I like.

00:03:54.074 --> 00:03:56.535
The rest are all
short and crispy.

00:03:56.994 --> 00:03:59.747
It sure isn't my day today...

00:04:05.627 --> 00:04:06.503
ls that it?

00:04:28.442 --> 00:04:29.067
Huh?

00:04:29.943 --> 00:04:31.695
The nice long one is...

00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:34.615
...gone!

00:04:36.825 --> 00:04:37.534
Excuse me.

00:04:37.576 --> 00:04:38.410
Yes?

00:04:38.452 --> 00:04:39.453
I'm missing...

00:04:39.495 --> 00:04:40.871
a fry.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.581
Huh?

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.375
Yeah, my fries.

00:04:45.876 --> 00:04:47.211
The long one...

00:04:47.503 --> 00:04:51.298
There was one that
was on the longer side,

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.175
and while I was
in the bathroom...

00:04:53.217 --> 00:04:54.343
Uh...

00:04:55.886 --> 00:04:57.471
You didn't eat it, did you?

00:04:57.763 --> 00:04:58.388
What?

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.474
| mean, did anyone eat it?

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.936
Would you like me
to call the manager?

00:05:04.645 --> 00:05:06.897
Oh, no...it's okay.

00:05:08.148 --> 00:05:09.316
Don't worry about it.

00:05:14.404 --> 00:05:17.032
<i>He makes a special trip
to a chain restaurant</i>

00:05:17.491 --> 00:05:19.827
and orders only French fries.

00:05:20.577 --> 00:05:24.164
No normal person would dream
of such behavior.

00:05:24.915 --> 00:05:26.041
And in that case...

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.751
JThere ls...

00:05:27.793 --> 00:05:30.128
a strong possibility
that this is a special foodstuff

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.756
<i>and that it holds the key
to Master Saitama's power.</i>

00:05:34.091 --> 00:05:35.592
Ifs appearance seems normal.

00:05:35.801 --> 00:05:38.262
Could there be a secret ingredient?

00:05:38.595 --> 00:05:39.596
No...

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.560
No matter how I look at it,
all I see is a regular French fry.

00:05:45.811 --> 00:05:48.438
Perhaps there is no secret
to his diet?

00:05:50.274 --> 00:05:53.569
| will send the data and
have it analyzed.

00:05:55.571 --> 00:05:57.865
Who the hell ate my fry?!

00:05:59.074 --> 00:06:02.870
And did it have to be the only long one?!

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:04.121
Wait...

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.623
Don't tell me I really do have...

00:06:06.665 --> 00:06:07.875
a stalker?

00:06:13.922 --> 00:06:15.048
Thieving bastard!

00:06:15.382 --> 00:06:17.593
I'm so gonna kick your ass!

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.680
<i>I'll hide right here
until he comes past.</i>

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:24.558
The area around here is deserted,

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.101
so / should be
the only one around.

00:06:26.226 --> 00:06:27.227
In other words,

00:06:27.269 --> 00:06:30.480
if someone shows up
at my house,

00:06:30.772 --> 00:06:32.858
that person has got to be my stalker—

00:06:33.066 --> 00:06:35.152
No, my French fry thief

00:06:35.193 --> 00:06:36.236
for sure!

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:42.534
No one's coming.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.914
Master, what are you up to?

00:06:48.373 --> 00:06:50.500
The same position
for two hours now.

00:06:51.627 --> 00:06:54.212
ls he engaging in some kind
of visualization exercise?

00:06:57.549 --> 00:06:58.592
Is the analysis complete?

00:06:59.051 --> 00:07:00.427
Thank you, Doctor.

00:07:00.886 --> 00:07:02.512
I'll head back now.

00:07:07.559 --> 00:07:08.352
Dang it.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.604
No one came.

00:07:16.944 --> 00:07:17.861
What's going on?

00:07:25.035 --> 00:07:26.870
My face...!

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:31.375
I'll make you all dry as dead leaves!

00:07:34.962 --> 00:07:35.921
Better be careful.

00:07:36.838 --> 00:07:38.215
It's been a bad day

00:07:38.548 --> 00:07:39.883
and I'm in a bad mood.

00:07:41.385 --> 00:07:42.302
That head...

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:44.471
| finally meet it again!

00:07:44.513 --> 00:07:45.389
Huh?

00:07:45.472 --> 00:07:47.557
You don't remember me?

00:07:48.892 --> 00:07:51.520
Six months ago, you beat me
with a single punch.

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:56.066
| am Men's Esthetician Man,
the wanted Class B criminal!

00:07:57.234 --> 00:07:59.152
The shock of being defeated by you

00:07:59.194 --> 00:08:01.321
made my luscious skin
completely dry out!

00:08:01.363 --> 00:08:04.616
Ever since, I have kept to a strict training
and moisturizing regimen,

00:08:04.658 --> 00:08:07.494
all the while searching for you!

00:08:08.704 --> 00:08:09.746
So you're—

00:08:09.788 --> 00:08:10.747
That's right,

00:08:10.789 --> 00:08:12.082
you remember now?

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.876
As I wandered about looking
for you,

00:08:14.918 --> 00:08:18.630
| turned into a much
more powerful monster!

00:08:18.964 --> 00:08:20.257
So that's what happened.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.134
| knew that

00:08:22.175 --> 00:08:24.845
if I kept causing
random incidents

00:08:24.886 --> 00:08:26.805
you'd turn up again.

00:08:26.972 --> 00:08:28.724
Everything adds up now.

00:08:29.224 --> 00:08:30.475
It was you.

00:08:31.768 --> 00:08:35.647
| doubt you can keep up
with this smoother, softer me!

00:08:35.939 --> 00:08:38.608
| don't remember you at all.

00:08:40.152 --> 00:08:41.903
But it was you, wasn't it?

00:08:42.904 --> 00:08:44.823
You're the one who stole
my French fry.

00:08:44.865 --> 00:08:46.283
You're the stalker!

00:08:52.914 --> 00:08:54.541

He has a normal diet.

00:09:16.688 --> 00:09:18.565

<i>| have not discovered

00:09:22.444 --> 00:09:26.114
Could Master be a cyborg like me?

00:09:28.784 --> 00:09:31.787
There is only one thing left I can do.

00:09:33.789 --> 00:09:37.584
| don't care how many times

00:09:38.126 --> 00:09:40.045

Don't you ever go around
stealing people's French fries again!

00:09:45.967 --> 00:09:48.345
If you're gonna come at me,
come at me straight.

00:09:53.433 --> 00:09:56.394

<i>That is my fate.

<i>I just need to change how I think.</i>

<i>Right! I need to think positively.</i>

noticed what I've been doing...
