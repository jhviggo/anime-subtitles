00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.730
You've lost contact with Metal Bat?

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.190
Yes. I've already contacted every 
hero higher than Class A for backup.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.740
The giant monstrous insect Centichoro...

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.530
Threat level: Dragon.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.160
It's basically a full-scale disaster.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.940
This is nothing like two years ago.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.750
I'm not sure we can defeat it, 
despite our numbers.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.760
Apparently, King is already 
fighting something.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.500
What are the other Class S heroes doing?

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.210
Urgent messages from the branch offices?

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.050
Th-This is...

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.010
Damn it! We're cornered.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.470
At this rate... we're finished.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.630
Wait!

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.150
<b>Class S Rank 6
Metal Knight</b>

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.210
It's the Class S hero, Metal Knight!

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.240
We're saved!

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:57.980
You're in the way!

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.460
Weapons tests aren't for show.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.860
Leave at once.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.370
S-Sorry!

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.000
It's unharmed... For a living 
organism, it's extremely tough.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.570
Annoying fly!

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.510
Did the centipede thing stop chasing us?

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.320
Yeah. I think we might 
just make it out of here.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.470
I hope Metal Bat is okay.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.510
<b>Smash</b>

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.450
You're not getting away, pro heroes.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.100
Leave that family behind.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.140
Monsters?!

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.980
<i>Interesting. It's been reported that 
Metal Bat is facing off with Centichoro,</i>

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.110
<i>so where is he now?</i>

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.760
Unbelievable.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.600
Monsters whose threat levels are Demon 
and above have randomly appeared

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.580
in multiple locations.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.940
We can't keep up with them.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.040
<b>Martial Arts Tournament</b>

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.260
As I figured, you're already pretty beat-up.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.700
I wanted to see just how strong you are,

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.230
but I don't think that's 
going to happen right now.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.730
Don't underestimate me!

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.870
You've lost so much blood. 
You'll probably pass out at any second.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.270
Not to mention you've 
got multiple fractures.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.540
What's keeping you upright? 
Your pride as a hero?

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.970
<i>His swings are even faster now.</i>

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.820
<i>They're also more powerful.</i>

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.770
<i>Don't tell me he's...</i>

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.860
<i>No, there's no doubt about it.</i>

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.870
<i>The more damage he takes, 
the more his physical abilities improve.</i>

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.200
What's the principle behind your strength?

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.960
Who the hell cares about principles?

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.710
I'm just pumped up.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.380
<i>The hell?</i>

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.460
Just come at me already, hero hunter.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.100
I've still got a giant centipede to 
deal with after I'm through with you!

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.930
<i>He's still...</i>

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.800
Let's see how long you can stay pumped up.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.520
I'll play with you for a bit.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.740
I'm over here!

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.570
Dumbass!

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.780
I can't forgive muggers or hero hunters.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.040
You're rotten to the core, 
and I'll beat that right out of you!

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.580
You ain't gonna hit me, dumbass!

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.920
Are you just going to keep swinging 
that thing around until you die?

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.900
Until I die?

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.250
I'm not that nice.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.700
I'll swing it until I win!

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.650
Killer Move... Pumped-Up Brutal Tornado!

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.190
<b>Brutal Tornado</b>

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.060
Huh? You're just spinning around in circles!

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.230
Don't make me laugh!

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.280
Unfortunately for you, I can deflect 
every one of your amateurish blows.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:04.760
He finally went down.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.720
<i>Tank-Top Master and Metal Bat 
are both just musclebrains.</i>

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.320
<i>They lack hand-to-hand martial arts skills.</i>

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.930
<i>Crushing the Hero Association 
might be easier than I thought.</i>

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:19.600
<i>You've got to be kidding me.</i>

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.070
<i>Did his attacks pack more 
of a punch than I thought?</i>

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.370
I might've been in trouble if he'd 
managed to land one on me.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.240
Big Brother!

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.100
Big Brother Bat.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.440
What are you doing?

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.540
Who is that?

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:43.690
His little sister?

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.420
Zenko, stay back!

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.630
Big Brother!

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.220
You missed the perfect opportunity.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.470
This time, I'll finish you off for good!

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:54.800
You can't!

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.850
Big Brother promised me that he'd 
never expose me to violence!

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:00.140
So no more fighting!

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:02.290
Huh?

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:03.860
The fight's over!

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:08.150
And why the hell should I have 
to follow your family rules?

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:10.950
No more!

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.750
Oh, yeah. I just remembered 
I had something else to do.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.710
I don't have time to waste on you fools.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.670
You're the one who attacked me!

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.630
Guess you get to live a 
little longer, Metal Bat.

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:29.580
What?!

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:32.150
Big Brother! Let's hurry up and go home!

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.630
There's a giant monster, too.

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:37.060
Oh, right! That family's in danger.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:38.060
I have to hurry.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.720
Wait, you're joking, right?

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.120
Come on! Don't do this!

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.950
You're gonna die!

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.020
You go on home, Zenko.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.110
Ugh! You stubborn oaf!

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.520
Huh? Big Brother?

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.220
Hello?

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:00.450
So that's the hero hunter 
everyone's talking about.

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:04.170
Not bad for a human.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.170
He's a coward for not finishing him off.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:12.010
No, that guy may actually 
prove useful, Hedrojellyfish.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.940
Hey, that's Metal Bat's little sister.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.350
The more hostages, the better.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:23.560
Hey.

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:28.690
So you're the creepy gaze I was sensing.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.580
It's still alive?

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:32.900
Wait a second, hero hunter!

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:34.700
Two on one, eh?

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.680
We are not your enemies.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.540
I'm sure this will interest you.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.160
The Monster Association?

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.250
<i>He took the bait.</i>

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:48.490
Follow me. I'll take you to our lair.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.050
I'm not interested. Get lost.

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.430
I'll pretend I didn't see that.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.600
But we'll be meeting again.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:05.100
As long as you continue 
hunting heroes, that is.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.770
Just you wait!

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:13.110
Disgusting.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.110
Well, this is a disappointment.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:17.780
My Mohipunch...

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.320
My Pine-a-pow...

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.320
Pineapple gets five points.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:24.830
<b>Smash</b>

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.830
Mohican gets two. That's out 
of a hundred, by the way.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.830
You're unbelievably weak!

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:35.180
Do you know how much I've trained my horn 
and this body for the destined day?!

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.680
Well, do you?!

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.580
Rhino Wrestler, get the hostages!

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:40.680
We're heading back!

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.140
What the hell? We're not fighting Metal Knight?

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:48.440
Correct. That's just a 
remote-controlled robot.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:53.030
Besides, today is not the day. 
You're forbidden to act on your own.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:56.970
Okay, fine. Are we taking 
both of these guys?

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:59.070
No, just the kid is enough.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:00.310
D-Don't!

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.960
Damn it! Metal Bat asked 
us to watch over them!

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.040
We'll stop you, even if it kills us!

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.370
Okay, you can die, then!

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.470
How do you like that, Phoenix Man?

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:13.820
What do you think my threat level is now?

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:17.760
Who knows? Centichoro, 
we've fulfilled our objective.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:19.830
You can fall back!

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.810
You're burrowing? I think not!

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.040
I will not let go!

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:40.200
This is fine. Today is not not the day.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.160
Get him!

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:44.280
You've got this, Heavy Kong!

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.830
<i>Damn it... Backup's not coming.</i>

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:48.290
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.390
Are you a Class A hero?

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.880
How many of you do I have to 
kill to raise my threat level?

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.760
<i>Monsters my electricity doesn't affect?</i>

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:01.890
<i>This isn't my lucky day.</i>

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:04.680
Class A hero Lightning Genji...

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.850
You're actually very lucky.

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:10.730
The other cities are facing much worse.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.940
<i>What the heck is going on?</i>

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:22.410
<b>Charanko

We're supposed to make our 
entrance now, you moron!

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:26.270
Hurry it up, Charanko!

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:29.260
Okay, let's go.

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:34.130
Ladies and gentlemen! 
Thank you all for waiting!

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:36.500
The 22nd Super Fight!

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.340
Here are all of our entrants!

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:46.590
First up is the Class A Rank 19 
hero who's also known

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:49.420
as Lightning Max, entering for the first time!

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.430
Max from Hyper Karate!

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:53.060
I can only see myself winning.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:54.190
Our only lady entrant!

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.110
Her lightning-speed attacks 
could be considered art.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:58.900
Ring-Ring from Palm Bells Fist!

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.400
I want to fight already.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.030
Next is Benpats from 
Bad Roads Martial Arts.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:04.780
And now, one of our top four regulars!

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:08.370
His serpentine arms enclose his 
opponent and take them down!

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:12.230
The man ranked the lowest of the
Class A heroes, Snek from Snakebite Fist!

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:14.460
Did you have to mention 
the lowest rank part?

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:16.710
We still have many more!

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:20.090
Always electrifying, Boltane from 
Fist of Thunder and Lightning!

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:22.220
Bazuzu from Bazuzu's Nuclear Fist!

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:24.590
Gatling from Many Striking Fists!

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:27.970
The kindred spirit from Sunflower Dojo's 
Gentle Art of Self-Defense, Hamukichi!

Dave from Crushing Giant Method!

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.230
Rosie from Psychoanalytic Martial Art!

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.340
Mentai from Spice Fist!

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.360
Jakumen from Giga Pro Wrestling!

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.230
Choze from Combat Arts of the Chosen People!

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:43.410
A former student of the Fist of 
Flowing Water Crushing Rock,

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:45.820
Sourface from Sourface-Style Kempo!

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.780
I'm so nervous, I think I'm gonna puke...

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.640
This is his seventh consecutive entry!

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.910
Can this man who refuses to give 
up finally make it to the top?

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:55.150
Zakkos from Fist of Crazy 
Collision, Fierce Truth!

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:57.920
I'm going to get my first 
victory and propose!

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.170
Next up...

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:03.340
We have a man who asked that no one go for 
his head on the surveys we handed out.

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.620
Did he really come here to fight?

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.530
Charanko from Fist of 
Water Polo, Carbonation!

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.180
Why am I getting booed already?

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:13.960
Isn't that the Class S hero Genos?

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.520
Guess he likes martial arts, too.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.550
And now for the strongest 
man in Super Fight history,

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:20.620
our returning two-time champion!

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:23.490
His fights are always one-sided.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:27.150
But according to him, he hasn't even 
shown us all his strength yet.

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:29.970
Bakuzan from Art of the Darkness Hellkill!

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:33.120
There will finally be meaning 
in my victory today.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.770
And we have another unrivaled contender!

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:39.270
He's returning for the first
time in seven tournaments!

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:41.960
The young legend who managed 
to win four times in a row!

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.420
Suiryu from the Dark Body Art!

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:45.420
Yeah!

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.640
He spent the three years since 
he disappeared goofing off,

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.140
and apparently he's only after 
the prize money this time.

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:55.090
Is he so powerful because he 
doesn't crave fame or notoriety?

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:58.810
However, Bakuzan is also in this tournament.

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:00.550
<i>So that's Suiryu...</i>

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:04.230
<i>If I can kill him, I'll be the strongest 
man in the history of this tournament.</i>

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.490
<i>I can practically feel his 
boodlust piercing my back.</i>

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:12.120
<i>I actually wanted to fight the guy who 
won last year's tournament, though.</i>

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:16.520
Now entering
City Q

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:20.460
<i>I wanted to play with someone 
stronger if I could.</i>

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:24.840
Now that we've introduced our 18 
entrants, let the 22nd Super Fight

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.050
begin!

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:30.970
Deep breaths, deep breaths...

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:34.010
I'll be fine. I'll be fine. I'll be fine.

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:35.450
Hey, old guy, are you nervous?

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:36.470
Don't call me "old guy"!

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:38.940
I may be your senior, 
but I'm twenty, just like you!

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:40.860
<i>Wait, he's younger than me?</i>

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.190
Hey, you.

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:44.400
You entered under a style 
I'd never heard of.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.220
You must be an amateur.

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:47.910
Don't take martial arts lightly.

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:48.900
Forfeit now,

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.820
or I'll make you regret it.

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.400
Well, you heard him.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.700
He's talking to you!

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.640
You can't even tie your obi right.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.830
You still can't tie it correctly. Here.

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:07.220
Super Fight is a premier martial arts 
tournament. It's no place for amateurs.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.970
This guy's also a student of the 
Fist of Flowing Water, Crushing Rock.

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:14.420
What? Him? I see... Seems they'll accept 
just about anyone these days.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:15.310
What?

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:19.890
Bang was supposed to be one of 
the judges at this tournament,

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:23.120
but he caused a ruckus by canceling 
his appearance abruptly.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.270
Master Bang?

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:30.580
The man called the strongest man in martial 
arts got wrapped up in being a hero.

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.520
That's enough out of you!

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.650
And wait, why aren't you the one who's mad?!

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:35.080
Huh?

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:39.000
I already left the dojo, but you're 
the only student who stayed behind!

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.600
Oh, right. I mean, 
just let him say whatever.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.210
What?!

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:46.190
I didn't come here to argue.

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:49.850
If you're threatening to crush 
me, I'll look forward to it.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:52.430
You don't look very strong, though.

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:54.840
Wow, way to put him in his place, Charanko.

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.680
I'll beat you to a pulp.

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:03.560
I'm fine with tracking down Garo, 
but is he really going to show?

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:07.870
Wow, you're definitely annoyed.

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:14.110
The Class A hero we were tracking 
is being attacked by someone.

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:15.910
What? Let's go!

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:20.200
<b>Boxing</b>

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:21.830
I, the Boxing Demon, 
shall destroy this city!

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:23.980
Guess it wasn't Garo.

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:27.170
Stand back, Bomb.

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:30.570
Silverfang? Perfect timing!

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:33.630
We should team— Huh? Um...

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:35.390
You must be a Class S hero!

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:38.350
I know you! You're a famous martial artist!

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:41.440
When I was human, I also 
learned martial arts...

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.270
but fighting in competitions 
just wasn't enough!

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:49.440
That's right! I wanted to let loose with all 
the strength I have, so I turned into a mon—

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.610
D-Damn, he's strong...

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:01.910
Let's hurry, before he ends up like this.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.170
And now, let us begin round one!

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:07.170
<b>Round 1
Max vs Ring-Ring</b>

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:08.880
Max versus Ring-Ring!

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:09.590
Fight!

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.470
Ring-Ring makes the first move!

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:15.710
Heart Hard Hit!

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:21.010
She did all that with 
one stroke of her whip?

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:26.940
You're a fool for thinking you could 
actually take me, Super S, on!

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:30.570
You pitiful, foolish hero brats!

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:34.190
H-Heavy Kong has been...

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:38.730
So this is what a Class A is like? 
That was uneventful.

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:41.910
More importantly, 
make sure you spread the news

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:47.450
that the one who took down 
Heavy Kong was me, Martial Gorilla.

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.380
There's no end to this!

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:00.930
You're not getting away!

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:11.520
Th-They're the worst possible 
enemies I could've faced...

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:16.440
I see. Despite the fact that 
we're only threat level Tiger,

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.870
we can defeat a Class A hero 
based on his attributes.

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:23.170
I guess we didn't need to go 
sneaking around after all.

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:26.610
We got word that Heavy Kong 
was defeated in City W.

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:30.790
And we still haven't been able to get 
a hold of Metal Bat or Metal Knight.

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:33.000
The giant organism that appeared in City I

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.560
has grown even bigger and harder 
after consuming a large building.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.260
We can't let it run loose any longer!

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:41.880
Poison! The monster that appeared in 
City Y is using some kind of paralysis poison

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.390
to render the heroes there immobile!

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:46.990
It's no use. There are just too many of them.

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:50.440
At this rate, we're going to be wiped out!

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:53.320
It seems that we, as well as the humans,

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.440
miscalculated how powerful the other was.

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:59.750
We are stronger than we expected,

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:04.830
and the humans are unexpectedly weak.

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:07.950
Stop! Snap out of it!

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.710
Wh-What's wrong, Darkness Blade?!

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:13.200
Those who are lashed by my whip

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.570
become my love slaves as 
a result of the stimulation.

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:18.670
H-Hey, stop this!

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:22.840
Now, if you want my love, 
fight until you die!

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.600
Y-You're...

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:34.500
Oh? Even more suitors to become my slaves?

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.520
How titillating!

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:44.870
Wow... If that's all it takes to become a 
threat level Demon, today's my lucky day.

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:49.260
So if I defeat you, will that break 
your control over those men?

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:52.700
I can do something heroic <i>and</i> have them 
in my debt. Two birds with one stone.

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:54.960
It's the Blizzard Bunch!

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.550
You're not getting away.

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:01.510
Don't tickle my sadism too much.

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:03.850
I'm liable to get overstimulated and kill you.

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:08.890
Max KO'd Ring-Ring in no time!

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:12.980
Many were skeptical about just how 
strong he is as a martial artist,

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.550
so he had been placed in the reverse seed,

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:19.360
but he managed to win against a 
girl without a single scratch!

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.090
I wouldn't say without a single scratch...

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:25.580
I guess he was still able to fight, 
even without explosives in his shoes.

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:27.950
Hey, what the heck is a reverse seed?

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:30.620
The weaker someone looks or is rumored to be,

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:34.950
the harder they make it 
for them to win the tournament.

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:39.550
I see. So they thought he was weaker 
than most of the people here.

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:42.730
Those who switch from being 
a martial artist to a hero

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:46.520
are seen as having joined an easier occupation.

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:49.970
<b>Winner
Max</b>

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:47.480
What about Bang, then?

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.300
Master Bang is a different story.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.500
By the way, you also got the reverse seed.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.440
Huh? Oh, you're right.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:21:00.150
<b>Zakkos  Charanko  Bakuzan</b>

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:58.190
So it's not that the guys 
on each end are strong,

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:00.150
but they're just treating me like I'm weak?

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:02.900
No, those two were definitely strong.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:06.410
Bakuzan, the one I fight after you, 
is favored to win this tournament.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:09.480
So based on where you've been placed...

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.870
you must be weak, too.

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:15.900
Round two, Zakkos versus 
Charanko, is about to begin!

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.000
<i>I'm gonna kill you...</i>

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:52.800
Ch-Charanko's strong!

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:56.270
Did Zakkos's brain end up 
scrambled after that single slap?

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:59.890
Actually, I'm not sure 
if Charanko's strong...

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:03.410
He's weak! Zakkos is just 
so pathetically weak!

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:06.620
He apparently invited the person 
he'd planned to propose to here,

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:11.110
but now there's been a huge 
change in his life plans!

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:13.530
Whoops. I sorta feel bad.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.540
Oh, we just got some new information.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.540
<b>Breaking News</b>

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.170
Apparently, that person 
never came to the venue!

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:20.620
All clear! They didn't see him!

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.330
Oh, thank goodness.

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:25.840
There's nothing good about this...

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:28.270
<i>Things played out as they usually do.</i>

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:30.610
<i>This tournament is likely to end</i>

00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:33.860
<i>before Master has a chance to
truly experience martial arts.</i>

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.980
Zakkos had pretty good moves.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:44.180
Guess I know who I'm facing 
off with in the finals.

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:50.250
<b>The Uprising of the Monsters</b>
