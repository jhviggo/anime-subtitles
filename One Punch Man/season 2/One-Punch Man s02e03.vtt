00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.520
What's the matter?

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.310
You can't stand?

<b>Fist of Flowing Water, Crushed Rock</b>

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.670
Charanko, what have you been 
doing here the last six months?

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.910
Didn't I tell you that if you were 
going to become my student,

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.370
you needed to train like 
your life depended on it?

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.470
You won't be able to learn any techniques.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.620
You're not fit to be a martial artist.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.870
I am expelling you from 
this dojo as of today.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.790
Don't ever come back again.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.930
Bang is acting strange?

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.310
<b>The Hunt Begins</b>

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.810
He suddenly said we were going to do a 
lesson, then beat the crap out of me.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.520
I can't believe someone as kind 
as Master Bang would do this.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.640
There has to be a reason.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.030
I came here because I thought 
you guys might know something.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.490
I have no idea.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.660
Bang? You mean the Class S Silverfang?

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.530
Once you're done talking, 
let's continue our game.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.160
There seem to be more of you here now...

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.240
I can at least guess what's going on.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.170
I'm assuming that Garo is somehow involved.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.910
Garo?!

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.050
You mean the guy who was expelled 
from our dojo? Why him?

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.380
What? You haven't heard?

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.780
Bang's former disciple, Garo,

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.430
has been classified as an evil monster 
and is wanted by the Hero Association.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.560
Bang said he'd bring him down himself.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.850
Monster? Garo?

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.160
Apparently, there was an incident 
at the Hero Association HQ.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.280
The Association's trying to hide it,

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.900
but if there's an intense battle, 
bystanders are sure to get hurt.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.200
That's probably why Bang wanted 
to distance you from it all.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.830
<i>I see...</i>

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.160
<i>Master Bang, am I just holding you back?</i>

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.130
What do you think about Bang's 
actions, Master Saitama?

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.680
It's not like I'm that 
close with that old man.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.780
<i>Silverfang, huh? 
That's such a good hero name.</i>

<i>What the hell is "Bald Cape" 
even supposed to mean?</i>

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.600
There's one thing that's bothering me.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:32.800
Who are you?

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.250
Master, he's some small fry named Charanko. 
He's Bang's current number one student.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.610
We've met him before.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.750
Huh? Have we?

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.810
I can't keep holding him back forever.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.830
I need to take care of Garo for Master Bang.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.460
But I guess there's no way 
I'll find him that easily.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.920
Even if I happen to find Garo, I—

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.880
Hey, you.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.050

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.550

What do you mean by "hunt"? 
You don't seem like a fan of mine.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.440
Help me become a true monster.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.230

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.150
It sure is.

come for my dojo, as well.

Who was stronger, the fish monster or him?

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:30.030

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:17.020
Hey, kid.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.170
Looks like you're reading 
something interesting.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.970
This guy's the Class S hero, King.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:30.930
He's the strongest one of all.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:34.170
This is the Class A hero, Lightning Genji.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.990
He's always patrolling my neighborhood.

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:41.190
<b>Lightning
Genji</b>

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:38.430
Look! I even got his autograph!

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:40.940
His autograph, eh?

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.180
I'd love his autograph, too.

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:45.790
Could you introduce me sometime?

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:49.370
Sure! You must like heroes, too, old dude.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:54.830
<b>Hero
Guide</b>

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:55.090
That Hero Guide looks neat. 
Say, could I borrow that, just for a week?

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:57.790
What? No way. Get your own.

00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:00.960
Jeez, you're so stingy.

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.890
Hey, what the heck? 
They even have monsters in here!

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:09.250
Isn't that exciting?

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:13.670
What? Why are you excited about the 
monster pages? They're super scary.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:18.130
It's better that they're scary. 
Don't you think they're cooler that way?

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:21.130
Really? You have weird taste, old dude.

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:25.000
I'm so envious. 
I'd love to be in this book, too.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.970
You want to be a hero?

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:30.610
I do, too... but I have no athletic talent.

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:32.490
Well, good for you.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.910
Your personality sucks, old dude.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:38.260
Well, then... Time to go patrolling.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:39.670
I'm heading off.

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.580
According to the guide,

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.710
this is around the time when the Class A 
hero, Golden Ball, visits his favorite bar.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:47.340
See ya, kid.

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:50.540
Be careful on your patrol, old dude.

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:55.850
Sure. Also, stop calling me "old dude." 
Learn how to talk to people.

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:58.050
Huh? What was that, old dude?

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.350
Hurry up and go home, kid.

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:06.430
All my attacks were dodged, 
parried, and blocked.

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:09.570
He also used throws and counters 
against me by reading my moves.

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:13.030
He can deal twice the damage by using 
his opponents' strength against them.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.670
The strikes to our joints and 
vital points were also brutal.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:19.750
He also incapacitated physical functions.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:27.050
Your average monster usually just lets 
all its strength loose in a rampage.

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:31.770
But he's different. He has 
special techniques to break people.

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:32.600
<b>Fist of Flowing Water,
Crushed
Rock</b>

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:35.490
In other words, he knows 
how to take down heroes.

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:45.940
Charanko

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:40.330
You want to spar with 
a strong martial artist?

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:41.280
Yeah.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.710
I'm sorta interested now. 
Got any connections,

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:47.180
uh... Champon?

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.820
It's Charanko!

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.980
Here. I'll even give you a banana.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.450
Don't put that there!

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:59.080
Then just go see Master Bang. 
He seems to like you, anyway.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:03.170
Come on, now. 
I can't push around an old guy.

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:04.670
Hey, that's rude!

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:08.380
A normal person can't fight a 
martial artist right off the bat, anyway.

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:10.280
First, you have to learn the basic forms...

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.840
Actually, before that, 
you have to build up stamina.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.440
You can run up and down 
hundreds of steps...

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.330
Or start by wiping the dojo floors...

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:19.720
Guess I'll leave if you 
don't have any connections.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.510
H-Hold on a sec!

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:25.470
There was a mixed martial arts competition 
I happened to enter on a whim.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.090
The ticket is... Here you go.

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:30.780
<b>Charanko
Participant Ticket</b>

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:30.780
It's all wrinkled.

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:34.950
I registered as a participant, 
but I plan to bail.

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:39.200
It still works as an entry ticket, though, 
so you can go watch the competition.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.340
You'll be able to see all kinds of styles.

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:43.050
Thanks.

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:47.090
<b>Stare...</b>

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:45.750
So you're going to drop out?

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.090
Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty hurt.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:51.630
<b>Stare...</b>

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:49.810
It says the prize money is three million yen.

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:51.700
Well, it's a huge tournament.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.000
The champion gets three 
million in one day's pay.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:59.640
<b>Stare...</b>

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.100
Just so you know, you 
can't enter in my place.

00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:59.640
Hey. Are you listening to me?

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:02.850
<b>Izakaya

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.850
You must be the Class A hero, Golden Ball.

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:03.930
Huh?

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:06.440
<b>Class A Rank 26

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:06.430
I have some business with you. 
Step outside for a bit.

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:08.890
At least let me enjoy a drink first.

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:13.140
Hey, what the hell?! Jeez, what a waste.

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:19.070
Sure, wild guy. There's a parking lot nearby.

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:20.330
Let's go there.

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:26.210
Every once in a while, I get punks 
who want to challenge a pro hero.

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:31.050
If you're picking a fight just because 
you're drunk, you should reconsider.

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:33.360
This is your chance to bail.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.800
Shut up, you drunk. I'm—

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:41.680
You bastard.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.690
You're way too lax, hero hunter.

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:49.270
Did Tank-Top Master seriously 
lose to a punk like you?

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.690
Just so you know, I'm pretty 
good at hunting, myself.

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:55.730
After I take you down, 
I'm gonna go have another drink!

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:00.630
<i>He guessed the bullet's trajectory 
by reading my hand movements.</i>

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:03.030
<i>Then how about this?!</i>

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:05.140
<i>A ricochet?</i>

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:07.630
Whoops.

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:10.850
Luckily for you, I missed your vital 
points, but what do you think of that?

00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:12.740
Aren't heroes amazing?

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:17.980
Luckily? It's because you're 
so drunk that your aim is off.

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:21.910
You're going to lose because you couldn't 
finish me off with that one shot.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.580
Unfortunately for you, 
I've got plenty of ammo left.

00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:26.820
Shape-memory Golden Bullets!

00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:28.750

<i>But... This is my final shot.</i>

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:45.620
<i>I'm going to end this.</i>

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.420
Die.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.120
You weren't at the bar,

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.280
so I thought you had forgotten about our plans.

I'm flattered that you've heard of me.

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:24.120
You must be the hero hunter 
I keep hearing about.

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:29.050
Ding, ding. For your prize, 
I'll crush you now, too.

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:31.480
His right leg's been injured.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.630
That should slow down his footwork.

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:36.510
I see. Thank you for the advice.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:41.140
Doesn't swinging that thing in a cramped 
place like this put you at a disadvantage?

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:43.970
Oh, I'm not so sure about... that!

Did you guys know that your trump 
cards are listed in the Hero Guide?

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.010
Opponents with weapons are easy 
once you get used to them.

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:19.590
Hey, don't get ahead of yourself.

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:22.890
You can't keep doing this forever.

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:25.660
I'm going to continue getting stronger.

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:28.230
Just try and take me out if you can!

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:30.900
Until you do, I'll keep doing 
whatever the hell I want.

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:35.110
Hey, the Hero Association 
makes a lot of money, right?

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:37.780
Don't say things like that.

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:40.770
It costs a lot of money to keep the peace.

It's not like we're loaded.

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:44.730
Then why did you buy this for me?

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.580
And why do you always stop by our place?

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.580
To keep the peace, of course.

For an official from the Hero Association,

fooling around with you 
two is a necessary expense.

00:19:54.330 --> 00:20:00.090
As someone who fights evil on the front lines, 
I need a way to restore my energy.

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:01.450
Letting loose, eh?

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:03.590
That means you're letting 
loose every single day.

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:07.270
Oh, I know. Why don't I introduce 
you to Amai Mask next time?

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:08.450

What? I'm not sure about that...

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:16.050
For real? Really?

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.010
Let me meet him, too.

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:19.940
I'll gladly kiss you on the cheek.

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:23.880
Letting loose, letting loose.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.240

<i>I've never seen him before.</i>

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:43.010
<i>Must be some nameless bottom-ranker.</i>

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:46.010
<i>He's probably trying to catch me 
so he can climb up the ranks.</i>

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:47.930
<i>Well, I'll strike first!</i>

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:48.760
Huh?

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.580
What's the big idea?

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.500
Who the hell are you?

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.360
You trying to rob me?

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.230
Don't interfere with my shopping.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.290
Excuse me, could I get this?

00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:07.700
That'll be 3,000 yen.

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:09.300
That's sorta expensive.

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:49.920
Not bad.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:50.720
Master...

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:52.690
It bothers you that much...

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:53.720
Wait, it's not like that.

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:57.370
I haven't decided to wear a wig 
for the rest of my life or anything.

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.270
Doctor Kuseno, it's me, Genos.

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:00.170
There's something I'd like 
to discuss immediately.

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:03.400
Master Saitama is in a perilous state.

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.800
Those synthetic hair implants 
made of reinforced fiber...

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:08.420
You said you could implant them 
into living skin, correct?

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:11.250
Yes, that's right. 
I believe I'll need them after all.

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:13.270
So black is one of the color options?

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:16.590
If we decide to go forward with the 
operation, when will you be available?

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:17.770
The sooner the better?

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:19.450
Next Wednesday? I see.

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:20.850
Yes, I'll be accompanying him.

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:23.050
Understood. Let's go with that day.

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:24.710
Thank you for all of your help.

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.210
Master Saitama! 
Are you free next Wednesday?

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:32.070
Stop trying to stick reinforced fiber 
into my head without my permission.

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:34.760
I'm going to enter a martial 
arts tournament wearing this.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.430
As Charanko.

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:38.390
It's today?

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:41.930
Yup. See you later.

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:44.100
I'm gonna go try out this 
martial arts thing.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:50.030
