00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.030
Fist of Flowing Water, Crushed Rock!

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.190
<i>Those moves are the perfect 
offense and defense alike.</i>

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.230
<i>They may be using the same style, 
but the difference in skill is obvious.</i>

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.550
<i>This battle's already been decided.</i>

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.920
<i>What the hell? The old man 
never fights this fiercely...</i>

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.160
<i>Sh-Shit... I'm losing consciousness...</i>

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.620
<i>Actually... I'm probably going to die.</i>

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.260
Why are you moving so strangely?

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.640
Where did you learn that?

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.690
You're like a beast.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.300
<i>Not yet...</i>

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.640
<i>I can still figure this out if I use him...</i>

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.460
Not happening.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.830
I took care of the monsters.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.040
Bang, all that's left is Garo.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.440
<b>Cleaning Up the Disciple's Mess</b>

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.410
<i>I sent in some monsters in 
order to take Garo alive,</i>

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.250
<i>but the Demon Cyborg...</i>

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.590
<i>I didn't expect him to be that strong.</i>

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.680
<i>And even Silverfang is here.</i>

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.180
<i>This will make it hard to snatch him.</i>

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.100
<i>But if I go back empty-handed, 
Orochi might eat me next.</i>

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.060
<i>I need Garo to survive 
this on his own somehow,</i>

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.520
<i>but I'm not sure things 
could be any worse.</i>

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.470
Say, Big Bro, if you were him,

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.470
would you still be able to stand 
after being hurt that badly?

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.120
If I were 60 years younger, 
I could've held on... probably.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.970
Come on! Just a little more!

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:25.950
Let's go, Bang!

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.780
<i>Damn it... Old Man Bang</i>

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.540
<i>is taking advantage of the fact that 
his former top pupil is weakened.</i>

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.170
<i>Not to mention the other geezer is the 
master of the Fist of Whirling Wind,</i>

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.970
<i>Slashing Steel, Bomb!</i>

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.970
<i>Have they no shame?</i>

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.610
<i>Even if I were to beg for my 
life in front of these two,</i>

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.490
<i>the Demon Cyborg wouldn't let me go.</i>

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.010
<i>So if I want to get through this dire situation,</i>

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.940
<i>I need to kill all three of them.</i>

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.240
<i>That's impossible, though.</i>

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.690
Know the pain that my top 
pupil Charanko felt, Garo!

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.160
Let's play heroes!

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.080
You wanna play, too, don't you, Garo?

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.250
Yeah, let's play!

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.450
Huh? Sure.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.050
Bum-ba-bom! Justice Man is here!

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.760
Hup!

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.790
Justice Man Kick!

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.350
That's dangerous!

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:29.540
Huh?

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.220
That's mean!

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.200
In that case...

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.260
You can be the monster.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.870
Huh?

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.270
You be the monster.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.650
<i>The hell is this? Am I seeing 
my life flash before my eyes?</i>

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.140
<i>This is a pretty shitty memory.</i>

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.420
<i>This guy is...</i>

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.790
Now you get to be the monster.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.120
<i>That's right. Tatsu.</i>

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.460
<i>He was the popular kid in class.</i>

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.580
Wait, what's going on?

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.370
Garo's going crazy.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.130
We were just playing, but 
then Garo suddenly got mad.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.500
We were playing heroes, 
and Garo got super mad at Tatsu.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.770
What the heck? What's his problem?

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.600
Poor Tatsu.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.300
So, what made you so angry?

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.940
Well...

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.730
I heard you got angry while 
playing heroes. Is that true?

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.740
That's because Tatsu always...

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.900
You can't even tell the difference 
between real life and make-believe?

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.950
That's not it.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.160
I always have to play the monster andâ€”

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.830
You're the one who lost control!

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.960
How are you going to take 
responsibility for this?!

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.580
<i>It's not that I didn't like 
playing the monster...</i>

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.710
<i>Did I just not like Tatsu playing the hero?</i>

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.660
<i>No, that wasn't the problem.</i>

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.760
<i>I just learned how unbelievably unfair 
things were while we were playing heroes.</i>

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.250
<i>Playing heroes is just</i>

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.850
<i>supposed to be kids reenacting what they 
see on a kids' show. It's make-believe.</i>

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.730
<i>It shouldn't matter who plays what role.</i>

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.370
<i>Tatsu was the most popular kid in class.</i>

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.190
<i>On the other hand, I was a loner 
who basically kept to himself.</i>

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.530
<i>The one to play the hero is decided when 
everyone agrees on who it should be.</i>

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.070
<i>Of course I'd never get that chance.</i>

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.460
Justice Man Cross Chop!

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.690
Why the heck are you dodging?

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.500
Guys, hold on to Garo for me.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.830
You got it.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:22.460
Huh?

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.370
<i>This should be obvious, but there's no 
scenario where the monster actually wins.</i>

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.920
<i>I would always lose.</i>

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.800
Justice Man Kick!

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.140
I've defeated the monster Garo Poop Man!

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.020
<i>The system in which the 
popular kid everyone loves</i>

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.930
<i>beats the crap out of the weak, 
loner kid who's hated by everyone...</i>

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.530
I can't take it anymore!

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.610
Fight me, Tatsu!

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.380
Huh? What the heck are you talking about?

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.090
I don't want to play the monster anymore!

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.250
If I win, promise me that you 
won't mess with me anymore!

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.270
Guys, hold on to Garo for me.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.770
That's not fair! Let me go!

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.010
I want to fight Tatsu fair and square!

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.280
The others said you suddenly

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.020
went crazy when you were 
all just playing around.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.460
That's not true.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.540
Tatsu's popular, so everyone's 
making me out to be the bad guy.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.150
That's not true! You did a bad thing!

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.960
Go apologize to everyone right now!

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.760
<i>Justice, my ass. Evil, my ass.</i>

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.690
<i>In the end, they were just going to 
kill me based on popular opinion.</i>

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.070
<i>It's unfair. It's unforgivable.</i>

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.260
<i>I'm angry!</i>

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.500
<i>I just want to teach them all a lesson!</i>

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:45.460
<i>I want them to feel a blow from the weak!</i>

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.920
<i>Screw justice and evil!</i>

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.590
It's over, Garo!

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:59.270
Like hell... it's over!

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.310
What?

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.650
Garo...

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.700
Bang! Above you!

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:24.710
A monster?

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:29.170
Genos!

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:31.710
Bang! He's a monster now!

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.760
I'm going to blast that thing 
along with Garo! Got it?

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.060
Hear me! I'm taking Garo!

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.350
I'm leaving the rest to you!

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:44.560
Spiral Incineration Cannon!

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:49.020
Centichoro!

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.830
What in the world is that?!

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.450
That thing's actually alive?!

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:11.380
Oh, no! We need to get to them!

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.280
To think it didn't even suffer a scratch

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.490
after being hit by Genos' attack...

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:36.670
That thing's going to be a pain in the ass.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.950
<b>Threat Level:
Dragon</b>

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.950
<b>Giant Monstrous Insect:
Centichoro</b>

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.910
What the hell do you guys think 
you're doing, interfering like that?

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:51.170
Just shut up and let Centichoro handle this.

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:55.120
He's a catastrophe that devours all.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.010
I can't help but admire his 
desire to destroy everything.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.640
I see that your endgame is 
as weak as ever, hero hunter.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:07.400
When you defeat them, you need to make 
sure they aren't breathing anymore.

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:11.520
All those heroes on the ground 
over there are still alive.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:18.240
But don't worry. 
Centichoro will end everything.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.670
Quit interfering!

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:21.990
They're my prey!

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:24.000
Come on, now. Stop squirming.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.160
Damn it! Put me down!

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.790
You won't get away with this!

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:29.870
Why are you so angry?

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:32.300
It's your fault for not finishing them off.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:42.060
Getting rid of two Class S heroes at 
once works out quite well for us.

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.640
They are our greatest enemies, after all.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.800
I'm sure you've seen by now 
that some opponents

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.360
are better suited for each other than others.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.570
According to our strategist, Gyoro-Gyoro,

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:58.010
there are only four heroes who 
stand a chance against Centichoro.

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:03.790
Terrible Tornado, who has 
unparalleled psychic powers.

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:07.750
Metal Knight, who hoards military 
might on an unknown scale.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:11.460
King, the strongest human alive.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:16.920
And the top hero who nearly killed 
Centichoro in the past, Blast.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.920
Centichoro aligned with

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:23.780
the Monster Association in order 
to get revenge against Blast.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:29.140
It means that he's determined to 
drag Blast out onto the battlefield.

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:32.520
In terms of compatibility between 
fighters, those two Class S heroes

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.520
don't have what it takes to survive this fight.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.450
Silverfang has unrivaled strength, 
but that only applies

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:42.530
for opponents of a size that allow 
him to use his martial arts.

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:46.470
The Demon Cyborg's functionality 
is also terrifyingly proficient,

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:50.260
but he doesn't have enough firepower 
to take down something that big.

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.950
Those two don't stand a chance.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:10:59.810
He's coming!

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:00.700
Genos...

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:01.560
We're counting on you.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.140
Got it!

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:12.180
Whirling Wind...

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.400
Flowing Water...

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.460
Fist of Roaring Ki, Rending Air!

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:37.630
What an amazing attack...

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.720
They broke through that hard exoskeleton...

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.550
That is truly the ultimate technique.

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:51.230
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet! 
Not yet! Not yet! Not yet!

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:12.310
We let our guard down.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:15.800
But we were able to use the huge 
attack that we can only use once.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.720
Thanks, Genos.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.130
It's no big deal.

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:21.560
It looks like it was effective.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.200
That shock is currently 
coursing through its body.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:27.100
I hope you explode into 
bits, you stupid monster.

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:30.810
It's over.

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.160
Seriously?

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.630
He molted!

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:56.360
How is that even possible?!

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.630
We can't defeat this! What are we going to do?

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:00.590
We're just outside the city.

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:03.630
If we let it go into that area, 
civilians are going to get hurt.

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:06.180
Bang.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.760
I'll fight that thing.

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:13.980
I'll hold off that centipede for as 
long as possible. You guys can run.

00:13:14.510 --> 00:13:17.440
Genos, I cannot agree to that.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:21.150
You shouldn't risk your life when 
you know there's no way to win.

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:23.990
You young'uns still have a future.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:29.690
Genos, just make sure you 
don't push yourself too hard.

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:34.830
Is that really okay, though?

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:40.170
Of course it's not!

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.600
This is too reckless! 
Cannons won't work on that thing!

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.880
<i>This thing, the monster from 
yesterday, and Garo are all</i>

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.530
<i>part of the Monster Association.</i>

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:14.600
<i>This battle is inevitable!</i>

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:21.340
Dual Blade Rush!

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:28.340
But that's what it means 
to fight against them!

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.770
I'll grind you to death!

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.760
<i>If that's being reckless, then...</i>

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:54.030
Genos!

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:58.000
<i>At this rate... I'm...</i>

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:00.460
<i>unworthy.</i>

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:12.630
Jet Drive Arrow!

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.850
You impudent creature!

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:25.710
What?!

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:27.320
He went into its mouth!

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:31.320
Die!

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:37.620
<i>This is... digestive fluid!</i>

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:40.120
I'll melt you until there's nothing left!

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:42.590
<i>You're the one...</i>

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:45.030
<i>who's going to melt!</i>

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:50.800
Ultra Spiral Incineration Cannon!

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.190
He did it!

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:41.650
<i>Again...</i>

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.260
<i>I cannot...</i>

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:46.410
<i>defeat him...</i>

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:51.290
<i>I cannot protect them!</i>

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:54.990
Run, Big Bro!

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:58.450
It's no use!

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:01.320
What's the matter?

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:06.130
You sure quieted down, hero hunter.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.190
I just don't agree with 
how this battle ended.

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:14.190
I want to defeat them on my own.

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:18.300
Then I would become the 
greatest object of fear.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:21.510
That's the point of being the hero hunter.

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:24.270
Object of fear? You?

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:27.350
You don't have the strength

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:31.440
to defy the likes of Centichoro or the 
upper echelon of the Monster Association.

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.910
Just you wait...

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:45.290
<i>What is it that I'm lacking?</i>

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:48.890
<i>There are still others like him?</i>

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:55.300
<i>Is there nothing I can do against 
these opponents but just watch?</i>

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.380
Bang, this isn't good.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.720
We're going to end up back in the city.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.260
There will be civilian casualties!

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:07.760
<i>Bang?</i>

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:09.940
Big Bro.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.820
I guess it's do or die.

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:29.880
I will exert my life's 
last remaining strength!

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:41.340
Courage...

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:44.600
Centichoro!

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.700
Hey, you pest!

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.440
I brought you Blast, 
the guy you've been looking for!

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:52.190
That's King's voice!

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:53.150
Blast?!

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:55.110
Hey, look!

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.590
He's turning toward the voice!

00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:00.050
Blast?

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:01.230
That's right!

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:08.030
The one who beat you so bad that you 
pissed yourself as you ran away!

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:10.000
The hero Blast!

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:13.480
If you want to fight him 
again, come over here!

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.290
What's wrong? You scared?

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:17.970
You coward!

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.260
Hey, if you're going to shit 
yourself, do that at home!

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:28.440
Vermin like you should go back into the 
ground and suckle on your mama's teat!

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:31.680
Looks like King made it in time.

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:32.400
Yes.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:36.860
He had mentioned that he wanted 
something to provoke Centichoro.

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:40.630
Is he trying to draw him in close
and fight him one-on-one?

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:42.070
I know it's top secret,

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:45.080
but I told him about 
Centichoro's grudge against Blast.

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.040
What did he say?

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.870
He just said... "Understood."

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:55.020
And then I heard the rumbling 
of the King Engine.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.830
To finish this, I need to bring 
him over here and make sure

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:03.330
our attack doesn't cause 
any casualties in the city.

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:04.200
Those are the rules.

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:11.440
Saitama?

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:16.860
Saitama!

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:55.150
Is that you, Genos?

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.860
I figured you'd be here.

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.130
It's a good thing we came.

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:05.320
Huh? Saitama, you look refreshed...

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:09.700
I feel like I was able 
to blow off some steam.

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:13.730
I kept losing to you at video games, 
so I was pretty stressed out.

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:16.170
You were still annoyed about that?

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:18.530
Master Saitama!

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.050
There's something I'd like to ask you.

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:21.880
What's up?

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:24.970
What do you think I'm lacking?

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:26.930
Huh? Probably power?

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.150
Thank you very much!

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:36.060
<i>No... Don't use Saitama as an example...</i>

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:39.020
<i>Genos!</i>

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:43.610
<i>Your battles show me the way, Master.</i>

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:47.700
<i>He has shown me true strength and 
the destination I should strive for.</i>

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:53.520
<i>I will also head there.</i>

00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:58.460
Let's go home.

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:35.770
Garo? Looks like he passed out.

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:37.770
Get plenty of rest.

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:45.330
We'll reach Orochi soon.
