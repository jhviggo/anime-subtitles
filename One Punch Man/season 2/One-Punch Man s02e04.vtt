<i>Ugh... This lame theme song... It's Justice Man!</i>

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.420
<i>That hero's getting in the

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.700
<i>You can do it! I believe in you, Devil Earl!</i>

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.420

<i>When will there be a monster 
that can defeat Justice Man?</i>

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.750
<i>Huh?</i>

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.130

<i>Justice always prevails?</i>

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.150
<i>But that's not fair!</i>

<i>Monsters have ambitions, too!</i>

<i>Monsters are working hard, too...</i>

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.020
<i>And yet, they always just die in the end...</i>

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.900
<i>But I want to support them... 
What about my feelings?</i>

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.790
<i>Monsters are so much cooler...</i>

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.050
<i>That the popular guys win and the 
unpopular guys lose is a tragedy.</i>

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.990
<i>In that case... I won't lose to anyone.</i>

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.500

I don't really remember 
what happened last night.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.180
Regarding Director Zeimeet's 
assault by a thug last night...

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.760
We're certain that Garo the 
hero hunter was behind it.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.650
So that means he's not 
only going after heroes.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.270
He's going after the Association itself.

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.600
He's strong enough to 
defeat Tank-Top Master.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.480

Let's issue an alert.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.570
Executives should avoid going 
outside unnecessarily

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.290
and, if they must go anywhere,
have Class S heroes accompany them.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.720
Are you sure?

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.880
The Class S heroes have been rather 
busy dealing with monsters lately.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.460
But the safety of executives close 
to our sponsors is more important.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.300
Bodyguard for an executive?

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.260
I decline. Why?

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.220
Because I'm in the middle 
of a battle right now.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.440
I just defeated them, but I'm now heading 
to the stage with the secret boss.

<i>I came here because I was told that 
there was an important mission...</i>

Apparently executives from the Hero 
Association are also being targeted right now,

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.600
but my son insisted on trying 
some commoner food today.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.630

There's even pudding on this thing!

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.230
I was wondering how vile sushi 
must be if it's under 10,000 yen,

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.800
but it seems this can actually be quite fun.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.000
Why?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.330
They need it when they tally up your total.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.360
But returning the plates 
is proper etiquette.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.270
I just told you not to return the plates!

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.170

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.280
It's my little sister!

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.720

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.780

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.010
He's definitely an executive 
from the Hero Association.

his kid. Let's take him.

<b>Charanko

<i>Shit. Does he actually know Charanko?</i>

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:24.340
Hey, come on, now. 
Did you forget the face of your senpai?

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.960
Is "Fist of Water Polo, Carbonation" 
supposed to be some kind of joke?

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.720
Well, I can't blame you for panicking.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.200
You never did like me.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.350
<b>Hero Association Hospital</b>

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:42.310
He better not have entered the 
tournament in my place...

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.350
I guess he's not that stupid.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.180
No, wait. Saitama does seem pretty stupid.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.150
Saitama?

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:52.990
Oh, you're...

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:56.200
You know Saitama?

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.410
Charanko, do you know why 
I entered this tournament?

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:05.130
<i>I couldn't care less, to be honest. 
Could you please just go away?</i>

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.040
There are two reasons.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.630
First, because this Super Fight tournament

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:12.960
is one of the best ways for a fighter 
to make a name for themselves.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:17.240
<b>Winner</b>

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.050
Master Bang won a while back.

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:18.090
And the second reason...

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:20.350
The incident that happened 
at last year's tournament.

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:24.650
The winner was a masked 
fighter named Wolfman.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:30.370
But later on, they found the 
actual Wolfman unconscious.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:36.620
And that's why they banned entering under 
false names and the use of disguises.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.120
<i>D-Disguises?</i>

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:44.120
You putting down a false fighting 
style might also be in the gray area.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.380
What happens if they find out?

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:49.090
You're stripped your qualifications
and permanently banned.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.170
And considering last year's incident,

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:54.090
you'll probably also be sued 
and slapped with a huge fine.

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.550
You might even be arrested.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.000
Huh? What?!

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.390
Huh? What's up?

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:04.010
Don't tell me you...

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:08.020
have an idea who that 
despicable impostor was!

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.430
<i>I'm safe.</i>

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.070
After seeing the video of them fighting, 
I'm certain I know who it is.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:14.630
There's no doubt about it.

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:16.780
The impostor in the last tournament

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.740
was Garo!

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.370
Heya. I'm back again.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.960
Oh, hey, old dude! 
Are you out patrolling again?

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:29.040
Stop calling me "old dude." 
And let me borrow that book.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.750
I told you, you can't borrow it.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.860
Huh?

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.420
I'm saying... that we 
should read it together.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.230
<i>Garo, huh?</i>

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:43.270
<i>That name came up again.</i>

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:45.210
About six months ago.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:48.360
So it's right after the incident 
where he was expelled by our master.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.480
There's no doubt about it.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:51.060
That incident?

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:54.290
You were off slacking somewhere,
so I'm sure you didn't know,

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:58.030
but it happened while the master was gone.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.520
I'm tired of this.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.240
Huh?

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.910
There's nothing else I can learn here.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.940
Let's have an actual fight.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:15.010
He was hiding his true intent 
while sharpening his fangs.

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:21.140
If he hadn't shown up, we wouldn't 
have had to leave the dojo, damn it!

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.560
That's why I'm going to win 
this tournament today

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:28.060
and regain my confidence.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.940
Confidence that I can get to Garo's level.

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.980
But to think that you'd have the 
guts to enter the Super Fight when

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.040
you were one of the weakest at the dojo...

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.700
You sure got cocky.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.080
I hear you're calling yourself 
Master Bang's top student,

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.040
but don't get too full of yourself.

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:52.220
I see. So Saitama might enter 
the tournament in your place.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:53.670
Yeah.

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.660
If someone inexperienced ends up 
entering a tournament like that...

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.320
They'll definitely be killed.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.480
You don't need to worry.

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:01.640
After all, he's...

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:04.600
a hero.

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:08.890
You know, I wouldn't have 
left the dojo if I'd known

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:11.030
that Garo was going to be expelled.

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:12.400
But if I hadn't quit,

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.910
I, Sourface, would've been Master 
Bang's number one student right now.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:21.950
How about it? Why don't we practice 
some holds until you pass out again?

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.410
But you did quit the dojo, right?

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:26.540
What?

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.620
Charanko fought Garo one-on-one.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:33.080
But anyway, I plan on defeating Garo myself.

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:37.050
As long as he's hunting heroes, I'm sure 
I'll run into him sooner or later.

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:38.540
What I'm saying is that

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.950
you ran away, so you don't get to 
act like you're better than me.

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:46.680
You'd better be prepared 
to defend those words!

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:49.760
The Super Fight is a one-day tournament.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.690
If you can actually manage 
to win your way to the top,

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:54.750
we're going to bump heads in the ring.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.610
And that's when I'll show you

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:02.240
what a real battle is.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.290
<i>A real battle, huh?</i>

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.500
<i>I don't remember what 
that feels like at all.</i>

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.630
That was amazing, Papa!

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.630
He defeated them in no time!

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:25.720
All right, let's take a 
picture to remember this.

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:29.430
Hey, hurry up and take cover. It's dangerous.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.440
Venus-People Trap and I were 
both annihilated instantly.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:36.900
Considering what you did to us, 
I guess you really are strong,

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.660
Metal Bat.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.570
So that's what a Class S hero is like, huh?

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:47.790
But if you're that strong, 
you probably think you're the strongest.

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.480
I was the same way...

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.210
Man, bugs are persistent.

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:55.420
I should probably finish you off.

00:12:55.420 --> 00:13:00.840
But then, my senpai showed up...

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.930
Another one?!

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:17.170

Well, thinking about that's 
not gonna help right now.

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:55.420
I'm just going to crush you!

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:59.750
Yup! He'll get back up and face 
the enemy, no matter what!

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:02.980

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.330
U-Uh, I—

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:08.330
Besides, he would never break 
the rules to enter in your place.

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:09.590
He's a hero, after all!

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:10.820
R-Right...

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:14.040

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:37.890
Of course he is! He's a Class S hero!

The fact that Centikohai and Centisenpai 
appeared one after another
