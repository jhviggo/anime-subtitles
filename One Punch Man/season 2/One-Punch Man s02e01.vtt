when you get popular.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.250
Must be nice... Getting your own figure.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.850
Let's contact the manufacturer.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.980
Nah... You're not supposed to 
ask them to make one yourself.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.880

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.740

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.060
What the heck is that?!

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.070

that I turned into one.

You're so awesome, King.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.030
Did you show up because you 
sensed the monster, King?

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.840
No, I was about to go shopp—

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.540
Hey, you can't just talk 
to King like that.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.930
Er, I don't really mind.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.180
Could I just get a handshake?

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.760
I'm busy.

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:09.940

Look! It's King! King's right over there!

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.300

What the heck's that noise?

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.000
You've never heard of the King Engine?

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.780
It's the sound you hear once 
King's in combat mode!

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.300
It's said that there's been no monster that 
made it out alive after hearing that sound!

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.700
Listen well. This is also 
a test of my combat AI.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.260
I need you to fight at full 
strength so I can gather data.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.850
<i>Is this thing a robot?</i>

<i>I have no idea what it's talking about.</i>

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.070
All right, but let me go 
to the bathroom first.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.530
I'll only be able to fight at about 
half-strength if I'm holding it in.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.450
That won't give you accurate data, will it?

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.330
I shall wait here for ten minutes.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.290
For every minute that you're late, 
I shall kill ten people.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:33.500
Got it?

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.400
That monster seems pretty strong.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.840
That thing is a robot... and quite powerful.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.640
It's performance might be 
higher than mine.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.800
I estimate that it's at least threat level
 Demon and will be quite troublesome.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.070
I wonder how King will fight it.

<i>That's all it is!</i>

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.130

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:48.390
Yeah, I'm not sure about using my hero name.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:51.150

I guess I bought it by mistake!

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:55.590

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:59.290
I mean... I've won a few tournaments 
for some fighting games, but...

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:00.700
Really?

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:04.200
So not only are you strong in real life, 
you're a winner in video games, too?

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.500
<i>How long does he plan on being here?</i>

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.390
<i>Hurry up and—</i>

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:09.460
So, why did you run away earlier?

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:13.750
Right now, Genos is fighting in your place.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:16.220
You're a super strong Class S hero, right?

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:19.680
Why did you run away from 
the robot monster then?

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:24.350
I came here to ask you that, 
but you were playing video games.

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:28.100
Did you get bored with the monster?

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:32.310
Could it be that you're so strong that 
you don't want to fight anymore?

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:34.780
Please, tell me.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.450
<i>Emergency evacuation warning.</i>

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.000
<i>A giant bird has appeared above City M.</i>

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.780
<i>Threat level Demon.</i>

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.770
<i>Please do not go outside.</i>

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:44.770
Here we go again.

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:46.240
<i>I repeat...</i>

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.210
That's the third warning just today.

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:51.290
What are you going to do? I'm gonna go.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.050
Well, I'll be damned.

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:02.370
Guess the threat decided 
to come right to you.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:06.570
Maybe there's something about 
you that attracts monsters.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:11.650
<i>Yeah... I've always been super unlucky.</i>

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:13.190
What do you do in situations like this?

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.440
<i>But lately, it's been getting worse.</i>

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.490
I mean, if these things are showing up at 
your house, you have to fight, don't you?

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.950
<i>Damn it... I have to do 
something about these lasers!</i>

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:33.880
Come down.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:39.010
My only target is King. I have 
no time to waste on you.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.340
<i>Come on, God, give me a break!</i>

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:46.140
<i>That one time, then that other time,</i>

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.310
<i>and then that other time!</i>

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.270
<i>I just got dragged into those messes!</i>

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.810
<i>I'm always running away.</i>

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:58.220
<i>Eventually, someone'll 
show up to defeat them.</i>

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:01.240
<i>I just happened to be at those places,</i>

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.150
<i>but everyone ends up thinking I'm 
the one who defeated those things!</i>

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:07.790
<i>I've never even been in a fight!</i>

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:10.120
<i>King...</i>

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:14.470
<i>I ended up with this hero name because 
they thought I was the ultimate hero</i>

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:16.540
<i>and my overwhelming strength...</i>

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:18.320
<i>What a joke.</i>

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.260
<i>I'm basically nothing but lies.</i>

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.680
Oh?

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:36.810
That's—

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.000
Why you little...

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.920
The steam is—

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:52.160
It appears that you're after King,

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:56.400
but I know someone that's stronger.

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:00.880
You not gonna fight, King?

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.520
<i>You've got the wrong idea!</i>

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.180
<i>I'm not the King that society 
looks up to so much!</i>

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:08.570
<i>I have to say it! I have to say it!</i>

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:10.700
<i>If I don't say it now, he's—</i>

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:13.140
<i>I'm actually—</i>

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:29.340
Seriously? So your strength and 
battle history are all lies?

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:34.710
I guess it must be true if you 
pissed your pants over that bird.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:38.100
<i>Wait, why are you just standing there?
 What happened to the bird?</i>

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.210
<i>He... What?</i>

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:41.420
You okay?

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.090
Someone! Someone!

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:54.980
Hey, calm down. I defeated the monster.

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:57.280
Is your eye okay?

00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.590
Try opening it slowly.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.250
Can you see?

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:05.990
Wh-Who are you?

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:07.480
Me?

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.740
Hm...

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:12.160
I guess I'm just a guy who's 
aspiring to be a hero for fun.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.880
You're so hurt...

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.890
This is nothing.

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:19.730
Today was a great victory.

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:25.980
<i>This guy is...</i>

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:31.700
Hey, what's the matter? Hey!

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:34.390
I'm so sorry!

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.730
Are you having fun?

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.350
Being a hero who lies and cowers in fear?

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:45.200
No...

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.930
I mean, it's none of my business, so I'm 
not going to lecture you or anything.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:55.590
But, uh... I may have been taking 
credit for your deeds.

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:58.000
This isn't about that.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:01.100
You're everyone's hero.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.460
No, I'm...

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:07.460
No matter what you think, they think 
that you're the ultimate hero.

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.450
<b>Rumble</b>

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:11.830
King, are you going to 
continue with your lies?

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:13.100
Or are you going to quit being a hero?

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.920
I'm not sure...

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.030
In that case,

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:18.840
why don't you just get strong?

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:19.310
Huh?

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:21.190
I'm going now.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:22.270
See ya.

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:23.990
Wait!

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.040
Aren't you angry with me?

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:30.490
<i>You worked so hard to become 
a hero, and yet, I...</i>

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.500
I'll be coming by now and 
then to play some games.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:34.780
Peace.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.190
Oh!

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:38.160
Uh...

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:42.250
Sure.

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:48.380
Dr. Kuseno, these are parts from a 
robot calling itself the Robot God G4.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.490
It had immense power and superb AI.

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:56.140
If there are any parts from it that 
I can use, please allow me to do so.

00:15:56.410 --> 00:16:00.760
Th-This is... Genos, where did you get this?

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.250
Doctor,

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:04.560
I want to get stronger.

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:08.070
All right. Let's give it a try.

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:11.520
I believe I can still make you stronger.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.700
Thank you.

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:18.270
But, Genos, while I know you became a 
cyborg for the sake of justice,

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:20.300
you shouldn't push yourself too hard.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.870
No, I have to push myself.

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:27.090
Right now, I'm trying to rank 
in the top ten of Class S.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:31.390
That reckless assignment 
your master assigned you?

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:33.970
I figured you'd say that.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:40.520
More importantly, Genos, have you 
gathered any clues about the cyborg?

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.560
That rampaging cyborg 
that destroyed your home?

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:48.510
You seem to be completely focused 
on your hero activities lately.

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:51.740
I haven't been able to track it down at all.

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.220
I see... But—

00:16:55.220 --> 00:17:00.290
The rampaging cyborg that's destroyed 
many towns and taken countless lives...

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:03.160
I will track it down, no matter what,

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:06.040
and destroy it with my own hands.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.630
No matter what. Whatever it takes.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:12.020
<i>Despite becoming a hero 
and gaining a master,</i>

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:14.340
<i>it appears that his hatred 
hasn't disappeared.</i>

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:18.640
Genos, I'm worried.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.000
I've been pursuing this 
cyborg longer than you,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.440
and I know just how dangerous it is.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:31.860
If you do end up finding it, don't do 
anything rash and report back to me.

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:38.640
You are calm and intelligent, 
but your youth can invite disaster.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.780
Do not fight it alone.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.910
Doctor Kuseno, I understand.

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:47.090
This is our fight.

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:56.750
I am Sitch, the leader of Earth in the Danger
 Prophecy Emergency Countermeasures Team.

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:59.380
I am deeply grateful that denizens

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:03.100
of the underworld like yourselves 
would heed our call.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:05.290
Let me just say

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:09.650
that we will not be looking into your 
criminal history or activities at this time.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:12.260
This is not a trap.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.320
There are a few heroes here, but they 
are just serving as my bodyguards.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.980
Heroes?

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.710
Bring them on! I'll murder all of them!

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:23.800
They won't act as long as you 
don't do anything reckless.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.580
Why don't we just take over the place?

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.360
Wanted men with huge 
bounties and top assassins.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.930
Even prison escapees.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.930
What is Sitch thinking, 
inviting these ruffians here?

Wait.

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:50.850
Seriously? A guy like him?

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:52.350
Unbelievable.

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:54.650
Yes.

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:58.310
In the physical exam 
portion of the Hero Test,

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:00.780
he crushed every record for every event.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:01.760

Despite having no notable record 
of his actions since then,

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:08.960
he managed to climb up 
from Class C to Class B.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.580
Right after his debut, on top of that.

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:13.290
There has to be something about this man.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
There has to be something about him.

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:18.460
A secret behind his strength.

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:23.730
First, we're going to find out where he is.

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:24.630
Yes, ma'am!

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:28.720
I'm going to hunt him down, 
and I'm going to make him regret

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.730
the fact that he managed to embarrass 
me, Sound-o'-Speed Sonic.

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:34.850
Just you wait...

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:37.120
You better be prepared...

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:39.040

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.380
Hey, why are you taking all the items?

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:46.640
What the hell, man?

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.220
First come, first serve.

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:50.920
This is co-op, you moron. 
You friggin' moron, King.

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.860
I'm still in my default gear!

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:55.080
Don't worry. I can beat them by myself.

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:59.310
Whoops. The controller broke.

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:00.220
