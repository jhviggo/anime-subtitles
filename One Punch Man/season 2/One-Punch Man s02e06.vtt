WEBVTT

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.850
Here he comes!

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:04.600
The one we've been waiting for!

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.350
The crowd's mood has changed.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.050
Why, though?

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.830
To think we'd be able to 
see this man fight again!

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.110
The crowd is quivering in bliss!

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.830
Suiryu is here!

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.600
He'll be going up against Max!

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.750
<i>He's got quite the reputation, 
but is he actually better than me?</i>

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.210
<i>No... Remember, Lightning Max.</i>

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.090
<i>The opponent I really need to surpass...</i>

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.970
<i>Compared to that monster, you're puny.</i>

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.600
Suiryu, I have to get stronger.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.270
Otherwise, I won't be able to 
protect everyone as a hero.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.980
Unfortunately for you,

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.320
I view you as a worthy opponent for 
testing a new anti-monster technique!

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.350
So you're a pro hero?

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.080
With rather lofty ambitions, I see.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.830
I guess everyone has their own 
reasons for seeking strength.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.610
Take your stance.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.090
Begin!

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.090
Lightning Big Wheel Double Ax Kick!

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.890
The reason I sought strength...

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.640
was so I could glide through life easily.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.990
Sorry I'm the stronger one.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.270
<b>The Uprising of the Monsters</b>

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.760
D-Did you see that, Charanko?!

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.570
Did you see Suiryu's kick?!

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:17.840
Yeah, why?

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.880
How are you so calm right now?

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.800
<i>Oh, it must be because he's an amateur.</i>

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.520
<i>He took down a Class A 
hero in a single blow.</i>

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.510
<i>I guess there's a surprising 
number of civilians</i>

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.020
<i>who are stronger than pro heroes.</i>

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.810
<i>I guess that's to be expected.</i>

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.980
<i>Master Saitama was also 
doing hero work as a hobby.</i>

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.130
<i>It makes sense that there could be 
other powerful people like him.</i>

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.420
<i>I'm sure none of them are 
on Master's level, though.</i>

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.660
<i>But that man might be able to satisfy 
Master's desire to experience martial arts.</i>

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.870
This is...

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.230
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm sure 
you're even more fired up now,

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.180
but next up,

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.300
we have Benpats from Bad Roads Martial 
Arts and Snek from Snakebite Fist!

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.290
Whoever wins this fight will face off 
against Suiryu in the second round!

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.940
You're a Class A hero?

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.520
You don't look very strong.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.690
<i>If I can defeat Suiryu, 
who defeated Lightning Max,</i>

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.190
<i>it might have a positive effect on my rank.</i>

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.190
<i>All right.</i>

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.420
Snakebite Fist.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.360
Like anyone would fall for a fake 
stance like that nowadays.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.490
You lowest-ranking hero jerk!

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.870
I'm not the lowest ranking.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.040
I'm the lowest-ranking Class A hero!

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.750
<b>Commentators' Booth</b>

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.750
There's trouble!

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.330
An extremely violent monster 
has appeared nearby!

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.960
We need to evacuate everyone immediately!

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.280
Seriously? Hurry up and 
make the announcement—

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.630
There's no need.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.600
Huh? Bakuzan!

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.770
That'll just cause people to panic.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.760
But if a monster shows up at this venue...

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.720
Look at how many martial 
arts masters we have here.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.270
No place could be safer.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.760
True...

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.090
Don't worry. If any monsters 
infiltrate the venue,

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.980
I'll take care of them myself.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.970
<i>Monsters have appeared, huh?</i>

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.990
<i>That's way too many.</i>

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.660
<i>City C... There's one in this city, too.</i>

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.580
<i>Should I let Master know?</i>

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.370
<i>No, I can just go take care of it myself.</i>

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.110
<i>I won't let it interfere 
with this tournament.</i>

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.460
<i>No matter how many small fry there are, 
I'll dispose of them immediately.</i>

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.970
Wh-What the hell?

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.860
You aren't weak at all...

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.050
The winner is Snek!

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.940
I want to believe that I rank 
among the strongest myself.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.390
But you get sick of the reality pretty quick.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.040
The battlefield of top heroes is 
filled with nothing but monsters.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.260
Incinerate.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.570
It's the Demon Cyborg!

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.430
That was some blow!

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.580
We're saved!

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.930
<i>I'm currently in City C near the stadium. 
What's the situation?</i>

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.920
Multiple monsters have appeared 
simultaneously in several cities.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.380
<i>We've confirmed that there are 
currently five in City C.</i>

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.310
Mr. Demon Cyborg, 
there's another monster over there.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.010
There's one over there, too!

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.460
I got rid of one.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.230
Where are the other four?

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.270
<i>I'll guide you to them.</i>

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.520
A blow charged with electricity!

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.520
<b>Bazuzu VS Boltane</b>

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.020
The winner is Boltane!

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.020
<b>Winner:
Boltane</b>

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.030
Gatling's super fast punches have 
finally taken down Hamukichi.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.070
He can no longer stand!

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.070
<b>Winner:
Gatling</b>

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.200
Dave immediately opened the match 
with an explosive body press!

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.160
<b>Winner:
Dave</b>

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.160
Rosie was taken down in mere seconds!

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.080
And the referee had to interfere!

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.790
Choze is strong!

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.000
Mentai didn't stand a chance!

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:42.880
<b>Winner:
Choze</b>

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.420
Rocket Stomp!

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.890
I know there's another 
one of you in the area.

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:57.470
Tell me where they are or continue 
to suffer until you die.

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:58.730
Choose one.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.810
Next up, we have Jakumen 
from Giga Pro Wrestling

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.220
versus Sourface from Sourface-Style Kenpo!

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.850
They are both competing 
here for the first time!

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.300
Do your best out there, Sourface!

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.310
Shut up! I used to be 
Master Bang's second-best student!

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:17.500
<i>This guy's pretty huge.</i>

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.950
<i>No, wait. I'm stronger!</i>

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:20.900
<i>I think...</i>

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.410
<i>Think back on all of your rigorous training!</i>

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:27.250
<i>This guy's face is pretty scary...</i>

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:31.470
Lemme have your face.

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:38.720
There you are. I'm going to eliminate you.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.960
Oh, hey. If it isn't a celebrity.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.020
Can I rip off your face, too?

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.970
How do you like my knifework?

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.050
I had you hit my hard head on purpose.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:10.550
High Voltage Fist!

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:14.090
Begone.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.100
He's taking care of them in seconds.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.270
The Class S hero, Genos... 
He's incredibly powerful.

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:27.440
Demon Cyborg... The last one is two 
kilometers northwest from there.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.900
<i>There are already others 
engaged in battle there.</i>

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:35.410
Can you speak?

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:40.160
Wh-When you're fighting him, 
make sure you don't lose sight of him.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.290
He'll be behind you before you know it.

00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:44.480
Are you a Class S hero?

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.790
Do you hate cockroaches, too?

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:52.210
Not cockroaches in particular, but I have 
a long-running feud with bug monsters.

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:53.970
<i>The last one.</i>

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.700
<i>If I can take care of 
this one with no issues,</i>

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.050
<i>I might make it to Master's match in time.</i>

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.770
Just so you know, I'm strong.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.540
Jakumen ends up tapping out!

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.060
That was an excellent finishing 
move on Sourface's part!

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.440
And they're holding each other up!

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.150
What beautiful sportsmanship!

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:15.490
Did you win, Sourface?

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:18.550
What?! Weren't you watching, Charanko?

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:20.530
Didn't you see how awesome I was?

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:21.950
I was in the bathroom.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.510
You jerk...

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:26.620
Hey! The guy you're up against next...

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:28.540
Be careful with him.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:31.130
I've seen Bakuzan in action before.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:33.630
<i>Crap... I undid my obi in the bathroom,</i>

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:33.630
He shows no mercy to inferior opponents...

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:35.510
Hey!

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:35.510
<i>and I don't know how to retie it.</i>

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.300
Are you listening?!

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:42.500
Next up, we have Charanko, 
fresh off a victory over Zakkos,

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:46.310
versus Bakuzan, a former 
two-time consecutive winner!

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:51.730
He is the master of Darkness Hellkill, 
which has left many fighters bloody!

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:57.780
Will he be sending even more of his 
opponents to the hospital this time around?

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:02.160
I'm just teaching those 
who lack resolve a lesson.

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:07.820
Listen up. When two martial 
artists fight, it's not a sport.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.950
Lives are at stake...

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.560
Hey!

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.240
Well, whatever. This should work.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.010
I'm going to kill you.

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:16.590
Begin!

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:22.510
And it's begun! How does Charanko 
plan to fight against Bakuzan?

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:26.890
<i>He's wide open. What's with this guy?</i>

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:29.560
<i>Does he even have the will to fight?</i>

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:34.110
Uh-oh! Bakuzan is closing 
the gap between them!

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:35.100
Hey, you.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.300
Are you an amateur?

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.990
Yeah. This is actually my first 
time doing one of these things.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:43.240
Let me experience your 
martial arts technique.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.400
Very well.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:48.500
As you wish, I'll give you my full 
course before executing you.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.580
First, your leg.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:56.340
My Demon-Sweeper Low Kick crushes bone, 
so you'll never be able to stand again.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:58.340
Next, your torso.

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:03.550
After my Bear-Killer Mid 
Kick and Carnage Punch...

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:07.680
your arm will break, 
and your guts will go flying.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.020
Lastly, your head...

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:13.270
My Hell-Bringin' Hand Chop 
will split your skull,

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:14.920
so you can kiss this world goodb—

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:16.570
Don't touch my head!

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.680
Uh... Out of bounds...

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.850
Crap. I missed out on the 
actual fighting part again.

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:29.910
The match is over! Someone get a stretcher!

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:33.710
What an absolutely stunning upset!

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:36.530
The one who defeated Bakuzan, 
who was favored to win this tournament,

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:39.730
was Charanko, who is competing 
here for the first time!

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:42.050
He finished him in one punch again.

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:45.310
Okay, then. I guess I'll do that, too.

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:52.480
<i>Mr. Ignoramus is here to explain 
the recent monster outbreak.</i>

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:58.360
<i>Mr. Ignoramus, what are your thoughts 
on the recent outbreak of monsters?</i>

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.860
<b>Monster Expert
Ignoramus</b>

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:01.860
<i>Nothing?</i>

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.820
<i>Oh, we've just received new information.</i>

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:12.040
<i>The Class A hero Lightning Genji was 
critically injured and has collapsed.</i>

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:12.040
<b>Hero
Guide</b>

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:14.710
<i>What do you think about this?</i>

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:18.150
<i>I see that you're speechless.</i>

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.800
<b>Critically Injured</b>

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.800
Hey!

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.670
Hey, wake up!

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:23.010
Ow...

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:24.550
Are you all right, Mohican?

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:27.010
There should have been a 
father and a son here.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.290
Do you know where the son went?

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:35.480
<b>Waganma</b>

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:35.480
<b>Narinki</b>

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:35.480
Mr. Narinki's son, Wanganma, 
was kidnapped by monsters.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.290
What?! But why?

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:44.110
We're not sure, but Mr. Narinki's 
contributions cover 7% of our expenses,

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:47.040
so we cannot lose his trust.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:51.400
Right. Getting Waganma back 
safely takes top priority.

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:55.000
Gather all heroes at Class A and up!

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.020
But...

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:59.380
Are you saying to ignore all the 
monsters rampaging through the cities?

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:04.220
The Class S hero Metal Bat has been found 
critically injured and unconscious.

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:07.340
Come on, now. What's wrong?

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.350
You can't hit me like that.

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:14.600
I can't get a good shot at him...

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.830
Where are you looking? 
I'm right over here!

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.240
<i>It's not just that he's fast...</i>

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:29.820
<i>My eyes can't keep up with his unusual 
movements, and he slips between buildings.</i>

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.150
You leave me no choice.

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.700
I didn't want to use this, but...

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:38.560
Oh? Do you still have something 
else up your sleeve?

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.800
Are you going to shoot laser 
beams from your eyes?

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:46.930
<i>I didn't even want to equip myself 
with this, but Dr. Kuseno was right.</i>

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:49.680
Tracking missiles? Poisonous gas?

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:55.770
<i>I will not grow if I cannot 
face superior opponents.</i>

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:59.310
It's not pesticide, is it?

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.650
Wh-What the...

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.900
My legs! This is...

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.530
It's an instantaneous 
super-strength adhesive.

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:13.030
Even if a super-fast ninja attacks me, 
I can take them out in an instant.

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:17.870
But by using this, I'm basically 
acknowledging how fast he is.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:19.370
What are you talking about?!

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.570
I guess this doesn't concern you.

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:24.840
Incinerate.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:35.740
<i>Did he leave his feet behind and flee?</i>

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.330
<i>Either way, he's critically injured.</i>

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.050
<i>I guess I can head back to the stadium.</i>

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:43.440
<i>I might make it back in 
time for Master's match.</i>

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.060
<i>Something's approaching at high speed...</i>

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:50.240
<i>Is it the cockroach? No... 
This is something different.</i>

00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:02.290
Hey... You're not supposed to fall 
under her control so easily!

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:04.850
You're so cute when you're panicked.

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:09.220
Too bad for you, 
but they're all my slaves now.

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:13.970
How does it feel to have your 
subordinates taken from you?

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:16.930
Come on, you'd better fight back.

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:18.850
You must be holding back.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:24.690
In that case, I'll let you join 
them as one of my slaves!

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.860
You're not gonna survive like that.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:34.280
Shut up!

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:39.060
Wow, you hold up against 
these numbers quite well.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.750
But I wonder how long you can keep that up!

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:50.260
Here we go! I'm going to lash you to pieces!

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:57.140
She's feeling that.

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:59.560
Now you're mine.

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:03.400
By the way, you're one of the 
Psychic Sisters, aren't you?

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:08.780
In other words, your little sister is 
the Class S hero Terrible Tornado.

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:14.570
Meaning if I use you as bait, 
I can lure Tornado out.

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:17.950
Good thing your little sister's so special.

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:28.750
<i>She hasn't lost her senses to my whip?</i>

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:32.860
<i>Her will is so strong... I think I hate her.</i>

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.510
That hurt, you stupid bitch!

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:44.010
I was going to use you to lure out 
your little sister, but forget that!

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:46.010
I'll rip you to shreds right now!

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:50.190
You don't have to lure her out. 
My older sister will come.

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:53.320
What's this shaking?

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.810
I guess she was closer than I thought.

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:59.450
She can sense when I've sustained damage.

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.910
She's coming.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.620
Explosions?!

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:05.620
Something's coming nearer.

00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:07.920
Something terrible!

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:13.550
She's coming.

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:15.910
Terrible Tornado.

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:20.180
S-Super S...

00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:23.930
There's an insane monster 
on the hero side, too...

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:27.330
<i>She's even worse than I thought.</i>

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:28.500
She destroyed... us all...

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:29.730
<i>I should probably get out of here...</i>

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.190
There she is.

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:37.240
Big Sis! I-I haven't lost ye—

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:40.380
Go on home already, Blizzard.

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:43.120
I'll clean up your mess.

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:47.210
S-Slaves! Buy me time to run away!

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:52.860
Wait! They're on our side! 
Please don't attack them!

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:00.010
I just asked you to not attack them...

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.970
I wouldn't call this an attack.

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:04.410
Uh, that was definitely an attack.

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:08.870
Also, I wouldn't say they're on our side. 
They're just a hindrance.

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:12.230
I'm surprised you still had that 
Class B club thing going on.

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:15.360
Ugh, she escaped.

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:18.220
I probably shouldn't waste time here talking

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.030
since there are apparently other monsters.

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.710
Could you tell your flunkies

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:27.850
that they're just in the way, 
so they should probably just run?

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:39.010
<i>I'd be denying my own worth, 
so I was trying not to think about it...</i>

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:43.100
<i>But this isn't good. 
I'm thinking about it again.</i>

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:47.850
I want to eat you! 
I want to eat human flesh!

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:49.580
Hold it right there!

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:54.570
Now that I, Snakebite Snek, am here, 
I won't let you hurt anyone else!

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:58.530
<i>I was shining so brightly back then.</i>

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:02.320
<i>I was someone special who had 
the power to protect the masses.</i>

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:06.740
<i>The fact that I was a real 
hero fulfilled my spirit.</i>

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:10.250
<i>But over time, I began to 
see reality a bit clearer.</i>

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:14.490
<i>There were creatures out there I couldn't 
defeat, no matter how much I struggled.</i>

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:19.880
<i>There were even nameless civilians 
out there that I couldn't defeat.</i>

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:23.530
<i>Are pro heroes actually necessary?</i>

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:25.870
<i>I find myself asking that a lot lately.</i>

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.390
<i>Maybe even if I didn't exist...</i>

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:30.940
<i>Even if the Hero Association didn't exist...</i>

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:35.400
<i>There'd still be someone else 
to defeat the monsters.</i>

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:40.990
<i>If anything, this man definitely doesn't 
seem like he'd need me to protect him.</i>

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:44.370
That Max guy earlier had a little more oomph.

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:48.120
Why do you just keep dodging? 
Why not attack?

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.750
I wanted to at least confirm your abilities.

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:55.250
Class A heroes get a pretty 
high salary, don't they?

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:58.710
If someone at your level can 
do it, it might be a decent job.

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:02.090
Just kidding. I'd just want the money.

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.340
Why are you so strong?

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:09.930
You're frivolous and lack all ambition.

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:13.310
Maybe it's just pure talent.

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:15.630
You really piss me off.

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:19.730
When I was training, I'd just 
randomly spar with my master.

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:22.200
But I haven't even trained 
the last couple of years.

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:27.410
Why do you bother being a hero? 
I mean, at your skill level...

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:29.160
Wh-What?!

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.070
There are many more 
powerful monsters lately.

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:35.290
Is there even a reason 
for you to try anymore?

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:40.100
Even if there weren't any heroes, the people 
who could survive would still survive.

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:43.930
The weak are weeded out, 
whether we have monsters or not.

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:46.140
That's how nature works.

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:50.810
So you're saying that we should just 
let the monsters kill people?!

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:51.470
What's going on?!

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.050
Is this part of the show?

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:54.930
Monsters!

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:55.900
<b>Hero Association Hospital</b>

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:55.900
Inside the hospital?!

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:59.500
We'll hold them back! 
Everyone, get to the roof!

00:20:57.650 --> 00:21:00.610
Bottom of Foot

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:03.090
Despite that, we survive.

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:05.570
What the hell does a monster want at a jail?

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:08.570
The boss escaped from jail 
to defeat some monsters!

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:11.130
So Puri-Puri Prisoner isn't here?

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:12.790
Oh, well.

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:14.790
Who are you saying will survive?

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:20.250
The strong.

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:20.840
<b>Super big</b>

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:20.840
Big winner!!

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:21.590
What—

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:25.340
This is what I'm talking about.

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:30.970
Sounds exciting out there.

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:06.940
Well, Gyoro-Gyoro, are the monsters 
we sent forth wreaking havoc?

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:12.830
Yes. We've lost some, but it appears 
that we still remain dominant.

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:15.620
The Hero Association is panicking.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.950
What is Goketsu doing?

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:20.530
It seems he's heading toward 
an event venue where

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:22.540
there's a martial arts tournament going on.

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:31.220
So far, our big victories include Demon 
Cyborg, Metal Bat, and Metal Knight.

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:35.720
And we still have our 
main forces on standby.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:39.310
Victory is certain for the 
Monster Association,

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:42.590
Monster King Orochi.

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:50.250
<b>Class S Heroes</b>
