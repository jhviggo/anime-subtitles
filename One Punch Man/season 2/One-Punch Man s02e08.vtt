WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.430
<b>Closing Ceremony</b>

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:04.400
Congratulations on your win, Suiryu!

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.880
We had a minor incident toward the end,

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.900
but in the end, you won, 
completely unscathed!

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.630
<i>Unscathed?</i>

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.400
<i>If he hadn't pulled his punch, I would've...</i>

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.410
<b>Announcement</b>

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.890
We now have an announcement 
for everyone here.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.200
There appear to be monsters 
outside right now,

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.910
Monsters?

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.880
so we ask that you do not leave the 
venue until the police give the all-clear.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.020
Again?

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.400
We'll be safe from the monsters in here.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.880
True.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.970
<i>There's no point in dwelling on it.</i>

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.420
<i>I just need to make sure
I never see that guy again.</i>

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.300
Hey, you're cute.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.290
Huh?

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.680
<i>I'm just going to take it easy.</i>

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.970
What's that?!

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.250
What is that?!

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.750
M-Monsters?!

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.110
Look! They're holding 
Rosie, Dave, and Bazuzu!

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.770
The contestants that were 
sent to the hospital..

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:54.950
I-I'm outta here!

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.240
You guys can deal with the monsters!

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.110
See ya!

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.300
Hey!

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.750
Are all the contestants here?

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.480
Look at all you runts. How far 
the martial arts world has fallen...

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.760
Well, whatever.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.970
You're all going to become monsters.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.110
<b>The Strong Ones Fight Back</b>

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.200
Even you trash fighters should be somewhat 
useful after you become monsters.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.240
Become monsters?

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.000
We pro heroes will put you in your place!

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.710
Way to go, heroes! Kick his ass!

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.000
Finished already?

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.010
With one hit?

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.670
I'm not here to kill you all today.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.850
I'm Goketsu, and I'm here on behalf 
of the Monster Association.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.680
Goketsu?!

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.390
You don't mean the previous 
Super Fight champion?!

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.560
If you know who I am, 
this shouldn't take too long.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.650
You must realize resistance is futile.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.970
But I heard that he was killed 
by a monster a few years ago!

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:39.990
So why...

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.960
It's true that I was defeated by 
a certain monster in the past,

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.540
and I was taken to their lair.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.930
But to my surprise, they made me an offer.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:57.100
In return for my cooperation,
they would grant all of my desires!

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:04.020
As a monster, I can surpass 
the limits I had as a human!

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.930
Do you understand what I'm saying? Right now,

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.890
I'm on a completely different level 
than the martial artist Goketsu!

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.060
Rejoice! I have something to give you.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.480
Eat those monster cells.

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:22.110
Then you can all become monsters.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.200
If you don't eat them, I'll just kill you.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.950
The Monster Association...

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.420
What do you want? Are you just 
out for murder and destruction?

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.380
<i>True, violence is a basic 
desire for monsters.</i>

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.550
<i>But that is not our only motive.</i>

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.870
We're trying to go one step higher.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.460
You can just stay there and watch for now,

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.830
<i>and observe how physically and 
mentally weak humans are.</i>

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.310
Choose.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.140
Die or become monsters.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.690
No, don't!

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.000
This is amazing!

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.390
I can feel the power and 
violence flow through me!

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.420
Hey, fatso!

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.250
You're gonna regret what you 
did to me during our match!

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.940
He's got superhuman strength now.

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.140
How interesting that even a peasant 
like him could gain such power.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.400
I should be able to awaken 
to the ultimate power,

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.800
given I'm the man with the 
world's most perfect genes.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.490
Choze, not you, too!

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.980
Not only did it improve 
my physical functioning,

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.790
but I can feel my subconscious 
limits falling away.

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.000
So this is how it feels to be 
a monster? Let's see...

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:03.990
Jakumen!

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.840
Now I'll definitely be able to kill that guy!

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:14.310
I'll make him pay for embarrassing 
me like that... with his death!

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.730
You didn't turn out too bad.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.400
We do have winners and losers, 
depending on what we're working with.

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.270
Go on. The rest of you filth 
need to eat those, too.

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.170
Please, spare me!

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:28.780
Benpats!

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.570
This is for survival.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:31.910
Hamukichi!

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.670
This is to become stronger!

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:35.370
Not you, too, Boltane!

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.920
I feel like I can do anything now!

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.820
This feels great!

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:50.420
They all turned into monsters!

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.890
Wh-Wh-What should we do?

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.010
Hey.

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.350
If I can chase those guys off, 
will you go on a date with me?

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:59.810
Great! That settles it.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.770
I'm going to relieve all that stress 
from the finals right now.

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.590
Oh? We actually have someone who 
dares defy us in this situation?

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:08.860
So be it.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.870
We're to eliminate anyone who dares to 
become an enemy of the Monster Association.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:14.460
Finish him!

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.080
You fool! You're nothing but a playboy!

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.870
You suddenly want to play hero now?

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.330
That's not it.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.500
It's just that you guys

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.300
are in the way...

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:31.150
of my fun lifestyle.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:02.540
Well, well... You're not half bad.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:04.080
Not half bad?

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.910
Your answer suggests you lack intelligence.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.810
What's that?

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:11.840
I've decided.

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:17.000
I'll remake this world with only 
those of my own choosing.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.850
And all of you fail.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.060
Begone.

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.140
This is nothing!

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.070
What?!

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:45.870
And in my eyes, you just failed.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:47.420
Entertain me a little more.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.380
You fool!

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:54.170
They're too fast! I can't see anything!

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:58.470
Dark Body Quake Tiger Fist!

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:05.850
Dark Body Phoenix Rising Fist!

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:13.360
Way to go!

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:17.830
Ouch... I haven't bled in a long time.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:20.620
This "monsterization" stuff sure is wild.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.660
They all became way stronger.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.840
You know, it would be a 
waste to just kill you.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.040
I'll still let you change your mind.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.770
The world will eventually 
belong to the monsters.

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:35.580
That means the strong can 
go as crazy as they want,

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.330
kill all they want, and enjoy true freedom.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.720
It'll be a world of blood and violence.

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.970
You can live an enjoyable life as a monster.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.640
Not a bad deal, is it?

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:49.560
Don't tell me...

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:51.770
I see.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.440
You're saying it doesn't matter 
what the world's like,

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.970
as long as you enjoy yourself...

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:06.040
Well, sorry... but the last thing 
I ever want to be is as ugly as you!

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.770
Dark Body Flying Dragon Fist!

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:09.790
Yes!

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.370
Then you get to die.

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:21.470
Watchdog Man!

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:23.160
You're awesome!

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.240
Thank you!

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.680
You really are the guardian deity of City Q!

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.860
<i>I guess he really is a Class S hero.</i>

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.810
<i>Just before I started my hunt, 
monsters suddenly attacked.</i>

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:38.380
<i>I was amazed at how powerful 
and fast he was in that battle,</i>

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.780
<i>but it's nothing.</i>

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.160
<i>I can deal with him just fine.</i>

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:47.950
<i>Watchdog Man, it's your turn to be hunted!</i>

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:54.290
Are you human, or are you a monster?

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.840
Fist of Flowing Water Crushed Rock!

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:00.930
I didn't say, "Shake!"

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:07.180
<i>He does have speed and 
power, if nothing else.</i>

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:11.520
<i>But he's inhuman!</i>

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.940
What? You done already?

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:17.650
Stand up. I'll give you three seconds.

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:21.510
Three, two, one...

00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:33.790
Good, good... Keep fighting back, 
as if your life depends on it!

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.380
<i>Damn it... He's not even flinching.</i>

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:41.340
<i>What do I do?</i>

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.340
You can take care of those guys, too.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:52.620
<i>Well, this isn't good...</i>

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:55.060
Come on, now, pay attention!

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:00.320
<i>It broke...</i>

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:03.300
Well? What's the matter?

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:08.290
Stand up. I'll give you three seconds.

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:12.660
Three, two, one...

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.590
Dark Body Quake Tiger Fist!

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:24.220
H-He caught my strongest attack?!

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:32.140
<i>He's strong...</i>

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.310
<i>He surpasses me in every way...</i>

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:40.900
<i>S-So this is... a monster?</i>

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:50.830
Hey, guys. You get some good grub today.

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:52.340
Enjoy your meal!

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.960
They were my disciples.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.420
But they were mentally weak,

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.840
so when they turned into monsters, 
they lost their sense of self.

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:06.590
Damn it!

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:10.930
<i>This isn't good!</i>

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:17.650
Hey, you! I'm in trouble here! 
Lend me a hand!

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:20.650
Suiryu.

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:24.900
After observing the finals, 
I've realized that you're stronger than me.

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:29.510
There's no way that I can 
beat you. I'll admit that.

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:33.080
But now, you're on the verge of death.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.670
How ironic.

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:37.330
You may have taken the top 
position in human society,

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:40.140
but you don't stand a chance 
against these monsters.

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:42.980
That's why I'm asking for your help!

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:43.920
I've made up my mind.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.300
I'm going to become a monster, as well.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:51.300
You can just die right here.

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:55.500
I give up on becoming the 
world's strongest person.

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:59.820
I'll aim to be the ultimate 
being on the next level!

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.590
Jeez, he actually ate all of them.

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:03.730
You greedy bastard.

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:08.100
Shut up! I'll shut that trap 
of yours myself in a moment.

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:13.080
Looks like your body's not holding up.

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:16.810
You've failed to become a monster.

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:21.210
Now, then... You're 
finally the only one left.

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.420
<b>Hero Association Hospital</b>

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:29.850
<i>There are patients up ahead in 
the ICU that can't be moved!</i>

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.300
<i>As a hero, I can't back down!</i>

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.990
In the end, heroes are only human.

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:38.770
You're only worth being 
oppressed by us monsters.

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:45.000
Everyone ran off,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.870
or they were defeated.

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:51.660
Good for you. Now you can cry and 
scream without anyone seeing you.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:55.120
Go on. Let me hear you scream.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.490
Coiling Defense!

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.170
Lightning Kick!

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:05.530
Snek! Max!

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:06.460
You're okay!

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:10.720
But why... Why did you come back?

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:12.930
To help.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:17.100
Now that we're dressed like 
this, we're the real deal.

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:22.060
This suit is strong against 
monster claws, fangs, and beaks.

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.670
It's a battle suit!

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:26.990
I'm also wearing my lightning shoes!

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:29.570
Now we can really show 
you what we're made of!

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:31.820
We're up against three opponents, though.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.140
Can we leave one of them to you?

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:34.990
Yeah!

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:46.090
You guys are lifesavers. Thank you!

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:48.940
Tank-Top Tackle!

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:56.140
That was an amazing tackle...

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:59.060
Don't try so hard when you're 
not wearing a tank-top.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:01.610
Can you stand, Mumen Rider?

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:02.350
Yeah.

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:03.980
I sure can.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.450
All right... My legs can still move.

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:09.820
Now, let's get out of here.

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:14.100
Why are you taking fighting 
stances, you two?

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:16.410
We'll hold him back.

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:17.780
Use that chance to run.

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:21.000
You can't be serious! 
You guys don't stand a chance!

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.190
I mean, you two were lower than me...

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:28.170
<i>You're kidding... Aren't you scared?</i>

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:37.680
This is my last chance!

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:41.270
I need to run! Run! Run! Run!

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.090
Where do you think you're going?!

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:47.810
Things are just getting interesting!

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:56.920
Oh? I guess this one was a winner after all.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.740
It looks like you're the same 
threat level as me: Dragon.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.230
Of course I am!

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:06.880
Oh? You're still trying to stand?

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:18.820
Our first objective...

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:24.680
Let the monsters run wild to show 
the humans how terrifying we are.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.330
That part is going very well.

00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:29.500
No place is safe anymore.

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:33.340
Everything is enveloped 
in uneasiness and fear.

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:35.300
Objective number two...

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:39.620
Kidnapping someone connected 
to the Hero Association.

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:41.510
That was also a success.

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:44.660
We managed to kidnap the son 
of one of their executives.

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:47.070
And objective number three...

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:49.630
Turning worthy humans into monsters.

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:51.130
This is also going well.

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:53.980
Nyaan infiltrated a prison

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:59.050
and monsterized a bunch of violent 
inmates, and is heading back here.

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:02.640
It appears Goketsu has turned some of 
the martial artists into monsters, as well.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:06.150
That should also bring us 
some worthy monsters.

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:09.550
It appears Goketsu is still...

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:13.250
Hey, Goketsu. Come back.

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:17.310
If multiple Class S heroes show up, 
even you will end up with broken bones.

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:18.990
Don't underestimate me.

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:21.700
But I'm done here, anyway.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:23.540
Hey, newbie.

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:24.730
Huh?

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:27.000
I'll take you to our hideout. Come with me.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:32.590
Don't you dare order me around!

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:43.340
Just listen.

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:47.460
There are a number of monsters, 
including me, who are stronger than you.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.310
Don't let your head get too big.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:53.460
Are the other monsters heading 
back to the hideout, as well?

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:56.110
That means the heroes, 
including Class S heroes,

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:58.950
will head toward any remaining monsters.

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:01.320
A simpleton like you 
wouldn't stand a chance.

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:05.290
I've given you a warning. 
Now, I'm heading back.

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:09.290
The outskirts of City Z.

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:11.250
That's where you can find us.

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.260
Did you hear that, Suiryu?

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.710
There's a ton of monsters.

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:18.510
Hilarious, isn't it?

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:21.470
That guy's punch freaked me out.

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:25.740
Yeah, I'm done trying to be the strongest.

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:28.060
S-Say, Bakuzan...

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:31.310
I have no intention of fighting anymore.

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:35.490
Please... Just let me go.

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:39.370
You see, Suiryu...

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:43.950
S-Stop...

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:47.830
I've always been a guy who loved 
hurting those weaker than me!

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:51.410
That's the only reason I 
wanted to become stronger!

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:56.920
Now that I'm free, I feel great!

00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:59.880
Let's go for another!

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:04.340
Wow, the great Suiryu 
actually screamed in agony.

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:07.760
It's too bad we don't have 
an audience to witness this.

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:15.610
Youth, talent, popularity, 
money, women, and freedom.

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:19.460
Don't you think you're a bit 
greedy to have all of that?

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:25.910
I'll let you taste a bit of hell 
before you die to make up for it!

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:31.290
You're pathetic, Champion.

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.180
Someone!

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:37.790
Help me!

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:39.510
A monster!

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:42.610
There's a monster here!

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:44.650
Isn't there anyone who can help me?!

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:47.480
I'm being attacked by a monster!

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:48.990
Please!

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:52.190
Heroes... Right! Heroes!

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:55.690
If you can hear me, please come here!

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:59.610
Heroes! Please come!

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:02.230
There's a monster here...

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:03.750
Heroes...

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:06.890
No one's going to hear you.

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:08.450
No heroes are going to come.

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:10.910
You're going to die!

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:14.370
No one stands a chance against this guy...

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:17.080
No matter how strong some heroes may be...

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:22.090
But, please... Rise up once again...

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:29.020
<i>When people find themselves in 
darkness, they seek the light.</i>

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:35.060
<i>It doesn't matter how faint 
or small that light is.</i>

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:39.560
<i>As long as it's there, there's hope...</i>

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.820
This is what you call despair.

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:55.080
Who the hell are you?

00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:59.290
I'm a hero.

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:04.260
I heard you call for help, Suiryu.

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:07.220
You did well on your own.

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:09.720
Leave the rest to me.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:50.250
<b>The Ultimate Dilemma</b>
