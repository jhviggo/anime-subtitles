01:24.056 --> 01:29.099
SOLO LEVELING

01:32.099 --> 01:34.078
Excuse me, Chief Woo.

01:35.083 --> 01:36.087
What is it?

01:36.087 --> 01:38.054
Please take a look at this.

01:38.054 --> 01:43.003
This is a report on the six Hunters
who died in a C-Rank dungeon.

01:43.003 --> 01:45.075
The survivors are a D-Rank
and an E-Rank Hunter.

01:46.009 --> 01:47.042
Looks like they ran away.

01:47.042 --> 01:48.084
It happens all the time.

01:48.084 --> 01:52.097
No, they didn't run, but they managed
to kill the Boss and escaped.

01:54.001 --> 01:58.001
The D-Rank Hunter Yoo Jinho
had quite expensive equipment.

01:58.001 --> 01:59.043
It's not surprising that they—

01:59.043 --> 02:00.073
What do you want to say?

02:00.073 --> 02:03.039
Investigate it yourself
if you think it's suspicious.

02:03.039 --> 02:04.065
No...

02:04.065 --> 02:07.032
It's just one of the survivors

02:07.032 --> 02:09.086
is the survivor from the Double Dungeon,

02:09.086 --> 02:12.002
Hunter Sung Jinwoo.

02:12.002 --> 02:13.024
Sung Jinwoo?

02:18.037 --> 02:20.083
And one of the six who died

02:20.083 --> 02:22.065
is Hunter Hwang Dongsuk.

02:24.054 --> 02:27.025
The brother of
Hunter Hwang Dongsoo, huh?

02:28.034 --> 02:30.038
Then it is indeed concerning...

02:31.092 --> 02:33.017
I'm back.

02:33.017 --> 02:34.063
Welcome home.

02:34.063 --> 02:35.026
Eh?

02:35.061 --> 02:37.001
Ah, souvenirs?

02:37.001 --> 02:38.039
It's fried chicken!

02:38.039 --> 02:39.064
Did something good happen?

02:40.001 --> 02:43.012
I'm not sure if it's a good thing.

02:43.094 --> 02:47.005
I've saved up for Mom's medical
bills and our living expenses.

02:47.077 --> 02:50.063
That's unusual for my stingy
brother to spend money.

02:52.024 --> 02:53.024
Oh, right.

02:54.065 --> 02:57.003
What happened last time?

02:57.003 --> 02:57.091
What?

02:57.091 --> 02:58.007
The raid mission.

02:58.099 --> 03:00.049
They paid you a lot, right?

03:00.049 --> 03:02.091
But you didn't seem
to have any injuries,

03:02.091 --> 03:05.059
so I thought your companions
must be strong.

03:08.067 --> 03:11.032
Well, yeah.

03:11.032 --> 03:14.037
So you guys killed
the enemies easily, right?

03:15.009 --> 03:16.093
Yes, that was easy.

03:17.039 --> 03:19.038
Regardless of the difference in strength,

03:20.039 --> 03:24.000
at that moment,
I had no hesitation.

03:24.064 --> 03:25.035
Moreover,

03:25.085 --> 03:28.065
I didn't even despise them.

03:29.073 --> 03:32.086
If it were the old me,
I would have tried to run away.

03:33.069 --> 03:36.007
Has my bravery increased with my level?

03:37.003 --> 03:38.078
But my opponents aren't magic beasts.

03:39.028 --> 03:40.049
They are people...

03:41.066 --> 03:43.004
Brother?

03:43.041 --> 03:45.029
You okay? Are you feeling sick?

03:46.004 --> 03:49.038
I thought the clerk didn't give me
the change, but I was mistaken.

03:49.038 --> 03:50.005
What?

03:50.005 --> 03:53.013
Seriously, don't scare me.

03:57.097 --> 03:59.047
Don't think about that now.

03:59.047 --> 04:02.031
I must keep getting
stronger for my family.

04:02.031 --> 04:03.014
And I mustn't die.

04:04.001 --> 04:06.081
If the same thing happens again,
I will do just the same.

04:08.064 --> 04:09.073
What is this?

04:09.073 --> 04:11.023
Harmful substance?

04:13.098 --> 04:15.016
Is it detoxifying me?

04:19.011 --> 04:20.062
Thanks for the food.

04:21.095 --> 04:23.003
Are you done eating?

04:23.003 --> 04:24.058
Then I'll eat it all up.

04:24.058 --> 04:27.002
Then don't complain
if you getting fat.

04:38.051 --> 04:39.088
I can't get drunk at all.

04:40.059 --> 04:43.097
The system's special ability
has broken down the alcohol.

04:44.039 --> 04:46.006
Is it the effect of some skill?

04:48.002 --> 04:50.039
SECRET QUEST: COURAGE OF THE WEAK
Blessing...

04:50.039 --> 04:52.000
Health and longevity...

04:52.094 --> 04:57.041
Improved my regenerative capacity
and disabled toxic and abnormal conditions...

04:58.007 --> 04:59.068
This is it.

04:59.068 --> 05:01.091
The reward for the Double Dungeon mission.

05:01.091 --> 05:04.066
So much has happened,
so I never bothered to check.

05:05.045 --> 05:08.045
Is this why my limbs could regenerate?

05:09.062 --> 05:11.068
There are many things
I'm unclear about.

05:17.042 --> 05:18.059
Brother.

05:18.059 --> 05:20.088
Someone named Yoo Jinho
called for you.

05:20.088 --> 05:21.088
Huh?

05:23.093 --> 05:24.085
I'll be right there.

05:26.022 --> 05:27.064
You've drank too much.

05:27.064 --> 05:29.006
Alcohol is poison to the body.

05:29.006 --> 05:30.056
I'm fine.

05:33.077 --> 05:36.027
Even if I became a doctor,
I wouldn't treat you.

05:36.027 --> 05:37.015
CAFE PENE

05:37.015 --> 05:39.069
Sorry for suddenly calling you out.

05:39.099 --> 05:41.078
I didn't expect to see you again.

05:41.078 --> 05:43.041
I'm really happy.

05:43.041 --> 05:45.066
You saved my life after all, Jinwoo.

05:45.095 --> 05:49.087
Thanks for giving me the magic gem too.
You helped a lot.

05:50.062 --> 05:52.008
And thank you,

05:52.008 --> 05:53.096
for keeping quiet about that "incident."

05:55.013 --> 05:58.084
T-That's because they tried to kill us first!

05:59.003 --> 06:00.046
It was self-defense.

06:01.092 --> 06:03.088
So, what did you want from me?

06:05.055 --> 06:07.051
Sir, I plan to build an attack te—

06:07.051 --> 06:08.051
I refuse.

06:08.051 --> 06:09.052
Huh?

06:09.052 --> 06:10.076
U-Umm...

06:10.076 --> 06:12.006
At least hear me out first.

06:12.052 --> 06:15.006
I'm not interested in
hanging out with a rich guy.

06:16.025 --> 06:17.006
20 times!

06:17.006 --> 06:18.023
No...

06:18.023 --> 06:20.015
Just 19 times!

06:20.015 --> 06:21.053
19 times?

06:21.094 --> 06:23.053
You want to be a Guild Master?

06:24.003 --> 06:25.091
Please let me finish first.

06:25.091 --> 06:26.074
Please!

06:32.046 --> 06:33.006
Go on then.

06:35.005 --> 06:36.063
Yes!

06:38.013 --> 06:39.075
As you speculated,

06:39.075 --> 06:42.059
I want to obtain
the Guild Master's license.

06:42.059 --> 06:44.034
One of the conditions

06:44.034 --> 06:47.051
is that a Hunter must participate
in raid missions at least 20 times.

06:47.051 --> 06:49.058
And the last mission was my first one.

06:50.047 --> 06:52.089
To take over the company,
I've studied hard.

06:52.089 --> 06:54.073
So I'm confident about the written exam.

06:55.014 --> 06:55.077
But...

06:56.027 --> 06:57.048
My real combat skills...

06:58.093 --> 07:01.061
Aren't you the second young
master of Yoojin Construction?

07:02.036 --> 07:05.007
I'm also doing this for our company.

07:05.053 --> 07:08.057
Honestly, my father wants
to establish a guild.

07:08.057 --> 07:10.087
Yoojin Construction
wants to establish a guild?

07:10.087 --> 07:12.004
Yes.

07:13.087 --> 07:18.005
Dungeons are certainly dangerous,
but they contain many rare treasures.

07:19.013 --> 07:22.046
Magic gems and mana crystals
are just a part of it.

07:22.046 --> 07:25.072
The bodies of high-rank beasts can
be used as materials for equipment.

07:26.076 --> 07:30.003
One can say that everything
in the dungeon can be monetized.

07:30.064 --> 07:34.077
You plan to have your own Hunters conquer
the dungeons and take all the spoils,

07:34.077 --> 07:36.073
so as to establish
a self-sufficient system?

07:36.098 --> 07:38.055
That's right.

07:38.055 --> 07:41.036
My father plans to hire an S-Rank
Hunter to be the Guild Master

07:41.036 --> 07:43.032
and my brother as the Vice-Guild Master

07:43.032 --> 07:45.007
to run the guild like a company.

07:45.007 --> 07:46.004
A S-Rank Hunter?

07:46.004 --> 07:48.041
There are only seven of them nationally.

07:48.041 --> 07:49.032
Yes.

07:49.091 --> 07:53.045
Moreover, Min Byung-Gu,
the only one who hasn't joined a guild,

07:53.045 --> 07:54.091
has already retired.

07:55.002 --> 07:57.062
Are you planning to poach
from other guilds?

07:59.083 --> 08:01.088
I advise you not to do that.

08:01.088 --> 08:04.051
The guilds that you poach
from will give you trouble.

08:04.051 --> 08:07.008
My brother is not one of the Awakened,
so he can't be the Guild Master.

08:08.043 --> 08:11.043
So you want to gain experience
and become the Guild Master

08:11.043 --> 08:13.001
to compete with your brother?

08:13.064 --> 08:16.093
If you want to hide your power
and participate in missions,

08:16.093 --> 08:18.039
you will need companions.

08:18.077 --> 08:20.094
Rather than teaming up
with high-ranked Hunters,

08:20.094 --> 08:23.065
completing the raid missions
with an E-Rank Hunter

08:23.065 --> 08:25.036
would be more convincing to my father.

08:27.032 --> 08:28.095
You are at least B-Rank...

08:28.095 --> 08:31.024
No, it might even be higher.

08:31.024 --> 08:34.012
Teaming up with
the wrong one could be fatal.

08:34.012 --> 08:35.029
But if it's you...

08:39.067 --> 08:40.067
Take a look at this.

08:42.029 --> 08:44.055
This building is planned
to be the guild's office.

08:44.055 --> 08:47.001
It's currently valued at 30 billion.

08:48.047 --> 08:51.022
This is the reward I am offering you.

08:51.084 --> 08:54.056
30 billion for 19 C-Rank missions.

08:54.097 --> 08:57.018
Before, I would have accepted right away.

08:57.006 --> 08:58.043
But...

08:59.014 --> 09:03.011
If I'm the only one in the world
who can level up, that's a different story.

09:03.004 --> 09:05.078
If I keep developing like this,

09:05.078 --> 09:07.036
someday I will be S-Rank...

09:07.036 --> 09:08.036
No,

09:08.036 --> 09:10.057
I may be even higher than that.

09:11.045 --> 09:14.074
In that case, 30 billion seems trivial.

09:14.074 --> 09:15.095
More importantly,

09:15.095 --> 09:17.066
teaming up with people

09:17.066 --> 09:21.079
without understanding
the impact of leveling up

09:21.079 --> 09:23.029
is too risky.

09:23.092 --> 09:24.077
Sorry.

09:28.096 --> 09:30.034
Please wait!

09:31.047 --> 09:33.018
As long as you help me,

09:33.018 --> 09:35.047
I will keep this secret
for you for a lifetime.

09:49.078 --> 09:52.078
I want the information
on those two survivors.

09:52.078 --> 09:54.007
Bring me their documents immediately.

09:57.054 --> 09:58.066
Excuse me.

09:59.007 --> 10:01.004
I have brought the documents.

10:01.004 --> 10:01.096
Mr. Hwang.

10:05.004 --> 10:07.009
My brother was killed.

10:09.008 --> 10:11.034
This has not been confirmed...

10:11.034 --> 10:12.038
The documents?

10:13.093 --> 10:15.043
Yes, right here.

10:16.043 --> 10:20.014
Laura, what would happen if I killed
someone in another country?

10:21.006 --> 10:22.014
Are you serious?

10:27.094 --> 10:32.036
In a country with a treaty regarding
Hunter crimes, you would be prosecuted

10:32.036 --> 10:34.032
under that country's laws.

10:34.078 --> 10:36.091
But if there's no extradition treaty,

10:36.091 --> 10:39.041
you would be subject to
the laws of our own country.

10:40.037 --> 10:41.033
So...

10:41.079 --> 10:45.012
Depending on negotiations with
the government, there might be leniency.

10:46.058 --> 10:48.054
Adjust my schedule.

10:48.092 --> 10:52.051
Sudden changes in schedule will affect
the operation of the guild.

10:53.013 --> 10:54.047
What's my schedule like?

10:54.093 --> 10:56.051
It's fully booked for now.

10:57.064 --> 10:59.085
Then clear it for later.

11:00.022 --> 11:01.043
I understand.

11:02.001 --> 11:03.052
I will arrange it.

11:04.039 --> 11:06.069
D-Rank Hunter Yoo Jinho.

11:07.056 --> 11:09.077
E-Rank Hunter Sung Jinwoo.

11:12.009 --> 11:16.066
I just hope you both
are still alive until then.

11:21.054 --> 11:24.037
It's rare to see you exercising.

11:24.037 --> 11:28.008
Studying all the time
is harmful to health, right?

11:28.008 --> 11:30.047
Oh? You ate too much fried chicken, right?

11:32.013 --> 11:32.083
Hmph!

11:38.026 --> 11:39.018
Hey.

11:39.018 --> 11:41.043
If you had 30 billion,
what would you do?

11:41.083 --> 11:43.014
Why are you asking?

11:43.042 --> 11:44.054
Just a random question.

11:45.018 --> 11:48.095
Pay mom's medical bills
and college tuition fees.

11:48.095 --> 11:49.061
And the rest?

11:50.019 --> 11:51.009
Hmm...

11:51.009 --> 11:52.057
Save it up.

11:53.003 --> 11:55.065
I don't know.
That's too much money.

11:55.065 --> 11:56.065
Hmm.

11:57.002 --> 11:58.028
That's true.

11:59.024 --> 12:00.082
Just keep up at your own pace.

12:00.082 --> 12:01.007
Eh?

12:01.007 --> 12:03.066
Wait, brother!

12:07.000 --> 12:09.033
Even as an E-Rank one,
he is still a Hunter.

12:13.088 --> 12:14.092
Yes...

12:15.097 --> 12:16.092
No, don't check.

12:18.059 --> 12:19.083
11 kilometers?

12:20.072 --> 12:23.064
Why are the numbers exceeding
when I accomplish the goal?

12:28.081 --> 12:29.085
I see.

12:30.052 --> 12:32.048
Then let's see how far I can go.

12:36.078 --> 12:38.015
Brother...

12:38.015 --> 12:40.061
I finally caught up...

12:41.028 --> 12:43.003
I'll have another lap.

12:43.003 --> 12:44.015
Eh?!

12:50.037 --> 12:52.005
It stopped at twice the goal.

12:52.005 --> 12:53.079
Then the rest...

12:59.055 --> 13:00.097
SECRET QUEST:
STRENGTH TRAINING HAS ARRIVED

13:01.051 --> 13:05.006
The daily quest became the secret quest?

13:06.006 --> 13:06.091
Yes.

13:08.001 --> 13:10.077
I can choose different boxes.

13:11.004 --> 13:14.073
CURSED RANDOM LOOT BOX
Guess I'll choose Blessed Random Loot Box.

13:29.029 --> 13:30.046
A key again?

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
The Demon's Castle...

13:35.000 --> 13:36.088
Acquisition difficulty of S-Rank?!

13:45.051 --> 13:47.097
Cures all illnesses with powerful magic...

13:48.093 --> 13:50.056
...Elixir of Life!

13:58.098 --> 14:01.003
If that Elixir of Life

14:01.003 --> 14:04.011
really can cure all illnesses...

14:06.002 --> 14:07.041
I've decided.

14:15.099 --> 14:19.008
If the acquisition difficulty of the key
is proportional to the difficulty of dungeon,

14:19.008 --> 14:21.055
then I am opening an S-Rank dungeon.

14:22.055 --> 14:23.055
If so,

14:23.081 --> 14:26.047
what awaits me inside will be magic beasts

14:26.047 --> 14:29.047
similar to those on Jeju Island
that even S-Rank Hunters can't handle.

14:38.057 --> 14:41.019
With my current strength,

14:41.065 --> 14:43.095
can I deal with beasts of that level?

14:49.089 --> 14:51.083
It'd be a lie to say I'm not scared.

14:53.008 --> 14:54.075
If things don't go well,

14:54.075 --> 14:57.096
I will use this teleportation stone
I got from the Instant Dungeon.

15:05.088 --> 15:07.068
If I give up, everything is over.

15:08.003 --> 15:09.097
I need to become stronger,

15:09.097 --> 15:11.064
to level up even higher.

15:11.064 --> 15:13.081
HELL'S GATEKEEPER CERBERUS
I must take back everything.

15:15.019 --> 15:17.081
How could I die here?

15:17.081 --> 15:18.077
TITLE: WOLF ASSASSIN

15:25.045 --> 15:27.045
ACTIVE SKILL: DASH

15:39.088 --> 15:41.059
I can hardly inflict any damage.

15:41.059 --> 15:44.009
The gap is still so huge
after I use the title skills?

15:45.047 --> 15:46.034
ACTIVE SKILL: MURDEROUS INTENT

15:50.089 --> 15:52.047
THE DEBUFF HAS BEEN CANCELED OUT
It's useless!

15:56.048 --> 15:57.056
DEBUFF: PARALYSIS. DRAIN.

15:59.098 --> 16:01.011
THE DEBUFF HAS BEEN CANCELED OUT

16:23.067 --> 16:24.063
A warning?

16:25.017 --> 16:27.051
A third of my HP was gone in an instant!

16:32.068 --> 16:33.081
HELL'S GATEKEEPER CERBERUS
HAS USED SKILL: RAGE

16:33.081 --> 16:35.001
ALL ABILITIES +100% WITHIN THREE MINUTES

16:35.001 --> 16:36.027
All abilities doubled?

16:40.069 --> 16:42.002
So fast...

16:46.024 --> 16:47.053
Only a half left?!

16:49.024 --> 16:50.041
There's no other way.

16:50.041 --> 16:51.074
Full Recovery!

16:57.033 --> 16:58.054
I stabbed it.

16:58.054 --> 17:00.000
NOTIFICATION:
THE ENEMY DOES NOT FEEL PAIN.

17:00.000 --> 17:00.096
What?

17:25.073 --> 17:27.011
ACTIVE SKILL: WILLPOWER
HP: 30% OR LESS, BUFF: DAMAGE -50%

17:42.087 --> 17:44.084
The warnings keep popping up.

17:45.021 --> 17:49.001
The system issues warnings at critical
moments to prevent my death

17:49.055 --> 17:51.003
because I am a player?

17:51.093 --> 17:53.022
No matter what,

17:53.022 --> 17:56.001
this thing can't be
an ordinary second awakening.

17:56.085 --> 18:00.015
I must hold on for at least
3 minutes until its skill ends...

18:00.073 --> 18:02.048
No, this is too dangerous.

18:04.048 --> 18:05.027
I must use—

18:20.034 --> 18:22.069
What can I do to survive?

18:23.087 --> 18:26.038
A few more hits and I'll be dead.

18:26.074 --> 18:28.015
Is there any way?

18:29.062 --> 18:30.088
The shop...

18:30.088 --> 18:32.009
I completely forgot it!

18:32.009 --> 18:33.009
EXCLUSIVE HEALING POTION, 300G.

18:33.009 --> 18:34.003
WOULD YOU LIKE TO PURCHASE
EXCLUSIVE HEALING POTION?

18:34.003 --> 18:35.091
One bottle costs 300 gold coins...

18:36.003 --> 18:37.052
3 bottles.

18:43.056 --> 18:45.065
One bottle only restores
100 points of HP?

18:46.002 --> 18:47.028
This is simply...

18:49.057 --> 18:50.069
Poison?

18:51.036 --> 18:53.078
You've drank too much.
Alcohol is poison to the body.

18:53.078 --> 18:55.049
I'm fine.

18:57.037 --> 18:58.007
I have to do this.

19:16.064 --> 19:17.068
Okay.

19:28.004 --> 19:29.052
It's not over yet!

19:30.098 --> 19:32.032
I can still move!

19:37.032 --> 19:38.087
Its skill effect has ended!

21:10.000 --> 21:13.017
YOU HAVE DEFEATED
THE HELL'S GATEKEEPER CERBERUS

21:28.035 --> 21:29.077
Is this the item I obtained?

21:30.006 --> 21:31.098
Another key?

21:32.048 --> 21:36.032
Is this the door that
Cerberus was guarding?

21:37.019 --> 21:38.015
What is this?

21:41.086 --> 21:43.032
FORMULA: ELIXIR OF LIFE

21:43.078 --> 21:46.091
The pattern for the Elixir of Life...

21:46.091 --> 21:50.083
THREE ITEMS ARE NEEDED
TO CRAFT ELIXIR OF LIFE.

21:50.083 --> 21:53.033
This experience made me
understand my current strength.

21:54.008 --> 21:57.000
Entering the castle at my current level
would surely mean death.

21:57.042 --> 21:58.002
But...

21:59.017 --> 22:01.003
I will return in the near future.

22:02.022 --> 22:03.043
Definitely.

23:37.044 --> 23:41.048
EPISODE 8: THIS IS FRUSTRATING
