00:11.610 --> 00:12.940
<i>If...</i>

00:23.510 --> 00:25.840
<i>If I had one more chance...</i>

00:33.850 --> 00:35.190
<i>A hospital?</i>

00:38.490 --> 00:39.480
<i>My arm's intact.</i>

00:48.340 --> 00:49.560
<i>My legs, too.</i>

00:51.930 --> 00:54.860
<i>I was stabbed through the chest, 
but there's no trace of it.</i>

00:55.370 --> 00:57.940
Was it just... a dream?

01:00.860 --> 01:03.630
Oh, I see you're awake.

01:04.290 --> 01:05.480
Excuse me...

01:07.440 --> 01:11.060
I'm Woo Jinchul, manager of the 
Hunter's Association Surveillance Team.

01:11.060 --> 01:12.300
I'm Kang Taeshik.

01:12.660 --> 01:16.020
What's someone from 
Surveillance want with me?

01:16.530 --> 01:19.100
For now, let's get your doctor in here.

02:51.970 --> 02:55.040
I was unconscious for three days?

02:55.690 --> 02:59.110
What about Joohee and Mr. Song? 
Are they okay?

02:59.110 --> 03:00.950
Yes. Although...

03:01.910 --> 03:04.620
Song Chiyul lost an arm, and as a result,

03:04.620 --> 03:07.230
he may have to retire as a hunter.

03:08.470 --> 03:13.010
And Lee Joohee's been traumatized. 
She's undergoing psychiatric care.

03:13.610 --> 03:17.760
Given her condition, I'm not sure 
she'll continue as a hunter, either.

03:24.720 --> 03:30.440
There were only six survivors of the double 
dungeon discovered on your expedition.

03:31.230 --> 03:34.200
A hunter's job is always a dangerous one,

03:34.200 --> 03:36.630
but it's rare to see such a tragic outcome.

03:37.610 --> 03:40.200
And yet, somehow,

03:41.630 --> 03:47.260
when the White Tiger Guild arrived on the 
scene after being alerted by the survivors,

03:51.560 --> 03:54.700
all they found was you, Sung Jinwoo, 
collapsed on the ground.

03:54.700 --> 03:58.930
There were no traces of the temple or 
the statues the survivors described.

03:58.930 --> 04:00.060
But that's...

04:00.060 --> 04:01.720
Unbelievable, isn't it?

04:03.690 --> 04:06.930
If there had been the slightest 
inconsistency between their reports,

04:07.470 --> 04:10.990
or if some of the deceased's remains 
hadn't been found on the scene,

04:10.990 --> 04:13.760
it would've cast suspicion 
onto your group instead.

04:15.850 --> 04:16.810
Incidentally...

04:17.660 --> 04:20.060
This is just speculation on our part, but...

04:21.740 --> 04:23.440
Sung Jinwoo...

04:23.440 --> 04:27.450
Have you experienced a second awakening?

04:28.910 --> 04:31.210
<i>A second awakening?</i>

04:33.590 --> 04:36.660
<i>A hunter's power is determined upon awakening,</i>

04:36.660 --> 04:38.400
<i>and it never changes from that point on.</i>

04:38.890 --> 04:42.490
<i>But... on rare occasions, a hunter 
can go through a second awakening.</i>

04:43.480 --> 04:47.060
<i>It lets them exceed their previous limits 
and rise to A or even S-Rank...</i>

04:47.690 --> 04:49.550
<i>Maybe I could, too!</i>

04:51.340 --> 04:52.770
This is a mana meter.

04:53.280 --> 04:55.280
Please place your hand over it.

04:56.810 --> 05:01.530
<i>If they really ran into instakill-level 
magic beasts, like the survivors said,</i>

05:01.530 --> 05:03.900
<i>then there's no way a low-level hunter 
could have survived.</i>

05:04.270 --> 05:07.100
<i>And for not even a trace 
to remain of said beasts</i>

05:07.100 --> 05:10.870
<i>would imply the presence of an A-Rank—
maybe even S-Rank hunter.</i>

05:11.550 --> 05:14.950
<i>The most likely explanation is that 
Sung Jinwoo underwent a second awakening.</i>

05:18.610 --> 05:19.750
What's it say?!

05:19.750 --> 05:22.240
If I've awakened again, 
what rank does it put me at now?

05:23.430 --> 05:27.260
My apologies. I'm afraid we 
may have been mistaken.

05:29.430 --> 05:32.610
Even E-Ranks usually manage higher than 70...

05:32.610 --> 05:34.430
He's basically just a civilian.

05:35.540 --> 05:38.660
<i>The dungeon has vanished 
and can't be explored again.</i>

05:39.490 --> 05:41.560
<i>So how did he survive?</i>

05:42.180 --> 05:45.250
Aw, man. I got my hopes up.

05:46.970 --> 05:50.830
<i>And I can't help but wonder why 
they didn't ask about this thing.</i>

05:53.110 --> 05:56.500
Maybe I'm the only one who can see it?

05:59.430 --> 06:01.430
<i>So it's not a touch panel, then.</i>

06:16.380 --> 06:18.540
<i>I remember something like this 
popping up before, too.</i>

06:20.150 --> 06:21.210
Jinah?

06:23.070 --> 06:26.990
You need to take better care of yourself! 
Do you know how worried I was?!

06:27.440 --> 06:28.670
Sorry...

06:28.670 --> 06:33.290
You always end up a mess, 
even when everyone else is fine!

06:33.290 --> 06:35.320
I get worried, okay?!

06:35.320 --> 06:38.290
<i>I can't believe I was prepared 
to leave her behind.</i>

06:35.320 --> 06:38.290
You were out for three whole days this time!

06:38.650 --> 06:40.320
What are you smiling about?

06:40.320 --> 06:44.010
The next time something like this happens, 
I'm gonna quit school and get a job

06:44.010 --> 06:46.120
so you don't have to be a hunter anymore!

06:46.120 --> 06:48.220
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

06:48.220 --> 06:50.610
But, Jinah... Can you see this?

06:50.990 --> 06:52.220
See what?

06:52.220 --> 06:53.790
Never mind. Sorry.

06:54.800 --> 06:59.130
Listen... You know how sometimes in a game, 
it says you have unread notifications?

06:59.130 --> 07:00.560
We're talking about games now?

07:00.560 --> 07:03.150
How do you manage to read them, usually?

07:03.150 --> 07:05.210
Should they be examining your head, too?

07:05.210 --> 07:07.900
Jinah, you used to play games 
all the time, remember?

07:07.900 --> 07:11.530
I mean, sure. You'd usually 
open your message box, right?

07:12.040 --> 07:14.610
Open the message box...

07:15.710 --> 07:17.440
Why bring up games all of a sudden?

07:17.440 --> 07:19.410
Well, y'know, not a lot to do in a hospital.

07:20.310 --> 07:22.980
<i>I remember this "Player" stuff 
being mentioned before...</i>

07:24.290 --> 07:27.020
Well, you seem fine, at least.

07:27.020 --> 07:27.920
I oughta go.

07:30.410 --> 07:32.240
Sorry about the wait, Song-yi.

07:33.470 --> 07:37.210
"This system is designed to assist 
the development of the Player."

07:37.210 --> 07:42.250
"Failure to comply with the system 
may result in a penalty..."

07:42.250 --> 07:43.940
"The rewards have been delivered"?

07:44.440 --> 07:46.750
I don't have a clue what 
this is supposed to mean.

07:48.010 --> 07:50.740
"Daily Quest: Strength Training."

07:50.740 --> 07:51.850
Confirm.

07:53.420 --> 07:56.570
Push-ups, sit-ups, squats, running...

07:56.970 --> 08:00.410
"Failure to complete the daily quest 
will result in an appropriate penalty"?

08:01.800 --> 08:05.630
What the hell? 
If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.

08:06.430 --> 08:09.580
I'm hospitalized. Where am I gonna 
get that kind of stamina?

08:10.270 --> 08:12.110
What in the world is going on?

08:13.900 --> 08:16.050
Regarding that hunter, Sung Jinwoo...

08:16.430 --> 08:20.060
It doesn't appear he's had 
a second awakening, Chairman Go.

08:20.330 --> 08:21.720
<i>I see.</i>

08:21.720 --> 08:27.110
<i>We're lucky this incident didn't result in a 
dungeon break, but something about it...</i>

08:27.110 --> 08:29.010
<i>It leaves too many unanswered questions.</i>

08:29.010 --> 08:32.490
Right. It's nothing like any previous case.

08:32.820 --> 08:35.610
<i>Even allowing for how dungeons 
tend to be full of mysteries....</i>

08:36.290 --> 08:39.100
<i>I think this'll need to be 
marked as a special case</i>

08:39.100 --> 08:41.870
<i>and entered into the databank 
for further evaluation.</i>

08:41.870 --> 08:43.390
Understood.

08:46.380 --> 08:48.300
It's gonna be a long day.

08:53.050 --> 08:58.260
I'd like you to participate in the next 
B-Rank raid as an instructor, Miss Cha.

08:58.590 --> 09:00.470
As an instructor?

09:00.770 --> 09:04.710
This raid is going to serve as a test 
and practical training for new recruits.

09:04.710 --> 09:05.890
Can you handle it?

09:05.890 --> 09:08.940
I have doubts about my ability as a mentor.

09:08.940 --> 09:12.120
All you need to do is fight 
how you normally do.

09:12.120 --> 09:14.460
Everyone will learn from your example.

09:14.460 --> 09:17.160
That's just how talented you are.

09:18.960 --> 09:23.940
The Hunters Guild is one of 
the five largest guilds in the country,

09:23.940 --> 09:26.270
but on an international level, 
we're unremarkable.

09:26.640 --> 09:29.600
And while individual ranks can't be increased,

09:29.600 --> 09:32.360
our collective combat ability can be honed,

09:33.380 --> 09:36.180
so that we'll be ready when the time comes.

09:43.240 --> 09:45.020
Another gate?

09:47.200 --> 09:49.940
In the middle of the damn road, too.

09:49.940 --> 09:51.700
When are the hunters gonna show up?

09:51.700 --> 09:53.770
I wish they'd take care of it already.

10:07.790 --> 10:09.260
A-An earthquake?!

10:20.850 --> 10:23.560
A... desert? What is happening?

10:24.490 --> 10:27.060
Am I dreaming? I was just in the hospital—

10:35.960 --> 10:37.570
Are you... kidding me?!

10:44.840 --> 10:45.860
Huh?

10:46.630 --> 10:48.100
Is something wrong?

10:48.100 --> 10:49.960
The patient from this room...

11:08.400 --> 11:10.750
How many of them are there, damn it?!

11:14.070 --> 11:16.060
Two more hours of this?!

11:16.530 --> 11:17.960
Any sign of him?

11:17.960 --> 11:19.240
No. Not where I looked.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.900
I think I'll check the room again.

11:21.900 --> 11:22.740
Good idea.

11:23.050 --> 11:26.080
I doubt he left the hospital...

11:29.450 --> 11:31.000
Can't... keep running...

11:56.320 --> 11:59.620
A penalty... quest?

12:03.040 --> 12:03.990
Mr. Sung?!

12:05.530 --> 12:07.730
Mr. Sung, are you all right?!

12:10.860 --> 12:13.450
Yeah, I'm healing nicely.

12:13.450 --> 12:15.880
I should be able to leave soon.

12:15.880 --> 12:16.930
<i>That's a relief.</i>

12:16.930 --> 12:21.080
<i>After all the worry you caused me, 
I'm expecting to be treated at Chagall.</i>

12:21.080 --> 12:23.580
Okay, okay, sure.

12:25.290 --> 12:27.210
All right, time to go.

12:29.740 --> 12:31.930
You want me... for a raid?

12:31.930 --> 12:36.600
<i>Yes. A D-Rank gate appeared 
in Hapjeong the other day,</i>

12:36.600 --> 12:39.380
<i>and all the guilds have prior engagements.</i>

12:40.610 --> 12:42.920
<i>I understand if you can't, of course.</i>

12:42.920 --> 12:46.430
<i>We understand what you've 
been through, Hunter Lee.</i>

12:46.430 --> 12:47.500
I'm sorry.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.250
<i>No apologies necessary.</i>

12:49.580 --> 12:53.760
<i>Oh, that said, I heard that 
Sung Jinwoo has woken up.</i>

12:53.760 --> 12:54.970
He has?!

13:02.310 --> 13:06.020
<i>Jinwoo... He's okay. That's wonderful!</i>

13:09.290 --> 13:11.460
Look. He's running again.

13:11.900 --> 13:16.110
Honestly... He's been at it every day 
since regaining consciousness.

13:18.980 --> 13:20.280
Jinwoo...

13:20.280 --> 13:24.250
I know hunters are supposed to heal 
faster than normal people, but...

13:24.250 --> 13:26.500
He says he's trying to get back into shape.

13:26.840 --> 13:29.180
And he doesn't listen when 
we tell him to take it easy.

13:29.180 --> 13:30.850
Even though he was badly
injured just a few days ago.

13:30.850 --> 13:32.460
He's a real handful.

13:34.300 --> 13:37.220
<i>It's been four days since 
I regained consciousness.</i>

13:37.220 --> 13:38.630
<i>I've figured out a few things.</i>

13:39.520 --> 13:42.800
<i>First, I'm not hallucinating these windows.</i>

13:43.950 --> 13:47.400
<i>When I complete the daily quest, 
I get three types of rewards.</i>

13:47.400 --> 13:49.070
Full recovery.

13:50.470 --> 13:52.970
All that exhaustion is gone in a flash.

13:54.780 --> 13:56.530
Next is the ability points.

13:56.880 --> 13:59.970
<i>I can distribute the points 
into whatever abilities I choose.</i>

14:00.670 --> 14:02.430
<i>I should probably go with strength, right?</i>

14:03.160 --> 14:06.080
<i>Upgrading my abilities makes me
that much more powerful.</i>

14:06.080 --> 14:09.120
<i>I can literally tell that 
I've got more strength now.</i>

14:09.120 --> 14:12.050
<i>I've also got these skill 
and inventory screens.</i>

14:12.460 --> 14:16.220
<i>My world's taken a real turn 
for the strange.</i>

14:17.400 --> 14:19.090
It's like a game!

14:26.150 --> 14:30.160
<i>And my final daily quest reward... 
the random loot box.</i>

14:30.160 --> 14:31.890
<i>I wonder what it'll be today?</i>

14:39.540 --> 14:40.560
A key?

14:43.090 --> 14:47.410
I've only gotten useless stuff like 
pens and bandages so far...

14:48.500 --> 14:51.590
An instance dungeon? What's that?

14:54.010 --> 14:58.170
Based on what's happened so far, it'll be 
some kind of event to help me get stronger...

15:01.950 --> 15:04.840
<i>And now a report on today's gate conditions.</i>

15:04.840 --> 15:08.850
<i>New D-Rank gates have appeared at these locations.</i>

15:09.180 --> 15:13.720
<i>The C-Rank gates in the Upper East and 
Midtown areas are currently being dealt with.</i>

15:14.280 --> 15:17.880
<i>The B-Rank gate that appeared 
in the wharf district the other day</i>

15:17.880 --> 15:22.360
<i>is scheduled to be raided within 
a few days by the Hunters Guild.</i>

15:22.360 --> 15:26.380
<i>Expect traffic delays as a result.</i>

15:27.160 --> 15:28.600
That was a really long line, huh?

15:28.600 --> 15:30.360
It's supposed to be for sweets.

15:30.670 --> 15:33.720
Understood. I'll head back to the office.

15:43.310 --> 15:44.510
Mom!

15:44.810 --> 15:46.010
Mom, wake up!

15:46.010 --> 15:47.430
What happened?!

15:47.430 --> 15:50.390
It's Mom... She won't respond!

15:51.910 --> 15:53.350
Eternal Sleep Disease?

15:53.350 --> 15:56.910
It's also known as Final Rest.

15:56.910 --> 16:00.070
It's a disease that came into existence 
with the appearance of the gates.

16:00.070 --> 16:03.320
It affects roughly one in every 
several ten thousand people.

16:03.320 --> 16:08.010
There are theories that it's caused 
by continual exposure to mana.

16:08.010 --> 16:11.950
In any case, the best that modern 
medicine can provide is life support.

16:13.750 --> 16:15.290
All right, kiddo!

16:15.290 --> 16:17.250
Step lively now!

16:17.250 --> 16:18.430
Right!

16:30.350 --> 16:32.140
Congratulations.

16:32.140 --> 16:34.780
You qualify to become a hunter.

16:35.650 --> 16:38.060
We're looking forward to 
seeing what you can do.

16:40.070 --> 16:43.870
I did it, Jinah! Now I can 
afford Mom's treatment!

16:43.870 --> 16:45.950
Isn't it dangerous, though?

16:45.950 --> 16:48.950
It'll be okay. Just leave it to me.

16:58.040 --> 16:59.470
What're you doing?!

16:59.470 --> 17:01.480
Just sit in a corner and don't do anything!

17:01.480 --> 17:04.720
Damned E-Rank, slowing us down...

17:07.550 --> 17:11.900
And for the record, if you don't 
contribute, you don't get a cut!

17:12.930 --> 17:15.480
I'm sorry for being so useless.

17:17.960 --> 17:20.950
I'll put my ability points into strength.

17:31.780 --> 17:35.920
<i>I've got my gear ready. 
I've taken care of everything.</i>

17:37.240 --> 17:39.170
<i>And I'm confident that I can 
run away if I need to.</i>

17:39.170 --> 17:42.650
<i>If things get dangerous, like last time, 
I'll get the hell out of there.</i>

18:25.700 --> 18:26.880
No!

18:28.840 --> 18:30.700
The exit's been sealed off?

18:37.290 --> 18:40.810
<i>I see. So I'm in a separate dimension.</i>

18:41.820 --> 18:44.670
<i>Instance dungeons aren't 
like the regular kind...</i>

18:45.050 --> 18:49.780
<i>I've never been into one myself, 
but I bet they're like red gates.</i>

18:50.160 --> 18:53.870
What a mess. I was thinking 
I could run, if I had to...

18:53.870 --> 18:55.900
But that's out now.

18:57.610 --> 18:59.400
"Teleportation stone"?

18:59.400 --> 19:03.280
What's that? I guess I'm stuck here 
until I can clear the dungeon?

19:04.320 --> 19:06.920
I couldn't even beat E-Rank beasts before.

19:06.920 --> 19:09.470
And now I have to clear a dungeon by myself?

19:09.470 --> 19:10.760
That's crazy...

19:12.220 --> 19:16.310
Can I really beat a boss without any party?

19:17.120 --> 19:19.570
Still, I don't have a choice!

19:30.230 --> 19:33.950
What do I do? I'm suddenly 
feeling less confident.

19:39.490 --> 19:41.370
Here they come! And there's three!

20:33.480 --> 20:34.580
<i>I beat one...</i>

20:55.660 --> 20:58.030
I've gotten stronger.

21:09.980 --> 21:11.080
<i>A wolf.</i>

21:12.090 --> 21:13.480
<i>I can sense it...</i>

21:14.850 --> 21:18.340
<i>This one's way stronger than those goblins.</i>

21:21.650 --> 21:23.830
<i>My legs... won't move!</i>

21:24.430 --> 21:26.060
<i>Why?!</i>

21:27.000 --> 21:28.780
<i>Am I afraid?</i>

21:29.240 --> 21:31.460
<i>I didn't think I was traumatized...</i>

21:33.510 --> 21:34.560
Damn it!

21:42.330 --> 21:43.740
<i>There's no healer with me!</i>

21:44.680 --> 21:46.580
<i>If I get injured here, I'm done for!</i>
