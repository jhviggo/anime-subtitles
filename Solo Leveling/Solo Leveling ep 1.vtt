WEBVTT

00:10.290 --> 00:12.200
Captain, we should be in this fight.

00:12.620 --> 00:14.670
You know there'd be no point.

00:15.100 --> 00:19.490
None of our weapons can do
any damage to those things.

00:21.040 --> 00:25.620
We've got no choice 
but to leave this to the hunters.

00:42.230 --> 00:43.800
All of you, engage the enemy!

00:43.800 --> 00:46.840
If they get past us, the front line 
is going to collapse!

01:03.020 --> 01:07.420
I-It's no good! We're too low-ranked 
to stand a chance!

01:08.770 --> 01:10.840
<i>Damn it... I'm...</i>

01:11.360 --> 01:12.550
<i>losing consciousness...</i>

01:23.190 --> 01:24.520
<i>Healing magic?</i>

01:26.830 --> 01:29.500
<i>Amazing. He healed me in an instant!</i>

01:30.440 --> 01:32.200
Look out!

01:32.200 --> 01:34.120
Byung-gu, get down!

01:35.700 --> 01:37.030
Yoonho!

01:37.030 --> 01:37.870
Right!

01:50.360 --> 01:51.690
It's the S-Ranks...

01:51.690 --> 01:53.680
The S-Rank hunters are here!

01:53.680 --> 01:56.060
You're rushing things too much, Byung-gu.

01:56.060 --> 01:59.360
Sorry. I wanted to help 
as many people as I could.

01:59.360 --> 02:03.350
Besides, I knew you two would protect me.

02:11.280 --> 02:14.420
I don't think that's the boss.

02:14.420 --> 02:16.990
Probably just the leader of this swarm.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.590
Byung-gu, look after the wounded.

02:19.920 --> 02:22.080
I've got it covered, Yoonho!

02:22.450 --> 02:24.230
Let's go, Eunseok!

02:24.230 --> 02:25.540
Yes, sir!

02:55.720 --> 02:57.050
Pure brute strength.

03:01.020 --> 03:03.410
Guess it wasn't the leader after all.

03:03.410 --> 03:05.360
Now this is getting fun.

03:18.030 --> 03:21.320
It seems they made it in time.

03:24.600 --> 03:27.270
Now then, we should get started.

03:28.140 --> 03:30.100
Guildmaster Choi, whenever you're ready!

03:30.100 --> 03:31.110
Right.

03:44.900 --> 03:47.070
Commence the attack!

03:52.670 --> 03:54.850
<i>Over ten years ago,</i>

03:54.850 --> 03:59.840
<i>a series of gates linking our world 
to an alternate dimension appeared.</i>

04:00.960 --> 04:06.010
<i>The other side of each gate teemed 
with bizarre creatures called "magic beasts",</i>

04:06.010 --> 04:08.370
<i>immune to conventional weaponry.</i>

04:08.370 --> 04:12.120
<i>Those who have awakened the abilities 
necessary to fight these beasts</i>

04:12.510 --> 04:14.680
<i>are called hunters.</i>

04:14.680 --> 04:17.860
<i>Based on the amount of magical power 
contained within their bodies,</i>

04:17.860 --> 04:25.290
<i>they are ranked, in descending order, 
as S, A, B, C, D, or E-Rank.</i>

04:26.380 --> 04:31.320
<i>However, once these powers have awakened, 
no amount of individual effort</i>

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
<i>can ever result in greater strength.</i>

04:58.470 --> 05:00.540
Good luck with today's raid.

05:00.540 --> 05:01.720
Thank you.

05:02.580 --> 05:04.910
Hey, Kim!

05:04.910 --> 05:06.300
Been a while!

05:06.300 --> 05:09.250
Hey, if it isn't Park! 
What're you doing here?

05:09.720 --> 05:12.470
I thought you said you'd had enough hunting.

05:13.710 --> 05:15.710
That was before my wife got 
pregnant with our second kid.

05:15.710 --> 05:20.220
Makes sense. If the raid goes well, 
you'll be raking it in.

05:21.070 --> 05:22.510
I'm pretty nervous, though.

05:22.510 --> 05:25.570
It's been so long that I dunno 
if I'm still in good enough shape.

05:25.570 --> 05:27.280
Not like I was that strong to begin with.

05:27.280 --> 05:29.750
Hey, it's Sung!

05:29.750 --> 05:31.730
What's up, Sung?

05:31.730 --> 05:33.790
Nice of you to come out despite 
the chilly weather.

05:35.780 --> 05:37.570
Good to be working with you guys again today.

05:37.570 --> 05:42.040
Hey, Sung! You eat before coming in?

05:42.040 --> 05:44.790
Yeah. I had a proper meal.

05:45.820 --> 05:49.590
What's with him? Is he a big deal? 
Everyone's saying hello.

05:50.710 --> 05:52.040
The exact opposite, actually.

05:52.040 --> 05:55.790
He joined up after you quit, and that kid...

05:56.100 --> 05:58.860
His nickname is "The Weakest 
Hunter of All Mankind."

05:58.860 --> 06:01.360
Weakest? Not strongest?

06:01.360 --> 06:02.300
Nope.

06:02.300 --> 06:05.300
Like, a trip through an E-Rank gate 
landed him in the hospital.

06:05.860 --> 06:08.410
He might be the weakest hunter there is.

06:08.410 --> 06:11.140
Out of everyone? He's that bad?

06:11.140 --> 06:15.040
So as a rule, you can assume any raid he 
gets called in for will be pretty easy-going.

06:15.040 --> 06:16.680
I get you.

06:16.680 --> 06:20.070
I'd hate for him to overhear us, 
so let's leave it at that.

06:21.180 --> 06:23.380
<i>Too bad I already caught it all.</i>

06:23.860 --> 06:27.860
<i>Well, can't argue with the truth.</i>

06:27.860 --> 06:30.400
Oh, no, Jinwoo! You're hurt again?!

06:30.400 --> 06:34.230
Ah, Joohee... Looks like 
we'll be working together again.

06:34.770 --> 06:37.890
Never mind that. What happened to your face?

06:37.890 --> 06:40.830
Same thing that usually 
happens to it, really...

06:41.990 --> 06:44.340
You seriously need to be more careful!

06:45.490 --> 06:47.760
I heard you even ended up in the hospital.

06:47.760 --> 06:50.360
It was an E-Rank dungeon, 
so I was the only one hurt.

06:50.990 --> 06:52.670
Wasn't there a healer?

06:53.020 --> 06:57.810
Everyone else was higher-ranked, so... 
they didn't think to bring a healer along.

06:58.130 --> 06:59.420
Are you serious?!

06:59.420 --> 07:01.580
They were only thinking of 
themselves! That's awful!

07:01.580 --> 07:04.740
It's okay. It's my fault for being so weak.

07:04.740 --> 07:07.330
You know how it is with me, Joohee.

07:07.660 --> 07:09.210
I'm used to it.

07:11.240 --> 07:13.250
Looks like we're heading in already.

07:13.250 --> 07:14.250
Come on.

07:15.480 --> 07:19.790
I'll be your humble leader 
for this raid outing.

07:19.790 --> 07:20.920
The name's Song Chiyul.

07:21.320 --> 07:22.970
It's a pleasure.

07:22.970 --> 07:24.820
Yeah, that makes sense.

07:24.820 --> 07:27.940
Mr. Song's got the most 
skills out of anyone here.

07:27.940 --> 07:29.760
It's a relief to have him in charge.

07:30.380 --> 07:32.500
Pleasure to be working with you, Mr. Song.

07:33.830 --> 07:36.070
All right. Is everyone ready?

07:36.070 --> 07:37.060
Let's head in.

07:42.520 --> 07:43.720
Hey, Sung.

07:45.060 --> 07:47.890
Try and hang in there behind us, 
and don't get injured this time.

07:49.080 --> 07:49.970
Right.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.070
Let's give it our best.

07:55.290 --> 07:58.480
<i>A knife with barely any magic power in it...</i>

07:58.940 --> 08:02.090
<i>But it was all I could afford.</i>

08:02.570 --> 08:04.540
<i>It's better than nothing, at least.</i>

08:07.180 --> 08:09.040
Today, I'm gonna see this through!

08:18.270 --> 08:20.660
Welcome back from your meeting, Chairman Go.

08:21.360 --> 08:23.450
How'd things go with the administration?

08:24.010 --> 08:26.740
The usual talking points.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.650
Dungeon breaks are a problem,

08:28.650 --> 08:33.030
but they still want the resources that 
can be collected from inside dungeons.

08:34.600 --> 08:37.840
Their demands make logical sense.

08:37.840 --> 08:43.380
And we hunters make a living 
by selling those resources.

08:48.220 --> 08:53.570
The stones collected from defeated beastsâ€”
these essence stones.

08:53.570 --> 08:54.920
They're valuable.

09:01.220 --> 09:02.350
I did it!

09:02.790 --> 09:04.470
I finally got one.

09:04.470 --> 09:05.590
Jinwoo!

09:20.000 --> 09:21.360
Jinwoo!

09:21.360 --> 09:22.710
Stay back, Joohee!

09:27.880 --> 09:29.930
I'm heading to the next magic beast.

09:29.930 --> 09:31.750
Joohee, look after Sung!

09:32.280 --> 09:33.590
Right!

09:35.220 --> 09:38.900
You're going to be okay! 
I promise I'll heal you!

09:55.540 --> 09:59.530
The essence stones collected 
from high-ranked beasts

09:59.530 --> 10:05.210
can be turned into powerful weapons 
and gear for fighting other beasts.

10:05.760 --> 10:10.400
Mana crystals that can 
be collected from dungeons

10:10.400 --> 10:13.010
have a similar application, 
but they're less potent.

10:13.010 --> 10:15.950
But the government's 
interested in a different use.

10:16.520 --> 10:19.400
As a new power source.

10:19.970 --> 10:25.340
Safer than nuclear, more efficient 
than water, wind, or geothermal,

10:25.340 --> 10:28.180
and one that doesn't pollute 
the atmosphere like fossil fuels.

10:28.940 --> 10:31.630
The ideal clean energy source.

10:31.630 --> 10:33.850
They're working on a way 
to generate electricity

10:33.850 --> 10:36.360
using essence stones and mana crystals.

10:36.360 --> 10:39.550
A rare fuel source that only 
hunters are able to collect...

10:40.110 --> 10:43.830
Which is why the duty that rests on 
hunters' shoulders is such a great one.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.360
All right!

10:51.460 --> 10:53.770
Yes! We beat the dungeon boss!

10:53.770 --> 10:54.900
That's Mr. Song for you!

10:54.900 --> 10:55.790
We did it!

10:58.570 --> 11:03.310
Jinwoo, you're not staying on as a hunter 
just because you're stubborn, right?

11:03.860 --> 11:07.230
If you keep this up, it's only a matter of time 
until something much worse happens.

11:07.650 --> 11:11.180
It's not just your midsection. 
You're hurt all over!

11:11.180 --> 11:11.980
Sorry...

11:12.330 --> 11:16.320
I don't want an apology! 
I'm worried about you!

11:22.180 --> 11:25.030
Have you all collected your loot yet?

11:25.030 --> 11:27.550
As much as we could, at least.

11:27.550 --> 11:30.370
There's not much in the way of 
mana crystals here, either.

11:30.370 --> 11:33.130
We're not gonna earn much 
at all, at this rate.

11:34.050 --> 11:35.820
<i>I guess it's over.</i>

11:36.720 --> 11:40.220
<i>And all I have to show for it 
is an E-Rank essence stone.</i>

11:41.320 --> 11:43.930
<i>Hardly worth almost dying for.</i>

11:45.530 --> 11:47.270
Hey!

11:47.270 --> 11:49.020
Take a look at this!

11:49.830 --> 11:50.730
A cave?

11:50.730 --> 11:51.960
Some kind of tunnel?

11:51.960 --> 11:54.480
It seems to go pretty far.

11:54.900 --> 11:56.840
A double dungeon, huh?

11:56.840 --> 11:58.880
I'd heard rumors before, but...

11:58.880 --> 12:02.860
We beat the dungeon boss, 
but there's no sign of it shutting down.

12:02.860 --> 12:05.330
Yeah, I thought that was strange.

12:05.600 --> 12:06.760
Which means...

12:06.760 --> 12:10.290
Yeah, there's more loot 
to be found down here.

12:10.290 --> 12:12.250
Listen up, everyone.

12:12.690 --> 12:15.080
When encountering 
unexpected cases like this,

12:15.080 --> 12:18.550
standard procedure is to wait 
for orders from the Hunter's Association.

12:18.550 --> 12:20.620
Hang on a sec, Mr. Song...

12:20.620 --> 12:24.220
Doesn't that mean that the new guys 
are gonna hog all the good stuff?

12:24.220 --> 12:28.190
It's still part of a D-Rank dungeon. 
It should be fine, right?

12:28.190 --> 12:32.190
He's got another kid on the way. 
And we didn't find many mana crystals.

12:32.700 --> 12:35.460
It'd be okay to bend 
the rules a bit, wouldn't it?

12:35.460 --> 12:36.730
Or no?

12:36.730 --> 12:41.160
I understand how you feel. 
But the fact remains that it'd be a risk.

12:41.520 --> 12:42.780
Let's take a vote.

12:42.780 --> 12:44.080
I dunno...

12:44.080 --> 12:45.090
I'm in!

12:45.090 --> 12:46.420
I say no.

12:46.420 --> 12:47.340
No.

12:47.340 --> 12:48.680
Let's check it out.

12:48.680 --> 12:49.440
Same.

12:49.440 --> 12:50.190
Yeah.

12:50.190 --> 12:51.750
I don't think so.

12:51.750 --> 12:53.160
I say we go.

12:53.160 --> 12:54.090
Likewise.

12:54.090 --> 12:57.050
Sorry, but... I don't want to.

12:58.160 --> 13:00.880
That makes six in favor, six against.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.030
You're the only one left, Sung. 
What do you think?

13:04.030 --> 13:05.970
I-I...

13:07.060 --> 13:11.140
<i>Even a D-Rank dungeon is dangerous for me.</i>

13:11.960 --> 13:14.990
<i>But... Now that Dad's gone missing,</i>

13:14.990 --> 13:17.150
<i>I'm the only one who can 
provide for my family.</i>

13:18.020 --> 13:22.070
<i>I need money for Mom's treatments... 
and to send my sister to college.</i>

13:22.710 --> 13:25.530
<i>I need this money!</i>

13:26.680 --> 13:27.690
Let's go.

13:34.710 --> 13:38.020
Now, if you could touch the black 
crystal with one hand, please.

13:44.640 --> 13:46.640
Next, please.

13:50.180 --> 13:53.580
You're a C-Rank?  
We'd love you to join our guild.

13:53.580 --> 13:56.590
Here's the contract.

13:56.590 --> 13:58.790
You can find the labor 
conditions detailed here...

14:01.820 --> 14:07.200
Right. One B-Rank and two C-Ranks 
have agreed to sign.

14:07.640 --> 14:10.110
Things are going smoothly so far, 
Guildmaster Choi.

14:10.110 --> 14:11.660
That's wonderful to hear.

14:11.660 --> 14:16.380
Age and gender aren't a factor. 
If they seem like an asset, make an offer.

14:16.920 --> 14:22.340
Not that we're likely to find anyone 
who can compare to Cha Hae-in.

14:24.320 --> 14:26.070
Someone! Catch them!

14:26.070 --> 14:27.300
Out of the damn way!

14:31.780 --> 14:34.260
Move! Or do you wanna get run over?!

14:56.230 --> 14:57.500
E-Excuse me...

14:57.500 --> 14:58.000
Here.

14:58.750 --> 15:01.280
Thank you! Thank you so much!

14:59.960 --> 15:01.280
That's Cha Hae-in!

15:01.280 --> 15:02.340
Cha Hae-in!

15:02.340 --> 15:03.470
The S-Rank hunter!

15:03.470 --> 15:04.610
Oh, damn!

15:04.610 --> 15:05.480
It's really her!

15:05.480 --> 15:06.480
This is awesome!

15:06.480 --> 15:07.390
I'm a huge fan!

15:06.480 --> 15:09.190
E-Excuse me...

15:07.390 --> 15:08.690
Can I shake your hand?

15:15.100 --> 15:16.680
Look at her go!

15:16.680 --> 15:19.020
That's an S-Rank hunter for you.

15:21.280 --> 15:23.710
How long's it been since we entered the cave?

15:23.710 --> 15:25.640
About 40 minutes.

15:25.640 --> 15:28.560
The gate shouldn't close until an hour 
after the boss is beaten,

15:28.560 --> 15:30.140
so we'll have 20 minutes to spare.

15:30.830 --> 15:32.920
Um... I'm sorry.

15:32.920 --> 15:34.500
About what?

15:34.500 --> 15:38.630
It's because I voted the way I did 
that we're searching for the boss now.

15:38.630 --> 15:41.960
You don't need to worry about me, so stop it.

15:42.540 --> 15:44.710
Are you sure you're okay?

15:45.140 --> 15:46.910
Of course...

15:46.910 --> 15:48.540
I'm not!

15:48.540 --> 15:50.300
Have you already forgotten?!

15:50.300 --> 15:54.350
If that attack had hit just a little higher, 
you'd be dead right now, Jinwoo!

15:54.350 --> 15:59.620
I was barely able to heal your arms 
and legs, too! This is insane!

15:59.620 --> 16:03.190
Are you sure you didn't hit your head?! 
Because it seems like it!

16:03.190 --> 16:04.690
Sorry...

16:05.150 --> 16:10.160
<i>It's true that having a B-Rank healer like 
Joohee around has saved me more than once.</i>

16:10.620 --> 16:12.710
Do you actually understand the problem here?

16:12.710 --> 16:13.650
Yeah.

16:15.440 --> 16:19.620
Well, in that case, maybe you should 
treat me to show your gratitude.

16:20.980 --> 16:24.440
Or what? You don't like the thought 
of taking me out to eat?

16:24.440 --> 16:26.550
Th-Th-That's not it at all!

16:26.550 --> 16:27.560
We're here!

16:27.560 --> 16:29.050
It's the boss chamber.

16:31.640 --> 16:34.730
Rare to see an actual door on one of these.

16:34.730 --> 16:36.380
It's kind of intimidating.

16:37.640 --> 16:38.870
Well, I'm going in.

16:38.870 --> 16:40.860
No way am I going back empty-handed now.

16:40.860 --> 16:42.980
Same here. Let's do it.

16:43.340 --> 16:45.550
The team moves onward together.

16:45.550 --> 16:48.360
That was the call, right, Leader Song?

16:49.350 --> 16:50.920
Yeah, you're right.

16:54.840 --> 17:00.500
<i>To the newly awakened: I am the chairman 
of the Hunter's Association, Go Gunhee.</i>

17:00.500 --> 17:04.070
<i>Among you there are bound to be those 
who choose to be hunters,</i>

17:04.070 --> 17:07.460
<i>and those who decide not to.</i>

17:07.460 --> 17:10.080
<i>It's been over ten years 
since the gates first appeared,</i>

17:10.080 --> 17:13.030
<i>and yet there's still a great deal 
we don't know about the dungeons.</i>

17:13.030 --> 17:15.430
<i>To become a hunter is to risk your life.</i>

17:15.430 --> 17:19.460
<i>Even those who have grown accustomed to raids
cannot afford to let their guards down.</i>

17:19.460 --> 17:22.320
<i>You must never grow arrogant, or careless.</i>

17:22.320 --> 17:24.400
<i>If you want to survive, this advice 
will serve you above all else:</i>

17:24.680 --> 17:26.860
<i>Please, be afraid.</i>

17:35.030 --> 17:36.970
Hey, the place lit up.

17:36.970 --> 17:38.350
Dig the atmosphere!

17:38.350 --> 17:40.540
I've never seen a dungeon like this before.

17:49.630 --> 17:51.670
What's with the statues?

17:51.670 --> 17:53.680
They look so old.

17:53.680 --> 17:55.460
And some have instruments.

18:01.730 --> 18:03.690
This one's way bigger than the rest.

18:04.340 --> 18:05.830
Damn, that's huge.

18:05.830 --> 18:06.820
What it supposed to be?

18:06.820 --> 18:08.400
There's something creepy about it.

18:08.860 --> 18:11.500
Gotta say, I'm not seeing any beasts.

18:11.500 --> 18:12.320
Good point.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.150
Not a single one...

18:15.860 --> 18:18.040
What is this? A magic circle?

18:18.040 --> 18:20.750
Mr. Song! Something's written over here!

18:21.670 --> 18:24.210
In the ancient script? Let's take a look...

18:24.880 --> 18:27.590
"The Commandments of the Cartenon Temple."

18:27.590 --> 18:30.260
"First, revere God."

18:30.760 --> 18:33.590
"Second, praise God."

18:31.350 --> 18:32.380
Jingwoo!

18:34.270 --> 18:37.430
"Third, prove your faith to God."

18:37.430 --> 18:40.800
That big statue... I saw its eyes move.

18:41.240 --> 18:43.690
It's been watching us!

18:44.770 --> 18:48.440
"Those who do not follow these laws..."

18:46.020 --> 18:48.440
It can't be. You must have imagined it.

18:49.110 --> 18:51.070
"...will not leave alive"?

18:55.350 --> 18:57.240
Hey! The door just shut!

18:57.240 --> 18:59.220
But why?!

18:59.220 --> 19:02.060
Are we trapped in here now?

19:03.120 --> 19:04.880
This is what I was worried about!

19:04.880 --> 19:07.040
You guys didn't take this seriously, 
and now look!

19:07.390 --> 19:09.950
We never should've come this way!

19:09.950 --> 19:10.750
I'm leaving!

19:11.290 --> 19:14.510
You can have the treasure, 
or whatever else you find in here.

19:14.510 --> 19:15.890
See ya!

19:16.890 --> 19:18.800
Get away from there!

19:35.490 --> 19:37.330
No!

19:37.330 --> 19:38.160
Are you kidding me?

19:38.160 --> 19:38.950
They moved!

19:39.560 --> 19:42.130
Are we supposed to fight those things?!

19:43.810 --> 19:46.200
<i>The guy who just died...</i>

19:46.200 --> 19:47.370
<i>Was he D-Rank?</i>

19:47.720 --> 19:51.020
<i>If nothing else, he was stronger 
than me and my E-Rank.</i>

19:52.210 --> 19:55.010
<i>And he was just... in an instant...</i>

19:55.670 --> 19:58.560
<i>This doesn't make sense! 
This is supposed to be a D-Rank dungeon!</i>

19:58.560 --> 20:00.640
<i>There shouldn't be magic beasts 
like this down here!</i>

20:01.080 --> 20:04.330
If these statues are moving... That means...

20:18.280 --> 20:22.200
<i>I've stood on the precipice of death 
plenty of times before.</i>

20:22.830 --> 20:26.250
<i>In my first raid ever, I got separated from 
everyone else, and ended up stranded.</i>

20:26.900 --> 20:30.410
<i>I've been attacked by E-Rank beasts 
and spent weeks in a hospital afterward.</i>

20:30.780 --> 20:33.890
<i>I almost starved to death 
in a labyrinth before, too.</i>

20:34.300 --> 20:38.930
<i>No matter how low-ranked the dungeon was, 
I was always fighting for my life.</i>

20:39.880 --> 20:44.020
<i>Most hunters are able to buy gear with the 
money they make from selling essence stones,</i>

20:44.020 --> 20:48.310
<i>so they can beat even stronger beasts, 
and reap even bigger rewards.</i>

20:48.980 --> 20:51.670
<i>But this cheap knife is the best I can afford.</i>

20:51.670 --> 20:54.680
<i>If it breaks, I'll have to fight empty-handed.</i>

20:56.500 --> 20:58.570
These shoes are done for, too.

20:59.400 --> 21:02.800
<i>And so, day after day...</i>

21:05.560 --> 21:08.530
<i>I've endured being mocked, 
and put up with a life-threatening job</i>

21:08.530 --> 21:10.580
<i>where the risks outweigh the rewards.</i>

21:10.930 --> 21:13.360
<i>But even then, in order to survive,</i>

21:13.360 --> 21:16.050
<i>I've learned to keep my eyes open 
and look for opportunities.</i>

21:16.850 --> 21:19.420
<i>That might be why I was able to tell...</i>

21:19.960 --> 21:21.470
Everybody, get down!

21:36.660 --> 21:37.820
What the hell?!

21:37.820 --> 21:38.820
Nobody mentioned this!

21:38.820 --> 21:39.830
What is going on here?!

21:39.830 --> 21:41.030
How should I know?!

21:41.030 --> 21:42.180
You all right?

21:42.180 --> 21:44.420
Yeah. How about you, Kim?

21:44.420 --> 21:45.700
I'm fine.

21:45.700 --> 21:48.410
No more... No more!

21:48.870 --> 21:51.370
<i>What is happening here?</i>

21:52.170 --> 21:54.090
<i>How is this possible?</i>

21:54.650 --> 21:57.050
<i>We're trapped. We're done for.</i>

21:57.050 --> 21:59.510
<i>We're dead. Dead.</i>

22:03.010 --> 22:04.470
<i>We're gonna die!</i>
