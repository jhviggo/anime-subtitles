00:07.830 --> 00:10.460
This should be far enough
away from civilization,

00:10.870 --> 00:13.130
considering I don't know
what's about to happen.

00:14.430 --> 00:16.080
A job-change quest...

00:16.630 --> 00:20.540
That's the quest that showed up after
I passed level 40 from the last raid.

00:21.250 --> 00:25.000
I've run into two dungeons
accessible with key items before,

00:25.490 --> 00:28.670
but the only quests I've been forced
to take on immediately

00:28.670 --> 00:32.090
were the penalty and emergency ones.

00:33.240 --> 00:39.390
This one, however, seems to be optional,
and I've been given time to decide.

00:39.390 --> 00:42.350
Should I assume that means it's going
to be that much more difficult?

00:42.930 --> 00:47.650
The logical assumption is that this is an
important event that'll make me stronger

00:49.740 --> 00:51.980
by earning skills best suited to my job...

00:54.740 --> 00:55.890
Yes.

01:08.270 --> 01:11.210
Oh, shoot, my daily quest...

01:11.910 --> 01:14.100
I guess I can do it when I get back.

01:14.670 --> 01:20.030
All right. Looks like
the real game starts here.

01:20.030 --> 01:23.060
I wonder what's waiting for me inside?

01:24.020 --> 01:25.440
Should be interesting.

03:18.180 --> 03:19.830
I apologize for the delay.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.840
No, you're right on time, Jinsung.

03:23.640 --> 03:25.870
It's been a while, Jinho.

03:26.270 --> 03:27.440
Brother...

03:31.870 --> 03:34.150
The dungeon seems surprisingly normal so far.

03:37.820 --> 03:40.570
I can't use potions or full recovery?

03:41.010 --> 03:44.010
Or leave until the quest is finished.

03:44.560 --> 03:46.540
I'm gonna need to be pretty careful, then.

03:57.790 --> 03:59.690
An armor-type beast?

04:17.310 --> 04:18.500
That didn't work?

04:34.090 --> 04:35.200
No good.

04:38.510 --> 04:40.130
I've fought enemies...

04:46.970 --> 04:48.480
with hard exteriors before!

04:58.260 --> 05:00.670
I wasted a use of Fatal Strike...

05:01.250 --> 05:03.870
and when I can't recover mana
or heal damage, too.

05:05.150 --> 05:06.070
But...

05:06.870 --> 05:10.970
It's not like they care, of course.

05:14.670 --> 05:16.300
What is it, Jinho?

05:16.300 --> 05:18.800
You've barely touched your food.

05:18.800 --> 05:20.560
Oh, nothing...

05:21.520 --> 05:25.070
Jinsung, how are things going
with establishing the guild?

05:25.070 --> 05:30.110
I've heard the S-Ranks you've been
making offers to have all declined.

05:30.540 --> 05:34.930
It's true that Hunters Min Byung-gu
and Cha Hae-in turned me down,

05:34.930 --> 05:36.230
but it won't be an issue.

05:36.970 --> 05:41.760
I've got negotiations underway with
European and Middle Eastern hunters.

05:42.890 --> 05:45.540
They're likely to sign
if we agree to their terms.

05:45.540 --> 05:47.890
It'll be similar to the case
of Hunter Hwang Dongsoo.

05:47.890 --> 05:48.910
You've got a point.

05:49.490 --> 05:52.010
Hunters from overseas. Of course...

05:54.530 --> 05:55.620
Jinho.

05:57.140 --> 06:00.500
I know you've been working on
something of your own in secret.

06:01.010 --> 06:03.630
Buying up the rights to all these
C-Rank raids at a high price,

06:03.630 --> 06:06.140
trying to establish your credentials.

06:06.450 --> 06:09.100
And that's fine, for a personal project, but...

06:10.610 --> 06:12.310
Don't even think about getting in my way.

06:16.910 --> 06:19.480
He doesn't know about the boss.

06:19.990 --> 06:23.080
If he had any idea of the kind of power
I have on my side...!

06:31.560 --> 06:34.280
I guess even I get tired
after this much combat.

06:34.820 --> 06:36.380
Better catch my breathâ€”

06:38.750 --> 06:39.860
The Stealth skill?!

06:40.930 --> 06:43.090
I've gotta deal with beasts
that can use that, too?!

06:46.550 --> 06:48.560
On top of that, there's a mage...

06:48.560 --> 06:50.560
and one that uses light magic, at that.

06:51.010 --> 06:54.180
The stealth skill and light magic...
What is going on here?

06:54.660 --> 06:59.310
That armor reminded me of the Kasaka, too.
It's like I'm revisiting my past battles.

07:02.280 --> 07:04.780
This quest is even tougher than I imagined!

07:06.590 --> 07:09.920
The different kinds of beast
all have different weaknesses.

07:10.520 --> 07:14.740
Knights require strength, assassins take
perception, archers need agility...

07:16.050 --> 07:19.070
Without enough strength,
the knights won't take damage.

07:21.800 --> 07:25.140
Without enough perception,
the assassins can't be detected.

07:26.190 --> 07:29.200
And the real issue is the mages.

07:29.570 --> 07:34.600
They probably need intellect as a counter,
but I haven't really invested in that stat.

07:34.920 --> 07:36.480
Which means I don't have much mana.

07:36.480 --> 07:38.980
I need to conserve my skills...

07:42.450 --> 07:44.360
but my fatigue is starting to build up.

07:44.820 --> 07:46.510
I need to end this soon!

07:58.870 --> 08:02.090
I see you're all here.

08:04.050 --> 08:05.450
The time has finally come.

08:14.980 --> 08:19.390
I'm just glad the beasts
drop stuff like this, too.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.690
A High-Rank Knight's Chestplate?

08:25.110 --> 08:27.990
Come to think of it, I haven't really
experimented with gear much.

08:34.100 --> 08:35.760
It can turn invisible?!

08:35.760 --> 08:37.930
I'm glad I don't have to stand out.

08:40.040 --> 08:42.000
Looks like it doesn't restrict
my movement, either.

08:42.960 --> 08:47.560
It's kind of hard to tell without being
fully restored, but my level has gone up.

08:48.310 --> 08:50.560
I've got plenty of gold and items, too.

08:50.920 --> 08:56.740
With my fatigue recovered,
I may as well move onto the next stage.

09:04.660 --> 09:05.730
Now, then...

09:06.310 --> 09:10.430
How bad is it gonna be
on the other side of this door?

09:14.740 --> 09:18.700
But if I can't get out of here without
getting through, I just have to press on.

09:25.960 --> 09:28.180
Something about that gust
just gave me the chills...

09:46.500 --> 09:48.240
Some kind of throne room?

09:56.060 --> 09:59.500
This sight, these sounds, the way it feels...

09:59.960 --> 10:01.710
My entire body remembers.

10:02.460 --> 10:06.360
This is pressure on the level of what
I felt during the double dungeon!

10:12.210 --> 10:16.180
And all of that intensity
is coming from this guy!

10:17.680 --> 10:20.230
"Knight Commander Igris the Bloodred."

10:21.000 --> 10:22.750
Name's red, too...

10:23.580 --> 10:26.860
He really is nothing like
the enemies I've fought so far!

10:28.220 --> 10:30.810
A knight who defends an empty throne...

10:37.530 --> 10:38.240
Here he comes!

10:47.270 --> 10:50.800
He chops through pillars
like they're dry branches!

10:59.180 --> 11:01.140
This is beyond just strong!

11:12.320 --> 11:15.060
To be able to move this quickly,
in that heavy armor...

11:15.730 --> 11:17.110
What a monster!

11:28.670 --> 11:30.200
Still no good!

11:43.570 --> 11:45.350
We're equals in terms of speed.

11:45.780 --> 11:47.700
But he's much more powerful.

11:49.060 --> 11:51.550
And because of that armor,
my dagger isn't doing anything.

11:52.030 --> 11:54.830
Do I have any way of beating this guy?

11:56.150 --> 11:58.570
He's even more dangerous than I thought.

11:59.110 --> 12:00.200
Still...

12:01.270 --> 12:03.660
I doubt I can win without a weapon,

12:04.520 --> 12:09.000
but this is the only way I can think of
to deal any damage through that armor!

12:16.790 --> 12:18.510
I guess you're being chivalrous, huh?

12:19.730 --> 12:21.740
You must think this is gonna be easy.

12:26.390 --> 12:27.560
Come in.

12:28.440 --> 12:31.150
Chairman, you still haven't gone home?

12:31.470 --> 12:33.800
I don't feel like calling it a day just yet.

12:33.800 --> 12:36.850
So I've been dealing with
a bit of work that's piled up.

12:36.850 --> 12:38.580
Likewise.

12:38.580 --> 12:41.620
I've been clearing some
non-urgent items off my plate.

12:43.470 --> 12:45.110
So it's finally happening.

12:45.110 --> 12:46.080
Indeed.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.360
Speak of the devil.

12:49.890 --> 12:52.530
I'm here. Are you heading out soon?

12:52.530 --> 12:53.290
Yes, sir.

12:53.290 --> 12:55.520
I wanted to thank you before that.

12:55.520 --> 13:00.010
I'm grateful you approved this operation.

13:00.010 --> 13:01.760
No thanks necessary.

13:02.160 --> 13:05.550
It's all because you've kept Jeju Island's
name afloat in the interviews

13:05.550 --> 13:09.190
you've been doing on TV and in print.

13:09.190 --> 13:14.280
That's kept it in the public's consciousness
and is swaying their opinion.

13:14.890 --> 13:18.740
All I did was help tip the scales a bit.

13:19.130 --> 13:22.370
You don't expect criticism
for kicking a hornet's nest?

13:22.370 --> 13:24.450
I'm prepared to take the brunt of that.

13:24.810 --> 13:26.430
Just be careful out there.

13:26.430 --> 13:28.780
Jeju Island is dangerous business.

13:28.780 --> 13:30.790
I'm fully aware, sir.

13:31.180 --> 13:33.760
This expedition is about
assessing threat levels.

13:33.760 --> 13:38.200
We'll prod the enemy and see how
and to what degree they respond.

13:38.200 --> 13:41.010
As diligent as ever, I see.

13:41.010 --> 13:43.410
The third raid on Jeju Island...

13:43.970 --> 13:46.440
To me, that battle...

13:47.720 --> 13:50.180
never really ended.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.150
So fast!

14:23.870 --> 14:27.880
Even though I blocked,
it felt like that took down 500 HP!

14:28.630 --> 14:31.100
I made the right move putting armor on.

14:32.060 --> 14:35.170
There's a chance taking it
full on would've killed me.

14:36.050 --> 14:38.680
For him to deal this kind of damage
even without his sword...

14:38.680 --> 14:40.260
He's too damn strong!

14:43.450 --> 14:47.860
If I can't compete in terms of power,
then I'll boost my speed!

15:04.840 --> 15:06.010
I can't catch him!

15:12.950 --> 15:15.100
That passive skill boosted my defense!

16:32.630 --> 16:34.030
That oughta do.

17:28.150 --> 17:29.560
I...

17:30.960 --> 17:32.290
haven't...

17:32.780 --> 17:36.080
lost yet!

17:57.260 --> 17:59.670
That dagger can't change owners like that!

17:59.670 --> 18:01.420
It'll go back into my inventory,

18:01.420 --> 18:02.440
and then back into my hand!

18:06.020 --> 18:07.030
Too shallow!

18:07.030 --> 18:08.230
Have to stab deeper!

18:37.650 --> 18:40.350
I won... right?

18:45.030 --> 18:47.440
That... was a close one.

18:49.900 --> 18:52.360
My winning was pretty much a fluke.

18:52.360 --> 18:55.880
In terms of skills, ability, and experience...

18:55.880 --> 18:58.820
There was a real difference
between us on every level.

18:59.440 --> 19:01.540
One screwup, and I'd probably be dead.

19:02.990 --> 19:04.790
Four rewards, huh?

19:05.250 --> 19:08.140
A pouch with 1,500,000 gold in it.

19:08.450 --> 19:13.560
The same helmet that Igris had...
and it's an S-Rank item!

19:14.050 --> 19:16.320
The key to the Demon's Castle
was S-Rank, too,

19:16.320 --> 19:19.720
but I've never had gear
of that quality before.

19:20.280 --> 19:22.930
It reduces physical damage by 15%,

19:22.930 --> 19:25.760
along with a 20-point boost
to strength and vitality!

19:25.760 --> 19:26.940
That's tasty!

19:27.650 --> 19:30.400
Along with a rune stone
for the Ruler's Hand...

19:30.840 --> 19:35.110
What kind of skill is that?
I guess I'll figure it out later.

19:36.530 --> 19:37.740
But what about...

19:38.380 --> 19:39.950
this "instant teleportation stone"?

19:40.690 --> 19:42.920
It won't go into the inventory.

19:43.300 --> 19:46.180
Why give me a teleportation stone now?

19:48.070 --> 19:51.400
Is... Is the job-change quest...

19:52.240 --> 19:54.470
not over yet?

20:02.010 --> 20:05.080
"Survive as long as possible"?
"Enhancement points"?

20:05.080 --> 20:06.860
And what is a "higher class"?

20:09.560 --> 20:11.700
"Good luck," huh?

20:13.080 --> 20:14.940
Wait, am I facing infinite
waves of enemies?!

20:19.870 --> 20:24.580
If they were as strong as Igris,
I would've been overwhelmed in seconds...

20:25.090 --> 20:28.480
But these guys?
I can handle them easily enough.

20:28.850 --> 20:31.740
Still... There's an awful lot of them!

20:47.450 --> 20:52.310
Damn it! I keep fighting, but the gates
keep puking up more!

20:54.270 --> 20:56.780
I think the key to this quest
is how long you can last.

20:57.150 --> 20:58.030
In that case...

21:00.590 --> 21:05.570
Stealth costs 200 mana to activate,
and then one for each second of use...

21:07.010 --> 21:08.370
I have 190 left.

21:09.140 --> 21:11.460
I'll buy as much time as I can!

21:15.870 --> 21:17.510
They saw through Stealth?!

21:26.950 --> 21:28.830
This is worse than I thought!

21:28.830 --> 21:31.440
I won't be able to use Stealth
or Murderous Intent anymore!

21:37.860 --> 21:39.050
How long has it been?

21:40.090 --> 21:41.490
Only five minutes?!

21:41.960 --> 21:43.340
I can't keep going!

21:43.340 --> 21:46.030
I hate to do it, but I'd better use
that teleportation stone...
