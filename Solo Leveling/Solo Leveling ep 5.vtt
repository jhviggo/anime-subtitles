00:02.098 --> 00:04.019
Did you see it?

00:04.019 --> 00:06.004
I did.
That E-Rank Hunter, right?

00:08.015 --> 00:10.062
He has a great body, right?

00:10.062 --> 00:13.062
His looks are average,
but he is cute.

00:16.032 --> 00:18.096
The type that surprises you
when he undresses?

00:18.096 --> 00:20.096
Since when did we have
someone like that?

00:20.096 --> 00:22.054
I completely missed it.

00:25.076 --> 00:27.084
He was unremarkable at first.

00:27.084 --> 00:31.043
But he has been in shape
since he started working out.

00:31.043 --> 00:32.055
Really?

00:32.055 --> 00:34.072
Can people gain muscles so quickly?

00:36.014 --> 00:37.023
Excuse me.

00:37.068 --> 00:38.081
Mr. Sung Jinwoo...

00:41.023 --> 00:42.015
Ah.

00:42.098 --> 00:44.002
I'm sorry.

00:44.032 --> 00:46.071
No, I should apologize too!

00:48.032 --> 00:51.053
His muscles are so firm.

00:53.045 --> 00:57.029
Did he have such a good physique before?

00:57.029 --> 00:59.079
What do you want to tell me?

00:59.079 --> 01:01.037
Ah, right.

01:01.037 --> 01:03.064
Today is your day of discharge.

01:03.064 --> 01:04.088
Do you have any discomfort?

01:04.088 --> 01:07.022
No, thanks to you,
I've fully recovered.

01:07.022 --> 01:08.003
I see.

01:08.003 --> 01:11.088
Then, please complete the procedures
at the counter later.

01:11.088 --> 01:13.008
Okay.
Thank you for everything.

01:16.006 --> 01:17.056
Excuse me...!

01:17.056 --> 01:18.006
Yes?

01:18.089 --> 01:21.069
Could you give me your contact?

01:21.069 --> 01:23.065
My contact?

01:23.094 --> 01:24.083
Yes.

01:24.083 --> 01:26.061
If you don't mind...

01:27.003 --> 01:30.032
Will they inform me of the examination
results after my discharge?

01:30.032 --> 01:31.032
I understand.

02:58.007 --> 03:03.096
SOLO LEVELING

03:04.046 --> 03:06.004
ULTRA MORNING NEWS

03:07.008 --> 03:09.013
Good morning, everyone.

03:09.013 --> 03:11.017
This is our special guest for today.

03:11.052 --> 03:13.067
Hello, I'm Baek Yoonho.

03:14.004 --> 03:21.022
Hunter Baek is one of seven S-Rank Hunters
and has had impressive achievements.

03:21.022 --> 03:25.081
What kind of life do you lead
when you're not on missions?

03:25.081 --> 03:28.073
Well, it's mainly training.

03:28.073 --> 03:30.077
Daily training is indispensable.

03:31.011 --> 03:34.003
If I don't simulate actual combat,

03:34.003 --> 03:35.049
my skills would get rusty.

03:35.049 --> 03:36.099
Every day?

03:36.099 --> 03:38.059
Is it not tiring?

03:39.016 --> 03:42.016
In my case, because of my previous job
as a firefighter,

03:42.016 --> 03:44.087
I'm used to regular training.

03:45.003 --> 03:48.096
A small mistake of mine could
endanger my companions' lives.

03:48.096 --> 03:51.059
That always makes me tense up.

03:51.059 --> 03:52.008
I see.

03:54.038 --> 03:55.097
Is it already this late?!

03:58.068 --> 04:00.034
Brother.

04:00.034 --> 04:02.031
Jinah, morning.

04:02.031 --> 04:03.043
You're up?

04:03.072 --> 04:05.063
I've been up for a while.

04:05.063 --> 04:07.048
Be careful on the road.

04:07.048 --> 04:12.002
The meal I made yesterday
is in the fridge...

04:13.002 --> 04:15.036
Brother, have you been exercising?

04:16.003 --> 04:18.028
Uh... a little.

04:18.028 --> 04:20.007
You're getting taller, aren't you?

04:20.007 --> 04:21.078
Is that the result of your training too?

04:22.053 --> 04:25.063
So men can grow after they've
reached adulthood, huh?

04:29.029 --> 04:30.054
I'm heading out.

04:31.079 --> 04:32.071
Hey!

04:33.042 --> 04:34.088
You forgot the umbrella.

04:35.025 --> 04:37.072
It's sunny today.
I don't need it since it's heavy.

04:37.072 --> 04:39.043
It's not heavy.

04:39.043 --> 04:41.064
Geez, it's fine.

04:41.064 --> 04:43.068
Better safe than sorry.

04:43.068 --> 04:44.068
Go.

04:45.005 --> 04:47.048
Sigh, I'm leaving.

04:47.048 --> 04:48.052
Be careful.

04:52.094 --> 04:54.098
I'll run later.

04:55.036 --> 04:58.079
The muscle I've gained must
be due to the ability stats.

04:59.036 --> 05:02.095
If I keep training,
I might become a bodybuilder.

05:05.041 --> 05:08.004
I still have some points left.

05:08.036 --> 05:10.059
Now, which one should I choose?

05:11.012 --> 05:13.038
I need strength to increase damage.

05:13.038 --> 05:15.088
But it's pointless
if I can't hit the target.

05:16.004 --> 05:18.013
Then I need to improve my agility.

05:18.063 --> 05:20.076
I'll boost both strength and agility.

05:20.076 --> 05:22.072
It's also good for enhancing vitality.

05:22.072 --> 05:24.043
Perception is useful too.

05:24.043 --> 05:25.097
As for intelligence...

05:25.097 --> 05:29.003
It feels related to magic.
Do I need it?

05:30.035 --> 05:32.001
Okay, I've decided.

05:33.051 --> 05:34.085
That should do it.

05:36.011 --> 05:37.007
LANDLORD

05:37.032 --> 05:39.019
Hello, this is Sung Jinwoo.

05:39.019 --> 05:40.085
You finally answered the phone.

05:40.085 --> 05:43.057
Sorry, I was hospitalized.

05:43.057 --> 05:45.045
I need to pay the rent, right?

05:45.045 --> 05:46.033
Yes.

05:46.033 --> 05:49.004
I still haven't received
the rent for this month.

05:49.025 --> 05:51.043
If you're tight on money,
I can collect it later.

05:51.043 --> 05:53.083
Ah, no, I'll transfer it in a bit.

05:53.083 --> 05:55.074
Is that so? Then, I appreciate it.

05:55.074 --> 05:57.092
Take care of yourself, okay?

05:57.092 --> 06:00.001
Yes, thank you.

06:01.084 --> 06:05.097
I don't know if the phenomenon
on me is a second awakening.

06:06.076 --> 06:10.022
But now I can kill goblins in an instant,

06:10.051 --> 06:12.094
I should be able to earn money
to pay the rent easily.

06:14.009 --> 06:16.027
That being said,

06:16.027 --> 06:18.086
it's not so easy to find work.

06:19.023 --> 06:22.009
I need to enter a higher-level Gate
to make money.

06:22.009 --> 06:24.007
However,

06:24.007 --> 06:27.086
an E-Rank Hunter like me
has no chance of getting in.

06:28.053 --> 06:30.033
Should I go for a re-evaluation?

06:30.093 --> 06:33.077
If my Hunter rank is higher,
I could enter the high-level Gate.

06:33.077 --> 06:36.033
The more attention I get,
the more money I might make.

06:36.096 --> 06:38.094
But it would attract too much attention.

06:39.038 --> 06:41.008
People with second awakening are rare.

06:42.013 --> 06:46.034
Not to mention Hunters who grow
stronger as their level increases.

06:47.003 --> 06:49.076
That would attract a lot
of unnecessary attention.

06:50.032 --> 06:52.014
The media are annoying.

06:52.014 --> 06:54.035
I might even become a target.

06:54.094 --> 06:56.004
Better not.

06:56.004 --> 06:59.007
At least I should be able
to protect myself first.

06:59.007 --> 07:02.069
Also, it's better to keep it down
before I know what this power is.

07:15.063 --> 07:16.029
Confirm.

07:18.033 --> 07:19.021
Hello there.

07:22.073 --> 07:24.009
I'm Hwang Dongsuk.

07:24.009 --> 07:25.023
I'm Sung Jinwoo.

07:25.023 --> 07:26.034
An E-Rank, right?

07:26.034 --> 07:26.097
Yes.

07:27.024 --> 07:28.092
Ah, I know him.

07:28.092 --> 07:30.068
He's super famous.

07:31.014 --> 07:34.089
I remember his nickname is
The Weakest Hunter of All Mankind.

07:35.056 --> 07:36.006
What the hell is that?

07:36.006 --> 07:37.004
Hey, stop that.

07:37.089 --> 07:40.017
Sorry, my members are rude.

07:40.017 --> 07:42.058
No, it's true that I am an E-Rank Hunter.

07:43.014 --> 07:44.044
Can I join?

07:44.044 --> 07:46.011
No problem.

07:46.011 --> 07:49.012
I just need you to make up the numbers.

07:49.074 --> 07:52.054
I said it over the phone,
but let me confirm it again.

07:52.054 --> 07:56.066
At least eight people are required
to enter this C-Rank dungeon.

07:56.066 --> 07:59.058
And half of them must be C-Rank.

07:59.092 --> 08:03.055
You're not counted as combat power,
so you will not share the spoils.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.008
However, we will pay your
commission fee of 2 million in cash.

08:09.055 --> 08:12.097
Four C-Rank Hunters
and two D-Rank or lower ones?

08:13.051 --> 08:14.077
I understand.

08:14.077 --> 08:16.022
What should I do?

08:16.065 --> 08:18.044
You'll carry our luggage.

08:18.082 --> 08:21.081
Inside are our meals, as well as
spare clothes and equipment.

08:21.081 --> 08:23.004
There's also a first aid kit.

08:23.075 --> 08:26.036
You're not bringing a Healer in?

08:26.009 --> 08:30.041
It's difficult for private teams
like us to recruit Healers.

08:30.041 --> 08:31.007
You should know that.

08:31.007 --> 08:34.058
We have always managed like this.

08:34.058 --> 08:35.057
Okay.

08:36.004 --> 08:39.000
A team with only Tankers and Fighters?

08:39.042 --> 08:40.079
They are reckless.

08:41.038 --> 08:44.017
And the fact that there's
no Healer is quite concerning.

08:44.017 --> 08:46.051
Then please sign the contract.

08:48.038 --> 08:53.047
The other party won't be held accountable
for any incidents in the dungeon.

08:53.079 --> 08:54.064
Done.

08:54.064 --> 08:55.018
Thank you.

08:57.098 --> 09:00.085
It seems we are in the same boat.

09:01.031 --> 09:04.004
My name is Yoo Jinho,
21 years old, and a D-Rank Hunter.

09:04.004 --> 09:06.078
I was also brought in to make up numbers.

09:06.078 --> 09:07.009
Okay.

09:07.009 --> 09:09.082
D-Rank with such gears?

09:09.082 --> 09:12.011
His family must be rich.

09:12.078 --> 09:14.099
Is this your first time
in a C-Rank dungeon?

09:15.062 --> 09:16.058
Don't worry.

09:16.058 --> 09:18.000
I will protect you.

09:22.037 --> 09:24.000
Let's go then.

09:24.046 --> 09:26.013
Aren't the bags heavy?

09:26.013 --> 09:27.005
Will you be okay?

09:27.059 --> 09:29.051
Yes, I'm fine.

09:30.001 --> 09:31.074
I am younger than you.

09:31.074 --> 09:33.051
You don't have to speak so formally.

09:34.035 --> 09:35.022
I understand.

09:35.085 --> 09:39.039
Have you heard? The president
who marked this project

09:39.039 --> 09:43.002
escaped abroad with 900 billion
funds two months ago.

09:43.002 --> 09:45.086
The employees and investors
are all complaining.

09:45.086 --> 09:46.065
Hmm...

09:47.007 --> 09:50.028
Ah... Did I talk too much again?

09:50.028 --> 09:53.065
I'm not used to paying attention
to people's reactions.

09:56.067 --> 09:57.058
This is it.

09:57.088 --> 10:00.096
Wow, what a large entrance.

10:00.096 --> 10:03.054
Such size is really rare.

10:04.029 --> 10:07.042
Dongsuk, is this really a C-Rank Gate?

10:07.042 --> 10:08.084
Isn't it too big?

10:08.084 --> 10:13.002
The investigators confirmed twice
before giving a C-Rank evaluation.

10:13.002 --> 10:14.001
It must be C-Rank.

10:14.043 --> 10:16.043
This Gate is huge.

10:16.043 --> 10:18.018
Is it okay to enter?

10:18.018 --> 10:20.056
The size of the Gate isn't very important.

10:20.056 --> 10:23.048
What matters is the flux of magic
power emanating from the inside.

10:24.014 --> 10:27.046
The Association will measure
that value and classify it.

10:27.097 --> 10:32.019
Normally, B-Rank and above dungeons
are handled by large guilds.

10:32.019 --> 10:34.007
Those below C-Rank aren't as dangerous.

10:35.024 --> 10:37.053
You know a lot about this, Jinwoo.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.066
I have been a Hunter for some time.

10:40.058 --> 10:43.087
But still, this is my first time
in a C-Rank dungeon.

10:44.029 --> 10:46.038
Please follow me.

10:46.063 --> 10:47.013
Yes.

10:47.071 --> 10:49.063
Jinwoo, let's go.

10:50.075 --> 10:52.048
Yeah... Got it.

10:56.084 --> 10:59.005
Kyuhwan, create some light.

10:59.005 --> 10:59.076
Okay.

11:04.046 --> 11:05.009
What's going on here?

11:05.009 --> 11:07.048
Not a single magic beast.

11:07.048 --> 11:09.032
There are no lights as well.

11:09.032 --> 11:11.091
There are normally luminescent
stones in dungeons.

11:12.057 --> 11:13.099
A pitch-black dungeon...

11:14.065 --> 11:16.082
...reminds me of the Cartenon Temple.

11:17.049 --> 11:18.082
Jinwoo,

11:18.082 --> 11:20.083
what is "luminescent stone"?

11:20.083 --> 11:21.054
Well...

11:22.008 --> 11:26.096
Luminescent stones are glowing rocks
that are common in cave-like dungeons.

11:27.058 --> 11:30.017
The stones are usually found
on the walls or floor,

11:30.017 --> 11:32.013
emitting light to illuminate the cave.

11:32.088 --> 11:36.088
So, the magic gems
obtained from magic beasts,

11:36.088 --> 11:39.068
the mana crystals collected in dungeons,

11:39.068 --> 11:43.035
and the luminescent stones
that light up the caves.

11:43.061 --> 11:45.048
They are quite confusing.

11:45.048 --> 11:46.098
You will get used to it soon.

11:50.037 --> 11:53.032
By the way, there's nothing here.

11:53.083 --> 11:54.069
Jinwoo.

11:54.069 --> 11:56.082
Can there be a dungeon
without magic beasts?

11:56.082 --> 11:57.049
Quiet.

12:00.027 --> 12:01.024
This sound...

12:01.007 --> 12:04.091
There are magic beasts here.
They just haven't shown up.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.087
Get ready!

12:05.087 --> 12:06.083
Yes!

12:07.021 --> 12:09.063
Moving as a group in the dark,

12:09.063 --> 12:11.084
and swarming towards any light source.

12:13.016 --> 12:14.059
It's insect-type magic beasts!

12:14.089 --> 12:16.006
- Insects?!
- Darn it!

12:16.006 --> 12:17.058
Insects, of all things!

12:17.058 --> 12:19.025
Dongsuk, do you see anything?

12:19.025 --> 12:20.008
No, I can't see a thing!

12:20.008 --> 12:22.039
Is this an ant nest?

12:22.039 --> 12:23.093
Then we're in trouble!

12:23.093 --> 12:25.052
The sounds are getting closer!

12:25.052 --> 12:26.098
Where will they emerge from?!

12:26.098 --> 12:28.044
There are too many holes here!

12:29.077 --> 12:30.077
Above!

12:34.094 --> 12:35.057
Kyuhwan!

12:38.011 --> 12:39.074
I'll draw their attention!

12:39.074 --> 12:40.041
Yes!

12:40.072 --> 12:43.016
Jinwoo, please don't leave my side.

12:45.058 --> 12:47.096
Look over here, bugs!

12:51.000 --> 12:53.021
Amazing, all the bugs are
heading towards Hwang.

12:53.021 --> 12:54.084
It's a taunting skill.

12:54.084 --> 12:56.055
C-Rank Hunters are indeed better.

12:58.042 --> 13:00.049
Jinsuk, 11 o'clock direction.

13:00.049 --> 13:01.059
Understood.

13:02.031 --> 13:04.001
- I'll also...
- Step back.

13:04.001 --> 13:04.093
Start the countdown.

13:05.039 --> 13:10.002
5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

13:10.002 --> 13:11.002
...0!

13:11.002 --> 13:12.051
This is my trump card!

13:12.051 --> 13:14.048
Take this!

13:15.069 --> 13:17.061
Good, take them down!

13:17.061 --> 13:19.003
I've been waiting.

13:19.037 --> 13:20.078
What a good teamwork.

13:20.078 --> 13:23.099
They've been working together for long.

13:24.032 --> 13:28.091
Maybe it's because they don't have a Healer,
the way they fight is rough.

13:30.036 --> 13:31.017
As for Jinho...

13:32.042 --> 13:34.088
His equipment compensates
for the lack of strength.

13:37.046 --> 13:39.005
Everyone is doing well.

13:41.005 --> 13:42.063
But I feel...

13:46.018 --> 13:47.039
...a bit frustrating.

13:47.097 --> 13:49.006
Alright.

13:49.006 --> 13:51.001
This should be the last one.

13:51.001 --> 13:51.089
Jinsuk.

13:53.065 --> 13:56.036
Yes, no more enemies.
We've taken care of them.

13:56.077 --> 13:58.026
Good, it's over.

13:58.026 --> 14:00.086
Take all the magic gems
and split them into seven parts.

14:00.086 --> 14:02.053
Yeah!

14:03.053 --> 14:05.028
I love this moment.

14:05.028 --> 14:06.049
Me too.

14:06.087 --> 14:09.001
Thanks for your help.

14:09.001 --> 14:11.052
It would have been dangerous
if we had noticed them later.

14:11.052 --> 14:11.096
It's okay.

14:12.057 --> 14:15.017
How did you know
they were coming from above?

14:16.017 --> 14:17.013
It's intuition.

14:17.008 --> 14:20.021
Your intuition is surely sharp.

14:20.021 --> 14:21.051
Dongsuk.

14:21.051 --> 14:22.009
Come take a look at this.

14:23.043 --> 14:24.008
Look at their wounds.

14:25.022 --> 14:27.005
These aren't sword wounds.

14:27.005 --> 14:30.031
Right? They don't look like burns
caused by magic either.

14:30.031 --> 14:35.027
Many of them were bitten
to death like this.

14:35.027 --> 14:38.019
Did the magic beasts fight
each other over territory?

14:38.019 --> 14:42.078
So there must be a stronger
magic beast around here.

14:43.061 --> 14:44.074
Is that so?

14:44.074 --> 14:47.066
A high-rank beast
that preys on these insects.

14:49.045 --> 14:53.021
Did you see the way
I slayed the magic beasts?

14:53.021 --> 14:54.013
Yeah.

14:55.004 --> 14:56.004
Jinho.

14:56.004 --> 14:58.046
Your sword and shield
are expensive, right?

14:58.046 --> 15:00.003
Eh? Yeah.

15:00.003 --> 15:01.065
Because this was my first mission,

15:01.065 --> 15:03.063
my father bought me high-quality gear.

15:04.005 --> 15:05.038
I see.

15:05.038 --> 15:07.009
I don't know for sure yet,

15:07.068 --> 15:09.011
but it's better to be cautious.

15:17.077 --> 15:18.044
There!

15:19.031 --> 15:21.067
What was that sound? An explosion?

15:21.067 --> 15:23.009
Stay calm.
It happens all the time here.

15:24.038 --> 15:25.015
Look.

15:26.041 --> 15:28.007
The guild master is in training.

15:34.033 --> 15:35.071
Amazing.

15:35.071 --> 15:37.095
He pierced through
that huge boulder in one strike.

15:40.013 --> 15:42.005
This isn't even a warm-up.

15:43.009 --> 15:45.055
Hey, clean this up.

15:48.055 --> 15:50.014
We've been walking for quite a while.

15:50.051 --> 15:51.072
The size of the dungeon...

15:51.072 --> 15:53.097
Is unrelated to its level, right?

15:54.032 --> 15:56.006
It's related to the flux of magic power.

15:56.006 --> 16:00.069
Although the dungeon is big,
it's quite empty, right?

16:00.069 --> 16:01.052
Yes.

16:01.009 --> 16:05.061
But transporting luggage becomes
quite laborious in such a big dungeon.

16:05.061 --> 16:07.086
Jinwoo, can you still manage?

16:07.086 --> 16:10.007
It's not that heavy.

16:10.007 --> 16:14.024
It's good to earn money
without having to fight.

16:15.029 --> 16:17.025
A good deal.

16:17.025 --> 16:18.025
No.

16:18.025 --> 16:19.046
Too good, actually.

16:20.042 --> 16:22.017
Something fishy is here.

16:24.009 --> 16:27.037
A battle-hardened team
yet without a Healer.

16:28.038 --> 16:30.039
They even needed
to make up the number.

16:30.076 --> 16:32.043
These magic beasts are also half-dead.

16:34.035 --> 16:35.039
Nice.

16:35.039 --> 16:36.027
Yeah.

16:36.077 --> 16:38.006
It really is strange.

16:38.006 --> 16:42.056
We haven't encountered a single
uninjured magic beast during the walk.

16:42.086 --> 16:45.078
All we've seen are either corpses
or those barely alive.

16:45.078 --> 16:47.078
The Boss should be somewhere.

16:47.078 --> 16:50.003
If there's no Boss, the Gate won't open.

16:50.086 --> 16:52.016
Wait.

16:52.016 --> 16:53.091
Kyuhwan, light it up.

16:53.091 --> 16:54.099
Okay.

16:59.062 --> 17:02.038
I think the Boss room should be ahead.

17:02.038 --> 17:03.021
Let's go.

17:15.026 --> 17:16.077
This is...

17:16.077 --> 17:18.001
Unbelievable!

17:18.001 --> 17:19.081
Mana crystals!

17:19.081 --> 17:21.098
There's quite a lot!

17:21.098 --> 17:24.023
It's not as valuable as the magic gem,

17:24.023 --> 17:25.023
but the amount...

17:25.023 --> 17:27.009
They are worth about a billion!

17:28.028 --> 17:32.011
Dongsuk, your brother
would be jealous...

17:32.011 --> 17:33.002
Hey!

17:33.002 --> 17:36.029
You shouldn't talk so lightly
about his brother.

17:36.091 --> 17:39.083
Dongsoo, I've told you.

17:39.083 --> 17:42.075
You're not always right.

17:42.075 --> 17:46.034
I'm no longer the guy who always
listens to his younger brother.

17:46.008 --> 17:50.067
I will use these as capital
to build my team.

17:51.038 --> 17:52.008
What a haul.

17:52.008 --> 17:55.026
Everyone will get well over 100 million.

17:55.026 --> 17:56.084
How are we going to move these out?

17:56.084 --> 17:57.076
Jinwoo.

17:57.076 --> 18:00.005
Please let me see your contract.

18:00.005 --> 18:01.094
I know the law very well.

18:01.094 --> 18:02.085
Okay.

18:03.094 --> 18:06.002
Excuse me, may I ask you something?

18:06.002 --> 18:06.098
What?

18:06.098 --> 18:09.082
This is the contract
you signed with Jinwoo.

18:09.082 --> 18:12.045
It only mentions
the ownership of the spoils.

18:12.084 --> 18:16.041
But mana crystals don't count as spoils.

18:16.041 --> 18:19.062
So it should be divided
into eight parts, right?

18:20.000 --> 18:21.037
Of course.

18:21.037 --> 18:22.079
We must divide it fairly.

18:22.079 --> 18:24.042
I'm clear on that.

18:24.092 --> 18:25.092
However,

18:26.025 --> 18:28.025
we need to deal with that guy first.

18:29.071 --> 18:30.063
The dungeon Boss?!

18:30.063 --> 18:32.005
I think you understand this.

18:32.005 --> 18:34.034
After defeating the Boss,
the Gate will close.

18:34.089 --> 18:38.097
So we must move all the mana crystals out
before defeating that spider.

18:40.027 --> 18:42.048
Luckily, it's sleeping.

18:42.048 --> 18:45.022
Now might be a great opportunity to mine.

18:45.095 --> 18:47.047
Lee Chul-Jin, where are our tools?

18:48.069 --> 18:52.007
I didn't know there'd be so many.

18:52.007 --> 18:55.016
So I left the tools in the car.

18:55.016 --> 18:58.012
Haven't I always told you
to keep the tools with you?

18:58.041 --> 18:59.091
I'm really sorry.

18:59.091 --> 19:01.037
Sorry.

19:01.037 --> 19:03.079
Can you two stay here?

19:03.079 --> 19:05.005
We need to get the tools.

19:05.005 --> 19:05.087
Huh?

19:06.042 --> 19:09.021
Just the two of us in the Boss room?

19:09.021 --> 19:10.008
Don't worry.

19:10.008 --> 19:13.059
It should be full and sound asleep.

19:13.059 --> 19:16.076
It should be fine for now
as long as you don't provoke it.

19:16.076 --> 19:17.072
But...

19:17.072 --> 19:19.097
Yoo, it's your first mission, right?

19:20.064 --> 19:24.023
Mr. Sung, this is also your first time
at a C-Rank dungeon, isn't it?

19:24.056 --> 19:26.023
Just trust me, guys.

19:26.069 --> 19:27.089
Okay?

19:28.065 --> 19:30.065
I need to tell my members something.

19:30.098 --> 19:33.019
I'll come back after a smoke.

19:33.019 --> 19:37.055
According to the rules, at least eight people
are needed to conquer a C-Rank dungeon.

19:38.009 --> 19:41.059
Excluding Jinho and me,
this team originally had six people.

19:42.004 --> 19:44.062
We have always managed like this.

19:44.091 --> 19:47.046
He said always, which means...

19:47.046 --> 19:49.097
They often conquer C-Rank dungeons.

19:50.092 --> 19:54.071
They should have regulars
to make up the numbers.

19:55.003 --> 19:56.008
Kyuhwan.

19:57.016 --> 19:59.006
Block the entrance to the Boss room.

20:05.014 --> 20:06.021
The entrance is...!

20:06.021 --> 20:06.085
What is this?!

20:08.015 --> 20:10.077
Did they betray us?

20:11.001 --> 20:12.036
As expected.

20:12.036 --> 20:13.023
They are...

20:14.007 --> 20:16.086
Sometimes you just come
across such scumbags.

20:17.065 --> 20:21.037
This work is inherently dangerous,
and accidents are par for the course.

20:21.087 --> 20:24.079
But even if an accident happens,

20:24.079 --> 20:29.021
it won't be made public,
hence the crime rate is high.

20:29.075 --> 20:32.059
There are no surveillance
cameras in the dungeons.

20:32.059 --> 20:35.042
If everyone is dead,
there's no evidence left.

20:36.007 --> 20:39.076
They use the weak as bait
to lure the enemy

20:39.076 --> 20:41.022
or abandon them in there.

20:41.008 --> 20:45.014
In simple terms, it's like a gecko
dropping its tail to survive.

20:46.022 --> 20:50.052
They plan to kill us over
a few mana crystals...

20:52.085 --> 20:56.082
I talked too much about the contract.

20:57.009 --> 20:59.007
No.

20:59.007 --> 21:00.024
In any case,

21:01.024 --> 21:04.033
they will kill us immediately
if we act rashly.

21:05.037 --> 21:06.075
More importantly...

21:10.062 --> 21:12.021
Jinwoo, please step back.

21:12.058 --> 21:13.075
I will figure out a way.

21:14.042 --> 21:16.096
We should be able to get out from there.

21:16.096 --> 21:18.069
This must be their plan.

21:24.097 --> 21:26.056
C-Rank Boss.

21:27.056 --> 21:28.098
And E-Rank Hunter.

21:30.001 --> 21:32.002
The difference in strength is too great.

21:37.078 --> 21:39.011
Another...

21:39.099 --> 21:41.007
...level?

21:42.099 --> 21:44.091
I take back what I said.

21:44.091 --> 21:46.062
Jinho, stay put.

21:47.016 --> 21:48.062
I'll handle this guy.

21:48.062 --> 21:49.016
Huh?

21:49.054 --> 21:51.004
What did you just say?

21:58.000 --> 21:59.053
I'll take it down.

23:37.001 --> 23:39.098
EPISODE 6: THE REAL HUNT BEGINS
