WEBVTT

00:02.740 --> 00:04.430
What is that thing?!

00:06.580 --> 00:07.860
Let's get out of here!

00:07.860 --> 00:09.840
Wait! You might get killed, too!

00:09.840 --> 00:11.060
Then what are we supposed to do?!

00:11.060 --> 00:12.300
Is there no other way out?!

00:12.300 --> 00:13.910
How the hell am I supposed to know?!

00:13.910 --> 00:15.100
Two of us are already dead!

00:15.100 --> 00:18.410
Nobody move! If you do, it'll attack again!

00:23.480 --> 00:25.660
Joohee! Joohee!

00:26.040 --> 00:27.500
That was a close one.

00:28.520 --> 00:32.280
If you hadn't noticed what was happening,
we'd all be dead.

00:33.380 --> 00:35.760
Didn't you yell because you'd figured it out?

00:35.760 --> 00:38.910
No... It just seemed dangerous...

00:40.450 --> 00:42.360
Mr. Song, your arm!

00:43.150 --> 00:45.320
If I grit my teeth, it's not too bad.

00:45.320 --> 00:47.020
Can you stop the bleeding, though?

00:49.950 --> 00:52.810
I was hoping to ask Joohee, but...

00:53.260 --> 00:54.760
she doesn't handle pressure well.

00:55.620 --> 00:59.770
That's why she only takes part in easy raids,
despite being a B-Rank healer.

01:00.410 --> 01:04.440
I've been through two or three
B-Rank dungeons myself...

01:05.170 --> 01:09.690
And that might be an A-Rank foe... or even S.

01:10.740 --> 01:14.160
The commandments of the Cartenon Temple
written on that tablet...

01:14.160 --> 01:18.830
"First, revere God. Second, praise God."

01:18.830 --> 01:21.210
"Third, prove your faith to God."

01:21.210 --> 01:24.120
"Those who do not follow these
laws will not leave alive."

01:24.650 --> 01:27.340
Mr. Song... The god it's talking about...

01:27.830 --> 01:29.600
It's probably that thing, isn't it?

01:31.250 --> 01:34.880
Over ten years ago, tunnels known as gates

01:34.880 --> 01:38.640
that connected our world to
an alternate dimension appeared,

01:38.640 --> 01:42.400
giving rise to a number of supernatural
phenomena throughout the world.

01:44.690 --> 01:49.200
Those who awaken to special powers,
known as hunters, are a prime example.

01:49.700 --> 01:55.300
They are tasked with defeating the beasts
that lie within the dungeons through gates,

01:55.750 --> 01:59.780
and a hunter's power,
once active, never changes.

02:00.610 --> 02:03.960
But at times, on the other side of a gate,

02:04.610 --> 02:07.760
one finds monsters who inspire
something beyond mere terror—

02:07.760 --> 02:11.090
something akin to absolute despair.

03:43.060 --> 03:44.240
Did you watch it?

03:44.240 --> 03:45.390
Oh, the video?

03:46.940 --> 03:50.010
What were you doing?
You almost got marked as late.

03:50.010 --> 03:51.130
Nothing special.

03:53.770 --> 03:56.280
Jinah, your brother's a hunter, right?

03:56.280 --> 03:57.690
Sure is.

03:57.690 --> 04:00.340
Well, that said, he's an E-Rank hunter...

04:00.340 --> 04:03.070
So he's always getting hurt real bad.
It seems like a lot of trouble.

04:03.070 --> 04:05.480
He came home covered
in bandages the other day!

04:05.960 --> 04:08.660
Why are you asking, anyway?

04:08.660 --> 04:09.990
No real reason.

04:10.970 --> 04:13.520
I bet I could do a better job...

04:14.580 --> 04:16.670
That thing is too strong to fight.

04:17.120 --> 04:19.360
Let's collect ourselves and
search for a way out of here.

04:19.360 --> 04:19.900
It won't be—

04:19.900 --> 04:21.390
I'm not just gonna die in here!
It won't be—

04:21.860 --> 04:25.420
I finally managed to land a contract
with a major guild!

04:25.420 --> 04:28.150
I can't afford to bite it like this!

04:28.150 --> 04:30.270
What are you doing?! You mustn't move!

04:30.270 --> 04:33.150
I can pull this off!
I'm pretty confident in my speed.

04:33.150 --> 04:34.800
I'll get it before it gets me!

04:46.120 --> 04:47.450
Damn it!

04:49.130 --> 04:52.900
I think this means it could
wipe us all out if it felt like it.

04:52.900 --> 04:56.800
Easily, too. Like stepping on a bug.

04:56.800 --> 05:00.830
Then why doesn't it kill us right now?

05:02.140 --> 05:04.470
It has the strength to kill us, but it hasn't.

05:04.820 --> 05:08.560
There's something different about it compared
to most beasts, which attack on sight.

05:11.310 --> 05:14.060
Mr. Song, what was the first
commandment again?

05:14.060 --> 05:15.120
The commandments?

05:15.120 --> 05:18.610
I think the first one was to revere God.

05:19.740 --> 05:20.490
God...

05:22.400 --> 05:24.430
This dungeon has its own rules.

05:24.910 --> 05:25.950
What are you doing?!

05:25.950 --> 05:28.330
If I'm right about this...

05:28.740 --> 05:30.010
You need to stop—

05:32.990 --> 05:36.960
From how you look, you haven't
given up on surviving this.

05:53.560 --> 05:56.400
Everyone! Bow your heads
toward the statue, please!

05:57.060 --> 05:58.390
Bow our heads?

05:58.390 --> 05:59.860
What the hell are you talking about?

05:59.860 --> 06:01.900
Did you figure out something?

06:01.900 --> 06:06.890
I think so. As long as you keep
your head low, it won't attack.

06:06.890 --> 06:09.660
"Revere God." Just like the commandment says.

06:13.980 --> 06:16.160
You're sure about this?

06:16.160 --> 06:18.000
Yes... For now.

06:19.030 --> 06:20.470
In that case...

06:26.180 --> 06:29.390
This is gonna save us? This is all it takes?

06:36.060 --> 06:38.270
Damn, that's freaky!

06:38.270 --> 06:40.230
Its expression changed?

06:43.380 --> 06:45.090
It's not doing anything.

06:46.080 --> 06:47.900
Hey! Don't just get up!

06:51.080 --> 06:54.160
Look! It's not attacking anymore!

06:55.970 --> 06:58.000
Is it really over?

06:58.000 --> 06:59.420
Are we safe now?

06:59.420 --> 07:00.210
All right!

07:00.620 --> 07:01.430
We're saved!

07:01.430 --> 07:02.420
We can go home!

07:03.220 --> 07:05.800
No... There's still...

07:12.810 --> 07:14.890
I thought it was over!

07:14.890 --> 07:18.650
Sung, what now?! You have
some kind of plan, right?

07:18.650 --> 07:21.070
N-Not at all!

07:22.370 --> 07:25.530
But it's probably a bad idea to break
the commandments they set!

07:25.870 --> 07:27.630
The second was to praise God!

07:27.630 --> 07:28.860
That's what we need to figure out!

07:28.860 --> 07:29.880
Praise him?!

07:29.880 --> 07:31.500
How, exactly?

07:31.500 --> 07:33.360
Let me give this a try.

07:33.910 --> 07:36.650
I've been studying ethnology.

07:36.650 --> 07:39.870
There are a few extolments
for gods that come to mind.

07:42.420 --> 07:46.220
O God, our great ruler
who brings order to the world...

07:46.220 --> 07:48.180
Is it working?

07:48.180 --> 07:50.300
I think it might be slowing down?

07:50.760 --> 07:53.020
Show us the path of truth.

07:53.430 --> 07:55.230
Wait. That's...

07:56.350 --> 07:59.190
Thy will be done...

07:59.920 --> 08:02.530
Those words don't apply to this god!

08:02.530 --> 08:05.700
We revere and honor thee!

08:05.700 --> 08:09.780
O God, our great ruler
who brings order to the world!

08:15.040 --> 08:16.130
Shit!

08:16.130 --> 08:17.220
Run for it!

08:25.260 --> 08:26.660
It's too dangerous to bunch up!

08:26.660 --> 08:27.380
Spread out!

08:27.380 --> 08:28.240
Right!

08:29.780 --> 08:31.250
Let's run, Joohee!

08:33.130 --> 08:35.020
I can't die like this!

08:35.520 --> 08:37.710
I've got family waiting for me!

08:39.030 --> 08:41.150
I should be safe over here, right?

08:41.720 --> 08:43.910
Hey, Park! Behind you!

08:52.870 --> 08:55.580
Park!

08:56.410 --> 08:59.440
Praise God... Praise God...

09:00.170 --> 09:04.690
What is there to praise about that thing?!
It's basically a devil!

09:05.590 --> 09:09.260
But I can't leave Joohee alone.

09:11.390 --> 09:12.980
I need some kind of clue.

09:13.670 --> 09:15.680
Spears... Axes...

09:19.470 --> 09:22.900
Hammers... Swords... Instruments...

09:23.630 --> 09:24.600
Instruments?

09:27.440 --> 09:31.060
Everyone! Run to the statues
with instruments!

09:31.490 --> 09:32.280
The instruments?

09:37.450 --> 09:40.370
Is it... playing?

09:40.370 --> 09:44.130
Hey! The statues with
instruments won't attack!

09:52.110 --> 09:53.760
Damn it all...

09:55.310 --> 09:57.590
Please, play your music! Hurry!

09:58.810 --> 10:01.130
Does it not work if there's two people?

10:01.130 --> 10:03.300
You stay here, Joohee!

10:03.300 --> 10:04.620
Jinwoo!

10:14.070 --> 10:15.110
Over there!

10:24.510 --> 10:26.130
Not there!

10:29.690 --> 10:31.010
No!

10:31.010 --> 10:33.220
Jinwoo!

10:44.380 --> 10:46.270
Not... yet...

10:50.040 --> 10:51.190
Not yet!

11:12.400 --> 11:14.820
I guess this is what was meant by praise?

11:21.300 --> 11:23.930
Jinwoo! Are you okay?!

11:24.760 --> 11:26.520
Yeah... Barely.

11:32.100 --> 11:33.330
Jinwoo...

11:33.680 --> 11:34.570
Yeah?

11:39.260 --> 11:40.550
Your leg...

11:43.660 --> 11:48.100
That's enough, Joohee. I'll be fine.

11:48.100 --> 11:51.490
What are you saying?! I'm going to heal you!

11:55.120 --> 11:56.320
Joohee...

11:58.070 --> 11:59.610
What a nightmare.

11:59.990 --> 12:00.930
It really is.

12:02.710 --> 12:04.560
It's a shame about your arm.

12:04.900 --> 12:07.920
But you made a careless call as our leader.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.380
I guess it's just karma.

12:09.380 --> 12:10.250
That's awful!

12:10.250 --> 12:11.370
Kim, you were the one who—

12:11.370 --> 12:12.820
Hey, we all decided together!

12:12.820 --> 12:14.980
And I remember how you voted.

12:15.780 --> 12:19.280
I was the one who made the final call.

12:19.790 --> 12:21.870
I'm responsible for everything
that's happened here.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.850
This is no time to be arguing.

12:24.850 --> 12:26.530
There's still one more commandment.

12:28.920 --> 12:30.330
What's going on now?!

12:30.330 --> 12:31.490
An earthquake?!

12:34.380 --> 12:35.750
What the hell is that?!

12:36.150 --> 12:37.470
An altar.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.740
They come up all the time in legends...

12:41.740 --> 12:44.180
for offering treasure
and sacrifices to the gods.

12:44.520 --> 12:47.440
The third commandment.
"Prove your faith to God."

12:49.060 --> 12:52.850
Even an idiot like me knows
what the move is here.

12:53.420 --> 12:58.210
We've gotta offer up a sacrifice,
ain't that right, Sung?

13:00.230 --> 13:05.220
I saw a man who was bragging about his wife
before we came in here split down the middle.

13:05.220 --> 13:07.000
And he wasn't the only one!

13:07.390 --> 13:09.860
You said it yourself, didn't you?

13:09.860 --> 13:12.210
Well, time to take responsibility, Leader.

13:12.800 --> 13:13.260
Kim, that's—

13:13.260 --> 13:14.220
Enough out of you, buddy!
Kim, that's—

13:14.220 --> 13:14.830
Enough out of you, buddy!

13:16.180 --> 13:20.070
Fine. Let me go myself.

13:21.930 --> 13:24.250
This isn't Mr. Song's fault alone.

13:24.250 --> 13:26.640
We took a vote to decide to come here!

13:30.310 --> 13:32.340
What's happening now?

13:35.890 --> 13:39.280
Sung! Is there anything else I need to do?

13:39.720 --> 13:43.900
What is this? Didn't we need a sacrifice?

13:45.070 --> 13:50.400
Sorry. I'd like to examine the altar,
so could you help me over to it?

13:52.630 --> 13:54.900
Get me right next to it, please.

13:54.900 --> 13:56.750
B-But then, won't we...

13:56.750 --> 13:58.800
I don't think anything will happen.

14:05.680 --> 14:07.720
Did you figure something out?

14:07.720 --> 14:09.140
Not yet, no...

14:09.750 --> 14:13.300
If we wait here, is anyone
likely to come rescue us?

14:13.300 --> 14:16.050
The gate will have been open
for a week as of today.

14:16.390 --> 14:19.440
They'll probably start moving again
before anyone comes for us.

14:22.600 --> 14:25.560
It takes seven days for a gate
to open up all the way.

14:27.710 --> 14:29.720
That's what's called a dungeon break.

14:30.570 --> 14:34.180
When that happens, the beasts are
able to cross over to the other side.

14:34.920 --> 14:38.310
The other objective of raids
is to defeat the dungeon boss

14:38.310 --> 14:41.670
and shut the gate down
before that time is up.

14:42.790 --> 14:45.570
Which means if we fail here...

14:46.430 --> 14:49.220
That thing will be able to enter our world.

14:50.000 --> 14:50.930
Hello!

14:50.930 --> 14:54.370
Oh, Miss Sung! It's wonderful
how you visit every day.

15:00.710 --> 15:03.320
Mom! I'm here again.

15:03.320 --> 15:06.000
Song-yi was late to class today.

15:06.000 --> 15:10.060
She said she'd had stuff to do,
but I'm sure she just overslept!

15:12.510 --> 15:14.540
Oh, and in the national test...

15:18.480 --> 15:20.450
Could you two come over here, please?

15:21.050 --> 15:23.870
We probably need a flame
to light up for each one of us.

15:24.350 --> 15:27.150
If anything's going to happen,
it'll be after that.

15:42.790 --> 15:44.490
The door's open.

15:44.490 --> 15:45.830
Can we leave?

15:45.830 --> 15:47.280
Unless this is a trap, too...

15:52.200 --> 15:53.780
What was that sound?!

15:53.780 --> 15:56.050
Th-The statues are coming this way!

15:56.050 --> 15:57.670
What do we do?!

15:57.670 --> 16:00.380
Why are they coming after us?!

16:04.840 --> 16:06.350
No!

16:06.350 --> 16:08.430
Joohee, don't close your eyes!

16:08.430 --> 16:10.100
They won't move if you're watching them!

16:10.800 --> 16:13.200
It works like that old children's game.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.600
Everyone, keep your eyes on the statues!

16:28.740 --> 16:29.670
Nooo!

16:29.670 --> 16:29.820
Hey!
Nooo!

16:29.820 --> 16:30.860
Wait!
Hey!
Nooo!

16:30.860 --> 16:30.870
Hey!
Nooo!

16:35.660 --> 16:37.310
What's going on here, Sung?!

16:37.310 --> 16:40.210
The door closed a bit,
but I think she made it out!

16:40.710 --> 16:41.670
Why?

16:42.170 --> 16:45.050
The blue flames have been
dying out over time.

16:45.050 --> 16:48.380
One of the orange ones went out
when someone escaped.

16:48.950 --> 16:53.260
The first order was to revere.
The second was to praise.

16:53.890 --> 16:55.520
The third is to prove our faith...

16:56.950 --> 16:58.710
It must be a trap.

16:58.710 --> 17:01.890
Causing danger and fear,
and then offering a false sense of hope...

17:01.890 --> 17:05.590
Maybe it's testing our faith in this god.

17:05.960 --> 17:08.570
I can't... I can't do this!

17:10.610 --> 17:11.550
Jeongho!

17:11.550 --> 17:12.120
Hey!

17:14.120 --> 17:15.080
Don't!

17:20.240 --> 17:21.450
You can't move!

17:21.450 --> 17:24.000
If anyone else leaves,
we'll have blind spots!

17:24.740 --> 17:26.500
What is happening here, Sung?!

17:26.500 --> 17:27.760
We need an explanation!

17:27.760 --> 17:31.510
As long as we keep our eyes on the statues
and don't move, we'll be safe!

17:31.980 --> 17:36.470
The blue flames are a timer.
When they're all gone, we'll all make it out!

17:37.600 --> 17:43.610
Isn't there a chance we'll be
trapped in here once they go out, too?

17:45.110 --> 17:47.680
I'll be honest, I didn't expect you,
our weakest member,

17:47.680 --> 17:50.180
to pull off as much as you've managed.

17:50.180 --> 17:54.760
The only reason we're alive
at all is thanks to you.

17:54.760 --> 17:56.200
Kim...

17:57.430 --> 18:02.930
But I've got a family waiting for me!
I can't die just yet!

18:02.930 --> 18:05.320
I wanna make it home alive!

18:05.320 --> 18:07.420
I can't take any more of this!

18:08.040 --> 18:09.450
I'm sorry!

18:14.700 --> 18:16.050
Why?

18:17.800 --> 18:18.780
Not yet!

18:19.160 --> 18:20.680
We have to survive this!

18:21.670 --> 18:24.630
I've managed to make it before, somehow!

18:28.330 --> 18:30.330
The two of you should go.

18:31.120 --> 18:32.570
Mr. Song?

18:32.570 --> 18:37.330
I think the doors will stay open
as long as one of us remains here.

18:37.840 --> 18:40.330
You two still have long lives
ahead of you. You should go.

18:40.870 --> 18:43.040
Joohee, look after Sung for me.

18:43.040 --> 18:44.570
R-Right!

18:46.480 --> 18:49.460
No... Oh, no... No...

18:49.830 --> 18:52.790
My legs... gave out on me...

18:53.940 --> 18:56.460
You must've over-exerted
yourself healing Sung.

18:57.140 --> 18:59.640
Mr. Song. Take Joohee and go.

19:01.050 --> 19:02.310
I just said I'm going to stay—

19:02.310 --> 19:04.760
Then who's going to carry Joohee out?!

19:04.760 --> 19:06.560
There's no time. Hurry!

19:07.770 --> 19:09.220
You can't, Jinwoo!

19:09.220 --> 19:10.320
In that case, it should be me—

19:10.320 --> 19:13.110
I promised to take you out to eat, didn't I?

19:13.730 --> 19:15.600
Use this to buy yourself dinner.

19:16.060 --> 19:19.040
And when I get out of here,
I'll be along to collect the change.

19:19.040 --> 19:21.070
How can you even say—

19:22.930 --> 19:26.900
I'm sorry. But it looks like
we really are out of time.

19:26.900 --> 19:28.070
Please.

19:35.720 --> 19:38.890
Good. I'm the only one who has to die.

19:40.620 --> 19:42.210
If I'd known this was gonna happen,

19:42.210 --> 19:44.980
I would've enrolled in a juicier
life insurance package.

19:50.750 --> 19:53.560
I'll take at least one of you down with me...

19:54.510 --> 19:55.990
So bring it on!

20:07.990 --> 20:09.990
I've always been the weakest.

20:10.540 --> 20:13.340
And I've been mocked for it,
time and time again.

20:13.340 --> 20:15.300
But I've always tried as hard as I could.

20:19.870 --> 20:21.010
And now...

20:22.510 --> 20:23.470
This is bullshit.

20:24.330 --> 20:26.330
It's bullshit! This is such bullshit!

20:28.430 --> 20:31.110
I tried to be stronger...

20:32.170 --> 20:34.070
but I couldn't.

20:38.790 --> 20:43.490
And even then,
I gave it my all to get this far!

20:50.340 --> 20:54.220
You couldn't take any more?
We all felt the same way!

20:54.220 --> 20:56.990
All you were doing was
justifying your own selfishness!

20:59.840 --> 21:02.500
That gratitude was purely superficial.

21:02.500 --> 21:06.850
It's always the most selfish
people who benefit the most!

21:07.210 --> 21:11.360
I have a family, too!
I wanted to make it home alive, too!

21:18.650 --> 21:21.280
It's good that I'm the only one
who has to die?

21:27.920 --> 21:31.110
How could you think that,
you stupid hypocrite?!

21:34.310 --> 21:38.050
No. I don't wanna die.

21:44.400 --> 21:48.350
If... If I had one more chance...
