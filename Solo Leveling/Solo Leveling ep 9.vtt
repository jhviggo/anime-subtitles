WEBVTT

00:07.360 --> 00:10.180
These stupid things are coming right at us,
begging to be killed.

00:10.180 --> 00:13.370
Well, I love it! Let's wipe 'em all out!

00:15.640 --> 00:18.040
I'm not sure which ones
are the real beasts.

00:20.320 --> 00:23.000
Old Man Song's a beast himself!

00:28.850 --> 00:33.340
That takes care of this group.
You really have gotten stronger, Sung!

00:34.000 --> 00:36.130
And where did you get such a nice dagger?

00:37.500 --> 00:41.930
Now that I think about it,
you haven't been hurt at all today, Jinwoo.

00:41.930 --> 00:43.730
I-Is that right?

00:43.730 --> 00:46.520
Here's hoping no one ends up needing my help.

00:46.520 --> 00:48.990
Well, I'm still counting on you.

00:48.990 --> 00:51.700
He definitely has changed.

00:52.310 --> 00:57.120
Not just his appearance but even his aura...
He's making it look easy now.

00:57.120 --> 00:59.580
Did you start learning martial arts?

01:00.210 --> 01:02.120
Let's keep going.

02:34.920 --> 02:36.220
The path splits here.

02:36.830 --> 02:39.050
The dungeon's been easier than forecast,

02:39.050 --> 02:41.210
so it should be fine
to split into three groups.

02:41.210 --> 02:45.530
There'd be additional risk,
but we'd be able to finish sooner, too.

02:45.530 --> 02:46.940
I think that's a good idea.

02:47.290 --> 02:49.860
I'll take the prisoners down
the path on the right.

02:49.860 --> 02:53.360
If you find the boss chamber,
send someone to let us know.

02:53.820 --> 02:57.740
I guess it's because I raised my perception
ability, but I can tell already.

02:58.640 --> 03:00.410
The boss is down there.

03:01.210 --> 03:03.770
These goblins weren't getting me
much experience, anyway.

03:04.400 --> 03:05.550
Mr. Song.

03:05.550 --> 03:07.610
Let's head down the path to the left.

03:07.610 --> 03:08.500
Understood.

03:08.500 --> 03:10.550
That leaves the middle for us.

03:10.550 --> 03:11.590
Right.

03:22.690 --> 03:25.230
If these goblins are all
there is, we'll be fine.

03:25.230 --> 03:28.340
I just hope we can finish this job safely.

03:28.340 --> 03:29.570
I'm sure we will.

03:30.320 --> 03:34.150
The Weakest Hunter only gets called in
for low-rank dungeons, right?

03:34.150 --> 03:38.260
Except we made that same assumption
once already, and look what happened.

03:40.850 --> 03:41.820
I've made up my mind.

03:42.380 --> 03:46.670
When this raid's over,
I'm gonna apologize to Sung.

03:47.920 --> 03:51.920
It's been bugging you, too, right?
How we ran away.

03:52.720 --> 03:55.160
We're grown men, professional hunters...

03:55.930 --> 03:58.120
Even if it was because of our families,

03:58.120 --> 04:01.400
that doesn't change the fact that
we left one of our own behind.

04:01.760 --> 04:06.100
If we wanna keep being hunters...
we need to face up to what happened.

04:08.310 --> 04:10.690
You think he'll forgive us?

04:10.690 --> 04:14.600
There's no chance.
But I'm still gonna apologize.

04:15.100 --> 04:17.020
Come on, let's get going.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.670
What a joke! These goblins are way too easy!

04:23.000 --> 04:24.530
Is that all of them?

04:24.530 --> 04:26.250
You expected it to take longer?

04:26.250 --> 04:28.240
I wanna rack up some more kills!

04:30.500 --> 04:32.830
What if you were facing humans?

04:33.910 --> 04:35.590
Could you kill them just as easily?

04:36.690 --> 04:39.050
I don't really see the difference.

04:39.050 --> 04:41.330
Yeah. It's all the same shit.

04:42.510 --> 04:44.270
What did you want to discuss?

04:45.410 --> 04:48.730
Three men... assaulted my daughter.

04:49.200 --> 04:51.470
She hung herself afterwards,

04:51.470 --> 04:53.980
and my wife was hospitalized
from the psychological shock...

04:53.980 --> 04:59.490
But these scum will be free in a few years,
like nothing happened at all!

04:59.490 --> 05:02.490
Not only that, but they're hunters!

05:02.950 --> 05:05.530
Hunters are allowed to participate
in raids while incarcerated

05:05.530 --> 05:07.600
to reduce their sentences, right?

05:08.470 --> 05:10.530
In what world is that fair?!

05:10.530 --> 05:13.510
When my daughter will never get to come home!

05:16.330 --> 05:17.340
And that is?

05:17.340 --> 05:19.630
I have three billion here.

05:19.980 --> 05:22.830
I want you... to...

05:23.620 --> 05:25.460
kill them, please.

05:26.420 --> 05:30.680
What happens in a dungeon
stays in the dungeon, right?

05:31.270 --> 05:34.180
Please! I'm begging you!

05:37.270 --> 05:40.900
Here's what I'll tell the inspectors
when I get out of here:

05:41.250 --> 05:46.480
The three of you were set upon
by a pack of a hundred goblins.

05:47.740 --> 05:50.200
This path really goes all over the place...

05:50.200 --> 05:52.190
Are we even making any progress?

05:52.190 --> 05:54.420
You think we got the dud route?

05:54.420 --> 05:55.830
Here we go...

05:58.410 --> 06:00.250
Help... me...

06:00.250 --> 06:02.510
Hoping for a quick death?

06:02.960 --> 06:07.750
I was actually asked to make you
suffer as much as possible first.

06:07.750 --> 06:09.740
Wh-What the hell are you doing?!

06:11.040 --> 06:13.640
Huh. I guess the paths met back up.

06:13.960 --> 06:17.960
Which means the left path
was the one that led to the boss room.

06:18.490 --> 06:20.500
That'll save me some trouble.

06:20.500 --> 06:21.630
Hel—

06:22.850 --> 06:24.860
Guess I'll have to alter my plans.

06:30.540 --> 06:34.800
That Kang Taeshik guy visited me in
the hospital with his inspector boss.

06:35.750 --> 06:38.580
I hope he doesn't remember me.

06:40.530 --> 06:41.420
Mr. Song!

06:41.420 --> 06:42.320
Right!

06:48.030 --> 06:49.760
What is this?!

06:52.120 --> 06:53.260
Jeongho!

06:56.000 --> 06:57.400
Mr. Kang...?

07:10.620 --> 07:13.120
Mr. Kim?

07:13.910 --> 07:15.870
Joohee, heal him.

07:16.470 --> 07:17.940
Hurry and heal him!

07:17.940 --> 07:19.540
R-Right!

07:22.570 --> 07:24.960
Mr. Kim! Please hang on!

07:25.280 --> 07:28.180
This wasn't the work of a magic beast.

07:28.620 --> 07:33.140
The weapon's too sharp. And whoever used it
avoided finishing him off... multiple times.

07:33.590 --> 07:38.100
Don't... bother. I'm not gonna make it.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.470
What are you talking about?

07:40.900 --> 07:44.180
You need to survive.
You have a family, don't you?

07:45.020 --> 07:46.570
You...

07:46.570 --> 07:52.030
You need to survive, no matter what!
How else can I keep blaming you?!

07:52.850 --> 07:56.500
I'm sorry. I really am sorry.

07:56.500 --> 08:00.830
I didn't see it playing out like this.

08:01.460 --> 08:05.170
I wanted to give you... a proper apology.

08:05.870 --> 08:09.140
I'm real sorry, kid.

08:09.760 --> 08:12.240
I mean... it...

08:20.650 --> 08:22.000
Kim...

08:31.380 --> 08:33.530
Wow, you're fast.

08:35.530 --> 08:38.910
I had intended on taking out
the healer first...

08:40.250 --> 08:42.670
But it looks like you were able
to change her fate.

08:43.160 --> 08:46.030
Mr. Kang?! Did you do this?!

08:46.030 --> 08:47.380
What if I did?

08:47.380 --> 08:50.690
Aren't you from the Hunter's Association?!

08:50.690 --> 08:52.080
You think you can get away with—

08:52.080 --> 08:54.050
I've got the perfect little story.

08:54.860 --> 09:00.560
I was gonna say that it was a swarm
of goblins, but here's my new angle:

09:01.220 --> 09:05.710
The prisoners were plotting an escape,
so they killed the rest of you

09:05.710 --> 09:10.150
and then tried to ambush me while
I was occupied fighting the boss...

09:10.530 --> 09:15.740
But they didn't have what it takes.
And that's why I was the sole survivor.

09:15.740 --> 09:17.580
What do you think? Perfect, huh?

09:18.040 --> 09:19.200
You scum.

09:19.910 --> 09:23.370
You can't stand against him. I'll go.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.300
I'm borrowing this, Kim.

09:27.230 --> 09:29.800
I haven't raised a sword against
another person in a long time.

09:30.170 --> 09:33.250
He's B-Rank, a level above me. But still...

09:33.810 --> 09:37.250
Ms. Joohee, could you cast a
physical strength buff on me?

09:37.250 --> 09:38.600
R-Right!

09:38.880 --> 09:41.970
Assassin types tend to have weak defenses.

09:42.440 --> 09:44.100
I'll aim for that.

09:44.100 --> 09:49.360
A washed-up mage like you trying to rely
on strength instead is gonna backfire.

09:49.360 --> 09:51.740
Right now, I'm a swordsman.

09:54.360 --> 09:58.740
But your skills are magic-focused!
Taking up that sword won't help you!

10:01.890 --> 10:03.960
You might be surprised!

10:04.520 --> 10:06.080
Okay, you've got some moves.

10:06.540 --> 10:10.090
Even putting aside the buff,
you really do know your stuff.

10:10.620 --> 10:13.340
It was only for a moment,
but he was able to keep up.

10:14.420 --> 10:16.180
If Mr. Song was a little faster...

10:16.180 --> 10:20.600
Fast and accurate! I can see why
you ditched magic for the sword!

10:21.830 --> 10:24.040
But that's about all you can manage.

10:28.400 --> 10:30.150
That pain-in-the-ass healer.

10:30.470 --> 10:32.360
Guess I had better deal with her after all.

10:36.820 --> 10:39.490
Turning your back on an armed opponent?!

10:39.490 --> 10:42.580
I guess you're no average old fart.

10:42.940 --> 10:45.820
I've trained S-Rank hunters before!

10:45.820 --> 10:48.080
In terms of blade technique, I won't be beat!

10:48.370 --> 10:51.870
Maybe, but the powers you've
been given have their limits.

10:52.250 --> 10:57.760
Did you think a mage type like you
could keep up with an assassin hunter?!

11:02.460 --> 11:03.570
Mr. Song!

11:05.860 --> 11:06.890
Oh, no...

11:06.890 --> 11:10.360
Your healer's useless, too.

11:14.280 --> 11:15.560
Game over.

11:22.700 --> 11:23.830
Did that work?!

11:24.240 --> 11:28.120
You took up that sword to make me
lower my guard against magic...

11:28.620 --> 11:31.920
so that when I went for the kill,
you could blast me.

11:31.920 --> 11:36.220
Pretty slick plan, for a senile old bastard.

11:36.220 --> 11:37.800
I'm finished!

11:38.740 --> 11:39.390
Now die.

11:45.850 --> 11:47.710
You again?

11:47.710 --> 11:48.940
Who the hell are you?!

11:49.950 --> 11:53.100
Sung Jinwoo, E-Rank.

11:54.420 --> 11:57.950
E-Rank? That's a load of crap.

11:57.950 --> 12:01.160
Sung? What was that just now?

12:01.160 --> 12:06.160
I could see a power type, even at E-Rank,
being able to block like that.

12:06.160 --> 12:10.070
But the reaction time you'd
need to pull it off twice...

12:10.070 --> 12:11.170
would require an assassin build.

12:11.590 --> 12:16.260
Not that it really matters, anyway.
You've been hiding your skills, haven't you?

12:16.260 --> 12:18.680
Your little group seems to know each other.

12:18.680 --> 12:23.480
So you can't be a false ranker.
They don't let any witnesses live.

12:23.480 --> 12:26.290
Which leaves only one possibility...

12:27.010 --> 12:28.440
You had a second awakening.

12:28.440 --> 12:29.520
You did, Sung?!

12:29.520 --> 12:30.690
A second awakening?!

12:31.390 --> 12:34.820
Then it must've happened
after the double dungeon!

12:35.160 --> 12:36.730
A double dungeon?

12:37.040 --> 12:40.090
Wait... Is he that weakling
E-Rank from before?

12:40.680 --> 12:43.890
But he looks and acts like a different person.

12:43.890 --> 12:46.700
And the mana meter only read 10
when we checked back then.

12:47.180 --> 12:49.260
If he had a second awakening,
it must have been after.

12:49.260 --> 12:52.670
So how'd he survive the double dungeon...?

12:53.130 --> 12:57.740
Well, whatever happened to you, I can tell
you don't have a ton of hunting experience.

12:57.740 --> 13:00.590
So it falls to me to teach you the ropes.

13:00.980 --> 13:02.680
Why did you do this?

13:02.680 --> 13:04.760
You mean killing the prisoners?

13:05.250 --> 13:08.560
I was asked to by the father of their victim.

13:08.560 --> 13:12.210
They drove someone to suicide
and didn't regret it at all.

13:12.210 --> 13:14.150
It's a bit of social justice, that's all.

13:14.150 --> 13:16.900
No. I was talking about Mr. Kim and Mr. Kang.

13:17.270 --> 13:18.440
Why kill them?

13:19.110 --> 13:22.660
Was it to silence them? Because you
could've done that without torturing them.

13:23.220 --> 13:27.360
But you didn't do that. You toyed with them.

13:27.910 --> 13:30.620
I don't think you did this
for the victim's sake at all.

13:31.120 --> 13:33.080
That's not what you really want.

13:35.650 --> 13:39.030
Sure, I can do that.

13:39.450 --> 13:41.490
But you've got the wrong idea.

13:42.010 --> 13:46.470
I'm a B-Rank hunter who has received
offers from a number of major guilds.

13:47.150 --> 13:51.420
So why am I working for peanuts
in the Hunter's Association?

13:51.930 --> 13:58.690
It's because I find people a <i>whole</i>
lot more fun to kill than beasts!

14:01.840 --> 14:04.750
There's a limit to what even a
reawakened E-Rank can pull off!

14:06.800 --> 14:07.620
Too slow.

14:07.620 --> 14:08.990
Impressive.

14:12.520 --> 14:14.160
He's so agile!

14:14.630 --> 14:18.570
Nothing at all like the Sung I remember!

14:21.260 --> 14:22.970
We're matched in speed!

14:23.400 --> 14:26.840
We've got the same build
and similar skill levels...

14:27.170 --> 14:30.490
But I have far more experience battling
high-ranked opponents than you!

14:30.490 --> 14:33.480
That inexperience will be your downfall!

14:39.900 --> 14:42.910
You've got grit, I'll give you that.

14:42.910 --> 14:44.310
Sorry...

14:44.310 --> 14:44.860
Eh?

14:44.860 --> 14:47.870
But could you be a little less bloodthirsty?

14:48.570 --> 14:52.040
Now you've done it.
Even the system's noticed.

14:53.370 --> 14:55.970
Then again, I guess I should be grateful.

14:55.970 --> 14:59.590
The system's given me another reason
to make sure you die.

14:59.590 --> 15:01.250
The system?

15:01.250 --> 15:02.670
What the hell is he talking about?

15:03.080 --> 15:05.630
I should have the advantage here...

15:12.150 --> 15:13.680
He's even faster?!

15:14.600 --> 15:17.650
Poison? A special effect
from that dagger of yours?

15:22.230 --> 15:24.990
I've got something special to show you, too!

15:26.530 --> 15:28.030
He vanished?!

15:28.420 --> 15:31.990
I should be completely undetectable.
You're a sharp bastard, all right.

15:32.400 --> 15:37.440
This is the Stealth skill. It conceals
my sight, my sound, and even my smell.

15:37.440 --> 15:41.740
Only a tiny fraction of assassin
hunters ever obtain this skill.

15:41.740 --> 15:46.480
Of course, no one knows I can use it, either.

15:46.480 --> 15:47.520
And the reason for that...

15:49.770 --> 15:54.720
is that no one who's seen me use it
has ever lived to tell the tale.

15:55.300 --> 15:57.230
You won't be so fast now.

15:57.850 --> 15:58.850
Jinwoo—

15:58.050 --> 15:59.760
Keep your hands to yourself!

16:00.610 --> 16:03.150
You two are next.

16:03.570 --> 16:06.070
At this rate, Sung's going to die!

16:06.070 --> 16:10.290
Now, think you can dodge my next strike
with an injured leg?

16:10.290 --> 16:13.240
Are you done talking now?

16:13.600 --> 16:15.030
Full recovery.

16:17.160 --> 16:19.000
He healed in an instant?!

16:19.000 --> 16:23.340
I've never heard of a combat hunter
who could use healing magic, too.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.460
What else does he have?!

16:25.460 --> 16:28.550
He's impossible to predict!
This guy is dangerous!

16:28.890 --> 16:31.120
That's another of my emotions, gone.

16:31.970 --> 16:35.850
I don't even need to get angry
to kill filth like you.

16:37.240 --> 16:41.020
Oh, I see. You've killed before, too, huh?

16:42.670 --> 16:45.120
Man, I didn't know we were
in the same business!

16:45.520 --> 16:46.770
I see now.

16:46.770 --> 16:51.610
He must've been forced through a number
of grave decisions in a short time.

16:52.020 --> 16:54.830
It wasn't just his appearance that changed.

16:54.830 --> 16:59.580
When hunters awakened, their supernatural
abilities turned the world on its head.

17:00.120 --> 17:04.590
Where we are is a place that only hunters
can enter. Laws aren't worth shit here.

17:04.820 --> 17:07.160
Whoever's strongest comes out on top.

17:12.740 --> 17:16.710
Is he tracking me from my bloodlust?

17:16.710 --> 17:19.990
But that won't let him know
exactly where I'm coming from!

17:24.980 --> 17:26.200
What the—

17:28.150 --> 17:30.780
Wait... Are you kidding me?

17:34.140 --> 17:37.560
What... the hell...

17:43.570 --> 17:46.720
You asked why I killed them, right?

17:47.500 --> 17:53.660
It's pointless to expect hunters, who thrive
in mortal combat, to stick to normal morals.

17:54.300 --> 18:00.470
You're the same way. You and me,
we're killing machines at this point.

18:00.910 --> 18:03.910
Which is why I'll die. Because I lost.

18:03.910 --> 18:06.560
It's just natural selection.

18:07.260 --> 18:09.460
But what the hell are you?

18:09.460 --> 18:13.030
You've got assassin skills,
healing, and debuffs...

18:13.030 --> 18:14.530
I've never heard of anything like it.

18:14.910 --> 18:18.940
Couldn't tell you. I'd like to know, myself.

18:23.290 --> 18:29.210
Well, you just killed me,
so your little E-Rank act is over.

18:29.210 --> 18:33.280
Let's say that I'm a hunter
who gets stronger with every battle.

18:36.140 --> 18:40.960
Then I'd say your shadow stretches
into some really nasty places...

18:41.440 --> 18:45.340
and you'll probably get as strong
as those places are dark.

18:45.730 --> 18:48.400
You'd better watch yourself, though.

18:49.200 --> 18:56.880
If you gaze for long into an abyss,
the abyss... gazes also into you.

19:02.870 --> 19:06.970
He's right. I'm incomparably strong
next to how I was before.

19:07.640 --> 19:09.210
But for some reason...

19:09.880 --> 19:15.330
the stronger I get, the more I feel
something inside of me falling apart.

19:15.330 --> 19:16.550
Jinwoo!

19:16.550 --> 19:18.420
Thank you so much.

19:18.830 --> 19:23.230
You really did it.
We only survived because of you.

19:23.230 --> 19:26.590
It's fine. You two should exit the dungeon.

19:27.300 --> 19:28.730
I'll handle the rest.

19:28.730 --> 19:31.020
What?! By yourself?!

19:31.710 --> 19:33.610
Then again... you're right.

19:34.470 --> 19:38.240
It's a shame we won't be able
to lay Kim and Kang to rest.

19:38.240 --> 19:39.700
We'll be waiting outside.

19:51.540 --> 19:52.630
Manager Woo!

19:52.630 --> 19:54.970
I heard the report. Where are the survivors?

19:54.970 --> 19:56.340
Right this way.

19:56.340 --> 20:02.050
I can't believe Kang was
killing in secret all this time.

20:02.400 --> 20:07.760
He had always been a little sketchy,
but as his supervisor, I was too careless.

20:08.610 --> 20:10.100
This is the three of them.

20:11.930 --> 20:15.280
Isn't he... the E-Rank hunter from before?

20:15.750 --> 20:17.360
He looks like a whole different person.

20:18.240 --> 20:19.760
It's good to see you again.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.660
Aren't you the inspector...?

20:21.660 --> 20:26.400
Woo Jinchul. I want to apologize for what
one of my men put you through.

20:27.050 --> 20:30.920
But first... I'd like
to address the main issue.

20:30.920 --> 20:34.380
Which one of you defeated Kang?

20:34.380 --> 20:37.460
I guess I won't be able to keep
my secret any longer.

20:37.970 --> 20:42.390
Which means I'm gonna have to
cancel my deal with Jinho...

20:43.010 --> 20:44.350
It was me.

20:44.810 --> 20:47.320
I killed Mr. Kang.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.020
Pardon me, but I believe your rank was...?

20:50.020 --> 20:51.540
C-Rank.

20:51.540 --> 20:54.560
How were you able to beat
a B-Rank like Kang?

20:54.560 --> 20:57.280
Why, with the help of my friend here.

20:58.450 --> 21:02.490
I see. Then you say you
managed with a healer's help.

21:03.580 --> 21:06.170
Kang was the cream of the crop among B-Ranks.

21:06.170 --> 21:09.710
By all rights, a C-Rank mage
shouldn't have stood a chance...

21:11.130 --> 21:12.540
Very well.

21:12.540 --> 21:17.000
I'll need to write this incident up,
so if you could please come with me.

21:17.400 --> 21:20.860
I can't get cocky just because
I beat Kang Taeshik.

21:21.180 --> 21:25.060
I couldn't tell before,
but this guy is A-Rank.

21:25.060 --> 21:27.200
As it stands, I'd be helpless against him.

21:28.580 --> 21:31.360
Sorry if I overstepped my bounds there.

21:32.270 --> 21:36.230
But I imagine you've got a good reason
for keeping your strength hidden.

21:37.880 --> 21:41.700
Well, think of it as my way
of paying you back.

21:46.090 --> 21:47.530
Three hours later,

21:47.530 --> 21:51.250
the man who hired Kang Taeshik
to kill the prisoners turned himself in,

21:51.250 --> 21:53.830
which confirmed that
we acted in self-defense.

21:55.920 --> 21:57.880
What a day, huh?

21:58.630 --> 21:59.800
Jinwoo.

22:01.360 --> 22:04.950
Do you remember this?
