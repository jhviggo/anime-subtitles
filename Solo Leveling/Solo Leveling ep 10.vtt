00:05.570 --> 00:07.940
You look like a different person, Jinwoo.

00:08.490 --> 00:11.170
When I haven't changed at all.

00:11.820 --> 00:13.510
Well, a lot has happened.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.100
And experience affects everyone differently.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.540
You're right.

00:20.290 --> 00:24.760
I think I might be too timid to be a hunter.

00:24.760 --> 00:28.710
I've tried to get over it,
but it never works out.

00:31.290 --> 00:36.400
I should really be participating in A and
B-Rank raids... or at least C-Rank.

00:36.700 --> 00:40.090
But I chose D and E-Rank ones on purpose.

00:41.670 --> 00:47.360
That's how I met you, and found myself
healing you time and time again.

00:49.110 --> 00:53.070
At first, it was a little annoying
how often you got injured...

00:53.710 --> 00:57.250
But you always managed to survive.

00:57.620 --> 01:03.170
I'll never forget the way that your eyes
always seemed to radiate vitality.

01:04.570 --> 01:07.360
We promised to go out to eat somewhere, right?

01:07.840 --> 01:10.670
You can have this back.

01:11.470 --> 01:12.630
Wait...

01:12.630 --> 01:16.100
I'm going to retire.

01:18.090 --> 01:19.730
I'm moving back in with my parents.

01:20.240 --> 01:23.650
If you ever find yourself in the area,
let me know, okay?

01:23.650 --> 01:25.150
I can show you around.

01:27.580 --> 01:30.940
I'll invite you out again, if that happens.

01:30.940 --> 01:32.140
Right.

01:46.650 --> 01:51.420
I don't believe an E-Rank like yourself
could defeat a B-Rank like Kang Taeshik.

01:52.360 --> 01:56.670
You've already been examined
for a potential reawakening, after all.

01:57.210 --> 01:59.970
But I feel I should warn you anyway...

02:00.620 --> 02:03.430
If you want to live a long life,
be careful out there.

02:03.430 --> 02:04.940
What do you mean?

02:05.470 --> 02:08.720
After the incident where Hwang Dongsuk's
strike team was wiped out,

02:09.140 --> 02:11.860
with you and the D-Rank hunter
as the only survivors...

02:12.250 --> 02:18.240
Hwang Dongsuk's younger brother,
Hwang Dongsoo, may be targeting you both.

02:19.730 --> 02:22.870
Hwang Dongsoo, the S-Rank hunter, is after me?

02:22.870 --> 02:26.490
Correct. It doesn't matter
what actually happened in there.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.530
All he cares about is that Hwang Dongsuk
died, while you managed to survive.

02:33.920 --> 02:38.000
The law is powerless to deal with S-Ranks.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.340
They have the potential to bring forth
either miracle or calamity.

02:43.140 --> 02:49.670
In other words, one of the monsters that
even monsters fear is out for your blood.

02:50.970 --> 02:55.990
If possible, I'd recommend taking
your family and leaving the country.

02:58.810 --> 03:02.240
That's one more reason I need to get stronger.

03:03.110 --> 03:04.810
Because if I don't...

03:05.650 --> 03:07.640
I won't be able to survive.

04:40.610 --> 04:45.680
Uh, Jinho? What am I looking at here?

04:47.080 --> 04:50.170
What do you mean? It's obvious!

04:50.170 --> 04:51.690
This is our strike team!

04:52.330 --> 04:56.710
I prioritized people who are qualified to be
hunters but have reasons they can't work

04:56.710 --> 05:00.240
and people who are having trouble getting by
when making my selections.

05:00.240 --> 05:02.730
You've got injured people... and drunks.

05:02.730 --> 05:04.890
That works better for us, right?

05:04.890 --> 05:08.300
We need a minimum of eight people
to raid C-Rank gates, after all.

05:10.050 --> 05:12.940
Hey, you've got a kid here, too.

05:12.940 --> 05:18.110
As long as they've awakened,
there's no legal issue with recruiting minors.

05:18.110 --> 05:19.120
Hey.

05:20.210 --> 05:21.850
That's kind of rude.

05:21.850 --> 05:24.310
I am a qualified hunter, y'know.

05:25.120 --> 05:27.090
But you're in high school, right?

05:27.090 --> 05:28.750
Do you have any raiding experience?

05:28.750 --> 05:30.780
N-No.

05:30.780 --> 05:32.270
What rank? E?

05:33.290 --> 05:35.270
So what if I am?

05:35.580 --> 05:36.760
I guess it doesn't matter.

05:36.760 --> 05:39.030
You'll be waiting out here anyway.

05:39.640 --> 05:42.520
Jinho and I will be the only ones
going into the dungeon.

05:43.900 --> 05:47.400
Hey... Is it seriously going
to be just the two of you?

05:47.400 --> 05:50.620
And does this job really pay three million
just for waiting outside?

05:50.620 --> 05:53.910
Right. Three million per raid.

05:53.910 --> 05:56.460
Pretty sweet deal, considering
you don't have to fight, right?

05:58.120 --> 06:00.050
The only stipulation
is that you can't talk about it.

06:00.530 --> 06:03.530
If you publicize our deal,
the contract specifies

06:03.530 --> 06:06.260
you'll have to pay back ten times that amount.

06:07.100 --> 06:10.650
The Stealth rune stone that
I got by beating Kang Taeshik...

06:11.610 --> 06:13.430
Might as well use it now.

06:25.120 --> 06:27.320
Okay. Looks like it worked.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.180
I'm ready to go.

06:31.540 --> 06:33.790
What are you wearing now?

06:33.790 --> 06:37.590
A full set of buff-boosting armor
made by an Italian manufacturer!

06:37.920 --> 06:41.250
If we're gonna hit the dungeon together, boss,

06:41.600 --> 06:43.820
I need to be at least this ready!

06:48.350 --> 06:51.550
I'm not trying to be mean here,
but take that stuff off.

06:51.550 --> 06:53.000
Okay...

06:57.160 --> 07:00.520
Boss, can you help me get up?

07:03.010 --> 07:04.820
All right. Let's get going.

07:05.510 --> 07:07.320
This is kind of nerve-racking.

07:07.320 --> 07:10.180
You've, uh, still got something on your head.

07:10.180 --> 07:12.300
At least let me keep the helmet!

07:13.610 --> 07:16.580
Fine, fine. Let's go.

07:16.580 --> 07:17.350
Right!

07:18.230 --> 07:21.430
They're seriously going in alone.
Is this gonna be all right?

07:21.430 --> 07:25.840
We did warn them. And the contract's been
paid out already, so what's it matter?

07:27.570 --> 07:31.190
A D and an E-Rank taking on
a C-Rank raid by themselves?

07:31.530 --> 07:35.850
Those two greenhorns don't have
a damn clue what they're getting into.

07:41.850 --> 07:44.270
Is Song-yi skipping today?

07:47.560 --> 07:49.160
How long's it been?

07:49.160 --> 07:54.060
About an hour. Even a normal strike team
would take at least two hours,

07:54.060 --> 07:55.200
so we've got a whileâ€”

07:57.460 --> 08:00.420
So they ran away. They're lucky to be alive.

08:00.420 --> 08:02.750
N-No! They didn't run away!

08:04.080 --> 08:05.980
The gate's starting to close!

08:06.810 --> 08:09.680
Are you kidding me? They beat the boss?!

08:10.010 --> 08:11.620
Where's the next gate?

08:11.620 --> 08:13.640
About an hour from here.

08:14.060 --> 08:15.770
Got it. Let's hurry on.

08:16.320 --> 08:20.240
We're moving, everyone!
The goal is to hit three locations today.

08:21.420 --> 08:25.360
That means you could potentially earn nine
million in one day. Are you coming or not?

08:25.950 --> 08:27.510
These guys...

08:27.510 --> 08:29.730
Who the hell are they?!

08:35.940 --> 08:38.090
Boss! I'm done mining!

08:38.090 --> 08:39.290
Got it!

08:39.290 --> 08:41.210
I better wrap up here, too.

08:47.950 --> 08:49.340
I'm heading out.

08:49.600 --> 08:51.650
Huh? More work today?

08:51.650 --> 08:54.050
Yep. Don't forget to lock up.

09:22.920 --> 09:25.080
He was hiding a skill like that?

09:25.620 --> 09:28.550
Boss has gotten stronger again...

09:28.990 --> 09:30.260
This Stealth skill...

09:30.830 --> 09:34.470
It wasn't fun to earn, but it's useful.

09:35.050 --> 09:37.660
Fighting while unseen is really effective.

09:41.440 --> 09:43.800
My Dash skill leveled up, too.

09:50.280 --> 09:53.740
And my new skills, Advanced Dagger Wielding
and Fatal Strike...

09:55.650 --> 09:57.450
They seem pretty useful!

09:59.670 --> 10:01.430
Great work!

10:01.430 --> 10:05.420
Once I'm finished grabbing this stuff,
we'll be done, so you can take it easy.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.470
Right. Thanks.

10:08.170 --> 10:10.360
I've got some handy new skills.

10:10.970 --> 10:15.670
But I don't have enough mana
to use them for very long.

10:16.180 --> 10:18.890
I'll need to work on my
intellect ability going forward.

10:20.140 --> 10:23.930
Things are moving smoothly,
so do I head to the Demon Castle next?

10:25.900 --> 10:31.470
No. Right now, I'd say I'm somewhere
between B and A-Rank.

10:31.990 --> 10:34.840
Would I really be able
to take that dungeon on?

10:38.320 --> 10:41.790
"The Player has reached the required level"?

10:44.460 --> 10:46.350
A job-change quest?

10:48.170 --> 10:50.660
Take a look at this, Manager Ahn!

10:51.680 --> 10:53.630
What is it, Kichul?

10:53.630 --> 10:56.760
Well, it's about the C-Rank gates...

10:56.760 --> 10:58.590
One hundred and fifty million?!

10:58.960 --> 11:04.080
Someone's spending 150 million
on the rights to C-Rank gates?

11:04.080 --> 11:07.580
Right. There's a strike team
that's been spending

11:07.580 --> 11:10.860
nearly double the market rate
on C-Rank gates...

11:11.320 --> 11:16.470
And the leader is... Yoo Jinho?
Never heard of him.

11:16.860 --> 11:19.770
He's the younger son of Yoojin
Construction's president.

11:19.770 --> 11:21.490
Yoojin Construction?

11:21.490 --> 11:23.700
This could put them in the red over time...

11:24.200 --> 11:27.250
Seems excessive for a rich kid playing hunter.

11:29.290 --> 11:31.460
Sung Jinwoo... E-Rank?

11:31.460 --> 11:34.870
Yes, sir. Their whole lineup
seems thrown together.

11:34.870 --> 11:36.690
I have no idea what the plan is.

11:38.930 --> 11:41.940
Hang on. I remember seeing
this "Sung Jinwoo" name

11:41.940 --> 11:45.030
connected to the double dungeon incident...

11:45.030 --> 11:47.770
There's something here. I can smell it.

11:51.610 --> 11:53.820
Sorry we're late!

11:53.820 --> 11:55.720
Nah, it's fine.

11:55.720 --> 11:57.900
You're ahead of schedule, even!

11:57.900 --> 12:01.420
Collecting the mana crystals
took longer than I thought.

12:01.710 --> 12:03.120
Okay, let's get going.

12:03.450 --> 12:06.550
You've gotta be exhausted.
You want me to drive?

12:07.370 --> 12:10.830
I've had nothing to do all day, so I'm
honestly kinda bored. Would that be okay?

12:10.830 --> 12:11.910
Oh, I see.

12:11.910 --> 12:12.550
What is it?
Oh, I see.

12:12.550 --> 12:13.090
What is it?

12:13.090 --> 12:13.660
But the contract says you don't need
to worry about doing anything, so it's fine.

12:13.660 --> 12:14.800
Nothing.
But the contract says you don't need
to worry about doing anything, so it's fine.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.260
But the contract says you don't need
to worry about doing anything, so it's fine.

12:18.210 --> 12:20.720
You think this Sung Jinwoo
hunter has reawakened?!

12:20.720 --> 12:22.530
I sure do.

12:22.530 --> 12:24.010
Based on what?

12:24.790 --> 12:29.270
Hunter Sung has been through three
major disasters and survived every time.

12:29.820 --> 12:32.020
First, the double dungeon.

12:32.400 --> 12:36.030
Second, the wiping out of
Hwang Dongsuk's strike team.

12:36.310 --> 12:40.450
And third, Kang Taeshik's murder spree.

12:41.460 --> 12:46.070
Every time, there was a large body count,
but every time, he was among the survivors.

12:46.070 --> 12:49.140
The only explanation is that he reawakened.

12:49.140 --> 12:51.620
I guess you're right...

12:53.180 --> 12:56.050
So where are you headed, Manager Ahn?

12:56.800 --> 12:58.510
Isn't it obvious?

12:59.920 --> 13:02.500
I'm off to scout a promising rookie.

13:06.410 --> 13:10.250
What is this, a picnic?

13:11.650 --> 13:12.740
Mister.

13:13.190 --> 13:16.400
This area's off-limits, y'know?

13:16.400 --> 13:18.340
Ah, you'll have to forgive us!

13:18.340 --> 13:22.110
We saw a bunch of hunters and got curious.

13:22.110 --> 13:25.870
That's a gate, right?
Is it safe for you to be so close?

13:26.270 --> 13:29.830
Don't treat me like a child. I'm a hunter.

13:29.830 --> 13:34.040
Then are you part of this strike team?

13:35.830 --> 13:36.850
Yes.

13:37.830 --> 13:39.070
But...

13:40.170 --> 13:45.200
Hunter Sung! He must've left his group
behind to tackle the dungeon himself!

13:45.200 --> 13:49.670
If my gut's right about this, he could be
a huge find! Even bigger than that!

13:50.140 --> 13:53.150
I see. Well, sorry for disturbing you.

13:53.150 --> 13:55.080
You be careful, now.

13:55.080 --> 13:57.190
Wait, are we leaving already, Manager?!

13:59.150 --> 14:03.110
The captain's back!
Everybody get ready to head out!

14:05.960 --> 14:08.050
What's the schedule looking like for tomorrow?

14:08.050 --> 14:11.080
I remembered I have something
to do. Can I get the day off?

14:11.080 --> 14:13.040
For tomorrow?

14:13.570 --> 14:17.650
I had reserved some gates...
You want me to cancel them?

14:17.650 --> 14:21.260
Let's not go that far.
It seems like a waste of money.

14:21.560 --> 14:23.970
I can hold onto them for another two days.

14:25.700 --> 14:28.180
Let's delay them for now, then.

14:28.620 --> 14:29.830
You got it!

14:30.150 --> 14:33.890
Sorry about the wait, everyone!
Off to the next one we go!

15:07.340 --> 15:10.780
The same dream... again.

15:19.970 --> 15:21.500
It's almost time.

15:25.080 --> 15:27.070
Good work today!

15:32.530 --> 15:36.250
I apologize if this is sudden. Hunter Sung...

15:36.570 --> 15:37.530
It's nice to meet you.

15:37.530 --> 15:41.710
I'm Ahn Sangmin, manager of the White
Tiger Guild's Second Administration Team.

15:42.010 --> 15:44.620
Could I trouble you
for a moment of your time?

15:45.990 --> 15:48.880
I'm sure you already know this,

15:48.880 --> 15:54.040
but the White Tiger Guild
is one of the country's best.

15:54.040 --> 15:57.660
However, we're always on the lookout
for promising new talent.

15:58.100 --> 16:01.080
And to get directly to the point,

16:01.080 --> 16:07.070
if you'll join us, I'm willing to pay you
double what Yoojin Construction is offering.

16:07.070 --> 16:11.660
If you have any additional conditions,
I'd be happy to arrange those, as well.

16:11.660 --> 16:13.190
How about that?!

16:13.190 --> 16:17.200
This is too good an offer for someone
who was E-Rank just a while ago!

16:17.570 --> 16:19.820
He's bound to say yes!

16:20.940 --> 16:24.290
How much is the White
Tiger Guild's HQ valued at?

16:24.570 --> 16:25.710
Huh?

16:25.710 --> 16:30.380
Well, uh, I'd say somewhere
around fifty billion...

16:30.380 --> 16:33.470
And that's what you're offering me?

16:34.560 --> 16:36.680
I... I don't follow.

16:40.130 --> 16:42.730
Th-Thirty billion?!

16:44.240 --> 16:45.690
Did you hear that?

16:46.090 --> 16:50.900
That's the market value of the building
that Yoojin Construction has offered me.

16:51.280 --> 16:56.540
You offered to double that, so I was thinking
a building worth fifty billion would do.

16:56.540 --> 16:59.660
I've got the documentation here,
if you don't believe it.

17:00.650 --> 17:02.880
I, er, I must admit,

17:02.880 --> 17:06.160
an offer like that isn't something
I'd be qualified to make on my own...

17:06.160 --> 17:08.090
I'd need to talk to my superiorsâ€”

17:08.090 --> 17:10.700
I think we're done here, then.

17:12.530 --> 17:14.480
I was too desperate.

17:14.480 --> 17:18.400
I should've dug into his deal
with Yoojin Construction first!

17:18.850 --> 17:23.080
I am curious, though.
Who did you hear about me from?

17:23.640 --> 17:27.130
You haven't been snooping around, have you?

17:28.820 --> 17:30.000
H-Huh?!

17:36.490 --> 17:40.050
That... That was the Stealth skill!

17:40.050 --> 17:42.920
A reawakened with Stealth?!

17:42.920 --> 17:47.180
That'd explain the size of the offer
Yoojin Construction made!

17:47.710 --> 17:51.040
I-I do apologize for looking you up
without any word.

17:51.040 --> 17:53.760
But I meant no harmâ€”

17:53.760 --> 17:55.010
Don't turn around.

17:56.440 --> 18:00.540
The tight dungeon market has led
to a delay in rookie training,

18:00.540 --> 18:03.480
without which they can't be sent
on raids as per Guild policy.

18:03.480 --> 18:09.050
I was investigating who was
buying up so many gates

18:09.050 --> 18:11.990
when I came across your name, Hunter Sung.

18:12.370 --> 18:15.910
Who else knows about me?

18:17.850 --> 18:21.110
Just me and one of my subordinates.

18:21.740 --> 18:24.850
I'd rather keep a low profile.

18:24.850 --> 18:29.780
If people start hearing about me, Mr. Ahn,
you two will be the first people I suspect.

18:30.490 --> 18:34.590
I'm obligated to make a formal report
to the head of my guild...

18:34.590 --> 18:39.700
but I don't want to die. I'll make sure
my subordinate keeps his mouth shut, too.

18:39.700 --> 18:41.220
I appreciate that.

18:42.450 --> 18:46.170
I guess monopolizing the C-Rank gates
has been causing some trouble.

18:46.170 --> 18:50.270
I'm sorry, but we'll need to continue
doing so for a while longer.

18:50.270 --> 18:55.200
That is a shame. It puts a real
bottleneck on our developing hunters.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.460
How about a deal, then?

18:58.020 --> 18:59.990
A d-deal?

19:00.390 --> 19:04.450
I'm willing to sell you the rights
to three of our C-Rank gates.

19:04.450 --> 19:06.780
If you pass on this, you may
as well consider your guild

19:06.780 --> 19:08.710
locked out of C-Ranks
for the foreseeable future.

19:08.710 --> 19:11.450
He giving me the hard sell.

19:11.450 --> 19:12.550
But...

19:12.550 --> 19:15.180
Understood. For how much?

19:15.740 --> 19:17.500
Three hundred million apiece.

19:17.500 --> 19:19.260
Three... Three hundred million?!

19:21.850 --> 19:27.230
The mana crystals and essence stones
are only worth 200 million on a good day!

19:27.570 --> 19:29.860
Could you at least lower the price to twoâ€”

19:29.860 --> 19:30.810
All right.

19:33.070 --> 19:34.760
Consider it a deal.

19:35.160 --> 19:39.380
Th-Then we'll be taking three off your hands...

19:39.380 --> 19:43.120
Right. Three C-Rank gates,
for a total of 600 million.

19:44.580 --> 19:46.500
A-All right, then.

19:47.600 --> 19:50.000
Transfer the money here by the end of the day.

19:50.480 --> 19:53.250
One other thing. You can have this.

19:53.250 --> 19:55.660
Close your eyes and open your mouth, please.

19:56.220 --> 19:59.180
It's okay. I won't hurt you.

20:08.100 --> 20:10.480
No way! The cut is gone!

20:10.480 --> 20:11.730
Good evening.

20:14.850 --> 20:21.000
If you're willing to show me all this,
can I take it as a sign that you trust me?

20:21.410 --> 20:25.100
As long as you keep your mouth shut, yes.

20:28.480 --> 20:29.830
M-Manager!

20:30.610 --> 20:32.810
How'd it go? The scouting.

20:32.810 --> 20:35.050
Well, Kichul...

20:35.050 --> 20:39.360
I think he might be a bigger deal
than I had even imagined.

20:43.950 --> 20:48.980
Boss, I confirmed the transfer.
The six hundred mill is really there.

20:49.390 --> 20:53.650
We were about to cancel these gates...
How'd you sell them at such a crazy price?

20:54.130 --> 20:55.830
And to whom?

20:56.160 --> 20:57.820
Let's call it a trade secret.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.620
What do you mean there are extra
C-Rank gates in our jurisdiction?!

21:03.620 --> 21:04.650
Just that!

21:04.650 --> 21:07.870
The three we bought were the only ones
that Yoojin Construction had purchased!

21:08.210 --> 21:11.070
And the rest are all selling
for 70 million or less!

21:11.070 --> 21:12.580
He tricked you!

21:12.580 --> 21:14.660
Y-Yeah...

21:14.660 --> 21:18.660
Not only did I fail at scouting him,
but he scammed me, too!

21:18.660 --> 21:20.300
What a nightmare!

21:20.960 --> 21:23.760
I guess if you're strong enough,
you become bold enough to do anything?!

21:25.260 --> 21:27.720
A message? But from who?

21:28.430 --> 21:29.950
This is Sung Jinwoo.

21:29.950 --> 21:33.460
With this, we're even. I'll forget
the fact that you spied on me.

21:35.400 --> 21:38.360
Okay. So that's how it is.

21:38.360 --> 21:40.860
That's one in his favor.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.200
This guy sure isn't to be messed with.

21:43.200 --> 21:45.520
Was that from Hunter Sung?

21:45.520 --> 21:46.590
Yeah.

21:47.160 --> 21:52.780
He might have raked me over the coals,
but I've got Hunter Sung's contact info.

21:53.630 --> 21:56.560
I'll be satisfied with that for now.

21:59.560 --> 22:02.010
A job-change quest, huh?

22:02.850 --> 22:04.280
Should be interesting.
