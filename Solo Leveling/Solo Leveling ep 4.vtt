WEBVTT

00:01.086 --> 00:03.073
STEEL-FANGED LYCAN

00:16.062 --> 00:17.021
Eh?

00:19.075 --> 00:21.083
My body feels light!

00:26.059 --> 00:28.008
I've tried so hard
to get this second life!

00:28.008 --> 00:31.041
I can't succumb to fear!

00:32.018 --> 00:33.093
I will not die here!

00:36.072 --> 00:37.068
Huh?

00:38.069 --> 00:41.015
Is it because my strength ability
has improved?

00:43.009 --> 00:45.002
But...

00:45.002 --> 00:46.036
It's still stronger than me.

00:50.041 --> 00:51.091
No, my attacks didn't work!

00:59.083 --> 01:01.037
What should I do?

02:27.084 --> 02:32.008
SOLO LEVELING

02:41.093 --> 02:43.073
I can't do this alone.

02:46.009 --> 02:49.011
I had no party or healers.

02:49.061 --> 02:51.057
All I have is water and food.

02:52.099 --> 02:54.043
If this goes on...

02:55.099 --> 02:58.028
If only I had a weapon
with magic power...

02:58.063 --> 02:59.053
A weapon?

02:59.087 --> 03:01.029
Inventory!

03:16.063 --> 03:19.019
Though I don't know
why this is in my inventory.

03:21.031 --> 03:24.023
Mr. Kim said this sword
cost him 3 million.

03:25.006 --> 03:26.094
This is an item that I couldn't afford.

03:27.073 --> 03:29.015
I can't think about that now.

03:29.015 --> 03:30.057
I'll use this sword for now.

03:31.004 --> 03:33.023
Huh? My body stopped hurting.

03:35.099 --> 03:37.032
As long as I have a weapon,

03:37.095 --> 03:39.002
there's nothing to fear.

03:40.041 --> 03:41.053
Huh?

03:42.087 --> 03:43.095
What?

03:43.095 --> 03:44.087
I can't pull it out!

03:47.008 --> 03:48.092
Please, come out!

03:58.038 --> 04:00.067
Your steel fangs seem genuine.

04:01.076 --> 04:03.068
I finally got this sword.

04:04.097 --> 04:07.039
Don't even try to damage it!

04:12.082 --> 04:14.015
Now that I think about it...

04:15.015 --> 04:16.069
Compared to those things,

04:17.062 --> 04:19.016
these beasts are nothing.

04:36.005 --> 04:38.097
Huh? I'm level 2 now.

04:38.097 --> 04:41.057
I never leveled up
when I completed daily quests.

04:42.005 --> 04:44.089
I see. Because this is actual combat.

04:44.089 --> 04:46.089
And my wounds just healed before.

04:47.035 --> 04:51.044
If I level up, will all my abilities
increase by 1 point?

04:52.006 --> 04:53.094
A total of 5 points.

04:53.094 --> 04:56.003
I only get 3 points from daily quests.

04:56.003 --> 04:59.004
So leveling up through combat is faster.

04:59.004 --> 05:03.016
How much will my abilities grow
with each point increase?

05:03.016 --> 05:05.087
Even intelligence and perception
have been quantified.

05:06.074 --> 05:08.079
Strength is the easiest to understand.

05:08.079 --> 05:10.092
With only 32 points,

05:10.092 --> 05:12.087
my movements became much lighter.

05:13.083 --> 05:15.034
I'm only guessing.

05:15.034 --> 05:17.088
But I think the higher
the basic ability,

05:17.088 --> 05:20.055
the more points I'll be able to get.

05:22.034 --> 05:25.043
So... I really can become stronger.

05:28.027 --> 05:31.006
But they are just five small magic beasts.

05:31.006 --> 05:32.069
I may have got carried away.

05:34.098 --> 05:37.086
Do they have magic gems on them?

05:38.061 --> 05:39.057
ITEM: LYCAN FANG

05:40.061 --> 05:43.057
I got an item instead of a magic gem?

05:44.007 --> 05:46.091
Strange things are happening to me.

05:47.058 --> 05:50.058
If I am controlled by
a system like a game,

05:51.012 --> 05:55.025
will this dungeon and magic beasts
differ from the ones in reality?

05:56.092 --> 05:59.000
Ah, I found the shop.

05:59.046 --> 06:00.034
Purchase.

06:00.034 --> 06:01.038
SHOP

06:01.038 --> 06:04.022
YOU CANNOT BUY ANYTHING AT YOUR LEVEL
New players can't use it?

06:04.076 --> 06:05.072
Sell.

06:10.047 --> 06:11.098
20 gold coins?

06:12.094 --> 06:15.056
How much would that be in cash?

06:16.019 --> 06:19.023
But this dungeon is at most E-Rank,

06:19.023 --> 06:21.086
so 20 gold coins probably isn't much.

06:23.024 --> 06:24.061
Alright.

06:24.061 --> 06:25.091
What should I do now?

06:26.007 --> 06:28.099
I can't leave unless I defeat the Boss.

06:29.045 --> 06:32.025
It seems I could leave once
I get the teleportation stone,

06:32.025 --> 06:34.042
but I have no idea where that is.

06:35.026 --> 06:37.003
If this drags on, I'll be short of food.

06:41.026 --> 06:42.008
Although it's an E-Rank dungeon,

06:42.008 --> 06:45.023
it's still so hard for me
to defeat the Boss alone.

06:45.086 --> 06:46.059
Wait...

06:46.059 --> 06:49.022
If I keep leveling up,
I might stand a chance.

06:51.081 --> 06:53.027
Although it's possible

06:53.027 --> 06:55.023
I'll be dead before that.

07:08.024 --> 07:09.083
There's nothing to be afraid of.

07:10.045 --> 07:12.079
I've already died once before.

07:29.047 --> 07:32.014
I won't die that easily.

07:32.081 --> 07:34.089
So you all shouldn't die too easily either.

07:37.019 --> 07:38.075
If I kill you in an instant,

07:39.027 --> 07:41.036
I'll feel really bad.

07:43.003 --> 07:45.031
You are qualified as a Hunter.

07:46.089 --> 07:49.012
Now I can pay mom's medical bills.

07:49.037 --> 07:51.051
If I could have another chance...

07:54.037 --> 07:55.012
Let's...

07:56.029 --> 07:58.017
Let's have a fierce battle!

08:03.055 --> 08:05.017
As long as I'm alive,

08:05.017 --> 08:06.084
I'll fight to the last moment.

08:07.093 --> 08:10.005
As long as it makes me stronger...

08:11.039 --> 08:13.001
I can abide by any rules.

08:13.001 --> 08:14.064
NOTIFICATION LEVELED UP
I can abide by any rules.

08:17.073 --> 08:19.085
YOU HAVE ACQUIRED TITLE:
WOLF ASSASSIN

08:23.094 --> 08:25.015
That doesn't look good.

08:25.057 --> 08:27.061
Can't the guild come
to deal with it quickly?

08:38.021 --> 08:40.096
This sword is almost done for.

08:42.004 --> 08:45.055
Weapons are just expendables after all.

08:46.017 --> 08:47.086
No matter what weapon I get,

08:47.086 --> 08:50.043
it'll wear out
after a few times in the dungeon.

08:51.009 --> 08:51.064
However...

08:51.097 --> 08:54.028
It seems like the battle is over.

08:55.006 --> 08:57.073
TITLE: WOLF ASSASSIN

08:57.073 --> 08:59.056
INVENTORY

08:59.098 --> 09:01.098
34 wolf fangs.

09:02.044 --> 09:04.019
Two worn-out short swords.

09:04.019 --> 09:05.057
Traveler's attire.

09:06.055 --> 09:07.059
And...

09:07.099 --> 09:11.024
The teleportation stone is easier
to get than I imagined.

09:12.041 --> 09:13.085
Should I return?

09:16.003 --> 09:20.005
But, there's no guarantee that there will be
another chance to become stronger this easily.

09:21.035 --> 09:24.063
What will happen to this dungeon
if I use the teleportation stone?

09:24.063 --> 09:25.067
Will it disappear?

09:26.055 --> 09:31.063
Will it disappear like
a time-limited event in a game?

09:32.051 --> 09:33.064
Regardless...

09:33.064 --> 09:36.081
It seems like I am being toyed
with by some unknown force.

09:38.022 --> 09:40.081
And I cannot escape.

09:43.085 --> 09:46.074
Should I continue forward or turn back?

10:02.005 --> 10:04.015
Yes, this is Lee Joohee.

10:05.008 --> 10:07.022
Ah, you're from the Hunter's Association.

10:07.084 --> 10:09.081
I'm really sorry about earlier.

10:11.045 --> 10:12.047
Eh?

10:12.047 --> 10:15.003
That Gate had a Dungeon Break?

10:15.055 --> 10:17.005
That's right around here.

10:17.064 --> 10:19.077
It's all because I rejected him.

10:20.007 --> 10:24.006
We're currently assembling
available Hunters to deal with it.

10:24.006 --> 10:26.097
But there's a serious shortage of healers.

10:32.003 --> 10:33.045
I understand.

10:34.077 --> 10:36.087
Every time I level up,

10:37.049 --> 10:41.013
my battles with magic beasts become easier.

10:49.096 --> 10:52.062
The color denoting the magic
beast's name also changes.

10:52.062 --> 10:55.047
White means it's weaker than me.

10:55.047 --> 10:57.035
Orange means it has the same level as me.

10:57.093 --> 10:59.089
And red means it's stronger than me.

11:00.047 --> 11:02.098
Lycan, which was initially marked red,

11:02.098 --> 11:04.085
is marked white now.

11:05.044 --> 11:07.095
This indicates I have
become much stronger.

11:08.048 --> 11:09.094
Even so...

11:09.094 --> 11:13.035
I'm not sure I can beat that monster
down there with my current strength.

11:14.021 --> 11:16.091
I don't know if it's because
my perception has improved.

11:16.091 --> 11:18.078
I can clearly feel...

11:19.074 --> 11:21.099
...that the monster below...

11:21.099 --> 11:23.054
...is terrifying.

11:25.096 --> 11:28.046
My level doesn't seem
to be rising anymore.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.092
If I keep fighting like this,
this sword probably won't last.

11:44.093 --> 11:48.023
I don't remember the stairs
at this station being this long.

12:02.074 --> 12:04.007
It no longer looks like a station.

12:11.006 --> 12:12.069
So fast!

12:17.037 --> 12:18.026
The sword...

12:24.006 --> 12:26.023
I've leveled up a lot.

12:27.006 --> 12:28.056
But its name...

12:30.004 --> 12:31.004
...is still orange.

12:31.004 --> 12:32.065
KING OF THE SWAMP
BLUE VENOM-FANGED KASAKA

12:33.028 --> 12:35.036
You're the boss here, right?

12:36.011 --> 12:39.045
It is covered in scales.
This sword is useless against it.

12:39.078 --> 12:41.082
Going bare-handed will be worse.

12:52.013 --> 12:55.025
Its attacks are fast and heavy!

12:55.025 --> 12:57.059
I can only try to weaken
its defense first!

12:57.059 --> 13:00.068
But how can I pierce
through these thick scales?!

13:08.056 --> 13:10.023
If I took this hit head-on,

13:10.023 --> 13:11.027
I would be dead.

13:31.067 --> 13:34.025
I thought I had become a bit stronger...

13:43.047 --> 13:46.064
Is it still not enough?

13:47.081 --> 13:50.068
How much stronger do I have to get...

13:51.089 --> 13:55.086
...to escape this life of constant ridicule?!

14:00.032 --> 14:02.024
The Weakest Hunter of All Mankind?

14:02.082 --> 14:05.062
Everyone has been calling you that lately.

14:06.016 --> 14:06.066
Yes.

14:07.003 --> 14:08.024
Good grief.

14:08.024 --> 14:10.062
There are always people
who speak childishly.

14:11.005 --> 14:14.054
You must work hard and make them
change their mind.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.013
Yes.

14:18.013 --> 14:19.042
I understand.

14:36.081 --> 14:39.061
They gave me that nickname
because I was too weak.

14:40.019 --> 14:42.009
I was looked down upon
because I was too weak.

14:45.028 --> 14:47.045
I also felt useless.

14:48.083 --> 14:50.033
As long as I'm strong enough...

14:52.002 --> 14:56.000
One with overwhelming power
can naturally remain undefeated.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
The weak are powerless before the strong.

14:59.035 --> 15:02.071
The weak can only stand still,
trembling in fear.

15:02.071 --> 15:04.097
People are looked down upon
because they are weak.

15:05.043 --> 15:10.031
Even if they're knowledgeable,
smart, or considerate,

15:10.031 --> 15:12.031
before the strong,

15:13.014 --> 15:15.056
they will be betrayed!

15:16.015 --> 15:17.065
Gentleness is meaningless.

15:17.065 --> 15:19.011
So I must become stronger.

15:19.011 --> 15:21.023
That's why I came here!

15:35.054 --> 15:37.004
I...

15:42.063 --> 15:45.017
I must become stronger.

15:51.026 --> 15:52.056
Not enough!

15:53.006 --> 15:55.035
Compared to that thing...

15:55.035 --> 15:57.007
Compared to the fear back then...

15:58.004 --> 16:00.019
You have nothing to make me afraid!

16:15.029 --> 16:18.012
I've put all my ability
points into strength!

16:23.038 --> 16:24.084
With my current self...

16:28.076 --> 16:29.076
With my current self...

16:32.035 --> 16:35.072
I'm going to kill you!

16:36.089 --> 16:42.011
Die!

16:57.091 --> 16:58.071
NOTIFICATION LEVELED UP

17:03.067 --> 17:04.063
NOTIFICATION LEVELED UP

17:12.039 --> 17:14.005
It seems...

17:14.081 --> 17:17.026
...I got a bit stronger.

17:18.035 --> 17:21.023
YOU HAVE DEFEATED A KING OF THE SWAMP,
BLUE VENOM-FANGED KASAKA

17:26.002 --> 17:29.007
Thanks to that, I got good stuff.

17:29.082 --> 17:32.078
This dagger isn't made from bone
but from teeth?

17:34.062 --> 17:37.016
Its power is twice that of Mr. Kim's sword,

17:37.016 --> 17:39.066
and it comes with paralysis and bleeding effects.

17:40.016 --> 17:42.004
By comparison...

17:42.004 --> 17:44.008
This thing is too terrifying to use.

17:44.008 --> 17:45.088
Anyway, I'll collect it for now.

17:46.084 --> 17:49.008
AS THE BOSS HAS BEEN DEFEATED, THE DUNGEON
WILL NOW REVERT TO ITS ORIGINAL STATE.

17:55.035 --> 17:56.079
Is it over?

18:03.069 --> 18:07.065
HAPJEONG STATION

18:08.003 --> 18:09.044
Not a person in sight.

18:09.044 --> 18:10.086
What time is it?

18:11.019 --> 18:12.057
Hey!

18:12.057 --> 18:14.007
How can you just walk in here?

18:14.057 --> 18:16.066
Didn't you hear the announcement?

18:16.066 --> 18:17.091
Announcement?

18:17.091 --> 18:19.073
Don't play dumb with me.

18:20.066 --> 18:22.062
Are you a Hunter?

18:23.000 --> 18:24.088
Yes, I am a Hunter.

18:24.088 --> 18:26.038
Sorry for being rude.

18:26.038 --> 18:27.088
I'll take you to the site.

18:27.088 --> 18:28.092
This way, please.

18:28.092 --> 18:30.034
Ah, okay.

18:30.092 --> 18:32.067
Has something happened?

18:38.006 --> 18:39.081
Dungeon Break.

18:39.081 --> 18:42.031
Did magic beasts get out?

18:42.031 --> 18:44.098
Almost all of them have been killed.

18:44.098 --> 18:47.069
Only a giant magic beast
has been left.

18:48.002 --> 18:50.049
I don't know if it's because
my perception has improved.

18:51.015 --> 18:52.001
I can feel it.

18:52.094 --> 18:54.007
That thing over there is the Boss.

19:00.037 --> 19:02.066
Please do not take photos.

19:02.066 --> 19:04.016
This place is very dangerous.

19:06.004 --> 19:07.079
Kill it quickly.

19:07.079 --> 19:09.099
What if the land prices here drop?

19:10.038 --> 19:11.092
All healers!

19:11.092 --> 19:14.038
Please focus on healing the Tanker!

19:14.038 --> 19:16.026
I don't need you to tell me!

19:18.047 --> 19:20.081
What are the Fighters doing?

19:21.007 --> 19:23.066
Why is it not weakening at all?

19:24.014 --> 19:27.006
Its defense is just too strong.

19:27.006 --> 19:29.065
We have few Mages among us.

19:29.065 --> 19:31.069
Excuse me, let me through.

19:31.069 --> 19:33.033
Is it because it's a temporary team?

19:33.033 --> 19:34.069
They don't work well together.

19:36.049 --> 19:38.007
Their ranks are too low.

19:38.057 --> 19:42.033
It should be eight E-Rank Hunters
and one D-Rank Hunter.

19:42.099 --> 19:44.048
And because that Tanker is D-rank,

19:44.048 --> 19:47.029
it became a prolonged battle
as no one could deliver a fatal blow.

19:48.008 --> 19:49.029
As for the Healers...

19:49.029 --> 19:51.025
Two D-Rank healers
and one B-Rank healer?

19:52.047 --> 19:53.063
Hey, Miss!

19:53.095 --> 19:55.067
Hurry up and heal them!

19:55.067 --> 19:57.047
Aren't you a B-Rank healer?

19:57.093 --> 19:59.051
What are you dazed about?!

19:59.051 --> 20:00.076
Ah, yes!

20:03.027 --> 20:05.073
Damn it, pull yourself together.

20:10.098 --> 20:14.061
So she still hasn't gotten over it
after a week.

20:15.024 --> 20:16.004
It's no surprise.

20:17.004 --> 20:18.036
After all, I also...

20:19.087 --> 20:20.099
No.

20:23.095 --> 20:25.002
This is a D-Rank Boss.

20:26.079 --> 20:29.051
It's weaker than
the one I just defeated.

20:30.005 --> 20:32.042
We'll get wiped out if this continues!

20:32.078 --> 20:34.088
We can't defeat it
without a high-rank Hunter!

20:35.038 --> 20:37.059
As long as I can break its defense,

20:38.003 --> 20:39.026
I can defeat it.

20:43.085 --> 20:45.093
I'll give it the most powerful hit.

20:46.089 --> 20:47.098
Take this!

20:49.077 --> 20:50.048
Huh?

20:50.075 --> 20:52.007
Good, its defense is broken.

20:52.007 --> 20:53.048
We can defeat it.

21:02.024 --> 21:03.024
We did it.

21:03.024 --> 21:04.083
We defeated it.

21:06.004 --> 21:08.041
All attacks were ineffective against it.

21:08.041 --> 21:10.058
Why were we able to break its defense?

21:10.058 --> 21:14.009
Our attacks had no effect.

21:14.088 --> 21:16.076
What was that thing that just flew in?

21:18.076 --> 21:23.026
A Boss Golem that remained unscathed
under the attack of a dozen Hunters

21:23.026 --> 21:25.018
was defeated by this thing?

21:26.093 --> 21:28.027
Sorry.

21:28.027 --> 21:28.081
Yes.

21:29.023 --> 21:31.077
Who threw this?

21:31.077 --> 21:34.006
Oh, it was the Hunter over there...

21:34.053 --> 21:35.023
Huh?

21:35.009 --> 21:38.064
- He was just here.
- Such terrifying destructive power.

21:39.069 --> 21:41.077
Is he a high-rank Hunter?

21:48.095 --> 21:51.005
I didn't expect to take it
down with a single strike.

21:51.005 --> 21:54.086
Perhaps that Golem was running
out of vitality anyway.

21:59.034 --> 22:01.047
Jinwoo...

23:37.031 --> 23:39.098
