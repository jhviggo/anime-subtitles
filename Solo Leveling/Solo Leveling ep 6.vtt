WEBVTT

00:08.007 --> 00:09.032
Dongsuk.

00:09.032 --> 00:11.062
Why do we make it so complicated?

00:11.062 --> 00:13.065
We can just kill them there.

00:14.066 --> 00:16.037
Are you an idiot?

00:16.037 --> 00:18.041
If we do it there
and wake up that spider,

00:18.041 --> 00:20.021
how will we take the mana crystal?

00:20.079 --> 00:23.057
I don't care what his nickname is,

00:23.057 --> 00:26.034
an E-Rank Hunter and a D-Rank Hunter
without combat experience

00:26.034 --> 00:28.009
will never defeat that Boss.

00:28.059 --> 00:31.051
We wait for that spider
to eat them and fall asleep again.

00:31.051 --> 00:33.035
Then we can take the Mana Crystal out.

00:34.001 --> 00:36.018
Do we blast it open again
with flash magic?

00:36.054 --> 00:38.064
That'll wake up the spider again.

00:40.081 --> 00:42.073
There's a small path above the cave,

00:43.036 --> 00:44.077
we can go down from there.

00:45.048 --> 00:47.003
I see.

00:47.003 --> 00:48.082
You are a genius, Dongsuk.

00:48.082 --> 00:50.061
But will it fall asleep?

00:50.061 --> 00:53.091
If it doesn't,
we'll have to take it down.

00:53.091 --> 00:55.095
That guy's name is Yoo Jinho, right?

00:55.095 --> 00:57.081
Did you see his equipment?

00:57.081 --> 01:00.041
His sword and shield alone
are worth hundreds of millions.

01:00.091 --> 01:02.058
If we can't take the mana crystal,

01:02.058 --> 01:04.092
we'll take his belongings instead.

01:05.005 --> 01:08.021
Let me see which
wealthy family he's from.

01:08.063 --> 01:10.084
At least we should attend his funeral.

01:11.003 --> 01:12.072
By the way,

01:12.072 --> 01:15.068
the noise we made
when sealing the road

01:15.068 --> 01:18.014
must have infuriated that Boss a lot.

01:18.085 --> 01:20.014
Kyuhwan,

01:20.014 --> 01:22.098
do you think you can kill
that beast by yourself?

01:23.023 --> 01:25.086
How could I possibly do that?

01:25.086 --> 01:27.004
Honestly, me neither.

01:27.086 --> 01:30.019
The Boss in Dungeon
cannot be underestimated.

01:32.028 --> 01:34.099
In other words, those two...

01:34.099 --> 01:38.054
...can't possibly leave there alive.

01:39.016 --> 01:40.058
Please wait.

01:40.058 --> 01:43.033
At least a B-Rank Hunter
can defeat a C-Rank Boss alone.

01:43.033 --> 01:46.059
Or a top-tier C-Rank Hunter.

01:46.059 --> 01:48.003
Jinwoo, you can't do it...

01:49.038 --> 01:51.026
Let's find a way to get out!

01:52.013 --> 01:53.097
Jinho is right.

01:53.097 --> 01:57.026
Even though I've had a second
awakening and leveled up,

01:57.026 --> 01:58.097
I am still very weak now.

02:00.002 --> 02:03.077
The Venom-Fanged Kasaka
in the Instant Dungeon

02:03.077 --> 02:04.098
should be D-Rank.

02:06.002 --> 02:08.082
That Golem Boss is
probably D-Rank or lower.

02:10.048 --> 02:14.007
This Boss is worlds apart
from those beasts.

02:16.019 --> 02:17.037
But why?

02:18.061 --> 02:21.004
I don't feel any pressure
that's making me tremble.

02:22.002 --> 02:26.067
I've become strong enough
to no longer fear a C-Rank Boss.

02:28.046 --> 02:30.034
My current level is 18.

02:32.084 --> 02:34.059
Against a C-Rank Boss...

02:36.077 --> 02:38.026
I have a chance of defeating it!

02:43.023 --> 02:45.089
Hunters are called Hunters...

02:47.019 --> 02:49.065
...because the real hunt begins now.

04:14.094 --> 04:19.099
SOLO LEVELING

04:29.025 --> 04:30.058
Thank you for your hard work.

04:31.054 --> 04:36.009
Government officials, media,
and energy-related groups...

04:36.009 --> 04:39.047
Having meetings with them for days
in a row is truly exhausting.

04:40.034 --> 04:43.093
I've never been good at
beating around the bush.

04:47.064 --> 04:50.073
I heard you have no plans coming up.

04:51.044 --> 04:54.069
If possible, could I ask you
for a sparring match?

04:55.065 --> 04:58.007
Perhaps it could change your mood.

05:01.053 --> 05:04.002
I am already a withered veteran...

05:04.053 --> 05:08.037
But I can't refuse when a young
person seeks my guidance.

05:17.088 --> 05:19.046
Its hide is very hard.

05:23.009 --> 05:24.064
Its attack is surprisingly powerful.

05:25.001 --> 05:26.006
If I took one hit, I would be dead.

05:33.014 --> 05:34.069
That kind of move...

05:34.069 --> 05:36.044
He is definitely not an E-Rank Hunter.

05:37.065 --> 05:38.008
Who is he?

05:40.082 --> 05:41.095
Is he...

05:41.095 --> 05:43.049
...a False Ranker?!

05:44.003 --> 05:45.087
I've heard about them.

05:45.087 --> 05:50.041
Very few Hunters can control their magic
power to deliberately get a lower rating.

05:50.041 --> 05:53.007
Such Hunters are called False Rankers.

05:53.087 --> 05:55.067
And they are usually...

05:56.013 --> 05:58.072
...a psychopaths who take
pleasure in killing!

06:01.088 --> 06:04.026
Why did I come here...?

06:04.072 --> 06:06.047
Dad...

06:12.027 --> 06:13.039
Damn it.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.069
I can't deal any damage
to its hard hide!

06:17.011 --> 06:17.094
My fatigue...

06:18.051 --> 06:20.065
If it keeps increasing,
it will slow me down.

06:21.032 --> 06:23.061
I need to get rid of it
before that happens.

06:24.007 --> 06:25.057
Paralysis and drain.

06:26.024 --> 06:29.003
This dagger's special abilities
are key to victory.

06:29.062 --> 06:31.049
It'll take effect if I hit its weak spot.

06:31.087 --> 06:32.007
That's the spot!

06:38.025 --> 06:39.059
Acid?

06:39.059 --> 06:41.046
It had this trick too.

06:42.026 --> 06:44.017
Tough hide and the strong acid...

06:44.017 --> 06:46.068
It's tougher to deal with than I expected.

06:47.051 --> 06:49.089
If this continues,
I have no chance of winning.

06:50.076 --> 06:53.081
I have to close the distance
between us.

06:54.043 --> 06:56.014
The new skill, "Dash."

06:56.081 --> 06:59.056
I'll use this move to get to it!

07:07.091 --> 07:08.091
THE DEBUFF HAS BEEN CANCELED OUT

07:12.087 --> 07:15.003
If one hit doesn't work,

07:15.003 --> 07:17.033
I'll do it again and again!

07:18.075 --> 07:20.048
He's so fast!

07:20.096 --> 07:23.013
But can his vitality hold up?

07:23.099 --> 07:25.046
What on earth is he planning?

07:28.018 --> 07:29.047
Faster...

07:31.022 --> 07:32.085
More faster...

07:35.035 --> 07:36.081
Almost there...!

07:41.098 --> 07:42.094
Jinwoo!

08:01.025 --> 08:02.029
Jinwoo!

08:26.004 --> 08:26.009
DEBUFF: PARALYSIS

08:27.078 --> 08:28.028
DEBUFF: DRAIN

08:29.024 --> 08:30.074
DEBUFF: PARALYSIS - DRAIN

08:31.074 --> 08:32.024
DEBUFF: PARALYSIS

08:32.087 --> 08:33.028
DEBUFF: DRAIN

08:33.007 --> 08:34.003
DEBUFF: PARALYSIS

08:43.079 --> 08:46.025
YOU HAVE DEFEATED
THE MASTER OF THE DUNGEON

08:47.092 --> 08:52.059
Thankfully I didn't claim
the rewards for the daily quest.

08:53.026 --> 08:55.045
Otherwise, I can't even imagine
the consequences.

08:57.093 --> 08:59.068
Unbelievable...

08:59.068 --> 09:02.023
He defeated the Boss all by himself.

09:03.065 --> 09:04.009
There's no mistake...

09:05.044 --> 09:08.011
He's a False Ranker!

09:09.003 --> 09:11.061
How much is this worth?

09:12.007 --> 09:13.053
Umm...

09:13.053 --> 09:15.014
S-Sir.

09:15.078 --> 09:19.008
Do you need me to help you
with the magic gem?

09:19.008 --> 09:21.071
I can carry the luggage too.

09:22.021 --> 09:25.071
Have some water, Sir.

09:25.071 --> 09:27.042
T-Thanks...

09:27.082 --> 09:29.046
Why is he suddenly calling me that?

09:29.084 --> 09:31.072
Please take a rest, Sir!

09:31.072 --> 09:34.039
I'll mine the mana crystal.

09:35.093 --> 09:38.039
What's with this kid?

09:40.064 --> 09:42.048
Huh? They are still alive.

09:50.007 --> 09:52.028
TRAINING ROOM

10:02.079 --> 10:04.029
Are you okay?

10:04.029 --> 10:05.038
Yes.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.021
Thank you for your guidance.

10:07.059 --> 10:11.005
I've relaxed a lot.

10:11.005 --> 10:12.042
Thank you.

10:12.097 --> 10:14.038
You are amazing, President.

10:14.038 --> 10:16.068
There's no sign of your
skills getting dull.

10:16.068 --> 10:20.039
No, I'm no longer as good
as I used to be.

10:21.018 --> 10:24.035
Jinchul, your moves have improved.

10:24.035 --> 10:26.023
It seems you've done
a lot of training.

10:26.023 --> 10:28.031
Training can't increase
Hunters' level,

10:28.031 --> 10:31.073
but it can improve their skills.

10:31.073 --> 10:33.024
Yeah.

10:33.024 --> 10:35.049
Don't take pride in the Hunter's strength.

10:35.049 --> 10:38.041
Having physical and mental
training is indeed important.

10:38.041 --> 10:42.012
Especially if you're going
to a dangerous place like a dungeon.

10:42.079 --> 10:44.012
After all, in such places,

10:44.075 --> 10:49.059
you see the worst of people.

10:49.096 --> 10:51.046
Is the Boss dead?

10:51.046 --> 10:53.067
Was this spider just big and stupid?

10:53.067 --> 10:54.008
What a crap.

10:55.017 --> 10:58.064
With his equipment, defeating
a C-Rank Boss isn't impossible.

10:58.064 --> 11:02.052
Even so, it's embarrassing
to lose to a D-Rank Hunter.

11:02.085 --> 11:05.006
Dongsuk, what should we do?

11:05.006 --> 11:06.073
What else?

11:07.006 --> 11:08.044
Yoo Jinho.

11:08.089 --> 11:11.023
I looked you up because of
your expensive equipment.

11:11.023 --> 11:12.061
You are no ordinary person.

11:13.032 --> 11:16.045
The president of Yoojin Construction,
Yoo Myunghan.

11:16.045 --> 11:18.011
He's your dad, right?

11:18.099 --> 11:21.003
So what?

11:21.003 --> 11:22.079
I'll give you a chance.

11:23.007 --> 11:25.033
Kill Sung Jinwoo.

11:25.033 --> 11:26.029
Eh?

11:27.008 --> 11:29.004
You know what we do, right?

11:29.004 --> 11:31.000
We kill the useless ones

11:31.000 --> 11:33.008
who just come to fill numbers
to take the spoils for ourselves.

11:34.021 --> 11:35.042
Yoo Jinho,

11:35.042 --> 11:37.068
I want you to be our accomplice.

11:37.068 --> 11:39.068
If you do, I'll spare you.

11:39.068 --> 11:41.001
How can I...

11:41.051 --> 11:45.002
That young Hunter killed a C-Rank Boss
on his own with that equipment.

11:45.006 --> 11:47.052
Any special effects
would be troublesome.

11:48.039 --> 11:52.023
If you refuse,
you can die together.

11:53.019 --> 11:54.023
What's wrong?

11:54.023 --> 11:56.032
What's there to hesitate about?

11:56.032 --> 11:58.086
No one will know
what happened here.

11:59.016 --> 12:03.004
Are you afraid of that E-Rank trash?

12:20.001 --> 12:20.089
Huh?

12:22.014 --> 12:23.006
You...

12:23.006 --> 12:25.068
Are you taking his side?

12:29.002 --> 12:31.027
Dongsuk, what do we do now?

12:31.027 --> 12:32.098
You start with the weaker one.

12:33.098 --> 12:35.004
Have you two...

12:36.003 --> 12:39.015
...ever killed people?

12:44.008 --> 12:44.066
AN URGENT QUEST HAS ARRIVED.
Urgent quest?

12:44.066 --> 12:46.004
DEFEAT THE ENEMIES 0/6
Urgent quest?

12:46.036 --> 12:47.007
What's going on?

12:48.041 --> 12:50.079
Pay attention here!

12:50.079 --> 12:51.054
Take this!

12:59.038 --> 13:00.043
Sir Jinwoo!

13:06.014 --> 13:07.052
Heejin.

13:11.019 --> 13:12.081
Long time no see.

13:12.081 --> 13:15.009
What's going on
at the White Tiger Guild lately?

13:15.009 --> 13:17.036
Nothing much.

13:17.036 --> 13:19.003
It's the same as usual.

13:19.003 --> 13:21.028
How about your Hunters Guild, Gina?

13:21.028 --> 13:23.091
The same as usual too.

13:24.028 --> 13:26.091
By the way,
you went to Hunter Cha's

13:26.091 --> 13:29.041
A-Rank dungeon training, right?

13:29.041 --> 13:30.075
How did it go?

13:30.075 --> 13:32.054
It was awesome.

13:32.054 --> 13:33.092
It ended in an instant.

13:34.046 --> 13:37.092
Those A-Rank magic beasts
we struggled with...

13:42.051 --> 13:44.039
...were instantly taken down by her.

13:45.039 --> 13:48.022
She defeated enemies effortlessly.

13:48.051 --> 13:50.006
Needless to say,
we were surprised.

13:50.006 --> 13:53.002
Kihoon was quite shocked.

13:54.035 --> 13:57.004
Because his goal was to
become the next Captain.

13:57.004 --> 13:59.004
He's really worked hard, hasn't he?

13:59.004 --> 14:01.061
What about Kim Chul?

14:01.061 --> 14:04.066
He also wants to be
the Captain, right?

14:04.066 --> 14:07.024
He's not a bad guy...

14:07.024 --> 14:09.087
That says it all.

14:10.041 --> 14:12.004
But after all,

14:12.004 --> 14:13.087
we are pretty lucky,

14:13.087 --> 14:18.046
as we are able to join large guilds
like Hunters Guild and White Tiger Guild.

14:18.046 --> 14:19.088
That's true.

14:19.088 --> 14:20.084
Yes.

14:21.013 --> 14:25.034
After all, there are ominous
rumors in some places.

14:25.068 --> 14:27.026
Ominous rumors?

14:27.076 --> 14:30.093
The teams with an abnormally
high casualty rate.

14:30.093 --> 14:32.000
Something like that.

14:35.035 --> 14:38.019
Yoo Jinho, he's already dead.

14:40.007 --> 14:41.053
How can you do that?!

14:44.003 --> 14:46.011
How could I forget?

14:46.078 --> 14:49.095
This is a place that believes
in the survival of the fittest...

14:50.066 --> 14:54.021
A place full of violence and deceit...

14:55.025 --> 15:05.051
How could I...

15:06.068 --> 15:08.018
I see.

15:08.018 --> 15:09.062
I've become numb.

15:10.054 --> 15:11.051
Careless,

15:11.051 --> 15:13.002
arrogant,

15:13.002 --> 15:14.027
and deluded.

15:17.019 --> 15:18.044
Enemies...

15:18.098 --> 15:22.086
The system is forcing me to kill people.

15:23.057 --> 15:26.003
Does that mean
it doesn't want me to die?

15:27.078 --> 15:30.024
This is neither coincidence nor kindness.

15:31.066 --> 15:34.002
The system needs me.

15:38.088 --> 15:40.063
I must be strong.

15:41.096 --> 15:44.017
Sir! Thank goodness.

15:44.017 --> 15:46.084
Hey, he's still alive.

15:48.076 --> 15:50.022
I see.

15:52.031 --> 15:54.056
The system is using me,

15:55.006 --> 15:57.044
and I am using the system too.

15:57.098 --> 16:00.086
Hey, Kyuhwan, don't hold back.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.009
How could I forget?

16:04.069 --> 16:06.082
The weak will have
everything taken from them.

16:06.082 --> 16:08.007
This place is just like that.

16:08.007 --> 16:10.045
You understand it very well,

16:10.045 --> 16:13.008
The Weakest Hunter of All Mankind.

16:13.062 --> 16:14.091
That means...

16:14.091 --> 16:18.012
You are ready to face
the consequences, right?

16:18.083 --> 16:19.071
What?

16:19.071 --> 16:21.029
What are you saying?

16:21.029 --> 16:23.038
If you guys are Hunters...

16:24.096 --> 16:28.084
...you should be ready
to become hunted.

16:30.003 --> 16:32.062
Dongsuk, let me do it.

16:33.003 --> 16:34.072
Buddy.

16:34.072 --> 16:37.048
It seems like you don't quite
understand the situation.

16:38.002 --> 16:39.098
Ready to be hunted?

16:39.098 --> 16:43.052
What can a boastful
E-Rank Hunter do?

16:43.052 --> 16:45.069
The Weakest Hunter of All Man—

16:54.033 --> 16:55.016
What?

16:55.099 --> 16:57.045
NUMBER OF ENEMIES DEFEATED: 1/6

16:58.025 --> 16:59.044
One.

16:59.044 --> 17:01.004
Ju-Juntae...?

17:01.004 --> 17:02.000
No way.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.092
When did he have
a weapon in his hand?!

17:03.092 --> 17:05.096
Where did he hide it?!

17:05.096 --> 17:08.097
Even if he was careless,
Juntae was still a D-Rank Hunter!

17:09.003 --> 17:11.035
How could an E-Rank Hunter
manage to kill him?

17:14.051 --> 17:16.056
I killed someone...

17:17.014 --> 17:18.056
I killed...

17:18.093 --> 17:21.078
I am following the system's instructions...

17:22.009 --> 17:23.098
But the fact is...

17:24.073 --> 17:26.048
...I killed someone.

17:27.061 --> 17:29.094
But if I don't,
I will be the one to die.

17:31.003 --> 17:33.041
There's no turning back now.

17:34.049 --> 17:37.058
Since only the strong can survive!

17:38.062 --> 17:39.083
Go to hell!

17:40.091 --> 17:42.029
Die!

17:50.005 --> 17:50.059
Huh?

17:50.059 --> 17:53.013
How can an E-Rank Hunter
have such skills?!

17:53.076 --> 17:55.039
You bastard...

18:00.031 --> 18:01.031
Kyuhwan!

18:01.031 --> 18:02.098
Y-Yes!

18:09.061 --> 18:10.086
Take this!

18:16.062 --> 18:18.008
NUMBER OF ENEMIES DEFEATED: 5/6

18:19.002 --> 18:20.002
So strong.

18:21.016 --> 18:25.017
I think he's even stronger
than he was when fighting the Boss.

18:25.017 --> 18:28.034
H-He wiped out my team
members in an instant...

18:28.084 --> 18:30.088
So you were hiding your ability?!

18:31.026 --> 18:33.042
You defeated the Boss too, didn't you?!

18:34.047 --> 18:36.034
But even if I'm also a C-Rank Hunter,

18:36.034 --> 18:38.047
I'm not the same as them!

18:39.001 --> 18:40.031
Enhancement!

18:44.085 --> 18:46.094
Even if he is as strong
as a demon,

18:46.094 --> 18:51.003
he must be exhausted after
fighting the Boss and five Hunters.

18:51.044 --> 18:55.032
He relies on his speed
and the special abilities of that dagger.

18:55.074 --> 18:59.003
But my enhanced body
is as hard as steel.

18:59.003 --> 19:00.074
Your dagger...

19:00.074 --> 19:01.074
...won't work on me.

19:03.041 --> 19:04.091
Take this!

19:07.004 --> 19:08.029
Captain Hwang,

19:08.029 --> 19:09.059
you are very strong.

19:11.009 --> 19:13.039
But let me tell you something.

19:18.051 --> 19:19.038
That is...

19:20.005 --> 19:21.093
...I am always leveling up.

19:23.027 --> 19:25.077
W-What happened?

19:25.077 --> 19:28.077
He knocked me to the ground?!

19:29.048 --> 19:30.069
This guy...

19:30.069 --> 19:33.015
...is no way an E-Rank Hunter!

19:34.024 --> 19:35.044
W-Wait!

19:35.044 --> 19:36.032
Don't kill me!

19:36.032 --> 19:37.024
Please spare me!

19:37.024 --> 19:38.095
Money... I'll give you money!

19:38.095 --> 19:42.007
You can keep all the Mana Crystals
and Magic Gems here!

19:43.054 --> 19:45.004
Is it not enough?

19:45.004 --> 19:46.000
I understand.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.017
I'll double the money for you.

19:48.017 --> 19:49.012
- I'll pay...
- Three times...

19:50.033 --> 19:52.084
You tried to kill me three times.

19:53.096 --> 19:55.067
And you begging me
to spare your life?

19:55.067 --> 19:57.047
P-Please stop!

19:57.047 --> 19:59.076
Do you think you can
get away with this?!

20:00.034 --> 20:03.047
No one will know
what happened in the dungeon.

20:04.018 --> 20:05.013
You said it.

20:06.077 --> 20:08.006
You bastard!

20:08.006 --> 20:10.031
Do you even know
who my brother is—

20:17.045 --> 20:18.024
NUMBER OF ENEMIES DEFEATED: 6/6

20:18.024 --> 20:19.041
URGENT QUEST: DEFEAT THE ENEMIES

20:25.079 --> 20:27.033
After the Boss dies,
the dungeon will begin to close.

20:27.075 --> 20:28.091
Let's get out quickly.

20:34.004 --> 20:35.034
Hmm...

20:35.088 --> 20:38.092
All C-Rank Hunters have perished.

20:38.092 --> 20:40.076
The survivors are...

20:40.076 --> 20:44.056
...a D-Rank Hunter
and an E-Rank Hunter?

20:44.056 --> 20:46.039
That's right.

20:46.039 --> 20:47.035
Well...

20:48.073 --> 20:49.056
You.

20:49.056 --> 20:50.009
Y-Yes?

20:50.009 --> 20:52.004
That sword in your hand

20:52.004 --> 20:54.048
is the Claymore Kallion
from the Maya Company, right?

20:54.048 --> 20:56.048
It just hit the market.

20:56.048 --> 20:57.078
Y-Yeah.

20:58.019 --> 21:00.099
I didn't know there'd be rewards too.

21:00.099 --> 21:04.001
- That is from the Gredos Royal Series.
- Skill: Murderous Intent.

21:04.083 --> 21:07.091
All abilities are halved?

21:08.002 --> 21:11.008
I see. If you are using that equipment,
I can understand.

21:11.083 --> 21:14.025
You defeated the Boss alone

21:14.025 --> 21:17.084
and this E-Rank Hunter
hid away, right?

21:19.084 --> 21:23.093
Thank you for your help today.

21:23.093 --> 21:25.081
The investigation ends here.

21:27.001 --> 21:28.097
S-Sir Jinwoo...

21:29.035 --> 21:32.094
Thank you, Sir.

21:34.001 --> 21:35.001
Yeah.

21:42.002 --> 21:43.058
Is something wrong?

21:44.016 --> 21:45.003
No.

21:46.087 --> 21:47.053
I'm glad...

21:48.037 --> 21:50.029
...I had her take an umbrella.

23:38.027 --> 23:41.002
EPISODE 7: LET'S SEE HOW FAR I CAN GO
