WEBVTT

00:08.070 --> 00:11.350
An item that can cure all diseases, huh?

00:17.960 --> 00:22.610
With it, maybe I could cure
Mom's Eternal Sleep Disease.

00:23.310 --> 00:27.340
The Elixir of Life has three ingredients...

00:27.340 --> 00:31.890
I don't have any of them,
but it's obvious where they are.

00:32.830 --> 00:37.510
That said, it'd be suicide to enter
that castle without getting stronger.

00:38.100 --> 00:39.960
I need to level up more...

00:41.360 --> 00:45.480
I need to get stronger.

02:16.720 --> 02:19.330
You accept, then?!

02:19.330 --> 02:21.350
Things have changed on my end.

02:21.350 --> 02:25.540
I'm willing to join you on the nineteen
C-Rank raids you mentioned.

02:25.850 --> 02:26.910
Yes!

02:26.910 --> 02:28.770
Under one condition, though.

02:28.770 --> 02:31.590
Sure! Whatever you want!

02:32.780 --> 02:35.430
You and I will be going in alone.

02:37.820 --> 02:42.470
As in... You and I would be the only ones
clearing the C-Rank dungeon, Boss?

02:43.050 --> 02:44.600
That's right.

02:45.790 --> 02:51.440
But C-Rank gates require a minimum
of eight team members to enter.

02:52.100 --> 02:54.150
So we hire people to meet the quota.

02:54.600 --> 02:57.620
The same way Hwang Dongsuk did.

02:59.370 --> 03:02.580
I-Isn't that... kind of risky?

03:03.070 --> 03:04.620
Think about it this way...

03:05.250 --> 03:10.000
If it's just the two of us, we can clear
these nineteen raids with no casualties.

03:10.610 --> 03:13.540
A strike team capable of handling
nineteen operations with zero injuriesâ€”

03:14.330 --> 03:18.430
wouldn't that be the perfect thing
to impress your dad with?

03:18.870 --> 03:20.430
I get you.

03:24.240 --> 03:25.940
Let's do it, Boss!

03:25.940 --> 03:29.080
I'll arrange the extra members and the gates!

04:07.500 --> 04:10.060
And how can I help you?

04:11.220 --> 04:14.980
Impressive. But I'd expect nothing less
from an S-Rank hunter.

04:15.580 --> 04:18.980
I was waiting for the right moment
to approach you...

04:18.980 --> 04:20.950
I hope you'll excuse the
interruption to your training.

04:20.950 --> 04:23.430
Here is my card.

04:33.090 --> 04:35.800
It's been over a decade
since the gates appeared,

04:36.470 --> 04:39.300
and the world's changed at
a dizzying pace since then.

04:40.090 --> 04:44.470
Infrastructure, the economy,
the media, even politics...

04:44.470 --> 04:48.020
The dungeons have changed all those things.

04:48.700 --> 04:51.940
In particular, our infrastructure,
the foundation of everyone's lives,

04:51.940 --> 04:55.400
can no longer operate without
the resources from dungeons.

04:55.400 --> 05:02.870
And hunters are the only ones capable of
retrieving these vital resources for our world.

05:03.270 --> 05:06.550
Those hunters are in turn overseen by

05:06.550 --> 05:10.290
the Hunter's Association,
a public institution.

05:12.170 --> 05:15.750
The Association takes awakened
hunters, grades them for rank,

05:15.750 --> 05:18.120
registers them, and handles oversight.

05:18.630 --> 05:21.250
They manage the gates
that don't go to auction,

05:21.250 --> 05:23.970
as well as deal with dungeon breaks.

05:24.630 --> 05:28.730
But the Association is nothing more
than a function of the state.

05:28.730 --> 05:34.380
The vast majority of those vital resources
from dungeons are collected by

05:34.800 --> 05:38.110
the guilds: the businesses who
hire out hunters as a service.

05:38.770 --> 05:43.820
The guilds have become extremely wealthy
from the dungeon resources they collect.

05:44.460 --> 05:49.250
Among them, the Hunters Guild,
the White Tiger Guild, the Reaper Guild,

05:49.250 --> 05:54.060
the Fame Guild, and the Knights Guild
are the largest five guilds in the country.

05:54.730 --> 05:58.350
They have a functional monopoly
on dungeon-related profits.

05:59.610 --> 06:03.550
And I see no reason to sit back
and simply let that continue.

06:03.920 --> 06:07.420
Especially considering how important
these resources are to everyday life.

06:07.420 --> 06:11.390
Leaving their collection to a group
of mercenaries is out of the question.

06:11.920 --> 06:17.190
We've contributed so much to this country.
It's our responsibility to handle this, as well.

06:19.070 --> 06:22.990
And the establishment of this guild
is crucial to our accomplishing that.

06:24.100 --> 06:25.660
Y-Yes, sir.

06:28.190 --> 06:31.580
Even if that's true,
there's a lot of risk involved

06:31.580 --> 06:35.420
in recruiting an S-Rank hunter to act
as my brother's business partner...

06:35.420 --> 06:38.630
Which isn't the case for me.

06:53.400 --> 06:56.690
Looks like anything extra I do
isn't counted anymore.

06:57.550 --> 07:02.690
It seems that cursed random loot box
that was offered in the secret quest

07:02.690 --> 07:05.470
is out of my reach now.

07:06.160 --> 07:10.780
I had hoped for an item as valuable
as the key to the Demon's Castle...

07:11.170 --> 07:14.550
Wait. There's still the chance that
the regular random loot box

07:14.550 --> 07:19.000
could have a key to something like
the instance dungeon from before...

07:27.250 --> 07:28.770
Or not.

07:32.440 --> 07:34.620
With my stats as high as they are now,

07:34.620 --> 07:37.350
three points aren't enough
to make a real change anymore.

07:38.030 --> 07:40.740
I'd like to level up more efficiently,

07:40.740 --> 07:43.820
but I have to wait on Jinho
for the C-Rank dungeons.

07:45.650 --> 07:50.090
Wait, the penalty zone!
Maybe if I fight that centipede...

07:50.540 --> 07:55.950
No. I might have an easier time
running now, but beating it...?

07:55.950 --> 07:58.770
And there's no guarantee
I'd get any experience points.

08:02.040 --> 08:04.560
They need hunters for a D-Rank gate?

08:04.910 --> 08:08.170
The Hunter's Association
is forming a strike team...

08:08.540 --> 08:11.680
which means I wouldn't be
able to fight on my own.

08:11.970 --> 08:13.250
Should I say no?

08:15.820 --> 08:17.600
But I guess it's better than nothing.

08:22.210 --> 08:23.810
This is frustrating.

08:34.770 --> 08:37.210
I didn't stand a chance against you, Master.

08:38.810 --> 08:41.250
I'm just not ready to be
beaten yet. That's all.

08:41.710 --> 08:46.540
It's a shame, though. I wish I could've
fought you at your best...

08:46.540 --> 08:50.780
Still worried about that?
It's been months since I lost my arm.

08:54.060 --> 08:56.110
An emergency summons?

08:56.450 --> 09:00.010
Low-ranked hunters get a lot of calls
for what amounts to running errands.

09:00.010 --> 09:02.770
You seriously won't consider retiring, Master?

09:02.770 --> 09:04.250
Retirement?

09:08.890 --> 09:14.330
You've got a point. An old man with one arm
missing might not be of much help at all.

09:14.330 --> 09:16.290
That's not what I meant, sir!

09:16.290 --> 09:20.180
Still, I may have lost an arm, but I survived.

09:20.180 --> 09:22.580
My best years are already behind me,

09:22.580 --> 09:26.120
but I'd like to spend what I have left
contributing to society.

09:34.530 --> 09:36.640
Looks like I've got my next raid.

09:37.650 --> 09:39.100
Say, honey...

09:39.810 --> 09:43.220
Isn't it about time you considered
something other than hunting?

09:43.220 --> 09:45.230
We're talking about this again?

09:45.230 --> 09:49.420
But it's so dangerous. All those people
died in the raid from before,

09:49.420 --> 09:52.930
and you only barely survived, right?

09:53.310 --> 09:55.410
Well, yeah...

09:56.350 --> 09:58.200
Daddy! Up!

10:00.240 --> 10:03.240
The thing is, Eunji is starting
preschool next year,

10:03.240 --> 10:04.780
and Eunha will be in middle school.

10:04.780 --> 10:06.230
We need the money, don't we?

10:06.230 --> 10:07.750
That might be true, but...

10:07.750 --> 10:13.720
It'll be fine. The Association doesn't send
low-ranked hunters into dangerous dungeons.

10:14.860 --> 10:17.680
The other time was just an exception.

10:17.680 --> 10:21.410
You're right. I'm sorry
for making such a fuss.

10:21.410 --> 10:22.770
Don't worry about it.

10:23.400 --> 10:24.980
Be careful, okay?

10:25.600 --> 10:27.890
You bet! I love you.

10:27.890 --> 10:29.010
Daddy?

10:29.010 --> 10:30.730
Yeah? What's up?

10:30.730 --> 10:32.910
Daddy, are you strong?

10:32.910 --> 10:34.770
You bet I am!

10:34.770 --> 10:38.280
I can beat scary monsters, y'know!

10:38.280 --> 10:42.660
Wow! You really are strong!

10:43.400 --> 10:45.480
You've got some damn nerve.

10:48.130 --> 10:50.130
What are you talking about?

10:50.130 --> 10:53.780
I can't believe you stuck me with
that interview. It was a waste of time.

10:53.780 --> 10:57.070
I managed to catch it.
You made a good impression.

10:57.070 --> 10:59.720
I found your answers to be quite profound.

10:59.720 --> 11:01.600
I'm not here for a bunch of empty flattery!

11:01.600 --> 11:05.310
And I'm pretty sure the interview was
meant to be for you in the first place!

11:05.310 --> 11:07.990
Well, considering the offer
made to Chairman Go

11:07.990 --> 11:14.270
was for a talented hunter of great character
who is dedicated to the job...

11:14.270 --> 11:17.460
I mean, does that really sound like me?

11:17.930 --> 11:20.240
Well, at least you realize
how sketchy you are.

11:21.490 --> 11:25.210
Whatever! So, what's this about, anyway?

11:25.210 --> 11:29.580
There's no way you asked me to come over
just so I could chew you out.

11:29.580 --> 11:34.630
There was something
I thought you should know...

11:35.630 --> 11:39.000
Yoojin Construction are getting ready
to launch their own guild.

11:39.000 --> 11:42.010
I know. They've been trying
to make moves in secret.

11:42.440 --> 11:45.130
There's been rumors about
headhunting at my guild.

11:45.130 --> 11:49.690
I suppose if you already know,
then I wasted your time.

11:49.690 --> 11:53.200
And I already know that you knew I knew.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.080
Can we please cut the crap?

11:56.440 --> 12:00.070
I'll ask you one more time.
What's this really about?

12:03.710 --> 12:08.330
You haven't called much lately.
Is everything goin' okay?

12:08.860 --> 12:09.650
Yeah.

12:09.650 --> 12:11.300
How 'bout work?

12:11.730 --> 12:14.170
Well... fine.

12:14.170 --> 12:19.680
You've always been such a scaredy-cat.
Are you really handlin' being a hunter?

12:19.680 --> 12:24.620
You're B-Rank, right? I'm sure most folks
would be pretty strong in that case,

12:24.620 --> 12:27.680
but wouldn't you just be gettin' in the way?

12:28.020 --> 12:30.390
You should come back home
an' help out with the business.

12:30.390 --> 12:31.810
Your Pa's worriedâ€”

12:31.810 --> 12:33.690
Quit trying to run my life!

12:34.500 --> 12:37.170
I can make my own decisions!
So just drop it!

12:37.170 --> 12:38.150
What are youâ€”

12:46.050 --> 12:47.660
I'm just in the way...?

12:49.610 --> 12:50.620
But...

12:54.400 --> 12:57.450
I wanna try a little more.

13:29.380 --> 13:30.580
Excuse me.

13:32.410 --> 13:35.210
How can I help you, Hunter Cha Hae-in?

13:35.620 --> 13:40.370
While I was training, I was approached
by a scout from Yoojin Construction.

13:40.370 --> 13:41.680
I thought you should know.

13:43.640 --> 13:50.060
They're apparently launching a new guild
and wanted me to join them as guild master.

13:51.080 --> 13:55.960
And I assume, since you're telling me this,
that you turned them down?

13:55.960 --> 13:58.790
Right. I refused the offer.

13:59.250 --> 14:02.100
That's a relief. Thank you for telling me.

14:02.100 --> 14:04.530
It's nothing. I was wondering...

14:04.530 --> 14:08.710
I saw President Baek on my way in.

14:08.710 --> 14:11.000
What were you talking about?

14:19.380 --> 14:23.560
What do you think about Jeju Island?

14:24.090 --> 14:27.940
Jeju Island? Why do you ask?

14:27.940 --> 14:32.540
Since the failed raid,
the island has been sealed off,

14:32.540 --> 14:35.910
with only occasional reconnaissance
done from the shore.

14:35.910 --> 14:39.570
And the public receives a single
annual update about any changes.

14:40.210 --> 14:44.680
People are trying to forget about the islandâ€”
and the terror it represents.

14:45.040 --> 14:47.490
Yeah, but can you blame them?

14:47.490 --> 14:52.470
Except, no matter how commonplace
gates may have become,

14:52.470 --> 14:55.480
or how much I get fawned over as
the "ultimate weapon" of humanity,

14:55.480 --> 14:59.590
I can never forget about that island,
or what happened there.

15:00.500 --> 15:04.840
I intend on clearing that island
in the near future.

15:05.490 --> 15:09.840
And to do that, I need you
and the others on the same page.

15:09.840 --> 15:15.360
We must gain strength, gather allies,
and sway public opinion.

15:15.360 --> 15:18.360
That's why you arranged for the interview
and are training new hunters.

15:25.970 --> 15:31.780
Isn't there something you left
behind on that island, as well?

15:38.790 --> 15:42.060
Eunseok... Byung-gu...

15:46.600 --> 15:49.480
Please. I'm begging you...

15:50.970 --> 15:52.850
They have to die.

15:55.650 --> 15:57.140
I'm heading out.

15:57.140 --> 15:59.440
It's a holiday, but you've got work again?

16:00.450 --> 16:02.370
You keep busy lately.

16:03.610 --> 16:04.650
I guess.

16:04.650 --> 16:06.020
Hard to believe you're the same guy

16:06.020 --> 16:09.690
who had to take time off to recover
from his injuries after every gate.

16:09.690 --> 16:11.450
All the training pay off?

16:11.450 --> 16:16.190
Probably. In any case, I'm able
to make a steady living now.

16:16.190 --> 16:17.620
That's a good thing, right?

16:17.620 --> 16:19.690
I guess it is.

16:19.690 --> 16:22.150
Wait, Jinwoo! What about your stuff?

16:22.150 --> 16:24.540
It'll be fine. I'm heading out.

16:24.540 --> 16:25.980
Wait, hang on...

16:29.050 --> 16:31.760
It's not like you're making
a quick trip to the store.

16:34.930 --> 16:38.410
I didn't awaken to a physical power,
which means my sword

16:38.410 --> 16:40.300
is useless against magic beasts.

16:41.040 --> 16:45.590
The martial arts I've spent decades on
are useless inside of a dungeon.

16:45.590 --> 16:50.590
A swordsman like myself gaining magic-focused
powers is quite the twist of fate.

16:50.590 --> 16:53.350
But I'm sure there's a reason for it.

16:56.760 --> 16:58.280
Are you...?

16:58.280 --> 16:59.750
Mr. Song?

16:59.750 --> 17:03.350
I wasn't sure it was you, but it is! Sung!

17:03.350 --> 17:04.840
It's been a while.

17:04.840 --> 17:07.340
I never thought I'd run into you
in a place like this!

17:07.340 --> 17:11.900
I must say, where'd that
gentle-looking boy go?

17:11.900 --> 17:14.900
How have you changed so much
in just a few months?

17:15.730 --> 17:17.060
Plus...

17:17.060 --> 17:19.520
Didn't you lose a leg?

17:19.520 --> 17:23.850
When I woke up in the hospital, it was back.

17:23.850 --> 17:25.270
I see!

17:25.270 --> 17:30.030
There must've been a high-ranked healer
among the hunters who came to collect you!

17:30.850 --> 17:35.080
Whatever the case, it's a relief seeing
a young man like yourself has fully healed.

17:35.080 --> 17:36.770
That's nice of you to say.

17:37.170 --> 17:39.140
But, Mr. Song, your arm...

17:39.140 --> 17:43.740
Too much time had passed
since my injury, I'm afraid.

17:43.740 --> 17:45.530
I don't mind, though.

17:45.530 --> 17:49.710
You know, someone from the Association
had told me you were alive.

17:49.710 --> 17:51.820
It's so good to see you!

17:51.820 --> 17:54.260
What are you doing here, anyway, Mr. Song?

17:54.260 --> 17:57.460
Answering a summons from the Association.
It's supposed to be urgent.

17:57.460 --> 17:58.970
You, too?

18:12.690 --> 18:14.570
What a coincidence.

18:15.130 --> 18:17.560
This is quite the reunion.

18:20.020 --> 18:21.410
Jinwoo?

18:21.760 --> 18:23.030
Joohee...

18:24.160 --> 18:27.430
Along with... Mr. Kim and Mr. Kang.

18:28.860 --> 18:30.090
It's only natural.

18:30.500 --> 18:34.930
We sacrificed Sung in order
to escape on that day.

18:35.540 --> 18:41.100
And I can't blame Kim for being too ashamed
to face me, after what he did.

18:41.400 --> 18:46.240
That said... five survivors from
that tragedy have been reunited.

18:46.240 --> 18:47.310
In that case...

18:47.660 --> 18:50.780
It really is you, isn't it, Jinwoo?

18:50.780 --> 18:52.950
You look like a whole different person!

18:52.950 --> 18:54.990
Yeah. It's been a while.

18:54.990 --> 18:58.120
You're so much taller,
and your leg is healed...

18:58.550 --> 19:00.790
I guess you were fine
after I visited you, after all.

19:00.790 --> 19:02.380
You visited me?

19:07.480 --> 19:12.090
Nice! We got a fine little lady in this group.

19:14.190 --> 19:18.090
What's up, baby? You and this guy an item?

19:18.720 --> 19:20.210
You should play with usâ€”

19:20.210 --> 19:21.570
Shut your mouths.

19:24.170 --> 19:26.020
This outing isn't for recreation.

19:29.030 --> 19:33.690
I'll now brief our regular hunters,
if you'd come this way.

19:34.430 --> 19:35.650
What's going on here...?

19:35.650 --> 19:40.130
These men are the prisoner substitute
hunters who will be joining you today.

19:40.130 --> 19:44.370
Substitute hunters?! We're supposed
to fight alongside criminals?!

19:44.370 --> 19:47.920
They are hunter convicts, but they're
here to reduce their sentences

19:47.920 --> 19:49.980
and are unlikely to cause trouble.

19:49.980 --> 19:54.510
We're short-staffed due to a exodus
of local hunters. I hope you'll understand.

19:54.870 --> 19:56.670
What a mess...

19:57.130 --> 20:01.100
You'll be accompanied by an overseer from
the Hunter's Association, Kang Taeshik, too.

20:01.100 --> 20:04.050
He's B-Rank, so even in
the worst-case scenario,

20:04.050 --> 20:08.370
he should be able to handle
three C-Rank criminals with ease.

20:08.370 --> 20:10.100
Please, rest assured.

20:10.450 --> 20:14.600
I don't know if this is a good idea.
You should sit the raid out, Joohee.

20:14.600 --> 20:15.820
What about you, Jinwoo?

20:16.570 --> 20:17.780
I'm going.

20:21.230 --> 20:23.370
Then I am, too.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.080
I understand.

20:26.730 --> 20:30.670
Damn, it's good to be free.

20:30.940 --> 20:34.630
We're not slaves here, man.
Is this kinda thing allowed?

20:34.630 --> 20:37.170
Shut up. You're convicts.

20:37.730 --> 20:41.430
You know what happens if you act up, right?

20:44.310 --> 20:48.650
I'm Kang Taeshik, an inspector with the
Hunter's Association Surveillance Team.

20:49.610 --> 20:53.920
I'll be responsible for them,
so you can relax.

20:54.710 --> 20:57.930
Who's going to take point on the raid today?

20:58.880 --> 21:02.460
Sung... Do you mind if I lead?

21:02.460 --> 21:03.740
No, go ahead.

21:05.680 --> 21:08.050
Thank you for giving me this chance.

21:08.050 --> 21:09.160
M-Mr. Song?

21:09.590 --> 21:13.030
On that day, seven people died because of me.

21:13.410 --> 21:16.510
The magnitude of my failure to protect
everyone can not be understated.

21:16.510 --> 21:20.100
But... six of us did survive, because of you.

21:20.100 --> 21:22.840
So let me say this, as a
representative of the others:

21:23.480 --> 21:25.680
I am so grateful to you.

21:26.340 --> 21:28.920
You don't have to bow, Mr. Song.

21:31.200 --> 21:34.720
Is it all right with you, as well, Kim?

21:37.000 --> 21:38.610
Go ahead.

21:45.280 --> 21:49.800
Well, with that being the case,
I will take point in the dungeon.

21:49.800 --> 21:52.670
Understood. Let's get underway, then.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.130
Off we go, now...

22:03.530 --> 22:05.010
Into the dungeon.
