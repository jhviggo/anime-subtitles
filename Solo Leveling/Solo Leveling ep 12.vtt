00:12.510 --> 00:14.660
<i>I lost track of the instant 
teleportation stone!</i>

00:15.030 --> 00:16.870
<i>And I don't have time to look for it!</i>

00:16.870 --> 00:21.380
<i>The only way I can survive 
is by beating them all!</i>

00:26.800 --> 00:28.500
<i>Stamina's at its limit!</i>

00:28.500 --> 00:30.180
<i>I can't use Stealth or Murderous Intent!</i>

00:32.820 --> 00:34.180
<i>But that doesn't mean...</i>

00:34.490 --> 00:35.930
<i>that I'm giving up!</i>

00:37.960 --> 00:38.930
<i>I am going...</i>

00:39.240 --> 00:40.940
<i>to survive!</i>

00:48.350 --> 00:52.740
<i>I was always at the bottom. 
I know what it's like better than anyone.</i>

00:53.130 --> 00:56.200
<i>But I could never give up 
on striving for more!</i>

01:08.710 --> 01:13.140
<i>His nickname is "The Weakest 
Hunter of All Mankind."</i>

01:15.560 --> 01:17.850
<i>Weakest? Not strongest?</i>

01:19.540 --> 01:20.660
<i>Nope.</i>

01:20.660 --> 01:23.870
<i>Like, a trip through an E-Rank gate 
landed him in the hospital.</i>

01:24.230 --> 01:26.690
<i>He might be the weakest hunter there is.</i>

01:28.820 --> 01:32.700
Sung, that's enough. You don't need 
to keep forcing yourself.

01:33.010 --> 01:37.210
He's right, Jinwoo. 
You'd be better off if you stopped.

01:41.080 --> 01:42.960
You're getting what you deserve.

01:46.300 --> 01:49.590
Why insist on something so dangerous?

01:50.230 --> 01:53.090
You were an E-Rank, 
but look how far you've come.

01:53.640 --> 01:57.050
That should be more than enough. 
Shouldn't it...

01:58.390 --> 01:59.470
Jinwoo?

03:32.570 --> 03:35.260
The third Jeju Island raid...

03:35.660 --> 03:41.550
My body was no longer fit for combat 
by then, so I wasn't there.

03:42.290 --> 03:44.450
How about you?

03:44.890 --> 03:48.350
I was. I was on perimeter security, 
acting as a point of contact, sir.

03:48.900 --> 03:52.140
So many lost their lives.

03:52.140 --> 03:56.010
And those who survived still bear 
the mental scars...

03:57.340 --> 04:01.470
The kind of scars that all hunters have.

04:02.220 --> 04:04.900
And they must overcome that pain,

04:04.900 --> 04:08.180
or destruction will be all that awaits.

04:09.640 --> 04:14.150
I gotta ask, is this really me? 
I can hardly recognize myself.

04:14.580 --> 04:16.730
Taller, and in much better shape.

04:16.730 --> 04:18.190
Looking pretty strong!

04:19.410 --> 04:23.990
But the differences are only skin deep. 
On the inside, I'm still weak.

04:24.370 --> 04:26.120
And it looks like I'm about to die again.

04:31.210 --> 04:35.850
Sung Jinwoo, E-Rank hunter. 
That's all you'll ever be.

04:36.640 --> 04:38.800
A dreamer who never learned 
his place in the world.

04:39.350 --> 04:40.420
Shut up.

04:54.160 --> 04:55.900
Still not good enough.

04:55.900 --> 04:59.950
This is what you get for patting yourself 
on the back about how "ready" you are.

05:00.340 --> 05:03.410
You're gonna get yourself killed.

05:05.210 --> 05:07.660
<i>Is it all the same...</i>

05:08.580 --> 05:10.060
<i>as back then...?</i>

05:12.530 --> 05:15.480
<i>What happened after that...?</i>

05:20.460 --> 05:23.180
<i>The quest is ending?</i>

05:23.520 --> 05:25.830
I guess luck is a factor in skill after all.

05:27.330 --> 05:30.480
It seems they don't want you to die just yet.

05:31.140 --> 05:32.220
Until next time, then.

05:44.820 --> 05:48.470
This is... the penalty zone?

05:50.770 --> 05:55.280
Oh, yeah... I never did 
the daily quest for today.

05:57.150 --> 05:59.180
Well, either way...

06:01.780 --> 06:05.550
Nice timing. That "penalty" saved my life.

06:05.950 --> 06:08.260
<i>"Good luck," huh?</i>

06:09.050 --> 06:12.040
<i>Because the quest was just that hard?</i>

06:12.040 --> 06:15.880
<i>Or because the system wants me to survive 
enough that it's cheering me on?</i>

06:16.420 --> 06:17.500
<i>Well, whatever.</i>

06:17.500 --> 06:18.820
Store.

06:20.290 --> 06:23.190
<i>I've never seen my exhaustion 
exceed 90 before.</i>

06:32.400 --> 06:36.970
<i>So if you're seriously injured, 
potions can't restore your HP anymore?</i>

06:37.550 --> 06:42.480
<i>I can either wait to heal naturally 
or try and get restored by leveling up...</i>

06:43.800 --> 06:46.510
Looks like I was worried for nothing.

06:51.920 --> 06:53.160
<i>"Until next time"?</i>

06:54.480 --> 06:58.320
<i>Right. If I manage to survive, 
I'll see him again.</i>

06:58.320 --> 07:02.770
<i>And as long as it doesn't kill me, 
any pain I go through</i>

07:02.770 --> 07:05.030
<i>is only going to make me stronger!</i>

07:20.910 --> 07:23.070
That was a weird dream.

07:25.550 --> 07:28.050
And Jinwoo still isn't home yet?

07:28.760 --> 07:32.140
He can't be working this late, can he?

07:33.070 --> 07:35.910
Could he have gotten a girlfriend...?

07:35.910 --> 07:37.740
Nah, no way.

07:38.410 --> 07:41.440
And I told him there's 
a guardian-teacher meeting today...

07:41.900 --> 07:44.080
Will he be able to make it?

07:49.860 --> 07:52.820
Being able to recover by leveling up 
really is convenient.

07:54.260 --> 08:00.040
I've got over ten minutes left. 
I should sort out my gear in that time.

08:03.470 --> 08:04.440
Buy.

08:09.920 --> 08:14.730
"Knight Killer." Deals 25% more damage 
to armor-type beasts.

08:14.730 --> 08:16.640
A little pricey, but that's not half bad.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.100
Okay, that just leaves this:

08:19.620 --> 08:21.970
the rune stone I got in my fight with Igris.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.840
I'm sure the skill will come in handy.

08:37.180 --> 08:39.030
Ruler's Hand...

08:39.030 --> 08:42.120
A skill that doesn't require mana? 
Should be easy to manage, then.

08:42.630 --> 08:45.660
The ability to affect objects 
without directly touching them, huh...

08:46.960 --> 08:48.610
Is that what he did?

08:54.750 --> 08:57.560
I guess I can't move anything large yet.

08:59.540 --> 09:02.020
That's all the preparations 
I can manage for now.

09:05.260 --> 09:07.190
The rest will come down to luck.

09:15.200 --> 09:18.660
It's only been a few hours, but you guys 
sure have grown in number.

09:25.140 --> 09:28.610
We'll be arriving in the airspace over 
Jeju Island's security perimeter shortly.

09:28.610 --> 09:29.900
Understood.

09:30.390 --> 09:34.470
I'm sorry. I know this 
must be painful for you.

09:34.470 --> 09:36.940
No. It's not a problem.

09:36.940 --> 09:41.640
I wasn't a hunter during the third raid,

09:41.990 --> 09:44.780
but I understand how 
you must feel, Guildmaster.

09:44.780 --> 09:47.160
It's a relief to hear that.

09:47.160 --> 09:48.260
Guildmaster Choi!

09:48.260 --> 09:50.400
I'm detecting multiple sources 
of mana from the water!

09:50.400 --> 09:51.790
Bringing up the feed!

09:55.680 --> 09:56.970
What the...?

10:02.130 --> 10:04.250
<i>The Knight Killer is coming in handy!</i>

10:04.250 --> 10:06.130
<i>This is way better 
than fighting bare-handed!</i>

10:06.740 --> 10:07.590
<i>But...</i>

10:07.590 --> 10:09.690
<i>What's this weird sensation?</i>

10:09.690 --> 10:11.550
<i>I keep killing them, 
but it doesn't feel like it.</i>

10:11.550 --> 10:13.760
<i>Plus, there's no sign of me leveling up.</i>

10:14.390 --> 10:17.980
<i>And what are their mages doing?</i>

10:17.980 --> 10:20.890
<i>They've been casting spells, 
but no attacks are incoming.</i>

10:20.890 --> 10:22.690
<i>Only the knights have been attacking.</i>

10:22.690 --> 10:24.520
<i>So what have they been doing?</i>

10:25.910 --> 10:27.860
<i>Gates! It's summoning magic!</i>

10:28.200 --> 10:31.360
<i>The knights are just weapons 
that they've been summoning!</i>

10:31.990 --> 10:34.350
<i>I can beat them, but it won't 
give me any experience!</i>

10:34.950 --> 10:36.160
<i>Which means I should target...</i>

10:36.160 --> 10:38.890
<i>you mages!</i>

10:45.750 --> 10:48.880
I was right. I need to go after the mages.

10:49.800 --> 10:50.970
Now that I know that...

10:52.800 --> 10:53.640
<i>Five more to go!</i>

10:58.060 --> 10:59.340
<i>Four more!</i>

11:16.530 --> 11:19.080
How long are you gonna hide back there?!

11:24.980 --> 11:26.420
<i>Three left!</i>

11:33.340 --> 11:34.370
<i>A golem?!</i>

11:50.650 --> 11:53.830
<i>I bet they think a single, stronger enemy 
will fare better than the knights...</i>

11:54.790 --> 11:58.070
<i>but having fewer targets 
just makes it easier to go after you guys!</i>

12:14.330 --> 12:16.640
The casters are already gone!

12:17.320 --> 12:19.590
So why don't you...

12:20.610 --> 12:23.850
shut the hell down?!

12:49.660 --> 12:53.480
It's over, right? Now what happens?

12:54.120 --> 12:59.870
I can switch to a more advanced class 
with the points I've earned...

13:00.460 --> 13:05.270
I'm getting a class based on 
my performance during the quest?

13:05.270 --> 13:06.480
So I don't get to choose?

13:15.640 --> 13:17.410
Huh? What's that mean?

13:32.600 --> 13:35.070
The shadow... army?

13:37.390 --> 13:39.590
Hang on, what the hell is this?!

13:39.590 --> 13:42.640
This is my new job class...?

13:43.590 --> 13:45.060
Necromancer?!

13:45.350 --> 13:49.190
Hang on a second! I haven't put 
anything into my intellect stat!

13:49.190 --> 13:50.640
So how did I...?

13:51.660 --> 13:57.400
<i>Necromancers are usually a magic-type class 
that summons undead monsters as servants.</i>

13:58.270 --> 14:00.200
<i>But I'm an assassin build,</i>

14:00.200 --> 14:02.340
<i>with a close-range combat style.</i>

14:02.340 --> 14:05.870
<i>My main stat is strength, 
and my skills fit that style, too!</i>

14:06.180 --> 14:10.550
<i>If I get a back-line class like necromancer, 
all that will be wasted!</i>

14:11.950 --> 14:15.300
Yes or no? I can reject it?

14:15.600 --> 14:19.820
<i>Changing my class to necromancer... 
The benefits are too unclear.</i>

14:19.820 --> 14:20.830
No.

14:22.260 --> 14:24.050
A hidden class?!

14:30.760 --> 14:33.650
<i>Does this mean it has 
some kind of special power?</i>

14:36.050 --> 14:40.110
A necromancer... If I had some 
kind of example to judge by...

14:43.790 --> 14:45.240
<i>Summoning magic!</i>

14:45.620 --> 14:48.710
<i>That's right. Those mages 
were using summoning magic.</i>

14:49.080 --> 14:53.000
<i>In terms of commanding others, that's a 
similar power to that of a necromancer.</i>

14:53.000 --> 14:54.920
<i>Not only that, but my previous fights here</i>

14:54.920 --> 14:58.010
<i>all felt like I was revisiting 
my past battles...</i>

14:59.000 --> 15:04.240
<i>It was called a job-change quest, 
but was this all prearranged?</i>

15:04.240 --> 15:06.000
<i>Is the system doing this?</i>

15:06.830 --> 15:08.140
<i>Still, it's interesting.</i>

15:08.570 --> 15:11.540
<i>These guys weren't very strong on their own.</i>

15:11.540 --> 15:13.430
<i>But I am.</i>

15:13.430 --> 15:16.610
<i>There's no rule that says necromancers 
can't fight on the front lines.</i>

15:17.190 --> 15:22.860
<i>If classes work like stats do, 
then as I level up, my skills will, too.</i>

15:23.320 --> 15:27.080
<i>It makes sense that this shadow army
thing would become stronger as a result.</i>

15:27.480 --> 15:28.640
<i>In other words,</i>

15:29.040 --> 15:31.590
<i>I won't be solo leveling anymore!</i>

15:32.370 --> 15:33.770
All right, then. Yes.

15:39.880 --> 15:41.010
Here you are.

15:41.010 --> 15:42.330
Thank you.

15:46.430 --> 15:48.680
It's already dawn.

15:48.680 --> 15:52.450
Hunter Choi and his people should 
have arrived at the island by now.

15:52.450 --> 15:53.310
Right.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.500
Sorry to keep you so late.

15:55.500 --> 15:56.650
It's fine.

15:56.650 --> 16:01.810
Since you're here, would you 
mind humoring me for a bit?

16:59.960 --> 17:03.920
<i>"Shadow monarch"? 
I've already got another class?!</i>

17:03.920 --> 17:06.250
<i>Did I really earn that many points?</i>

17:07.430 --> 17:12.880
<i>Unique class skills and 10 ability points... 
Along with a new title...</i>

17:12.880 --> 17:16.970
<i>If my rewards are ready, 
is the quest finally over?</i>

17:17.340 --> 17:19.870
<i>Have I completed the job change?</i>

17:22.410 --> 17:28.280
<i>I can hear something like a moaning... 
It sounds like people in pain.</i>

17:29.380 --> 17:30.570
<i>Shadow Extraction...</i>

17:32.610 --> 17:34.750
I have to designate a command word...

17:38.750 --> 17:39.880
Arise.

17:58.740 --> 18:00.320
This is awesome!

18:00.950 --> 18:05.330
<i>The unique skills are Shadow Extraction 
and Shadow Storage.</i>

18:05.800 --> 18:08.800
<i>A skill that lets you drain mana 
to create shadow soldiers,</i>

18:08.800 --> 18:12.160
<i>and one that lets you hold onto those shadows 
and summon them whenever you want...</i>

18:12.970 --> 18:16.050
<i>These must be those shadow soldiers.</i>

18:16.640 --> 18:19.130
<i>I'll have to be careful, 
since the extraction can fail</i>

18:19.130 --> 18:23.300
<i>depending on the strength of the target 
and the time since death.</i>

18:23.970 --> 18:26.030
<i>And I've got the mages, 
as well as the knights.</i>

18:26.030 --> 18:28.670
<i>They come in different ranks, too.</i>

18:30.410 --> 18:33.650
<i>If it's possible to extract 
A or S-Rank shadows,</i>

18:33.650 --> 18:37.600
<i>and their strength reflects 
how strong they were in life...</i>

18:47.440 --> 18:48.900
Good!

18:49.280 --> 18:52.370
There seems to be an upper limit 
to extractions and storage.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.780
I'll release 11 of the infantry.

18:56.640 --> 18:58.470
Sorry to wake you for nothing.

18:59.670 --> 19:00.840
Now, then...

19:01.280 --> 19:03.560
<i>Knight Commander Igris the Bloodred.</i>

19:04.050 --> 19:06.290
<i>If I can bring him under my control...</i>

19:07.670 --> 19:08.760
Arise.

19:17.970 --> 19:19.190
<i>What?!</i>

19:22.150 --> 19:24.480
This must've been what it 
was warning about before.

19:26.220 --> 19:27.520
Two more tries...

19:31.860 --> 19:32.860
Arise!

19:38.730 --> 19:39.970
Damn it!

19:40.340 --> 19:45.750
It goes without saying, but unless 
we hunters undergo a reawakening,

19:45.750 --> 19:49.260
our powers will neither 
grow stronger or weaker.

19:49.260 --> 19:52.470
Which is why we train our combat 
techniques and gather allies.

19:53.720 --> 19:55.430
Are you waiting for your king's return?

19:56.230 --> 19:58.650
When you have no idea when that might be?

19:59.600 --> 20:01.460
Knight Commander Igris...

20:01.460 --> 20:03.040
You're a warrior.

20:03.500 --> 20:06.400
Cutting down foes with that sword 
should be your purpose in life.

20:07.160 --> 20:10.990
Do you really intend to let it rust 
in this dank and decrepit place?

20:12.840 --> 20:17.610
If you need someone to whom you 
can dedicate your sword, serve me.

20:18.280 --> 20:21.210
Instead of defending the throne 
of one long gone,

20:21.620 --> 20:24.120
defend the man who stands before you.

20:24.760 --> 20:25.880
Arise.

20:38.760 --> 20:42.930
Which is why... there's something 
I like to envision occasionally.

20:55.320 --> 21:00.740
About how there are new awakenings every day.

21:02.070 --> 21:03.540
It should be obvious.

21:04.530 --> 21:05.790
Igris.

21:07.930 --> 21:09.670
That's your name.

21:11.020 --> 21:15.360
Someone who defies all our expectations,

21:15.360 --> 21:19.050
strong enough to become a new guiding light,

21:19.490 --> 21:22.990
could be born this very moment.

21:38.160 --> 21:39.910
You're with me now.

23:18.970 --> 23:20.540
Guildmaster Choi...

23:20.540 --> 23:22.080
What in the world is this?

23:22.080 --> 23:23.390
I don't know.

23:23.390 --> 23:26.760
To my knowledge, 
this has never happened before.

23:27.050 --> 23:29.520
But now...

23:31.820 --> 23:33.490
They're evolving?
