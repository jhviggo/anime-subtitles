01:48.330 --> 01:53.210
<b>Freedom</b>

01:48.330 --> 01:53.210
<b>Freedom</b>

01:49.940 --> 01:51.800
Arnheid.

01:54.260 --> 01:57.860
Which means this is Ketil's farm.

01:59.210 --> 02:01.450
I don't believe it.

02:01.450 --> 02:05.660
The two of you were just
a few days' walk away.

02:07.180 --> 02:09.020
You look a little haggard...

02:10.100 --> 02:15.020
But you're even more beautiful than before.

02:21.410 --> 02:26.040
What? Is he Arnheid's husband?

02:31.600 --> 02:33.610
Is Hjalti doing well?

02:34.640 --> 02:38.050
He must be so big by now.

02:47.940 --> 02:49.050
Gardar...

02:51.780 --> 02:53.080
Hjalti is...

03:01.570 --> 03:02.440
Come.

03:03.300 --> 03:08.260
Let's return to our home together. 
All three of us.

03:10.710 --> 03:11.660
Our home?

03:12.790 --> 03:15.170
Don't take his hand, Arnheid.

03:21.980 --> 03:24.410
If you do, I'll kill him.

03:40.610 --> 03:41.820
Gardar!

03:41.820 --> 03:42.490
Fox!

03:43.490 --> 03:45.440
Take Arnheid and get out of here.

03:45.440 --> 03:46.410
Yes, boss.

03:54.060 --> 03:56.560
There's something wrong with him, boss.

03:56.560 --> 03:59.700
Did he forget he's being chased?

04:01.750 --> 04:04.590
Is it true that he killed Lizard?

04:07.580 --> 04:10.570
Yes. Split his head wide open.

04:12.360 --> 04:13.700
I see.

04:16.400 --> 04:19.520
He's here to kidnap Arnheid.

04:19.520 --> 04:21.380
Protect her with your life.

04:21.380 --> 04:22.140
Yes, boss.

04:24.530 --> 04:26.410
Are you Ketil?

04:29.380 --> 04:31.060
What if I am?

04:33.080 --> 04:34.710
I'll kill you!

04:35.540 --> 04:38.540
Stop, Gardar! This is reckless!

04:38.540 --> 04:40.180
Gardar!

04:49.110 --> 04:50.620
Don't, Einar.

04:50.620 --> 04:53.140
We don't even know what's going on. 
What are you going to do?

04:53.400 --> 04:55.810
Are you going to attack Snake?

04:56.250 --> 04:58.060
I know exactly what's going on here!

04:58.400 --> 05:01.940
Arnheid's husband is here to rescue her.

05:02.350 --> 05:05.700
Don't you want her to be free?

05:05.950 --> 05:08.600
I do, but look at what you're dealing with.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.080
You'd have to kill three men to get away.

05:11.080 --> 05:14.560
I know I'm not strong enough, but...

05:14.560 --> 05:17.770
Einar, that's not what I'm trying to say.

05:18.650 --> 05:20.620
Can you kill a man?

05:21.070 --> 05:23.460
Whether it's a guest or anyone else,

05:23.460 --> 05:25.990
could you use this axe to kill a man?

05:31.910 --> 05:36.900
Then... what am I supposed to do?

05:39.410 --> 05:41.440
Smart choice, Thorfinn.

05:42.470 --> 05:44.690
You guys watch quietly from over there.

05:46.290 --> 05:48.120
I'll capture him alive.

05:48.860 --> 05:52.070
I still need to question him 
and confirm his identity.

06:00.790 --> 06:04.090
Be careful, boss. He's strong.

06:04.440 --> 06:09.450
Who do you think you're talking to, dumbass?

06:10.970 --> 06:12.820
Whoa.

06:17.800 --> 06:21.310
You can't take him alive, boss. Kill him.

06:21.310 --> 06:25.900
Shut up. That was just a warm-up.

06:26.360 --> 06:29.780
Were you guys able to land 
a single blow on him?

06:29.780 --> 06:33.530
What? Well, embarrassingly...

06:34.980 --> 06:37.110
He's injured.

06:37.110 --> 06:40.760
How'd the three of you lose 
to an injured man?

06:54.600 --> 06:56.300
So that's where it was after all.

07:03.250 --> 07:06.170
Badger, tie him up.

07:06.690 --> 07:09.590
Gardar! Gardar!

07:07.130 --> 07:10.320
Wow, you beat him in an instant.

07:11.970 --> 07:14.100
Gardar!

07:18.620 --> 07:20.490
Arnheid!

07:22.330 --> 07:24.330
Arnheid!

07:28.340 --> 07:30.420
Arnheid!

07:32.620 --> 07:34.390
Arnheid!

07:33.140 --> 07:34.730
Come on, walk.

07:37.430 --> 07:39.180
Don't let your guard down.

07:39.180 --> 07:42.570
Always keep five guys watching him.

07:40.340 --> 07:42.570
Arnheid!

07:42.570 --> 07:47.740
And tell Kjallakr's uncle that
 we've apprehended the suspect.

07:46.100 --> 07:47.740
Arnheid!

07:47.740 --> 07:48.950
Got it.

07:54.550 --> 07:55.900
Now then...

07:56.880 --> 07:59.480
You look like you've got something to say.

07:59.480 --> 08:02.460
But a slave's opinion doesn't matter.

08:06.530 --> 08:08.360
Can't you let him off the hook?

08:09.040 --> 08:11.220
This is too much to bear.

08:11.220 --> 08:13.870
He killed one of my men.

08:13.870 --> 08:16.090
He's suspected of killing others, too.

08:17.810 --> 08:20.460
Not only that, 
but he wants to kill the master,

08:20.460 --> 08:23.720
and he intends to kidnap 
the master's darling Arnheid.

08:25.580 --> 08:28.760
We can't let someone like that off the hook.

08:38.550 --> 08:41.500
Forget about him, Arnheid.

08:41.900 --> 08:44.250
That's not your husband.

08:44.730 --> 08:47.140
He's just a runaway slave 
who's lost his mind.

08:52.660 --> 08:58.060
Stay out of this matter. 
Look after Gramps for me.

09:41.160 --> 09:42.040
Einar, wait.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.030
Einar.

09:48.070 --> 09:49.860
Please have a seat.

09:51.940 --> 09:55.000
It's almost time for dinner.

09:59.300 --> 10:02.760
At night, under cover of darkness,

10:02.760 --> 10:06.790
we might be able to sneak into 
the fort and rescue Gardar.

10:07.890 --> 10:12.180
If we don't do something, 
your husband will be executed.

10:14.480 --> 10:17.880
Thank you, but it's all right.

10:18.580 --> 10:21.060
Sometimes, things can't be changed.

10:23.880 --> 10:27.270
And it's better not to do 
anything in those situations.

10:29.040 --> 10:33.160
It's better to sit still and 
wait for the storm to pass.

10:35.240 --> 10:38.810
I don't want you to get
 caught in the storm, Einar.

10:43.090 --> 10:47.420
Don't you love Gardar?

10:48.840 --> 10:49.930
I do.

10:50.880 --> 10:58.490
Our parents arranged our marriage, 
but he was kind to me and our son.

10:59.810 --> 11:02.170
Then we should go.

11:02.170 --> 11:06.200
Even if we end up having to fight Snake 
and his men, it's better than doing nothing.

11:06.950 --> 11:08.950
Isn't that right, Thorfinn?

11:12.480 --> 11:15.500
Please, Thorfinn. Lend me your strength.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.840
I'll draw the guards to me, so you...

11:17.840 --> 11:22.570
I lost my son because of pots.

11:29.090 --> 11:34.010
Could I tell you a little about myself?

11:43.760 --> 11:46.570
About the past.

12:13.700 --> 12:19.320
Our family lived in a village in Sweden.

12:20.370 --> 12:25.030
Neither wealthy nor poor, 
we lived a quiet life.

12:33.040 --> 12:35.260
When our son was one year old,

12:35.260 --> 12:39.290
deep in a distant forest, 
a marsh containing iron was found.

12:40.440 --> 12:47.380
Fighting broke out between several groups 
competing for ownership of the marsh.

12:48.890 --> 12:52.910
Gardar's friend was among 
those involved in the conflict,

12:53.800 --> 12:56.150
and he asked for his help.

12:58.550 --> 13:04.930
Gardar told the rest of the village about it, 
and the men gathered to discuss it.

13:05.890 --> 13:08.970
Should we join the fighting or not?

13:10.000 --> 13:12.430
If we won, we'd acquire iron.

13:17.480 --> 13:22.040
So the men decided to join the fight.

13:29.920 --> 13:33.960
The women were shocked when we heard this.

13:34.680 --> 13:40.860
After all, our village had all the 
pots and sickle blades we needed.

13:43.910 --> 13:50.250
But women can't overturn 
a decision made by men.

13:53.140 --> 13:55.980
Please reconsider, Gardar.

13:55.980 --> 13:59.640
It's not as though we're currently 
suffering from a lack of iron.

14:03.470 --> 14:07.030
Why are you risking your life 
for something we don't need?

14:07.890 --> 14:09.180
Arnheid.

14:12.200 --> 14:13.430
We do need it.

14:15.520 --> 14:18.960
Yngve of the West is an ambitious man.

14:19.940 --> 14:25.210
If his clan acquires the iron, it'll upset
 the balance of power in the area.

14:29.680 --> 14:31.580
And our village will become wealthy.

14:32.640 --> 14:34.280
So will the two of you.

14:45.340 --> 14:50.410
Hjalti, your father is going to 
fight to protect you.

14:52.450 --> 14:54.830
I couldn't understand it.

14:54.830 --> 14:56.360
Ow, that hurts.

14:58.290 --> 15:02.900
He could've protected us 
better by staying with us.

15:10.360 --> 15:13.750
All the young men went off to battle,

15:14.190 --> 15:17.260
while the women and children were 
left behind to defend our homes.

15:17.260 --> 15:19.520
Several weeks passed.

15:21.490 --> 15:22.650
And then...

15:28.820 --> 15:30.030
Look.

15:31.700 --> 15:36.420
When we saw the ships, 
we thought the men had returned.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.900
But instead...

15:53.920 --> 15:57.110
They attacked while the men were gone.

15:58.950 --> 16:02.490
Our homes were burned. 
The elderly were killed.

16:02.940 --> 16:08.170
The women were put on ships and taken away.

16:09.880 --> 16:14.310
And I... lost Hjalti...

16:23.810 --> 16:31.670
Hjalti! No! Hjalti!

16:45.920 --> 16:51.240
When I met Gardar today, I was afraid of him.

16:52.960 --> 16:57.300
I'm sure all the suffering 
he's experienced has changed him.

16:58.360 --> 17:02.710
He is the storm itself now.

17:06.240 --> 17:14.310
This time, I must protect my child, 
from the men's storm.

17:17.350 --> 17:19.130
Your child?

17:22.020 --> 17:24.630
I just learned the other day

17:26.020 --> 17:30.940
that I'm pregnant with Master Ketil's child.

17:35.880 --> 17:39.910
I'm sure he'll welcome this child.

17:40.720 --> 17:42.900
After all, he's been wanting one.

17:44.770 --> 17:52.460
On this farm, I could peacefully 
raise a healthy child.

17:55.940 --> 17:58.680
So Einar,

17:59.540 --> 18:04.090
stay here until the storm passes.

18:06.740 --> 18:07.900
Stay here.

19:08.100 --> 19:13.960
I thought you were waiting 
for the storm to pass, Arnheid.

19:16.390 --> 19:19.500
You were listening, sir?

19:21.570 --> 19:26.560
You seem to think I've gone 
completely senile,

19:26.920 --> 19:30.600
but I haven't lost my senses yet. 
Don't underestimate me.

19:36.100 --> 19:39.620
I thought I could at least tend his wounds.

19:45.750 --> 19:50.500
I know I shouldn't see him again,

19:52.390 --> 19:55.350
so why?

20:01.000 --> 20:07.780
I once patiently waited 
for a storm to pass, too.

20:10.960 --> 20:17.770
No, I trembled as I hid.

20:30.120 --> 20:35.000
It was more than 20 years ago.

20:38.130 --> 20:45.910
My son Ketil and a beautiful girl from 
our village were in love back then.

20:49.090 --> 20:54.600
But one day, a man from 
a nearby village named Ebbe

20:54.600 --> 20:58.360
who'd been growing his power 
fell in love with her,

20:58.360 --> 21:01.990
and I was forced to make a painful decision.

21:03.480 --> 21:08.980
Ketil was prepared to fight to protect her.

21:10.560 --> 21:14.730
But at the time, we were still weak.

21:14.730 --> 21:18.060
Many were afraid of Ebbe.

21:18.620 --> 21:21.910
They thought we'd be 
wiped out if we defied him.

21:24.980 --> 21:30.170
So we made the decision to submit.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.130
Norse men would be disgusted to hear that.

21:37.610 --> 21:43.050
I offered up a young woman to protect myself.

21:47.520 --> 21:52.460
And yet, on the day of her wedding...

22:07.570 --> 22:13.660
It was the work of a man who 
envied and resented Ebbe's wealth.

22:18.050 --> 22:21.510
By the time I heard 
the news and rushed there,

22:22.050 --> 22:26.430
everything had already burned to ashes.

22:37.780 --> 22:43.190
Why? Why does this always happen?

22:50.000 --> 22:52.510
The only thing I can say is...

22:56.040 --> 23:04.340
Even if you can wait out the storm, 
it leaves scars behind.

23:19.220 --> 23:23.320
I'm sorry I can't help you.

23:37.990 --> 23:40.540
I'll be back soon.

25:52.150 --> 25:55.030
<b>Storm</b>

25:52.150 --> 25:55.030
<b>Storm</b>

25:53.030 --> 25:54.100
"Storm."
