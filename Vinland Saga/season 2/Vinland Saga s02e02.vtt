00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.010
<b>Ketil's Farm</b>

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.010
<b>Ketil's Farm</b>

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.130
Einar, Thorfinn... Starting today, 
you two are friends.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.490
Go on, say hello.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.120
I'll be assigning the
 two of you the same job.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.770
You're to work together.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.020
Nice to meet you, Thorfinn.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.910
Hello.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.470
Good. Let me explain what you'll be doing.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.860
Einar, what does this place look like to you?

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.080
What? Uh...

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.300
A forest?

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.890
Wrong.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.090
This is a future wheat farm.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.800
I own these woods.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.210
I'm going to let the two of you borrow them.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:44.970
Borrow?

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.060
Yes. I'll leave everything up to you.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.080
You'll clear this land, work it,
 and reap the harvest.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.730
I'll buy it from you for a fair price.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.610
Once that amount exceeds your price, 
you'll buy yourselves back.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.720
Buy ourselves?

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.910
In other words, we'll... we'll be free?

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.670
That's right. Earn your freedom 
yourselves, the right way.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.520
Depending on how hard you work, you may be 
able to accomplish that within three years.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.340
I'll wait to collect your lease payment 
until after your first harvest.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.100
What's the matter? Is there a problem?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.560
N-No. Thank you. I'll do my best.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.320
Good.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.400
If you have any problems 
or questions, ask Pater here.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.950
He knows this farm well.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.720
Nice to meet you.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.170
I became a free man by the same means.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.460
I know it'll be tough working in an 
unfamiliar land, but do your best.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.000
I w-will!

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.460
For today, observe Thorfinn's work.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.280
You must be exhausted from the long journey.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.660
Thorfinn, be good to Einar. Got it?

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.540
Yes, sir.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.430
Hey, our master...

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.240
Huh?

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.590
Hey, wait up.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.490
What kind of man is our master?

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.610
Is this normal in Denmark?

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.480
We had slaves back in my homeland, 
but they were slaves for life.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.330
I'm from Northern England. What about you?

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.050
Iceland.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.610
Iceland, huh?

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.470
Iceland...

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.740
Where's that?

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.700
Wow, you've already cut down a ton of trees.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.700
How much is left?

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.360
Everything on this side.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.120
This side?

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.170
See that river over there?

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.860
Everything on this side of the river.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.630
This side of the river?

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.110
You mean...

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.570
There's still a lot left to clear?

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.620
Huh? What?

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.380
Hup!

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:09.480
Huh?

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:13.990
What do you want?

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.140
He told you to observe.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.180
I want to free myself as soon as possible.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.400
What's wrong with that?

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.670
In that case, could you 
work a little farther away?

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.660
And cut them so they fall 
perpendicular to the river.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.220
I see. So we float them down the river, huh?

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.500
Ow...

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.750
Man, I'm hungry.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.550
Hey, how does lunch work around here?

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.600
We get lunch.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.810
That's good. Do we go pick it up somewhere?

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:01.950
No, the retainers should be bringing it soon.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.820
Really? This place leaves 
nothing to be desired.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.690
No way. Seriously?

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:09.950
Seriously.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.820
Hey, lunch is here. Right, Thorfinn?

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.350
I'm telling you, seriously.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.080
You're the only one who hasn't.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.580
Man, I had no idea.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.960
I guess I'll go see her tonight.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.680
Yeah, you should.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.160
Go and get rejected.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.470
That's not gonna happen.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.720
Hey, that must be the newbie.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.010
Yeah, looks like it.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.850
Look at that stupid face.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:39.560
The face of a slave.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.610
H-Hello, I...

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.330
Yeah, we know. We've heard.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.820
Um...

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.080
What is this?

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.330
Your lunch.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.240
Let's all go tonight.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.740
Um, what is this?

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.620
I said it's your lunch.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:04.580
What?

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.460
Th-This is all?

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.970
What? You got a problem with that, huh?

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.470
Not a problem, exactly...

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.500
This is for both of us?

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.200
You heard him.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.940
Good grief.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.300
Is this your first time being a slave?

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.070
What? Well, yes.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.480
Then remember this.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.450
You're lucky you're getting fed at all.

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:37.620
Not only that, but us free men came 
all the way here to bring you lunch.

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:41.080
You should start by thanking us.

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:44.980
<i>These jerks...</i>

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:47.830
Go on, say it.

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:51.090
Say, "Thank you."

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:58.260
Why are you looking at me like that, asshole?

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:05.110
We'll take it. Thank you.

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:16.740
Thorfinn, you'd better 
teach him some manners.

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.810
And don't injure the horse.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:22.460
Yes, sir.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.760
Those assholes are napping.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:38.730
They just came here to shirk their duties.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:44.780
And you shouldn't be so obedient 
just because you're a slave.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:49.860
Einar, push from the back.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:51.750
I'll pull from the front.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.610
Once we get it to the river, 
we'll use it to build a raft.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:03.050
Shouldn't we cut this tree a little shorter?

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:05.750
That old horse won't be able 
to drag it by itself.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:07.910
The trees belong to our master.

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:10.360
We can't cut them shorter 
without his permission.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:15.440
Hey, isn't this their job?

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:18.090
Normally you wouldn't let 
a slave use a horse.

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:21.070
And this miserable horse alone 
won't be enough.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:22.600
Don't worry about it. Let's go.

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:34.170
Einar.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:35.360
O-Okay!

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.250
Einar, lift the front.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.230
Got it.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.060
Let's go.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:27.880
I'm so hungry, I feel sick.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.300
They won't get away with this.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:35.900
They ate my lunch.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:44.140
Retainers don't have their own farms,
 so they have to serve a master, right?

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.890
Yeah.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:52.410
Then they're halfway 
to being slaves themselves.

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:56.900
They're just making sure there's 
someone beneath them by bullying us.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.280
Don't you agree, Thorfinn?

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.320
I don't know. It doesn't matter.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.800
It <i>does</i> matter.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.600
We're our master's property.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.130
His retainers can't push us around.

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.030
I'm going to tell our master about this.

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:27.820
Don't. They'll just harass us more.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.120
And you're <i>okay</i> with that?

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:40.900
Einar, Thorfinn...

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:43.110
Master.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:49.030
Well, Einar? How was your first day?

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:51.020
Actually, I have something to report.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:51.980
Don't.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:52.790
Shut up.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.060
I have something to report.

00:12:56.060 --> 00:13:00.030
Today, those retainers of yours...

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:20.330
What is it, Einar? 
What do you have to report?

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.840
What a strange fellow.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.180
If you've got nothing to say, 
then I'm leaving.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:50.250
Einar.

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:51.660
Huh?

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.520
Weren't you going to report them?

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:01.590
Shut up.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.760
Hup.

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:32.440
It's hot today.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.100
We've got water.

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:38.030
We just got it from the spring.

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:39.520
It's cold.

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:41.690
Bring me a cup.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.010
High-speed turn!

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:49.020
Here you go.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.410
Thank you.

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:52.660
We went to the deep spring.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.790
I feel rejuvenated. Thank you.

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:00.170
You're welcome.

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.880
Come on, everyone.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.230
We're almost done.

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:07.420
Let's finish this patch by noon.

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:08.630
Yes, sir.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.800
The master's pitching in, too, huh?

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:17.080
I thought rich people didn't work.

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:26.280
Danish or English, we all look 
the same when we're working.

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:33.490
Hey, not like that.

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:35.990
Don't make me say it again, Olmar.

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:39.750
What? I'm just doing what you told me to do.

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.500
Use a hand sickle.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:45.120
And cut it to below the knee.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.790
I showed you how to do this.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:50.040
Who cares as long as it gets cut?

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:50.510
What?

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:53.930
You fool. After the harvest 
comes the grazing.

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:58.640
We leave long stumps so
the livestock can eat them.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:03.530
You're 17, and you <i>still</i> haven't 
learned the order of things.

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:07.290
That's why you don't understand 
the purpose of each individual task.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.970
Shut up. I know.

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:12.900
I've got the order down pat.

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:16.760
Get this into that thick skull.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:19.160
If you're going to lead others, then—

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.450
Yeah, yeah. Below the knee, right?

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.090
I got it.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:25.000
Whoa!

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.840
You fool! Don't swing your scythe like that.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:30.260
You'll crush the ears of the wheat.

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.760
You said cut below the knee.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:34.700
What's going on over there? 
He's getting an earful.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:32.680
I'm doing that.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.440
Do it properly.

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:36.850
That's the master's son, Olmar.

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:38.060
Right there. Just like that.

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:39.140
Father and son, huh?

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:39.140
Shut up.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.230
Ah, I can't take this!

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:47.360
I thought I'd help out for once, and you 
won't stop complaining about stupid shit.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:51.720
I'm out. I thought I'd help, but forget it.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.650
Hey, where are you going, Olmar?

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:57.740
Somewhere you ain't, shithead.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:00.720
You'll be taking over this farm before long.

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.540
You need to accept that.

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:06.700
When did I say I wanted 
to take over this place?

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:14.260
A grown man shouldn't be doing 
this dull, boring, <i>tedious</i> farm work!

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:16.340
I'm gonna use this to...

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:21.190
Huh?

00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:27.020
What's he doing?

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:27.550
What?

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:28.780
I'm not sure.

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:43.220
I'm gonna make a name for myself 
with a sword, damn it!

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.880
Olmar! Wait, boy!

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:52.590
I'm going to England soon.
 I'll make sure of it.

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:59.050
I'm not spending my whole life here 
in the middle of nowhere.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:04.500
I'm gonna join Prince Canute's army 
and achieve greatness.

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:26.330
Um... Sir, when is soon?

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.210
Soon means soon.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:33.290
King Harald should be calling 
for reinforcements soon.

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:38.470
I think you should take over the farm.

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:41.050
What? You, too?

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:42.640
What do <i>you</i> know?

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.520
That's not what I meant.

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:48.020
I'm just worried about you.

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.690
Huh? Oh...

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.280
Hey...

00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.310
Come here. Let's go again.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:06.300
<i>Good, daughter of mine. That's it.</i>

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.690
How are things going?

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.490
I brought food for the young master.

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:11.540
What?

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:16.000
N-Not now. They're getting round two started.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.160
Oh, my!

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:19.760
Oh, my.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.480
With this, our family's future 
will be secure.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:31.480
Exactly. As long as the young master 
keeps coming here...

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.450
Wh-Wh-Wh-What's the matter, sir?

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:45.700
Did our daughter commit some kind of blunder?

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.620
Shut up, idiots!

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:53.390
I know what you're up to, 
you penniless tenant farmers.

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:55.750
You're after my dad's fortune.

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:59.510
You think you'll get to live a life of
 luxury if you join Ketil's family?

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:01.760
W-We'd never dream of that.

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:06.920
Women are rotten, every last one of them!

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:10.770
Sir, that wasn't our intention!

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:13.020
Sir, wait!

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.860
Damn it. What's wrong with everyone?

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:19.900
I'm my own person, not my father's tagalong.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:22.940
Damn it! I feel like shit!

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:26.730
Hey, it's the young master.

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:28.940
Huh? The young master?

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:31.630
Hello, sir!

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:33.040
Hey!

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.000
What are you doing?

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.190
It's dangerous to race around at night.

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:41.670
So dangerous.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.680
What are you guys doing?

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:49.290
We're coming over to you.

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:52.680
Come on. Walk straight.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:59.580
We went to see a woman, 
but the retainers beat us to her.

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:01.530
Hey, the wheat...

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:02.170
So we're drowning our sorrows.

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:08.080
But if we start a fight with them, 
we'll get in trouble with our boss again.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.570
Screw that, right?

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:13.200
Screw that.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:19.690
You're lucky. You can do 
whatever you want on this farm.

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:23.590
Shut up. You guys don't know how I feel.

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:26.060
What? Are you mad?

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:27.880
You got something on your mind?

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.490
Don't be mad.

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:34.350
I don't have time for you idiots.

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.960
Go back to your fort and go to sleep.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:41.520
Now, now, now, now, now, now... 
Don't be so irritable.

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.700
You're young.

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:43.980
But you're so cold.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.490
H-Hey, don't try to lead my horse.

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:50.120
Don't worry about it. 
Let's drink another round, okay?

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:53.400
Let's stay up all night chatting, young master.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.620
Tell us all about your youthful troubles.

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:59.960
You're hoping I'll entertain you 
while you drink, aren't you?

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:03.580
Screw this. I'm going home. Let go.

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.020
He should just take over the farm.

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:21.500
He doesn't know war.

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:25.750
He probably thinks warriors are cool.

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:32.550
Everyone who goes to war is a beast.

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:38.160
Go to sleep. We have an early morning.

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:45.110
Soldiers came to my village twice.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:56.100
First came the King of England's soldiers. 
They burned down every single house.

00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:01.350
My dad fought against them, but he was killed.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:06.490
All I could do was watch.

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:17.560
After them came the Danes.

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:25.830
They claimed they were saving us 
from the tyranny of the King of England,

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.460
but they pillaged everything they could.

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:42.940
They're beasts wearing human skin.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:52.630
Hey, Thorfinn. Are you asleep?

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:55.030
<b>Snake</b>

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:55.030
<b>Snake</b>

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:54.330
<i>"Snake."</i>
