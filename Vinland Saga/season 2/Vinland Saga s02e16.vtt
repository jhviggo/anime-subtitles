WEBVTT

00:42.230 --> 00:45.190
Be careful. He's strong.

00:45.670 --> 00:46.570
Got it.

00:48.320 --> 00:52.060
Wh-What's going on? It's still so early.

00:56.800 --> 01:00.040
He doesn't seem to be here.

01:00.440 --> 01:02.920
There's so much crap, it's hard to tell.

01:04.070 --> 01:05.930
Throw it all out.

01:09.400 --> 01:12.200
What the hell are they doing?

01:14.360 --> 01:15.460
He escaped.

01:16.300 --> 01:17.000
What?

01:17.500 --> 01:19.020
Gardar escaped.

01:19.570 --> 01:23.270
What other reason would 
they have to search our shed?

01:29.730 --> 01:30.960
Arnheid!

03:24.390 --> 03:28.680
<b>Great Purpose</b>

03:24.390 --> 03:28.680
<b>Great Purpose</b>

03:33.460 --> 03:34.980
Wait, Einar!

03:35.860 --> 03:39.360
Stop, Einar!

03:40.170 --> 03:44.470
If Gardar escaped, 
he'll look for Arnheid again.

03:46.950 --> 03:49.220
What will you accomplish by going to Arnheid?

03:49.920 --> 03:51.990
Will you drive back Gardar?

03:55.490 --> 03:58.570
I don't know, but...

04:00.370 --> 04:06.230
There must be something I can do for Arnheid.

04:29.400 --> 04:30.730
Arnheid!

04:36.820 --> 04:38.590
It's not him.

04:38.590 --> 04:42.020
It's not Gardar. Just two slaves.

04:43.280 --> 04:46.590
What are their names again?

04:46.590 --> 04:49.100
You mean the master's slaves.

04:50.230 --> 04:52.570
Thorfinn and Einar, huh?

04:52.980 --> 04:55.070
Yeah, those guys.

04:55.070 --> 04:57.080
What are they doing here?

04:58.430 --> 05:01.360
What should we do, boss? 
Should we chase them off?

05:03.300 --> 05:07.830
No, leave them alone. 
Let them do what they want.

05:20.370 --> 05:23.620
Um, Arnheid...

05:26.240 --> 05:30.380
Yes. You're here about Gardar.

05:32.070 --> 05:33.770
You know?

05:37.590 --> 05:38.380
Yes.

05:41.080 --> 05:44.790
I helped him escape.

05:46.370 --> 05:49.800
I cut the ropes binding him.

05:53.810 --> 05:57.500
Gardar, he... the man watching him....

05:58.000 --> 06:06.540
I thought we'd both be killed, so I...

06:14.980 --> 06:26.920
Then Gardar killed all the other guests 
who came to see what was happening.

06:31.910 --> 06:33.540
<i>More dead guests...</i>

06:34.060 --> 06:36.740
<i>The situation couldn't be worse.</i>

06:42.100 --> 06:43.020
Einar...

06:43.960 --> 06:46.060
We're being watched by guests.

06:46.060 --> 06:49.940
Kneel next to Arnheid and
 pretend to wash dishes.

06:57.330 --> 07:01.380
Stay calm, and tell us what's happening.

07:04.930 --> 07:10.470
Gardar was badly injured in the f-fight.

07:11.810 --> 07:18.760
We fled here in the rain, 
to the old master's house.

07:20.500 --> 07:26.500
But Gardar lost consciousness 
while I was tending his wounds.

07:27.570 --> 07:30.090
He was too heavy to carry.

07:30.720 --> 07:35.020
I was barely able to hide him.

07:36.600 --> 07:39.370
So Gardar is here.

07:39.960 --> 07:45.400
Yes. The old master helped me.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.690
Snake and his men arrived soon after.

07:51.300 --> 07:58.470
They seem to think Gardar fled 
and is hiding somewhere.

08:00.320 --> 08:06.180
They're waiting for Gardar 
to come for me at the house.

08:06.610 --> 08:09.940
Mister Snake and two other men are inside.

08:13.090 --> 08:17.680
Why... Why would you do something 
so reckless by yourself?

08:18.370 --> 08:22.700
And after you said we'd wait out the storm
 for the sake of the child inside you.

08:30.600 --> 08:32.900
Why?

08:42.680 --> 08:44.090
Perhaps...

08:45.650 --> 08:49.990
Perhaps I was dreaming.

08:50.880 --> 08:57.620
Dreaming of a life as part of a family 
with Gardar and the child inside me.

08:59.350 --> 09:04.440
I thought that perhaps he had returned...

09:08.000 --> 09:12.140
I thought he'd returned.

09:17.810 --> 09:26.010
Those eyes that used to be 
so full of confidence...

09:32.050 --> 09:34.840
They looked so miserable.

09:37.650 --> 09:45.260
We've lived so miserably 
since we lost Hjalti.

09:48.520 --> 09:52.940
But I still dream...

10:05.960 --> 10:10.420
How are Gardar's injuries? 
Has the bleeding stopped?

10:15.680 --> 10:20.090
He was bleeding badly 
from the right side of his chest.

10:21.160 --> 10:25.670
He was still bleeding when I hid him.

10:28.050 --> 10:30.180
Every moment counts.

10:38.880 --> 10:40.100
Arnheid...

10:42.050 --> 10:47.290
Are you prepared to cast your lot with Gardar?

10:57.060 --> 11:02.340
If you want to live with Gardar, 
then you'll have to flee together.

11:04.610 --> 11:06.870
But you're pregnant.

11:07.650 --> 11:10.150
The road ahead will be difficult.

11:11.910 --> 11:14.010
But if you still want to try,

11:15.620 --> 11:17.560
then I will help you.

11:19.540 --> 11:22.900
It's the only option left.

11:33.300 --> 11:37.050
<i>The only option, huh?</i>

11:41.090 --> 11:43.820
I'll help, too.

11:43.820 --> 11:47.130
Together, we may be able to do something.

11:48.600 --> 11:49.750
Thorfinn...

12:07.740 --> 12:09.750
Ow! Whatâ€”

12:10.090 --> 12:11.440
Don't sleep.

12:11.440 --> 12:15.420
If you take your eyes off Arnheid again, 
I'll break your nose.

12:15.880 --> 12:18.550
Y-Yes, boss. Sorry.

12:23.620 --> 12:24.490
Who's there?

12:26.760 --> 12:30.710
I'd like to begin preparing lunch.

12:33.890 --> 12:36.670
Take the tools you need and cook in the yard.

12:36.670 --> 12:40.540
You're the bait. 
Stay where you'll be seen.

12:42.630 --> 12:45.340
Very well. I understand.

12:56.320 --> 12:59.880
What a pitiful bunch.

13:00.710 --> 13:02.790
Right, Snake?

13:06.120 --> 13:13.660
They say inferior people 
can't help but become slaves.

13:14.420 --> 13:16.870
That it's where they belong.

13:18.040 --> 13:21.240
But I don't think so.

13:21.690 --> 13:27.190
Slaves were just unlucky. That's all.

13:28.160 --> 13:34.280
If you and I had been unlucky, 
we might've ended up as slaves, too.

13:35.320 --> 13:39.540
So what? That's got nothing to do with this.

13:39.960 --> 13:42.310
He killed five of my men.

13:42.660 --> 13:45.510
I won't be satisfied until he's dead.

13:47.060 --> 13:50.370
I can't walk around wearing this sword

13:50.370 --> 13:53.480
when I'm crying myself to sleep 
over my unavenged men.

13:58.120 --> 14:01.310
Then throw away your sword.

14:05.880 --> 14:11.830
Even I can tell that sword 
isn't from around here.

14:12.290 --> 14:16.940
There was a reason you ended up here.

14:17.970 --> 14:24.150
But I doubt throwing away your sword 
would allow you to escape whatever it was.

14:25.890 --> 14:30.620
Enough talking, Gramps. 
It's time for your nap.

14:33.440 --> 14:36.360
You can have my farm.

14:37.280 --> 14:41.840
Work the land. Produce life.

14:41.840 --> 14:45.480
That's better than swinging around a sword.

14:49.080 --> 14:55.620
I can no longer stand and walk. 
Soon I will die.

14:56.320 --> 15:00.280
It's a good opportunity for you 
to straighten out your life.

15:02.870 --> 15:08.360
I owe you for reading the Bible to me.

15:12.020 --> 15:15.740
Don't talk about that nonsense now.

15:15.740 --> 15:17.740
I'm not doing no stinking field work.

15:19.730 --> 15:20.730
Boss.

15:20.730 --> 15:21.460
Huh?

15:21.810 --> 15:23.690
There's someone out there.

15:27.170 --> 15:30.320
Over there. Third tree from the back.

15:31.400 --> 15:34.450
That's probably him in its shadow.

15:37.990 --> 15:39.500
All right.

16:11.700 --> 16:12.740
They're coming out.

16:13.200 --> 16:16.260
One, two, three...

16:16.740 --> 16:18.450
That's all of them.

16:22.960 --> 16:25.530
I'm counting on you, Einar.

16:43.100 --> 16:44.590
Spread out.

16:45.020 --> 16:47.860
We'll follow him from different 
positions and vantages.

16:52.920 --> 16:57.740
Sir, I'm sorry, but I need to 
borrow your horse and cart.

16:57.740 --> 17:01.400
I promise I'll pay you back 
by working for you.

17:02.320 --> 17:04.780
Don't worry about that.

17:04.780 --> 17:08.160
More importantly, load me into the cart.

17:08.160 --> 17:13.130
If I'm there, we'll be able to travel 
around the farm unquestioned.

17:13.130 --> 17:17.540
But we can't involve you in this...

17:18.690 --> 17:21.390
I'm already involved.

17:21.880 --> 17:25.640
Now quit arguing and help me.

17:26.550 --> 17:29.930
Y-Yes, sir. Thank you.

17:34.900 --> 17:36.380
Damn that Gardar...

17:36.780 --> 17:38.680
He's trying to flee into the woods.

17:39.280 --> 17:42.420
We won't be able to use 
the horses in the woods.

17:42.420 --> 17:44.870
Catch him. Don't let him enter the woods.

17:48.960 --> 17:51.300
<i>Damn it! It's so far away...</i>

18:08.600 --> 18:11.740
<i>He's alive. His wounds were treated well.</i>

18:13.010 --> 18:15.670
<i>But he's as cold as a stone.</i>

18:16.640 --> 18:18.460
<i>He lost too much blood.</i>

18:19.970 --> 18:22.440
<i>Please hang in there.</i>

18:27.720 --> 18:28.960
<i>He's fast.</i>

18:29.620 --> 18:33.820
<i>A gravely injured man 
could never run that fast.</i>

18:35.330 --> 18:37.550
Spider! Badger!

18:37.550 --> 18:39.450
Stay on him.

18:39.970 --> 18:42.080
Don't force a confrontation.

18:42.080 --> 18:46.310
If that's Gardar, you won't 
stand a chance against him.

18:46.920 --> 18:49.040
I'll send reinforcements later.

18:49.040 --> 18:51.160
Keep following him until then.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.060
You got that?

18:53.400 --> 18:54.680
I'm counting on you guys.

18:55.570 --> 18:58.570
What? Wait, where are you going, boss?

19:01.890 --> 19:04.060
The cart is ready.

19:04.060 --> 19:06.330
We'll hurry toward the border to the south.

19:06.830 --> 19:10.880
Once you're out of the country, it'll be 
difficult for the guests to pursue you.

19:11.600 --> 19:14.080
I'll leave you partway to distract them.

19:14.080 --> 19:16.230
I'll draw as many pursuers to me as I can.

19:17.810 --> 19:21.930
Sir, could you accompany them 
to the edge of the farm?

19:22.240 --> 19:24.730
Got it.

19:56.980 --> 19:59.270
<i>I didn't hear horses.</i>

20:02.880 --> 20:05.270
<i>Did he dismount and run here?</i>

20:11.200 --> 20:12.600
I see.

20:13.770 --> 20:16.780
So he's unconscious.

20:17.560 --> 20:20.550
No wonder I couldn't sense him.

20:27.330 --> 20:28.580
Thorfinn...

20:40.050 --> 20:44.680
Just so you know, Thorfinn, 
I'm not here to negotiate.

20:47.090 --> 20:49.580
Hand over Gardar.

20:50.550 --> 20:52.090
Otherwise,

20:53.320 --> 20:54.420
I'll kill you.

21:01.490 --> 21:03.020
<i>There were three pursuers.</i>

21:03.560 --> 21:05.990
<i>But only Snake is here.</i>

21:05.990 --> 21:07.580
<i>I don't sense the others.</i>

21:08.520 --> 21:13.160
<i>If I can subdue him somehow, 
we can still escape.</i>

21:14.580 --> 21:18.500
<i>I'll slip past his sword and
 deal a single blow to his chin.</i>

21:21.750 --> 21:24.250
You gonna fight him, Thorfinn?

21:24.250 --> 21:27.610
Good grief. I guess 
you can't help it this time.

21:28.010 --> 21:30.560
You're helping someone.

21:30.560 --> 21:33.900
You've got a good reason to raise your fists.

21:36.230 --> 21:38.520
But, you know,

21:38.880 --> 21:42.840
I'm sure he's got a good reason, too.

21:43.900 --> 21:46.120
What will you do, Thorfinn?

21:46.540 --> 21:54.170
Will you remain a pacifist, or will you 
fight him in order to help someone else?

21:56.910 --> 22:00.810
Which road leads to becoming a true warrior?

22:01.360 --> 22:03.830
There's no time to think about it.

22:05.420 --> 22:08.180
Look. He's right in front of you.

23:12.370 --> 23:15.180
Do you think you can beat him 
while you're still half-asleep?

23:47.320 --> 23:49.030
<i>That's an odd stance.</i>

23:49.760 --> 23:51.780
<i>Not right for a spear or an ax...</i>

23:52.550 --> 23:53.510
<i>A sword?</i>

23:56.570 --> 23:57.610
<i>No...</i>

25:52.020 --> 25:54.940
<b>The Road Home</b>

25:52.020 --> 25:54.940
<b>The Road Home</b>

25:53.250 --> 25:54.390
"The Road Home."
