WEBVTT

01:51.850 --> 01:54.480
Sixteen!

01:53.630 --> 01:58.550
<b>The King of Rebellion</b>

01:53.630 --> 01:58.550
<b>The King of Rebellion</b>

02:00.430 --> 02:02.600
Seventeen!

02:03.120 --> 02:05.840
Eighteen!

02:07.460 --> 02:10.330
Nineteen!

02:17.660 --> 02:20.570
Twenty!

02:20.570 --> 02:24.080
Crap, I lost!

02:24.560 --> 02:27.450
Wow, but he's so small!

02:28.750 --> 02:30.700
He's still holding on!

02:31.460 --> 02:33.520
Way to go, shorty!

02:33.520 --> 02:37.430
I lost a ton of money because of you, Drott!

02:37.840 --> 02:40.000
What the hell are you doing?

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Break this shrimp's skull already!

02:45.760 --> 02:47.290
<i>Something's not right.</i>

02:47.810 --> 02:50.760
<i>I feel hardly any resistance when I hit him.</i>

02:54.030 --> 02:54.980
Damn it.

02:55.570 --> 03:00.740
<i>I see. That messenger certainly 
is used to taking a beating.</i>

03:01.600 --> 03:05.200
<i>He's twisting his neck and hips 
just before Drott's fists hit him,</i>

03:05.200 --> 03:07.750
<i>thereby dispersing the impact away 
from the core of his body.</i>

03:10.040 --> 03:11.940
<i>His movements are subtle, too,</i>

03:12.660 --> 03:15.190
<i>so no one's noticed that
 he's avoiding direct hits.</i>

03:17.010 --> 03:19.470
<i>But Drott is a strong man.</i>

03:20.100 --> 03:22.700
<i>At this rate, he can't last long.</i>

03:24.160 --> 03:26.970
Twenty-three!

03:27.940 --> 03:31.130
Twenty-four!

03:31.130 --> 03:32.380
Thorfinn...

03:35.000 --> 03:40.170
But violence should be a last resort.

03:41.830 --> 03:48.020
I want to learn to find that first method.

03:50.260 --> 03:56.680
<i>Is this the "first method" 
you were talking about?</i>

03:58.640 --> 04:01.940
<i>Not hitting him back. Simply enduring.</i>

04:03.110 --> 04:09.930
<i>Is that how you're going to live from now on?</i>

04:25.310 --> 04:27.940
What's going on? Is there a fight?

04:30.310 --> 04:31.660
Hey, you.

04:34.670 --> 04:35.740
Thorfinn?

04:37.540 --> 04:38.920
Hey, stop!

04:39.220 --> 04:40.710
What's this about?

04:41.910 --> 04:45.270
He's got nothing to do with the farm!

04:47.140 --> 04:48.220
<i>Crap.</i>

05:06.110 --> 05:09.770
All right! That was a solid hit!

05:10.120 --> 05:13.250
Thirty-two!

05:14.050 --> 05:15.870
That made a crazy sound.

05:16.790 --> 05:18.200
Is he dead?

05:19.910 --> 05:20.930
Thorfinn!

05:29.270 --> 05:30.750
What are you two doing?

05:30.750 --> 05:33.270
I thought you left the farm already.

05:33.990 --> 05:35.930
How did this happen?

05:38.740 --> 05:45.780
If he can endure 100 of his punches, 
he'll be allowed to speak directly to the king.

05:46.360 --> 05:49.260
That's the promise they made.

05:51.170 --> 05:52.390
That's ridiculous.

05:53.480 --> 05:55.860
He's doing this for the farm?

06:01.850 --> 06:04.410
Enough of this. No more.

06:04.980 --> 06:08.890
The farm will surrender. 
The decision's been made.

06:10.690 --> 06:16.520
You idiot. You're unbelievably softhearted.

06:17.590 --> 06:21.670
If talking could've resolved this, 
we'd have done that already.

06:26.200 --> 06:29.410
Are you sure about that?

06:33.140 --> 06:37.800
Did you really put in the effort

06:39.380 --> 06:46.070
to resolve this through conversation?

06:50.740 --> 06:53.110
Once they drew their swords,

06:54.400 --> 06:59.720
you merely answered with your
 own blades without thinking.

07:00.940 --> 07:04.830
That's 32 hits. We're handing out winnings.

07:01.830 --> 07:04.830
Is he getting back up?

07:04.830 --> 07:06.190
Hey, wait a second.

07:19.660 --> 07:23.140
Why are you just standing there, middle-part?

07:24.450 --> 07:28.540
Your fists hurt less than 
being bitten by a bug!

07:29.460 --> 07:33.800
Sixty-eight more. Get it over with.

07:34.280 --> 07:36.330
I'm a busy man.

07:37.620 --> 07:40.810
People are waiting for me!

07:54.070 --> 07:56.500
Don't! This battle is alreadyâ€”

07:58.860 --> 08:02.160
Einar, if he keeps this up, he'll die.

08:40.660 --> 08:44.140
Ninety-eight...

08:48.340 --> 08:52.090
Ninety-nine...

08:58.440 --> 08:59.830
One hundred.

09:29.540 --> 09:32.460
Thorfinn, son of Thors.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.760
I'm sorry I doubted you.

09:38.340 --> 09:39.850
You...

09:41.200 --> 09:44.540
You are a true warrior.

09:51.520 --> 09:52.820
Chief Thegn...

09:53.910 --> 09:59.360
This man once guarded His Majesty as we do.

09:59.920 --> 10:04.250
Please permit Thorfinn 
an audience with the king.

10:13.140 --> 10:17.750
You're small, but you're well-trained, Thorfinn.

10:18.860 --> 10:21.960
Why didn't you strike back?

10:22.870 --> 10:29.020
Beating Drott would have proven
 that you are a former guard.

10:31.460 --> 10:33.920
What kind of question is that?

10:34.710 --> 10:38.660
I can't hit someone when 
I'm trying to negotiate for peace.

10:39.810 --> 10:43.460
I just met all of you today.

10:44.040 --> 10:47.450
We don't know anything about each other.

10:47.750 --> 10:49.620
We have no reason to hate each other.

10:50.290 --> 10:54.670
So why do we have to 
hit each other? It's stupid.

10:55.780 --> 10:59.240
It's just Canute and Ketil 
who are feuding with each other.

10:59.690 --> 11:04.810
The two leaders could settle this 
over a game of hnefatafl.

11:05.260 --> 11:10.350
There's no need to gather all these men 
and shed all this blood.

11:15.230 --> 11:18.390
We just met today.

11:20.260 --> 11:22.680
You are not my enemies.

11:36.900 --> 11:39.740
I don't have any enemies.

11:49.240 --> 11:57.850
You're a bold man to reject war while 
surrounded by this many professional soldiers.

11:59.110 --> 12:00.410
But...

12:02.130 --> 12:05.000
Ketil and His Majesty 
should play hnefatafl, huh?

12:06.040 --> 12:07.960
What's so funny?

12:07.960 --> 12:13.910
Sorry. You should try suggesting 
that to His Majesty yourself.

12:15.160 --> 12:19.590
He doesn't go to war because he wants to.

12:20.340 --> 12:24.920
Once you see him and hear what he has to say, 
you'll realize what's in his heart.

12:29.080 --> 12:30.970
Clear the way.

12:30.970 --> 12:34.020
I'm permitting this messenger 
an audience with His Majesty.

12:43.740 --> 12:45.990
Come on, Einar.

12:48.380 --> 12:51.370
We're going to see the man who starts wars.

12:52.510 --> 12:54.780
Don't you have things 
you want to say to him, too?

12:56.630 --> 12:58.380
Y-Yeah.

12:58.750 --> 13:01.720
You bet I do. A whole mountain of them.

13:39.800 --> 13:44.300
Are all of them casualties of this battle?

13:45.720 --> 13:47.780
Don't look, Einar.

13:49.600 --> 13:50.890
Pater...

13:52.140 --> 13:53.130
Don't look.

13:53.790 --> 13:59.020
If you find Pater among the dead, 
you won't be able to remain calm.

14:32.340 --> 14:34.490
Very well. I'll see him.

14:35.130 --> 14:37.820
I'll respect the feelings of
 yourself and the men.

14:37.820 --> 14:39.240
Thank you.

14:40.960 --> 14:43.110
Messenger, approach.

15:13.380 --> 15:14.890
So you're still alive.

15:16.710 --> 15:19.560
It's been a while, Thorfinn.

15:22.720 --> 15:26.630
You must hate me for making you a slave...

15:28.640 --> 15:35.160
No... for what happened to Askeladd.

15:40.640 --> 15:46.120
I'm still alive after drawing 
a blade against Danish royalty.

15:47.320 --> 15:50.730
I appreciate the consideration you showed me.

15:52.600 --> 15:56.600
I'm sorry about the scar on your face.

15:57.770 --> 16:00.590
<i>He's the man who scarred His Majesty's face?</i>

16:01.400 --> 16:03.530
<i>Thorfinn Karlsefni...</i>

16:04.450 --> 16:08.480
<i>The man said to have been 
an even match for Thorkell in combat.</i>

16:09.320 --> 16:11.700
<i>I had no idea he was so small and young.</i>

16:13.260 --> 16:15.860
You drew a blade against the king?

16:19.000 --> 16:21.860
It's impossible to tell 
who you are with that face,

16:22.450 --> 16:25.050
but you seem to be the Thorfinn I know.

16:25.970 --> 16:30.100
You've come to say some commendable things.

16:33.010 --> 16:35.110
Four years, huh?

16:37.200 --> 16:40.900
It's already been four years since then.

16:42.360 --> 16:46.580
That's enough time for a person to change.

16:54.720 --> 16:58.100
Canute, I'd like you to leave the farm.

16:58.960 --> 17:00.200
I can't do that.

17:01.780 --> 17:04.280
Ketil's clan started this dispute.

17:05.250 --> 17:12.490
Ketil's son Olmar killed ten of my men because 
I wouldn't make him one of my thegns.

17:13.910 --> 17:15.240
I've heard about that.

17:15.770 --> 17:17.580
But you've made your point.

17:18.060 --> 17:21.010
More than 100 of the farm's men have died.

17:21.520 --> 17:27.020
This region may not be able to recover 
now that so many of its workers are dead.

17:28.920 --> 17:31.910
I advised them to surrender.

17:32.490 --> 17:36.150
It's Ketil's fault for miscalculating the
 difference in the strength of our forces.

17:36.870 --> 17:41.740
This battle cannot end until 
Ketil's clan has been dealt with.

17:43.760 --> 17:48.220
In other words, it won't end 
until you've captured this farm.

17:49.960 --> 17:52.330
Make all the excuses you want. 
You can't hide it.

17:52.800 --> 17:56.520
You call yourself a king, 
but you're actually just a thief.

17:57.380 --> 18:02.500
How are you any different 
from the average Viking chief?

18:04.000 --> 18:08.140
If you want a farm that badly, 
then start one yourself.

18:09.140 --> 18:13.510
Till the land, watch over it, 
and raise your own crops.

18:14.030 --> 18:16.490
Then you'll understand firsthand

18:17.220 --> 18:23.240
what a terrible thing it is to 
take that from someone else.

18:27.120 --> 18:28.260
Canute.

18:29.340 --> 18:33.130
You once told me at Gainsborough...

18:34.740 --> 18:37.030
that you'd build a paradise in this place.

18:37.860 --> 18:41.190
A utopia for those who suffer.

18:44.020 --> 18:47.160
Do you still believe that?

18:50.530 --> 18:51.960
A chief, huh?

18:53.370 --> 18:58.090
Indeed. I am the chief of Viking chiefs.

19:01.160 --> 19:03.060
I am the sovereign king...

19:03.610 --> 19:06.360
The most powerful Viking on the North Sea.

19:08.240 --> 19:11.450
The ruler of the largest territory 
in Northern Europe.

19:12.240 --> 19:16.260
The commander who leads a
 thousand ships and ten thousand men.

19:16.850 --> 19:21.550
My power exceeds human understanding 
and makes the impossible possible.

19:25.490 --> 19:26.420
Behold.

19:27.370 --> 19:30.690
With my power, I shall stop those waves.

19:34.450 --> 19:39.820
In the name of King Canute, 
waves, I command you to stop.

19:57.940 --> 20:02.200
Did you bear witness to my strength?

20:03.590 --> 20:06.810
I am powerless to stop 
even the approaching waves.

20:08.790 --> 20:12.730
Do you know who drives those waves?

20:20.560 --> 20:21.640
God does.

20:23.430 --> 20:30.280
Building a paradise on Earth 
means defying His logic.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.430
It's an act of rebellion against God.

20:35.170 --> 20:40.220
Humankind cannot find 
happiness under God's rule.

20:42.770 --> 20:44.010
Rebellion...

20:44.800 --> 20:46.940
Look at us, Thorfinn.

20:48.280 --> 20:50.310
Look at us Vikings.

20:51.220 --> 20:54.010
We're responsible for this 
chaos and destruction.

20:54.460 --> 20:56.300
We're fearsome raiders.

20:57.600 --> 21:01.620
Do you think we deserve to live in paradise?

21:02.820 --> 21:06.320
But that is what humans are.

21:06.980 --> 21:12.340
Committing sins as we wander lost 
is precisely what humans do.

21:14.020 --> 21:20.650
Unless I save these people abandoned by God, 
I'll never be able to build a paradise.

21:23.440 --> 21:26.470
Save the Vikings?

21:27.410 --> 21:28.340
Yes.

21:29.640 --> 21:37.980
I am the only one capable of conquering them, 
ruling them, unifying their strength,

21:37.980 --> 21:40.480
and directing them towards paradise.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.050
I need strength.

21:44.360 --> 21:50.790
I will unify the strength 
of all humankind to fight God.

21:57.880 --> 22:00.880
<i>Canute is an incredible man.</i>

22:01.800 --> 22:06.630
<i>It never even occurred to me 
to save the Vikings.</i>

22:08.680 --> 22:11.260
I'm gonna knock this guy on his ass.

22:11.780 --> 22:15.770
You're free to pursue 
whatever huge goals you want.

22:16.150 --> 22:21.610
But who's gonna save all the people 
you kill today for your goals?

22:22.450 --> 22:25.210
Will you let the Vikings live 
because they can help you,

22:25.210 --> 22:28.970
while killing and stealing from people 
who aren't useful to you?

22:29.720 --> 22:32.630
Building a paradise, my ass!

22:34.630 --> 22:41.670
King Ethelred burned down my village, 
and King Sweyn killed my family.

22:42.680 --> 22:46.380
I don't care what their ideals were.

22:48.310 --> 22:50.090
I've had enough.

22:50.570 --> 22:54.790
I refuse to suffer any more because of you.

23:01.760 --> 23:03.270
Hate me if you must.

23:03.970 --> 23:06.250
I won't seek your forgiveness.

23:07.810 --> 23:10.390
What did you say?

23:11.620 --> 23:13.020
Don't, Einar.

23:18.140 --> 23:20.660
Canute, I'll ask you again.

23:21.380 --> 23:23.960
You really have no intention
 of leaving this farm?

23:24.320 --> 23:28.710
No. I need Ketil's wealth for my undertaking.

23:31.610 --> 23:33.640
What will you do, Thorfinn?

23:34.440 --> 23:37.580
Will you kill me here?

23:40.780 --> 23:45.230
For you cannot stop me unless you kill me.

25:50.940 --> 25:55.070
<b>Two Paths</b>

25:50.940 --> 25:55.070
<b>Two Paths</b>

25:52.320 --> 25:53.940
"Two Paths."
