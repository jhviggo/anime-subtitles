WEBVTT

00:25.070 --> 00:27.010
Who is he? Where?

00:28.300 --> 00:30.130
Which one? That guy?

00:31.960 --> 00:37.760
<b>For Lost Love</b>

00:31.960 --> 00:37.760
<b>For Lost Love</b>

00:31.970 --> 00:35.500
Oh, him? The one lying 
facedown on the table?

00:35.930 --> 00:38.920
That's right. That youngster.

00:38.920 --> 00:41.180
Okay, okay. I see.

00:41.180 --> 00:43.780
He looks like someone who'd do that.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.950
He's the guy who lost to a pig.

00:48.100 --> 00:50.820
Guys like him really do exist.

00:50.820 --> 00:55.230
I'm amazed he had the balls to say 
he wanted to join the king's guard.

00:57.110 --> 00:58.740
So, what did you want?

00:58.740 --> 01:02.360
All we have to do is 
tell him he's been rejected?

01:02.360 --> 01:05.000
That's right. All you need to do 
is convey the message.

01:06.510 --> 01:08.370
Fine, I guess.

01:09.370 --> 01:10.380
Aw, damn.

01:10.980 --> 01:14.140
I'm not sure I can keep myself 
from doing more.

01:15.250 --> 01:16.760
You want to mock him?

01:17.190 --> 01:19.750
I mean, just look at his stupid face.

01:23.180 --> 01:26.800
Go on. I'll buy you drinks later.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.100
Okay.

01:28.660 --> 01:30.170
Quit laughing so much.

01:30.170 --> 01:31.690
Yeah, but...

01:48.910 --> 01:52.930
You lot look just as stupid as he does.

03:32.110 --> 03:33.510
Olmar?

03:35.750 --> 03:38.820
Olmar, do you have a minute?

03:44.450 --> 03:46.520
My name is Brodd.

03:46.520 --> 03:48.780
I'm a member of the king's guard.

03:51.180 --> 03:52.370
And?

03:52.760 --> 03:58.380
I've brought a message from Wulf, 
captain of His Majesty's guard.

03:58.640 --> 04:00.530
You're here to tell me I've been rejected.

04:01.340 --> 04:04.560
Now, now. I'm here on a job.

04:04.560 --> 04:06.870
Allow me to deliver my message.

04:10.940 --> 04:17.330
Olmar, regarding your request 
to join the king's guard,

04:17.720 --> 04:20.740
the captain spoke highly 
of your determination

04:20.740 --> 04:24.780
to offer your life in service of His Majesty.

04:26.340 --> 04:31.540
However, upon seeing your skill with a sword,

04:32.340 --> 04:35.530
he remarked that your skills 
"need improvement."

04:38.030 --> 04:42.910
Therefore, we regret to inform you that...

04:44.170 --> 04:47.460
Regret to inform you that...

04:57.650 --> 05:01.820
Th-There's nothing regrettable about it. 
You lost to a pig!

05:04.030 --> 05:06.600
Don't say that.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.230
I-I can't breathe.

05:09.700 --> 05:13.890
I heard... I heard you
 couldn't even cut a <i>pig</i>.

05:13.890 --> 05:19.080
Why not? Was the pig wearing 
chain mail? A hauberk perhaps?

05:19.530 --> 05:22.870
Oh, but on a pig, 
I guess you'd call it a <i>hog</i>berk.

05:31.860 --> 05:35.600
Forgive me. I shouldn't laugh.

05:36.090 --> 05:39.310
He failed to get a job.

05:39.310 --> 05:42.980
Do you guys know anyone who's hiring?

05:43.580 --> 05:47.610
Come to think of it, 
the castle was looking for a new cook.

05:47.960 --> 05:51.250
That won't work. He can't chop up pigs!

06:00.880 --> 06:02.130
I'm dying!

06:16.110 --> 06:20.020
A warrior answers insults with his sword!

06:20.450 --> 06:21.710
Draw your weapon!

06:28.680 --> 06:31.000
But you couldn't even cut a pig.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.500
I'm dying! I'm gonna die laughing!

06:37.080 --> 06:37.580
Whoa!

06:38.430 --> 06:40.070
What's your problem?

06:40.510 --> 06:44.350
You'll hurt someone doing that, you weakling.

06:50.230 --> 06:51.460
Come on, let's go.

06:51.460 --> 06:52.250
Wait for me.

06:52.250 --> 06:53.340
It's a fight!

06:53.340 --> 06:55.600
There's a five-on-one 
happening by the stalls!

06:55.900 --> 06:57.490
They've got swords!

06:57.490 --> 07:00.020
Someone's gonna bleed!

07:01.000 --> 07:01.760
Get him!

07:01.760 --> 07:03.110
Kill him!

07:03.380 --> 07:05.290
You've got this, young one!

07:05.290 --> 07:07.000
I'll take him on myself.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.610
We'd dishonor ourselves as warriors if we 
ganged up on a guy who can't even cut a pig.

07:12.660 --> 07:13.910
You'd better not lose.

07:15.610 --> 07:18.810
Look at you, all excited to fight.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.700
I'll help you train, Olmar.

07:30.610 --> 07:33.010
Come on, stand up. You can do it.

07:42.530 --> 07:45.550
He's as pathetic as I was told.

08:06.870 --> 08:08.430
Stand up, Olmar.

08:09.190 --> 08:11.510
Don't lie on the ground during a duel.

08:18.020 --> 08:19.110
Thorgil...

08:21.020 --> 08:25.790
Thorgil, they... they humiliated me.

08:26.780 --> 08:28.370
I know. I can see that.

08:28.870 --> 08:31.490
Get back on your feet and kill him.

08:41.500 --> 08:42.430
Stand up.

08:50.690 --> 08:52.890
Stand up, Olmar!

09:00.700 --> 09:03.610
Th-Thorgil, I...

09:04.340 --> 09:05.930
Listen to me, Olmar.

09:06.530 --> 09:09.820
There are only two options for a 
warrior who has been insulted.

09:10.530 --> 09:12.510
Kill or die.

09:13.050 --> 09:14.950
If you can't kill him, then you'll die here.

09:17.550 --> 09:22.810
I won't allow you to go on living 
without addressing this insult.

09:24.390 --> 09:26.490
Fight and become a man.

09:27.060 --> 09:29.380
Today is the day.

09:30.730 --> 09:31.840
Thor...

09:31.840 --> 09:32.860
Go on.

09:36.940 --> 09:38.340
What the hell was that?

09:39.820 --> 09:41.900
Imagine it, Olmar.

09:41.900 --> 09:44.730
Imagine the moment you 
cut off your enemy's head.

09:44.730 --> 09:46.730
Y-Yeah...

09:47.210 --> 09:50.030
Let me hear you. Say it from your stomach.

09:50.860 --> 09:51.730
Yeah.

09:51.730 --> 09:52.700
Louder.

09:52.700 --> 09:53.730
Yeah!

09:54.380 --> 09:55.840
Imagine it.

09:55.840 --> 09:59.990
Imagine your enemy crying with remorse in a 
pool of blood with his guts strewn about him.

10:00.320 --> 10:01.620
Yeah!

10:01.930 --> 10:04.120
Show some spirit, Olmar!

10:04.120 --> 10:05.330
Yeah!

10:05.330 --> 10:08.000
Kill the bastard! Kill him!

10:08.000 --> 10:08.940
Yeah!

10:08.940 --> 10:10.980
Go!

10:14.640 --> 10:18.590
Uh-oh. Provoke him, and all of 
a sudden, he's raring to go.

10:23.020 --> 10:25.670
The time for practice is over.

11:03.730 --> 11:04.730
Seriously?

11:06.060 --> 11:06.820
Hey!

11:07.350 --> 11:08.680
You bastard!

11:09.170 --> 11:10.800
Don't let him escape alive.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.420
We'll reclaim our honor here and now.

11:13.420 --> 11:14.320
Yeah.

11:15.740 --> 11:19.690
Well done, Olmar. That's my little brother.

11:22.820 --> 11:24.540
Leave the rest to me.

11:41.510 --> 11:43.340
He's dead...

11:45.870 --> 11:47.310
Did <i>I</i> kill him?

12:08.740 --> 12:11.930
I killed a man...

12:31.310 --> 12:32.250
So it was his eye.

12:33.650 --> 12:36.100
It was damaged by a rock or something.

12:38.380 --> 12:40.360
Olmar! Thorgil!

12:40.900 --> 12:43.250
Move. Get out of the way.

12:48.660 --> 12:52.310
Wh-Wh-What is this?

12:53.370 --> 12:54.710
What happened?

12:58.300 --> 12:59.500
Y-You...

13:05.420 --> 13:07.390
Calm down, Dad.

13:08.020 --> 13:10.640
Calm down? You want me to calm down?

13:10.900 --> 13:14.750
You... You killed the king's men!

13:15.190 --> 13:18.360
What are you going to do about this?

13:18.810 --> 13:20.610
We did nothing wrong.

13:20.860 --> 13:21.930
What?

13:21.930 --> 13:24.570
Olmar was insulted, so he fought a duel.

13:24.570 --> 13:25.940
He defended his honor.

13:25.940 --> 13:26.860
But...

13:27.160 --> 13:28.620
There were five of them.

13:28.620 --> 13:32.200
No one could object to me joining the fight.

13:32.770 --> 13:35.430
You're his father. 
You should be praising him.

13:39.490 --> 13:42.590
Duels are forbidden by law!

13:43.050 --> 13:46.470
Nobody cares about that law.

13:46.930 --> 13:53.350
They had swords. They must've known 
insulting him would be costly.

13:54.290 --> 13:56.580
They knew that, and insulted him regardless.

13:56.580 --> 13:59.350
The churls deserved to die.

14:02.880 --> 14:05.190
Move. Clear the way.

14:04.610 --> 14:05.860
Hey, what's going on?

14:06.600 --> 14:08.420
It's... It's the guards.

14:08.420 --> 14:11.970
We did nothing wrong. 
Duels happen all the time.

14:11.970 --> 14:14.090
Normally we wouldn't be punished.

14:18.460 --> 14:24.070
Who dared to start a commotion 
just outside His Majesty's castle?

14:25.570 --> 14:28.430
Step forward and present yourselves.

14:31.010 --> 14:34.260
What's going on here? Olmar is alive.

14:34.770 --> 14:38.080
Ketil's here, too. Who's the other one?

14:38.080 --> 14:41.910
I don't know. Probably a family member.

14:43.950 --> 14:47.890
I am Thorgil, son of Ketil, 
member of the king's guard.

14:48.320 --> 14:51.260
This is my father, Ketil, 
and my younger brother, Olmar.

14:52.070 --> 14:53.780
This was a fair duel.

14:54.510 --> 14:56.340
We have done nothing wrong.

14:57.450 --> 15:01.540
Silence. The king has forbidden duels.

15:03.390 --> 15:09.230
You've disrespected the king. 
You're all under arrest.

15:10.080 --> 15:11.890
I-I knew it.

15:11.890 --> 15:14.710
See? I told you so, Thorgil!

15:20.210 --> 15:21.850
Come on, hands behind your back.

15:21.850 --> 15:22.900
Stop resisting.

15:23.280 --> 15:25.860
W-W-Wait a minute. I didn'tâ€”

15:27.140 --> 15:29.790
Hand over your sword and 
put your hands behind your back.

15:32.130 --> 15:33.780
Hey, are you deaf?

15:46.210 --> 15:47.350
What?

15:48.900 --> 15:50.970
You... You asshole!

16:23.460 --> 16:24.960
Bastard!

16:39.140 --> 16:42.350
H-Have you actually lost 
your mind this time, Thorgil?

16:42.730 --> 16:45.850
It's over. There's no coming back from this.

16:49.500 --> 16:52.860
There's something I want to ask you.

16:54.820 --> 16:58.890
I'm not a patient man. 
Be careful how you answer my question.

16:59.530 --> 17:01.110
If you tell me, I'll spare your life.

17:03.030 --> 17:05.340
Why did you allow Olmar to win?

17:06.510 --> 17:07.180
What?

17:07.890 --> 17:10.060
They... let me win?

17:11.050 --> 17:12.030
Tell me.

17:12.030 --> 17:13.510
I-I don't knowâ€”

17:21.770 --> 17:23.730
You should heed people's warnings.

17:24.860 --> 17:28.310
Tell me. Why did you set up Olmar?

17:30.850 --> 17:37.330
To... To arrest Ketil.

17:38.410 --> 17:46.250
We had Olmar kill the king's men 
so Ketil would be held responsible

17:47.060 --> 17:50.050
for his son's disrespect to the king.

17:53.490 --> 17:57.570
Wh-What did I do to deserve that?

17:58.770 --> 18:03.470
I-I simply followed Captain Wulf's orders.

18:04.270 --> 18:06.850
Please, let me tend to my wounds.

18:07.130 --> 18:11.060
The blood... It won't stop!

18:12.710 --> 18:16.370
It's over. King Canute 
has set his sights on us.

18:20.330 --> 18:22.140
No, Dad.

18:24.310 --> 18:25.620
Thorgil...

18:27.010 --> 18:29.370
This is the beginning.

18:30.050 --> 18:32.030
Our enemy is strong.

18:53.850 --> 18:57.980
I see. So Ketil's family escaped.

18:58.590 --> 19:01.410
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

19:02.470 --> 19:06.220
I sent men to secure their ships and
 lodgings, but they haven't been found.

19:06.930 --> 19:08.660
We're currently searching for them.

19:09.330 --> 19:13.550
It's my fault that we failed to capture Thorgil.

19:15.510 --> 19:17.800
He sounds like a skilled warrior.

19:18.300 --> 19:20.570
Yes. He was a good subordinate.

19:22.430 --> 19:24.150
It doesn't affect our plans.

19:24.640 --> 19:27.130
We have our excuse to punish them.

19:27.760 --> 19:30.680
As planned, we'll head to Ketil's farm.

19:31.660 --> 19:34.150
If Ketil isn't there, then that's fine.

19:34.570 --> 19:38.400
If he is and resists us, 
then we'll simply overwhelm him.

19:38.400 --> 19:43.350
Yes, Your Majesty. 
I'll mobilize 32 of your guard.

19:44.130 --> 19:49.580
With 70 of Floki's Jomsvikings, 
we'll have 102 men altogether.

19:50.510 --> 19:53.970
That should be enough. 
When will Floki arrive?

19:54.620 --> 19:57.180
Within three days, from Jomsborg.

19:59.130 --> 20:02.510
Then we'll leave at dawn three days from now.

20:03.300 --> 20:04.060
Leave me.

20:04.800 --> 20:05.550
Yes, Your Majesty.

20:30.950 --> 20:33.860
What are you laughing about, King Sweyn?

20:34.990 --> 20:37.340
Don't be so angry.

20:37.760 --> 20:45.230
Why shouldn't a father be pleased 
his son is beginning to resemble himself?

20:52.150 --> 20:54.350
Keep going.

20:55.700 --> 21:03.290
You'll need to pile up plenty of
 bodies to reach the top.

21:18.860 --> 21:24.140
All right, gentlemen. You can come out now.

21:30.150 --> 21:32.140
These barrels reek of salt.

21:34.070 --> 21:38.700
You saved us, Leif. 
I appreciate your kindness.

21:39.300 --> 21:41.810
This isn't an act of kindness. It's a deal.

21:42.350 --> 21:44.900
Don't forget the promise you made me.

21:45.470 --> 21:50.910
I wouldn't smuggle criminals 
out of mere kindness.

21:46.790 --> 21:48.210
Boy, that stinks.

21:51.240 --> 21:55.550
Do you have any idea how difficult 
it was to convince my men?

21:56.780 --> 22:00.210
Don't worry. A warrior 
never goes back on his word.

22:00.780 --> 22:06.340
Ketil's farm will buy all your 
cargo for triple its value.

22:07.300 --> 22:09.390
Don't forget about Thorfinn, too.

22:09.740 --> 22:13.180
Of course. You can have the slave, too.

22:13.830 --> 22:15.520
Right, Dad?

22:19.710 --> 22:21.900
Dad, you can come out now.

22:21.900 --> 22:23.800
Shut up!

22:23.800 --> 22:27.400
Don't talk to me. Leave me alone.

22:28.070 --> 22:29.990
He's in a bad mood.

22:30.740 --> 22:33.820
Don't forget our promise.

23:05.990 --> 23:09.140
All right. That's enough for today.

23:09.690 --> 23:11.850
Yeah.

23:11.850 --> 23:13.270
Good work today.

23:28.550 --> 23:29.970
What's the matter, Thorfinn?

23:30.740 --> 23:33.010
Is the sunset that captivating?

23:36.950 --> 23:37.820
No...

23:44.330 --> 23:46.630
Mock me if you wish.

23:47.930 --> 23:50.220
Curse me if you must.

23:52.450 --> 23:55.950
I do all of this to create my utopia.

24:00.940 --> 24:05.450
All for lost love.

25:51.650 --> 25:55.030
<b>Dark Clouds</b>

25:51.650 --> 25:55.030
<b>Dark Clouds</b>

25:52.970 --> 25:54.180
"Dark Clouds."
