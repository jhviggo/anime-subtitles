<i>Carve it.</i>

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.140
<i>Carve it into your flesh.</i>

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.440
<i>Carve it into the land.</i>

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.740
<i>Carve it into the sea.</i>

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.250
<i>Carve it into your enemies.</i>

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.750
<i>Carve it into your spoils.</i>

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.130
<i>Carve it.</i>

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.760
<i>Carve it.</i>

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.240
<i>Carve that warmth into me.</i>

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.220
<b>Slave</b>

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.220
<b>Slave</b>

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.330
Einar!

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.430
What are you doing?

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.440
I could ask you the same thing!

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.440
Why're you attackin' that tree?

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.940
You tryna crush the house?

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.740
Are you gonna be a woodcutter, Einar?

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.040
No.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.800
I'm training for battle.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.200
Behold my power.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.030
You're a big lad, 
but you'd be useless in battle.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.530
Get ready for lunch.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.080
I'm so hungry...

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.220
You don't have to throw a knife at me.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.750
You're holding dishes and spoons.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.260
You wouldn't mind a dish?

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.490
They say bears have to 
eat lots before winter.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.640
Huh.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.770
So, why are you trainin' again all of a sudden?

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:21.690
Thankya.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.440
Well, because I gotta protect this place.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.580
After it was all burnt to ashes, 
it's finally been rebuilt.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.820
I'm not letting that happen again.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.390
I'm sure Dad would—

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.140
Mister Guthmur's milk is so good.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.140
Right? That man knows his way around a teat.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.400
What are you doin' 
with your hands? It's so creepy.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.330
Hey, listen to me.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.130
Gross!

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.060
Don't bother.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.860
Don't poke your nose into warrior stuff.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.340
Doesn't it frustrate you, 
always being on the losing side?

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.960
Dad died protecting us.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.080
That's right.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.000
And you're alive.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.630
You've rebuilt this village,

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.360
and you're eating a delicious meal 
with two beautiful ladies.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.330
We haven't lost at all.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.150
Hey.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.610
Hey, how are you?

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.580
Hurry up.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.380
Listen closely. Once we enter 
the woods, I want you to run.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.390
Follow the river, and...

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.270
Lotta.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.530
Mom.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.910
Don't think. Just run straight ahead.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.580
Your brother and I will be with you.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.730
Mom!

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:25.820
You ready? Let's get you up.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:30.010
Mom!

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:44.990
Einar, run. Leave me.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.910
I'm not...

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:49.920
Come on. Stand, damn it.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.070
Mom?

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.890
Mom!

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.220
Mom...

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.650
Silly girl...

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:12.160
There are still people over there.

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:15.080
Hey, they've got women, too!

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.100
We're on our way, girls!

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:30.700
Stand up, Einar.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.520
Take Lotta and go. Hurry!

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.530
Mom...

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:44.630
Even a dying old hag can still manage.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.880
Live.

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:55.080
As long as you're alive, you can...

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.560
Ei...nar...

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.120
Lotta...

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:32.810
Why aren't they running?

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:35.470
Hey, she's pretty cute.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.630
Your mom's dead, isn't she?

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:41.100
Lotta!

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.350
Let go! Einar!

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:44.100
Lotta!

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.120
Let go of her!

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.680
Einar!

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:52.540
How dare you!

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:56.170
Einar! Einar!

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.410
You'll pay for—

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.300
What the hell are you doing?

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.350
She freakin' stabbed me!

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:25.470
Aw, man. What a waste.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:26.780
Nothing we can do about it.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.480
Let's sell the kid for beer money.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:31.610
You're such a dumbass.

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:33.340
I'm sorry, okay?

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.010
Come on. Let's go, beer money.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:45.260
<b>A fir on a barren land withers

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:45.260
<b>— Hávamál</b>

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.260
How is she?

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.030
She's not gonna make it.

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:33.240
Shit. Fine, let's move her.

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:47.370
Heave-ho!

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:50.700
Hey!

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.260
Hey, what the hell was that for?

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.930
You didn't need to throw her overboard!

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.060
All right, you're not swollen.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.020
We're handing out blankets.

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:19.340
Keep yourselves warm.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.640
We paid a fortune for you lot.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.650
Don't go getting sick without our say so.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:29.450
At the very least, stay healthy 
until we find a buyer for you.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:30.500
Got it?

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.180
Come on, hurry up!

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:36.660
Take in that sail!

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:07.880
<i>That's right. I have to live.</i>

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:22.430
Don't skip the liquor. 
It'll improve your color.

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:26.590
Clean every nook and cranny, 
especially your heads.

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:29.110
Check each other for lice.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.120
How's this?

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:38.910
Hair's good.

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:41.480
Could you do her makeup 
so she looks a little younger?

00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:59.740
Well? Pretty good selection 
this time, don't you think?

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:02.290
All second-rate crap.

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:03.840
There you go again.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.780
You won't find anything better than ours!

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:12.150
<i>That's right. I can't stay there.</i>

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.740
<i>I'll run away. 
As long as I survive, I can try again.</i>

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:41.060
Hup...

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.190
Thief!

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.340
Sorry!

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:55.760
Hey, Einar.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.270
You still don't get it.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.810
Listen closely, slaves.

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:14.620
Your homes are far, far away.

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:17.150
No matter how much you struggle, 
you're never getting back to them.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:22.000
And naturally, 
nobody's gonna help you escape.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:28.730
Because you're outsiders 
and penniless slaves.

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:32.920
Find a good master 
and serve him as best you can.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:37.680
You'll eat way better than if you 
run away and end up a beggar.

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:41.930
Before you go running off on adventures, 
think real hard about which is better.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.270
You got that, Einar?

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:05.060
I have to live...

00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:20.880
Well, he's not bad, but have you 
got any boys with a cuter face?

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.470
Ah, I see.

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:26.190
In that case, we've got some 
special products for you to look at.

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:29.230
Oh, really? How exciting.

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:32.170
I'm sure you'll find them satisfactory.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.290
<i>They're right.</i>

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:44.220
<i>Even if I blindly ran away, 
I wouldn't know where I was going.</i>

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:46.900
<i>And besides...</i>

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:55.320
<i>I don't have anywhere to go back to.</i>

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:02.310
<i>As long as I obediently serve 
some master somewhere...</i>

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:08.280
I'm telling you, you sure are lucky.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.520
We just got a huge batch in.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.860
Look, that's him.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:16.490
Isn't he the one you're looking for?

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:45.470
He looks nothing like him!

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:47.770
He's not blond <i>or</i> small!

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:51.060
Huh? Now that I get a better look, 
I guess that's not him.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.080
That aside, what do you think?

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.560
He's strong and tough. If you buy him now—

00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:00.950
I told you, I'm not here to buy a worker.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:04.030
All I want is to free my relative.

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:07.450
I'm certain he came to this town.

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:09.770
Blond and small...

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:11.240
His name is Thorfinn.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.340
You really have no idea where he is?

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:23.310
I'm sorry.

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:27.400
And sorry to have bothered you.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.440
No problem. Come again soon.

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:34.740
He's never gonna find him.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:42.250
<i>So he's walking around 
looking for his relative.</i>

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:50.340
<i>Whoever he's looking for is one lucky guy.</i>

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.490
You there.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.730
Can you speak? Let me see your teeth.

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:19.500
What's your name?

00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:21.760
Einar.

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.140
Where are you from? What did you do before?

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:26.800
I was a farmer in Northern England.

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:28.680
Oh?

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.000
What do you say, Einar?

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.420
Would you like to help out on my farm?

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.900
A farm...

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:16.330
Einar, over here.

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:22.910
All of my people are at work now.

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:25.900
I'll introduce you to them at dinner.

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:26.920
Yes, sir.

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:31.080
But first, take a look at my farm.

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:07.110
<i>Hey, Mom. Was that really true?</i>

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:14.730
<i>Live or die, I'll never be free again.</i>

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:21.180
<i>You still think I haven't lost?</i>

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.980
<i>My family was taken from me.</i>

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:50.940
<i>I lost my home. I lost everything.</i>

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:56.810
<i>I didn't even know 
what the point of living was anymore.</i>

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:09.320
Thorfinn, it's me. Come here.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:30.780
<i>"I'll be bought by a good master 
and do my best to serve him."</i>

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:36.040
<i>"As long as I'm an obedient slave, 
I won't starve."</i>

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:40.700
<i>I was beginning to think that way.</i>

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.620
Thorfinn...

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:55.990
<i>That was...</i>

00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:03.100
<i>how Thorfinn and I met.</i>

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.990
