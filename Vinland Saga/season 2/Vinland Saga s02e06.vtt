01:48.830 --> 01:55.590
<b>We Need a Horse</b>

01:48.830 --> 01:55.590
<b>We Need a Horse</b>

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
Come on, you bastard!

02:34.410 --> 02:36.630
Einar! Einar, stop.

02:37.910 --> 02:40.380
Let's dig it out a little more 
and cut the roots.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.650
We won't get it out like this.

02:48.210 --> 02:50.020
Piece of shit!

02:50.440 --> 02:51.700
It still won't budge.

03:02.020 --> 03:03.780
Come on!

03:13.750 --> 03:18.020
We need a horse. We won't get 
anywhere without a horse.

03:19.470 --> 03:25.230
They lent us one to move the lumber, 
so why don't we have one to prepare the soil?

03:25.230 --> 03:26.870
It doesn't make sense.

03:27.630 --> 03:29.570
They didn't lend us a horse.

03:30.060 --> 03:33.520
The retainers just made us 
do their job for them.

03:35.080 --> 03:36.800
What do you want to do, Einar?

03:36.800 --> 03:40.280
Should we save preparing the fields for
 later and chop down more trees first?

03:42.650 --> 03:46.260
No, I'll try talking to them again.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.060
It might be a waste of time, though.

03:49.750 --> 03:52.040
You guys don't know when to quit.

03:52.040 --> 03:54.250
No means no.

03:54.710 --> 03:58.550
But we have Pater's permission.

03:58.990 --> 04:00.450
Pater?

04:01.130 --> 04:02.930
You mean the former slave?

04:02.930 --> 04:04.600
In any case, no.

04:04.600 --> 04:07.180
We're using all the horses for other work.

04:07.180 --> 04:09.240
We don't have any to spare for you.

04:12.180 --> 04:15.610
Come on, slaves. You're wasting your time.

04:15.610 --> 04:18.250
Quit slacking off and 
head back to your woods.

04:18.690 --> 04:19.380
Hello.

04:20.880 --> 04:24.940
What's this? I only heard one "hello."

04:24.940 --> 04:28.430
I see the big lad is as rude as ever.

04:28.910 --> 04:31.690
Hey, we're taking a horse.

04:31.690 --> 04:32.790
Sure.

04:36.320 --> 04:41.670
Now that I think about it, 
you slaves are no different from livestock.

04:42.820 --> 04:48.050
Just borrowing a plot of land and
 running a farm is insolent enough.

04:50.730 --> 04:53.640
Use your own bodies to do the work.

04:57.900 --> 05:02.240
That jerk. Our only choice
 is to talk to the master.

05:02.240 --> 05:04.190
We need a horse.

05:04.190 --> 05:07.140
Not just for removing stumps, 
but for tilling the soil, too.

05:07.660 --> 05:10.920
I'm not gonna let their bullying stop me.

05:11.910 --> 05:16.190
But even if the master's influence 
allows us to borrow a horse,

05:16.190 --> 05:18.440
we'd just be upsetting the retainers.

05:18.940 --> 05:21.050
They'll hate us even more.

05:21.530 --> 05:25.160
What are we gonna do, then? 
Do all the work ourselves?

05:25.160 --> 05:29.060
Who knows how many years it'll
 take for us to finally start farming?

05:29.760 --> 05:31.790
The woods are vast.

05:31.790 --> 05:35.450
Couldn't we wait to start farming 
until we've cleared more land?

05:35.950 --> 05:38.500
It's impossible for us to level 
the land and start growing crops.

05:43.170 --> 05:44.040
Thorfinn!

05:44.570 --> 05:47.980
Why are you so unmotivated?

05:47.980 --> 05:49.820
Don't you want to be free?

05:50.240 --> 05:52.990
We're gonna grow crops, no matter what.

05:52.990 --> 05:57.000
Then we'll sell them to the master 
and buy back our freedom.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.600
And to do that, we need a horse!

06:03.130 --> 06:07.360
For a guy who never eats a square meal,
 you've sure got a lot of energy.

06:07.360 --> 06:10.810
<i>You</i> just don't have enough energy, asshole!

06:12.050 --> 06:14.520
I think I get the picture.

06:19.030 --> 06:24.930
Hup, and... Ow, ow, ow...

06:30.530 --> 06:33.530
What are you doing? Over here. Come on.

06:33.930 --> 06:36.180
Can't have a conversation 
standing this far apart.

06:38.280 --> 06:39.940
Don't step on the ridges.

06:46.550 --> 06:50.920
Hello. Um, can we help you?

06:50.920 --> 06:52.330
What are your names?

06:52.330 --> 06:54.860
Oh, right. I'm Einar.

06:54.860 --> 06:56.010
I'm Thorfinn.

06:56.620 --> 06:57.980
Shall I lend you one?

06:57.980 --> 06:58.760
What?

06:59.310 --> 07:02.440
A horse. You need a horse, don't you?

07:03.480 --> 07:04.280
What?

07:07.050 --> 07:09.130
Y-Yes, we need a horse!

07:09.130 --> 07:11.280
Wait, for real?

07:11.280 --> 07:15.400
That'd be a huge help.

07:16.120 --> 07:17.830
Uh, actually...

07:18.170 --> 07:22.520
I'm sorry, but who are you?

07:36.970 --> 07:38.850
My back is killing me.

07:46.730 --> 07:50.360
Uh, um... Gramps?

07:50.830 --> 07:52.460
It's Sverkel.

07:52.460 --> 07:54.620
Mister Sverkel to you.

07:55.380 --> 07:59.750
Mister Sverkel, how long do we have 
to keep picking out these rocks?

07:59.750 --> 08:02.500
Until the rocks are gone.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.990
Come on. I don't see your hands moving.

08:04.990 --> 08:06.560
Oh, s-sorry.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.010
Ow...

08:10.010 --> 08:11.240
Ow...

08:11.240 --> 08:12.890
Good.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.510
So, um, Mister Sverkel!

08:16.840 --> 08:20.080
About you lending us a horse...

08:20.080 --> 08:21.690
Carry the basket, would you?

08:29.230 --> 08:32.200
Once you're done chopping firewood, 
draw up some water.

08:32.200 --> 08:33.290
Be quick.

08:33.290 --> 08:34.520
Yes, sir.

08:40.140 --> 08:42.680
He's totally taking advantage of us.

08:42.680 --> 08:44.960
We don't have time for this.

08:45.910 --> 08:50.460
Does that old man live 
in this house all alone?

08:52.440 --> 08:55.840
Who knows? I've never met him before, either.

08:56.770 --> 08:59.400
Is he really going to lend us a horse?

08:59.400 --> 09:04.040
What if he's just making us 
work for him for free?

09:04.920 --> 09:07.850
Either way, this is a typical day for us.

09:08.420 --> 09:10.340
After all, we're slaves.

09:10.860 --> 09:13.090
We're the <i>master's</i> slaves.

09:13.610 --> 09:16.740
I don't care what your circumstances are.

09:17.070 --> 09:18.960
This is our agreement.

09:18.960 --> 09:23.000
In exchange for borrowing a horse, 
you'll do chores at my house

09:23.370 --> 09:26.750
when you pick it up and when you drop it off.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.900
Got it?

09:39.040 --> 09:42.140
All right. Let's get the next one.

09:42.570 --> 09:44.540
Pull!

09:45.520 --> 09:47.400
Boy, that was easy.

09:47.400 --> 09:48.900
I feel amazing.

09:49.480 --> 09:51.950
I can't believe he actually 
let us borrow a horse.

09:51.950 --> 09:53.900
That old man is a good guy.

10:00.090 --> 10:01.780
Hup!

10:10.630 --> 10:12.300
Come on, you can do it.

10:12.300 --> 10:13.640
That's it. Just like that.

10:13.640 --> 10:15.060
You're such a cute horsey.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.580
All right.

10:19.580 --> 10:21.830
Next stump.

10:58.650 --> 11:03.080
At this rate, we might actually be ready 
in time for sowing season in the fall.

11:06.210 --> 11:09.180
Maybe the old man will even lend us a plow.

11:09.180 --> 11:12.170
I hope he'll lend us a heavy one with wheels.

11:12.970 --> 11:15.230
What do we plant in fall?

11:15.230 --> 11:16.230
What?

11:17.770 --> 11:20.630
Wheat, obviously.

11:21.220 --> 11:24.740
Really? You plant wheat in the fall, huh?

11:25.800 --> 11:27.490
What?

11:27.790 --> 11:33.050
Hey, hey, wait a minute.
 Have you ever worked on a farm before?

11:33.050 --> 11:34.250
No.

11:35.320 --> 11:38.440
Nobody in my homeland farmed.

11:39.120 --> 11:42.100
And since I was a kid, 
I worked on the battlefield.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.510
A land without farms...

11:47.000 --> 11:48.660
I don't believe it.

11:53.690 --> 11:57.000
My mom and sister 
would be shocked to hear that.

12:01.400 --> 12:05.200
Well, don't worry. 
Leave all the farming stuff to me.

12:05.200 --> 12:07.760
After all, I'm a professional.

12:07.760 --> 12:08.580
Sure.

12:09.330 --> 12:11.160
Hey, slaves.

12:11.630 --> 12:15.670
Who gave you permission to take that horse?

12:16.420 --> 12:18.590
Ugh, these guys...

12:18.590 --> 12:19.670
Hello.

12:20.320 --> 12:24.160
We didn't take this without permission.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.300
Mister Sverkel lent it to us.

12:26.300 --> 12:28.620
What? Who?

12:28.620 --> 12:33.190
Mister Sverkel. He lives way down this road.

12:33.500 --> 12:37.900
Liar! There's no Sverkel around here.

12:37.900 --> 12:40.510
So you finally resorted to theft.

12:40.510 --> 12:45.240
Huh? Does our farm have a horse like this?

12:45.240 --> 12:48.160
Hey, slaves. Who'd you say 
you borrowed this horse from?

12:48.540 --> 12:53.480
I told you, Mister Sverkel!

12:53.480 --> 12:55.020
You don't know him?

12:55.020 --> 12:57.630
He's a short bald old man.

12:58.180 --> 13:02.280
Short... bald... old man...

13:02.280 --> 13:05.110
Oh, the old master.

13:05.110 --> 13:08.760
Oh, right. Come to think of it, 
that might've been his name.

13:09.320 --> 13:11.640
The <i>old</i> master?

13:12.060 --> 13:14.020
You're actually lying, aren't you?

13:14.820 --> 13:17.260
He's a real crabby old man.

13:17.260 --> 13:19.380
There's no way he lent you a horse.

13:21.450 --> 13:23.880
He's Ketil's father.

13:24.760 --> 13:28.340
He's the most important man on this farm.

13:40.360 --> 13:42.460
Looks like rain.

13:43.350 --> 13:47.220
Thorfinn, let's stop for the day 
once we finish this row.

13:47.610 --> 13:48.520
Got it.

13:50.120 --> 13:52.170
Stop, stop.

13:54.300 --> 13:56.190
More roots.

13:56.190 --> 14:00.070
Even though we pulled out the stumps, 
the deepest roots still got left behind.

14:03.060 --> 14:04.410
We don't have a choice.

14:04.410 --> 14:06.620
This year, we'll till shallowly.

14:06.620 --> 14:09.730
We wouldn't want to break the plow 
we borrowed by overdoing it.

14:15.490 --> 14:16.810
It's amazing.

14:17.670 --> 14:19.990
In one day, we've turned 
that wasteland into this.

14:24.070 --> 14:26.170
Look. There's one over there.

14:27.320 --> 14:28.340
And there.

14:29.300 --> 14:32.050
And there. Look, they've got two.

14:32.050 --> 14:37.350
They've got a total of ten heavy plows 
after buying four more this year.

14:37.850 --> 14:40.420
Our master is unbelievably wealthy.

14:41.450 --> 14:43.370
Are they that expensive?

14:43.370 --> 14:45.180
You bet they are.

14:45.180 --> 14:48.620
Back in my village, 
eight families shared a single plow.

14:49.390 --> 14:52.800
I'm glad the old master had one.

14:52.800 --> 14:56.750
The retainers definitely wouldn't 
have let us borrow one.

14:57.320 --> 15:02.030
It must be difficult to do the 
same work by hand, with hoes.

15:02.030 --> 15:06.610
Having one of these and a horse
makes a world of difference.

15:08.710 --> 15:10.570
What an incredible invention...

15:11.000 --> 15:13.590
It must've been invented by a farmer.

15:14.340 --> 15:18.980
Someone unfamiliar with how difficult 
farming is couldn't have made this.

15:21.080 --> 15:24.520
You really don't know the
 first thing about farming.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.480
Everything's new to you.

15:26.480 --> 15:29.090
You're like an overgrown baby.

15:35.930 --> 15:38.030
Aw, man. It's starting to rain.

15:38.030 --> 15:39.400
Let's hurry, Thorfinn.

15:45.110 --> 15:48.420
Have you prepared for the rain?

15:48.890 --> 15:51.240
Don't change the subject.

15:51.240 --> 15:54.180
I'm worried about your health, Dad.

15:54.730 --> 15:57.370
You're getting too old to push yourself.

15:57.370 --> 15:59.630
When you collapsed on
 your farm the other day,

15:59.630 --> 16:02.470
you got lucky because Snake 
happened to be around.

16:03.560 --> 16:06.820
It's my wish to die on my farm.

16:07.160 --> 16:11.120
Living by yourself at your age 
is ridiculous enough.

16:11.120 --> 16:13.070
You're not capable of physical labor.

16:13.370 --> 16:16.320
Mind your own business. 
I'm managing just fine.

16:16.320 --> 16:18.450
Don't be stubborn, Dad.

16:19.930 --> 16:24.460
Ketil, you and I think too differently.

16:24.460 --> 16:27.500
If we lived together, 
we'd just end up arguing again.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.880
Because you're so stubborn, Dad.

16:30.300 --> 16:33.160
We can't go in there right now.

16:36.600 --> 16:40.020
Think about what I said.

16:41.370 --> 16:43.780
What are you boys doing here?

16:44.450 --> 16:45.320
Hello.

16:45.900 --> 16:49.320
Dad, you can't just do whatever you want.

16:49.320 --> 16:51.190
These are my slaves.

17:03.160 --> 17:07.330
You're wet. While you're here, 
wash your clothes.

17:09.690 --> 17:12.250
Those two must not get along.

17:13.790 --> 17:16.280
Now then, where's the washtub?

17:18.520 --> 17:19.680
What is it?

17:19.680 --> 17:22.140
It's Snake. Snake's here.

17:22.140 --> 17:22.930
A snake?

17:27.050 --> 17:29.080
What's he doing here?

17:29.080 --> 17:33.690
Did he sleep through that argument?

17:34.050 --> 17:35.970
What's wrong with him?

17:36.450 --> 17:38.070
He's sprawled out all over the place.

17:45.620 --> 17:48.250
Gramps, you're cooking, aren't you?

17:48.250 --> 17:51.240
I'm not letting you eat by yourself again.

17:51.240 --> 17:53.170
Damn it. I see you're awake.

17:54.810 --> 17:57.940
What are you guys doing here? 
Did you come to sneak into my bed?

17:59.160 --> 18:00.690
Good morning.

18:02.070 --> 18:04.430
You're a hopeless man.

18:05.210 --> 18:07.810
You're only awake during mealtimes.

18:08.270 --> 18:10.460
Don't you think that's embarrassing?

18:10.460 --> 18:15.660
How can a grown man like you brazenly 
eat when he doesn't even work?

18:15.660 --> 18:17.280
Shut up, Gramps.

18:18.020 --> 18:20.670
Thieves come at night.

18:20.670 --> 18:25.530
This farm is peaceful because 
we patrol it every night.

18:25.530 --> 18:27.410
That's why I've got no problem eating.

18:28.390 --> 18:32.120
How are you guarding anything when all 
you do is sneak into young women's homes?

18:32.120 --> 18:36.050
We're guarding the young women 
so they don't get stolen.

18:37.080 --> 18:39.050
You've always got a comeback.

18:39.560 --> 18:41.800
So do you, Gramps.

18:44.340 --> 18:46.460
What are you guys doing?

18:46.460 --> 18:49.390
Come over here and eat. 
You haven't eaten yet, right?

18:52.680 --> 18:54.150
Are you sure?

18:54.150 --> 18:57.450
Eat, eat. The food ain't so fancy 
that you need to be shy.

18:57.450 --> 18:58.650
How dare you.

18:59.640 --> 19:03.910
Have a seat. If you worked today, 
then you've earned the right to eat.

19:08.520 --> 19:11.920
Is it true that thieves come to the farm?

19:12.360 --> 19:14.730
They do. All the time.

19:14.730 --> 19:18.600
They come for unharvested wheat,
 pigs, that kind of thing.

19:18.600 --> 19:20.050
Huh.

19:20.490 --> 19:22.810
Some of them are armed, too.

19:22.810 --> 19:27.260
Beating up those guys 
and capturing them is our job.

19:27.260 --> 19:30.190
We really do work around here.

19:31.210 --> 19:36.640
What we'd lose to thieves 
is equal to what we pay you.

19:36.640 --> 19:40.450
You really know 
how to piss someone off, don't you?

19:41.050 --> 19:44.700
We could chase off thieves without your help.

19:45.210 --> 19:47.450
We're Nordic men.

19:47.450 --> 19:50.040
We know how to use swords and spears.

19:50.800 --> 19:54.330
Oh? You're saying you can 
still fight at your age?

19:54.330 --> 19:56.750
Don't flatter yourself, Snake.

19:56.750 --> 20:00.160
There are plenty of fighters 
more skilled than you.

20:00.160 --> 20:03.340
I'm just worried about your health, old man.

20:03.340 --> 20:06.890
I'm not so decrepit that I need your concern.

20:06.890 --> 20:08.110
Don't be so angry.

20:08.110 --> 20:10.600
You'll collapse again, Grandpa.

20:11.640 --> 20:18.140
In reality, despite what you say, this farm's 
fighting force is too small for its scale.

20:18.140 --> 20:21.990
The 13 men I've got have 
their hands full chasing down thieves.

20:22.450 --> 20:28.490
You could easily take over 
this farm with 50 to 60 men.

20:29.130 --> 20:30.630
Right, Thorfinn?

20:30.630 --> 20:31.250
Huh?

20:34.680 --> 20:37.750
Oh, um... I'm not sure.

20:41.140 --> 20:45.510
Nothing tougher than thieves 
ever comes to this place.

20:45.840 --> 20:47.690
You don't know that.

20:47.690 --> 20:50.200
It'll be too late once
 it's already happening.

20:50.200 --> 20:51.520
Don't worry.

20:51.520 --> 20:54.890
Regardless of what happens, 
I won't ever come crying to your lot.

20:55.910 --> 20:59.650
Why don't you get anything 
tougher than thieves here?

21:01.820 --> 21:03.900
S-Sorry.

21:05.030 --> 21:07.280
Because of King Harald's influence.

21:07.940 --> 21:14.430
Twice a year, Ketil sends an absurd
 amount of tribute to him.

21:14.430 --> 21:19.690
Because the king accepts his tribute, 
he's obligated to protect Ketil.

21:22.260 --> 21:24.300
It's foolishness.

21:24.300 --> 21:27.360
Buying peace with money is foolishness.

21:27.360 --> 21:33.810
What need is there to hold so much land 
a single farmer can't defend it himself?

21:34.870 --> 21:38.880
How many days do you think it 
takes to get here from Jelling?

21:38.880 --> 21:42.440
We're the ones actually defending the farm.

21:42.760 --> 21:45.930
Too much wealth brings about misfortune.

21:45.930 --> 21:47.280
You're ignoring me now?

21:47.280 --> 21:50.640
Increasing your wealth 
makes you fear losing it.

21:50.640 --> 21:55.040
You spend money to assuage your fears 
and then have to earn more.

21:55.490 --> 21:59.790
And my idiot son hasn't realized yet 
how pointless it is.

22:03.830 --> 22:07.930
I've had enough. 
Old men love giving lectures.

22:10.930 --> 22:13.450
Hey, it stopped raining.

22:18.650 --> 22:21.880
Now then, it's time 
to go out patrolling again.

22:21.880 --> 22:23.150
Don't come back here.

22:29.610 --> 22:32.200
But you miss me when I don't.

22:32.200 --> 22:33.770
Get out of here!

22:41.290 --> 22:43.370
Those two were weird.

22:43.370 --> 22:46.520
They get along better than 
the actual father and son.

22:46.520 --> 22:47.240
Yeah.

22:48.550 --> 22:53.430
I feel like I learned a lot of things today.

22:56.280 --> 22:59.310
Good for you, you overgrown baby.

22:59.310 --> 23:00.690
Don't call me that.

23:11.450 --> 23:14.090
Too much wealth, huh?

23:31.470 --> 23:34.240
You can spread more seed than that.

23:34.240 --> 23:34.850
What?

23:35.670 --> 23:37.600
But isn't this all we have?

23:37.980 --> 23:41.350
It'll be fine. Grab huge handfuls.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.980
I'm your friend. Trust me.

23:44.470 --> 23:45.520
Friend?

23:45.520 --> 23:47.490
What? No way.

23:48.110 --> 23:50.190
Why would you question that?

23:50.190 --> 23:51.530
We're friends, aren't we?

23:51.840 --> 23:53.800
What? We're not?

24:04.120 --> 24:05.010
No...

24:09.410 --> 24:10.650
We're friends.

25:51.480 --> 25:54.990
<b>Iron Fist Ketil</b>

25:51.480 --> 25:54.990
<b>Iron Fist Ketil</b>

25:52.780 --> 25:54.490
"Iron Fist Ketil."
