01:45.660 --> 01:52.000
<b>Path of Blood</b>

01:45.660 --> 01:52.000
<b>Path of Blood</b>

02:13.350 --> 02:16.150
Are you deaf too, you old man?

02:24.890 --> 02:26.660
Don't move, guards.

02:29.930 --> 02:33.030
The king is within reach of my sword.

02:37.360 --> 02:38.490
Is he serious?

02:38.490 --> 02:39.680
Oh, dear.

02:52.100 --> 02:53.270
Askeladd.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.720
You bastard! King Sweyn is mine.

02:56.720 --> 02:57.940
Don't move, Thorkell!

02:57.940 --> 02:59.880
Askeladd's not acting normal.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.320
Don't provoke him.

03:01.320 --> 03:03.570
The king mustn't be harmed.

03:03.950 --> 03:04.930
What?

03:11.610 --> 03:15.590
Put away your sword,
then I'll forgive you for this offense.

03:16.210 --> 03:17.840
Forgive me?

03:17.840 --> 03:20.130
Don't push your luck, you savage.

03:20.720 --> 03:25.640
As punishment for mocking my family
 and my people, you deserve to die!

03:26.320 --> 03:27.930
This is my last warning.

03:28.730 --> 03:32.140
Put away your sword, Askeladd.

03:32.520 --> 03:34.470
That's my nickname.

03:35.140 --> 03:38.900
I'll tell you the name my mother gave me.
My real name.

03:40.660 --> 03:43.650
Lucius Artorius Castus.

03:44.410 --> 03:50.500
I am the rightful king of the land of Britannia.

04:07.930 --> 04:09.620
I feel better now.

04:33.350 --> 04:38.710
<i>For a period of time, 
the Danes held dominion over England.</i>

04:39.150 --> 04:43.610
<i>But in the year 1014, 
the situation changed rapidly</i>

04:43.610 --> 04:46.480
<i>with the death of King Sweyn of Denmark.</i>

04:51.410 --> 04:56.750
<i>Denmark and England 
crossed swords once again.</i>

04:58.050 --> 05:00.520
<i>Canute succeeded his father Sweyn</i>

05:00.520 --> 05:05.080
<i>and took command of the
 Danish viking army in England.</i>

05:06.220 --> 05:08.030
<i>Upon hearing news of Sweyn's death,</i>

05:08.030 --> 05:13.570
<i>Ethelred II returned from his exile 
to Normandy and was reinstated.</i>

05:14.660 --> 05:18.810
<i>Both men proclaimed themselves 
King of England,</i>

05:18.810 --> 05:23.030
<i>and the fate of the throne 
was uncertain once more.</i>

05:23.580 --> 05:28.770
<i>England was exhausted 
by never-ending battles.</i>

05:37.210 --> 05:39.000
Your Highness, stand back.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.150
I'm fine. I didn't drink any.

05:42.150 --> 05:44.400
Y-Your Highness, have mercy!

05:44.760 --> 05:48.700
I swear to our Lord Jesus Christ
 that I didn't know.

05:48.700 --> 05:50.700
I had no idea the drink was poisoned.

05:51.130 --> 05:52.990
Your Highness, have mercy!

05:52.990 --> 05:54.790
Please, King Ethelred!

05:55.610 --> 05:57.130
Bastard...

05:58.730 --> 06:00.500
Such underhanded means...

06:26.250 --> 06:32.970
The situation here is even worse 
than we were told, Your Highness.

06:33.930 --> 06:36.870
It will take a long time for Mercia,

06:37.230 --> 06:42.310
once called the Jewel of the Fields, 
to recover from this.

06:43.730 --> 06:46.600
Gunnar, don't speak as though 
we had nothing to do with this.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.050
We laid waste to this region.

06:51.850 --> 06:52.950
What is that?

06:53.740 --> 06:54.570
Huh?

06:55.590 --> 06:57.270
Oh, right.

06:57.640 --> 07:02.520
This is the advance force of our army, 
which conquered this region.

07:02.970 --> 07:04.440
That's not what I meant.

07:04.440 --> 07:06.780
I'm asking what it is that they're doing.

07:07.470 --> 07:10.240
Why, pillaging the land, of course.

07:10.240 --> 07:13.810
They're looking for girls to
 sell from among the beggars.

07:14.710 --> 07:16.130
I thought I forbade that.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.620
Have them beheaded and 
display their heads on the road.

07:19.620 --> 07:20.580
What?

07:21.060 --> 07:26.220
B-But collecting the spoils 
of war is a military custom.

07:26.220 --> 07:28.750
Cracking down on it harshly would be...

07:28.750 --> 07:31.570
Men who can't maintain discipline 
are no soldiers of mine.

07:32.040 --> 07:34.600
Behead them and display 
their heads on the road.

07:35.240 --> 07:38.730
Y-Yes, Your Highness.

07:38.730 --> 07:39.670
Hey, you!

07:39.670 --> 07:41.890
What? Seriously?

07:57.450 --> 08:01.750
I appreciate you coming all the 
way here, Your Highness.

08:02.390 --> 08:04.880
Floki, have the arrangements been made?

08:05.230 --> 08:07.870
Yes, Your Highness, they await your command.

08:07.870 --> 08:10.760
They can move out immediately.

08:11.780 --> 08:15.560
But you need not have met them yourself.

08:15.560 --> 08:17.640
You could have allowed us to handle the matter.

08:17.640 --> 08:21.130
It's fine. I was already here 
observing the military situation.

08:21.130 --> 08:22.270
I shall meet with them.

08:22.600 --> 08:25.550
Earl Eadric of Mercia is a coward.

08:25.550 --> 08:27.890
He is hardly a man worth meeting.

08:28.460 --> 08:31.880
A person's character and their 
usefulness are two different things.

08:31.880 --> 08:34.150
Either way, I shall meet him 
and judge for myself.

08:36.120 --> 08:41.210
And besides, there is 
another reason for my visit.

08:42.350 --> 08:44.340
What do you mean?

08:45.360 --> 08:48.290
Hey!

08:48.290 --> 08:52.300
Canute!

08:52.300 --> 08:55.550
You're here, you bastard!

08:55.550 --> 08:59.300
Canute!

08:59.970 --> 09:02.240
I must appease <i>that.</i>

09:02.240 --> 09:04.700
I imagine it was too great a 
task for you and your men.

09:04.700 --> 09:07.100
Yes, indeed.

09:17.610 --> 09:20.490
You little brat!

09:20.490 --> 09:21.930
Let me hit him!

09:21.930 --> 09:26.420
Get outta my way and let me hit him once!

09:27.080 --> 09:28.500
Calm yourself, Thorkell.

09:29.040 --> 09:32.110
Why, you friggin' fraggin' little...

09:33.110 --> 09:40.760
I hate when someone stops my 
battles more than I hate frogs!

09:41.100 --> 09:41.930
What?

09:41.930 --> 09:43.010
Frogs?

09:44.150 --> 09:46.970
Mercia has requested a truce.

09:47.880 --> 09:50.650
Our victory here is as good as certain.

09:51.050 --> 09:53.030
You did well, Thorkell.

09:53.030 --> 09:55.030
Shut up!

09:55.770 --> 10:02.120
Battles don't stop until you've 
taken the opposing leader's head.

10:02.120 --> 10:06.790
I was about to lop off Eadric's head.

10:07.200 --> 10:08.750
Don't make such a fuss.

10:08.750 --> 10:12.340
Earl Eadric of Mercia is
 merely the leader of this region.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.500
Look at the bigger picture.

10:15.050 --> 10:18.620
I don't care about that crap.

10:18.620 --> 10:22.550
I just want to enjoy a
 fulfilling life of warfare.

10:22.920 --> 10:28.440
In the lands to the east, Ethelred's son, 
Edmund, is making some disquieting moves.

10:28.890 --> 10:33.860
I ask that you help us pacify the east. 
Your overwhelming strength in battle isâ€”

10:33.860 --> 10:39.400
I'll decide where I go and 
who I fight, Dicehead.

10:40.520 --> 10:41.820
Canute!

10:42.430 --> 10:47.580
You'd better not have forgotten 
what I said to you then.

10:48.690 --> 10:55.970
"I'm going to watch what you do from now on,
and who you'll become."

10:57.460 --> 11:00.280
You're still a nobody.

11:00.280 --> 11:02.840
You aren't even the King of England.

11:03.160 --> 11:05.510
You're just a kid.

11:05.870 --> 11:07.900
So listen up, kid.

11:07.900 --> 11:11.750
No matter what you do, 
you won't be able to avoid war.

11:12.190 --> 11:15.730
You have no choice but to carve 
your path with blood and iron.

11:16.660 --> 11:19.120
Just like Askeladd did.

11:19.120 --> 11:20.650
Don't forget that.

11:21.100 --> 11:25.380
From the start, the path you walk 
has been covered in blood.

11:27.680 --> 11:29.370
How long are you going to keep doing that?

11:29.370 --> 11:31.870
It's annoying! Get outta here!

11:32.220 --> 11:34.370
Boy, I'm pissed.

11:35.040 --> 11:39.010
I'll back down for today, 
but there won't be a second time.

11:39.010 --> 11:40.660
And don't you forget it.

11:42.510 --> 11:45.600
H-How dare he insult you like that 
in front of the soldiers.

11:45.600 --> 11:50.520
Your Highness, 
you mustn't overlook this offense.

11:51.250 --> 11:53.950
Why not? It makes sense.

11:53.950 --> 11:55.770
He offered a valuable warning.

11:56.840 --> 11:58.850
He's an honest man.

11:57.460 --> 11:58.850
Move it!

11:59.560 --> 12:01.000
Clear the way.

11:59.560 --> 12:02.400
It would surely be a
 pleasure to live like him.

12:05.850 --> 12:06.790
Let's go.

12:30.100 --> 12:32.450
4,000 pounds of silver.

12:32.890 --> 12:36.210
This is everything we were
 able to gather at this time.

12:37.220 --> 12:39.270
Please accept this offering.

12:43.830 --> 12:47.780
If you'll withdraw your forces from Mercia,

12:48.110 --> 12:50.760
we'll provide you with an
 additional 4,000 pounds.

12:50.760 --> 12:54.090
It's not a bad deal, Canute.

12:55.110 --> 12:59.530
You offer me Danegeld, Eadric?

13:03.560 --> 13:07.160
What is your answer, Canute?

13:22.470 --> 13:23.940
This is nothing.

13:37.090 --> 13:40.460
Okay, lift 'em.

13:51.640 --> 13:52.420
Hup.

14:28.180 --> 14:29.790
Let me ask you something.

14:31.190 --> 14:39.270
You're paying me this silver so
 I'll leave Mercia, aren't you, Eadric?

14:39.850 --> 14:42.270
I-I'm offering you 8,000 pounds.

14:42.270 --> 14:45.360
That should be more than enough 
for you to withdraw.

14:47.590 --> 14:48.490
It's not.

14:49.770 --> 14:52.900
Think carefully about what you're saying.

14:53.390 --> 14:57.500
You're telling Canute, Bretwalda of England,

14:57.850 --> 15:01.490
to take this money 
and leave his own territory.

15:02.310 --> 15:06.760
And the price you set on such an
 insult against a king is this paltry sum?

15:10.080 --> 15:12.370
I am your king.

15:13.210 --> 15:17.540
I came to this land to quell the rebellion 
taking place within my domain,

15:18.770 --> 15:20.730
not for wealth.

15:24.100 --> 15:25.400
This is nonsense!

15:25.400 --> 15:31.530
Our king is Ethelred of the
 honorable House of Wessex, not you.

15:31.530 --> 15:32.940
Silence.

15:32.940 --> 15:34.400
But Father...

15:34.400 --> 15:37.600
Enough. This is neither the time nor place.

15:37.600 --> 15:42.790
You're right. There is another 
who calls himself the King of England.

15:44.530 --> 15:49.670
So, did you offer me this deal 
with Ethelred's permission?

15:51.290 --> 15:56.300
I-I'm sure His Highness would understand 
if we explained the situation to him.

15:57.350 --> 16:00.310
Ah, how open-minded of him.

16:00.950 --> 16:06.490
So Ethelred would forgive one 
of his own vassals for deserting

16:06.490 --> 16:08.600
in order to protect his own land.

16:09.940 --> 16:13.240
Now, that's not nice.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.890
He's got a nasty streak.

16:17.330 --> 16:20.250
The world is in chaos 
because there are two kings.

16:22.720 --> 16:25.940
One must die.

16:27.860 --> 16:31.960
Ethelred is a coward who
 abandoned his people and throne

16:31.960 --> 16:35.170
to flee into exile during the previous war.

16:36.080 --> 16:41.990
Don't you think it's foolish to trust 
the future of England to such a man?

16:44.410 --> 16:48.610
You're telling me to betray him?

16:52.330 --> 16:54.490
You've already betrayed him.

16:57.400 --> 17:00.840
I'd like you to assist me, Eadric.

17:05.690 --> 17:09.060
I'd like to make Ethelred go away.

17:12.210 --> 17:16.030
You've served him for 
many years as his vassal.

17:16.030 --> 17:18.010
I'm sure you would know 
of a good method.

17:20.980 --> 17:26.770
Do you intend to strip me of
 every last shred of loyalty, boy?

17:27.910 --> 17:30.370
In exchange, I'll allow you to keep Mercia.

17:30.920 --> 17:33.060
Ethelred's head is my price.

17:33.780 --> 17:35.780
A good deal, don't you think?

17:36.890 --> 17:41.210
I refuse. A truce is off the table.

17:41.210 --> 17:45.290
I'll keep fighting a foul man 
like you until the bitter end.

17:50.870 --> 17:55.130
Floki, this man doesn't seem to be a coward.

17:55.130 --> 17:56.630
He's got some backbone.

17:57.600 --> 18:02.900
In that case, 
shall we test it, Your Highness?

18:06.680 --> 18:08.560
Come outside, Eadric.

18:09.270 --> 18:11.380
I have something to show you.

18:57.590 --> 18:59.070
Are you ready?

18:59.070 --> 19:00.610
Yes, Your Highness.

19:02.630 --> 19:03.490
Light it.

19:17.540 --> 19:21.510
Signal fires? What are they signaling?

19:24.650 --> 19:27.750
What is this?

19:30.440 --> 19:34.130
What are you doing, Canute?

19:48.410 --> 19:49.570
Father.

19:51.650 --> 19:53.960
L-Look...

20:06.340 --> 20:08.330
Th-There are more over there.

20:12.650 --> 20:17.910
C-Canute, what are they signaling?

20:21.860 --> 20:24.790
This is what it means 
to go to war against me.

20:26.930 --> 20:29.430
Imagine it, Eadric.

20:30.820 --> 20:35.860
Mercia has been reduced to ash.

20:51.350 --> 20:52.600
Do you understand now?

20:53.430 --> 20:59.360
If I will it, reducing you to ash 
would be no trouble at all.

21:06.530 --> 21:07.690
Father!

21:14.760 --> 21:18.250
Buy peace by offering me Ethelred's head.

21:19.050 --> 21:20.570
It's the smart choice.

21:47.830 --> 21:56.330
<i>The next year, in April of 1016, 
King Ethelred II of England would die.</i>

22:04.340 --> 22:05.320
Your Highness!

22:07.540 --> 22:09.480
<i>It is said he died of an illness.</i>

22:18.600 --> 22:23.940
<i>After Ethelred's death, 
his son Edmund assumed the throne.</i>

22:24.400 --> 22:27.370
<i>As his father's successor,</i>

22:27.370 --> 22:30.950
<i>Edmund caused great trouble for 
Canute's forces in a hard-fought war, but...</i>

22:36.190 --> 22:42.210
<i>Seven months later in that same year, 
he unsurprisingly also died of an illness.</i>

22:55.300 --> 22:57.130
Died of an illness, huh?

22:57.830 --> 23:01.100
It took King Sweyn ten years 
to conquer the nation,

23:01.610 --> 23:03.860
and this time, it ended in less than three.

23:05.110 --> 23:10.330
The Witanagemot will recognize
 Canute as Bretwalda.

23:11.080 --> 23:13.290
The coronation will be held 
first thing next year.

23:18.790 --> 23:20.770
Don't talk to me about Canute.

23:21.290 --> 23:22.730
You're ruining my beer.

23:27.380 --> 23:28.510
Fine, fine.

23:43.860 --> 23:49.570
<i>Sweyn, Ethelred, and Edmund...</i>

23:51.110 --> 23:54.090
<i>Thanks to the unnatural deaths of his rivals,</i>

23:54.090 --> 24:00.370
