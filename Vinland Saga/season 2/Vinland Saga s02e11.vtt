<b>Kings and Swords</b>

00:20.080 --> 00:27.590
<b>Kings and Swords</b>

00:25.880 --> 00:28.170
Yup, they're going at it.

00:28.630 --> 00:32.590
Over here, Your Highness. 
It's His Majesty and Wulf.

00:34.730 --> 00:36.260
You're right.

00:36.970 --> 00:39.260
I can't believe my brother's...

01:10.900 --> 01:12.750
He actually dodged that.

01:12.750 --> 01:17.330
I'm impressed. His Majesty moves well 
for someone so heavily armed.

01:18.490 --> 01:21.310
Aren't those real swords?

01:21.310 --> 01:24.730
Probably, yes.

01:24.730 --> 01:26.600
Can this really be considered practice?

01:26.600 --> 01:28.710
If either gets hit, they'll be badly hurt.

01:29.230 --> 01:32.400
Ah, I see he's making quite the effort.

01:32.400 --> 01:33.660
Gunnar.

01:33.660 --> 01:37.110
Princess Estrid, how do you do?

01:37.570 --> 01:42.680
Terribly! I'm so frightened, 
I'm on pins and needles.

01:44.600 --> 01:48.370
Don't worry. Wulf is a skilled swordsman.

01:48.680 --> 01:52.340
He's surely holding back so as 
not to seriously injure His Majesty.

01:54.860 --> 01:57.220
It doesn't look that way to me.

01:58.740 --> 02:00.540
I can't believe this.

02:00.540 --> 02:05.470
My brother used to hate 
even touching swords.

02:05.770 --> 02:10.320
His Majesty's royal blood has
 awakened in England.

02:10.320 --> 02:12.230
It's a very good thing.

02:13.030 --> 02:17.360
Above all else, a king must be strong.

02:17.710 --> 02:22.710
After all, Norse men 
don't listen to weaklings.

02:27.370 --> 02:28.850
But my brother...

02:30.920 --> 02:33.450
seems like he's in a lot of pain.

02:45.340 --> 02:48.150
Retreating when you're tired 
is a bad habit of yours.

02:48.650 --> 02:51.050
Retreating will draw out the fight.

02:51.870 --> 02:56.050
A king fights by advancing and 
cutting his way through his enemies.

02:56.840 --> 03:02.450
Both your enemies and subjects 
are watching to see how you fight.

03:09.010 --> 03:11.220
Estrid is watching as well.

03:13.190 --> 03:15.140
I'm sure you've noticed.

03:16.360 --> 03:22.720
I see. That must be why you started 
attacking more aggressively.

03:23.020 --> 03:25.820
There... There you go again!

03:25.820 --> 03:27.720
I'm not falling for that.

03:29.170 --> 03:31.000
Forget what I said. 
Just a slip of the tongue.

03:31.450 --> 03:35.230
Besides, she seems lost in 
conversation with the man beside her.

03:52.710 --> 03:54.490
I... concede.

04:00.870 --> 04:02.840
Nicely done, Your Majesty.

04:05.630 --> 04:07.800
I'm amazed.

04:07.800 --> 04:11.630
He may have only won one in five bouts, 
but he made Wulf admit defeat.

04:11.630 --> 04:14.680
Didn't Wulf look away at the end?

04:21.900 --> 04:26.720
Your Majesty, I've told you that
you mustn't throw your sword.

04:26.720 --> 04:30.120
Your Majesty, that was an impressive fight.

04:31.720 --> 04:33.580
What do you want, Gunnar?

04:33.580 --> 04:37.880
I've finished preparing the documents about
 the matter you asked me to investigate.

04:37.880 --> 04:39.670
We can review them in your room later.

04:46.390 --> 04:51.670
Anyway, there aren't too many wealthy men.

04:53.440 --> 04:56.350
Even if we were to squeeze 
any of the men listed,

04:56.350 --> 04:59.760
we'd get at most 3,000 pounds a year.

04:59.760 --> 05:05.050
Besides that, our only option is to 
raise taxes on the overall population.

05:06.490 --> 05:09.690
Ah, I'd recommend that one.

05:10.090 --> 05:12.160
Ketil, son of Sverkel.

05:12.160 --> 05:15.620
He's a wealthy farmer who owns 
a large swath of land in the south.

05:16.240 --> 05:19.590
I don't see the families' 
military forces listed here.

05:19.590 --> 05:25.800
Yes, but without visiting them 
in person, it's hard to say.

05:26.980 --> 05:30.610
We need those numbers. 
Look into it and report back to me.

05:31.290 --> 05:33.530
Yes, Your Majesty.

05:34.620 --> 05:40.000
Either way, we'd be 
raising taxes significantly,

05:40.000 --> 05:43.250
right after you've been 
crowned King of Denmark.

05:43.250 --> 05:47.690
I'm concerned there will be 
backlash from the people of Denmark.

05:48.600 --> 05:52.100
Part of governing is making 
sure that doesn't happen.

05:52.660 --> 05:53.880
We have options.

05:57.850 --> 06:03.750
<i>After being crowned King of England, 
Canute faced an urgent problem:</i>

06:04.530 --> 06:07.130
<i>securing a new source of funds.</i>

06:08.790 --> 06:11.580
<i>Even after conquering England,</i>

06:11.580 --> 06:15.610
<i>Canute kept a Danish force directly
 under his control stationed there.</i>

06:16.840 --> 06:23.400
<i>But the cost of maintaining such a force 
was being paid with English taxes,</i>

06:23.400 --> 06:27.490
<i>which contributed to the
 discontent of the English.</i>

06:28.890 --> 06:34.600
<i>Unless he could squeeze funds 
from Denmark, his other territory,</i>

06:35.030 --> 06:38.600
<i>he would be forced to 
downsize his stationed army.</i>

06:40.670 --> 06:44.840
You said we have options, 
but what are they exactly?

06:44.840 --> 06:46.630
Bringing more land under our control.

06:47.340 --> 06:49.080
By developing it?

06:49.080 --> 06:53.370
But it would take some time 
for that to yield a profit.

06:53.370 --> 06:57.520
We'll acquire more farmland 
without developing virgin land.

06:59.140 --> 07:02.120
You mean... by requisitioning land?

07:02.120 --> 07:05.730
Your Majesty, surely 
you're not considering that?

07:06.170 --> 07:08.080
We need the money.

07:08.080 --> 07:10.700
We've no choice but to be somewhat 
heavy-handed in our approach.

07:11.210 --> 07:16.230
It's better than sowing discontent 
among the people by raising taxes.

07:17.570 --> 07:20.840
If you've got a better suggestion, 
I'm all ears.

07:22.440 --> 07:29.670
Well... what about drawing down the army?

07:29.670 --> 07:31.110
That's out of the question.

07:31.690 --> 07:37.350
I'm their conqueror and a Dane. 
The English will never look favorably upon me.

07:38.060 --> 07:43.640
An army under my direct control is 
what allows me to govern the region.

07:45.460 --> 07:47.090
Kings are like swords.

07:47.780 --> 07:52.020
What can a king without military might 
accomplish in this world?

09:30.150 --> 09:31.220
What?

09:32.680 --> 09:35.690
King Harald has passed away?

09:36.480 --> 09:40.330
A week ago. You're too late, Dad.

09:41.180 --> 09:46.670
But... Then by the time 
I left the farm, he was already....

09:46.670 --> 09:48.480
That's exactly what it means.

09:50.450 --> 09:53.050
I had no idea he was in such poor health.

09:58.630 --> 10:00.420
I don't believe it.

10:00.960 --> 10:04.120
I even brought him a mountain of gifts.

10:04.980 --> 10:07.210
Enough to fill three knerrir, huh?

10:08.330 --> 10:10.210
What a lavish offering.

10:17.140 --> 10:18.470
Wait a minute.

10:18.470 --> 10:24.110
Thorgil, if you came to meet me,

10:24.110 --> 10:27.690
does that mean His Majesty Canute 
is here as well?

10:28.050 --> 10:31.730
Well, yeah. I do serve him 
directly as his guard.

10:32.580 --> 10:36.730
Currently he's acting as the king. 
He's at the palace.

10:36.730 --> 10:40.360
I see. That's my silver lining, then.

10:40.720 --> 10:44.440
I've lost King Harald's backing.

10:44.440 --> 10:50.370
I must build a good relationship 
with the next King of Denmark.

10:51.160 --> 10:54.750
Could you arrange a meeting 
between me and His Majesty?

10:56.130 --> 10:58.000
You're a tough old man.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.260
All right. I'll make something happen.

11:00.610 --> 11:02.500
I'm counting on it.

11:03.430 --> 11:06.070
Olmar! Olmar!

11:06.950 --> 11:09.520
Hey, where did Olmar go?

11:09.520 --> 11:13.520
The young master headed off into town alone.

11:13.520 --> 11:15.560
And you let him go?

11:15.560 --> 11:17.760
I told you not to take your eyes off of him.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.900
Now, now, Dad.

11:20.220 --> 11:23.740
He's 20 years old. He's not a child.

11:23.740 --> 11:25.200
He <i>is</i> a child.

11:25.880 --> 11:29.710
That idiot son of mine has never grown up.

11:30.360 --> 11:33.080
You watch what happens 
while he's town alone.

11:33.720 --> 11:36.120
By now, he's surely bumped into someone

11:36.120 --> 11:40.490
and gotten into a fight over 
who should apologize to whom.

11:41.740 --> 11:44.930
You're the one who bumped into me.

11:45.260 --> 11:49.710
Don't screw with me. 
You should be apologizing to me.

11:50.970 --> 11:53.600
What was that?

11:53.600 --> 11:55.980
What are you talking about?

11:56.380 --> 11:57.960
What are you gonna do about this?

11:57.960 --> 11:59.990
I was going to trade this cloth.

11:59.990 --> 12:02.570
That's not my problem.

12:02.570 --> 12:05.740
Don't think you can use this as an excuse 
to force me to buy it off of you.

12:05.740 --> 12:07.200
What's going on?

12:06.170 --> 12:09.180
What the hell? Don't insult me.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.690
It's a fight.

12:09.180 --> 12:12.000
I do expect to be compensated, though.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.490
Now you've shown your true colors.

12:14.490 --> 12:18.500
That's what you intended from the start, 
isn't it? You're just a sleazy swindler.

12:19.010 --> 12:21.620
Ugh! So disgusting.

12:20.470 --> 12:22.280
You bastard...

12:22.280 --> 12:26.260
How does someone grow up 
to be an asshole like you?

12:26.650 --> 12:31.130
I'm an honest businessman, just like my dad.

12:31.130 --> 12:33.340
I won't allow you to continue to insult me.

12:33.340 --> 12:36.400
What are you gonna do about it, huh?

12:36.730 --> 12:40.110
You wanna go, huh? I'm ready to go anytime,

12:40.540 --> 12:42.360
you clumsy oaf.

12:43.950 --> 12:47.950
Now I'm pissed off, you ignoramus!

12:53.000 --> 12:54.690
He drew his sword.

12:58.890 --> 13:02.550
What's wrong, you oaf? Bring it on.

13:02.910 --> 13:04.930
Are you scared?

13:04.930 --> 13:07.050
Th-This isn't fair.

13:07.050 --> 13:14.470
Not fair? When men fight, it's to the death.

13:16.810 --> 13:20.120
If you're walking around unarmed,

13:20.730 --> 13:28.040
then it just means 
you're not a real Norseman.

13:28.410 --> 13:30.430
Then let me ask you this:

13:30.430 --> 13:33.540
who do you think bought you that?

13:35.540 --> 13:38.010
You idiot son of mine!

13:38.010 --> 13:41.310
Why are you always starting fights?

13:41.310 --> 13:43.660
Wh-What the hell is your problem, Dad?

13:43.660 --> 13:46.050
Stay out of my fight!

13:48.570 --> 13:50.680
I'm sorry.

13:51.400 --> 13:53.680
Allow me to compensate you for the cloth.

13:53.680 --> 13:55.700
Is this enough?

13:56.160 --> 13:58.230
Whoa...

13:58.940 --> 14:03.710
W-Well, in that case, 
I've got no problem with you.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.080
Hold it, Bug-Eyes.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.080
Give him his change.

14:09.830 --> 14:13.150
Oh, Dad, you were watching?

14:13.150 --> 14:14.830
I saw the whole thing.

14:14.830 --> 14:20.460
I was watching to see how you'd 
settle the fight, but I'm disappointed.

14:20.940 --> 14:24.050
You still can't be trusted with big deals.

14:24.930 --> 14:26.170
Sorry.

14:27.080 --> 14:30.990
Allow me to apologize for my son.

14:30.990 --> 14:34.610
My name is Leif Ericson.

14:43.650 --> 14:46.190
So he's your adopted son?

14:46.190 --> 14:49.320
Yes, something like that.

14:49.320 --> 14:52.700
It was a stroke of fate 
that brought him to me.

14:53.120 --> 14:55.290
Come on, introduce yourself.

14:56.900 --> 14:59.320
My name is Thorfinn. Thank you for earlier.

14:59.850 --> 15:02.580
But call me Bug-Eyes. 
That's what everyone calls me.

15:03.480 --> 15:04.790
Thorfinn...

15:05.960 --> 15:07.530
Oh, excuse me.

15:07.530 --> 15:11.590
One of my people goes by the same name.

15:12.480 --> 15:15.630
He's quiet and hardworking.

15:15.630 --> 15:18.950
Perhaps I should've 
named this boy Thorfinn as well.

15:20.640 --> 15:24.370
You've got a rather spirited boy there.

15:29.080 --> 15:33.660
Ketil, forgive me for asking, but...

15:34.190 --> 15:36.140
That Thorfinn...

15:36.140 --> 15:40.170
Is he by any chance a slave?

15:40.670 --> 15:41.540
What?

15:41.540 --> 15:45.130
Yes, I'm surprised you figured that out.

15:45.600 --> 15:49.590
I didn't mention his status 
because I didn't want to offend you.

15:51.880 --> 15:55.410
Is he a Nord with blond hair and brown eyes?

15:56.400 --> 15:58.930
About the same age as this boy?

15:59.760 --> 16:03.180
I'm surprised. It's exactly as you say.

16:03.180 --> 16:05.900
He's shorter than him, though.

16:06.170 --> 16:08.510
This again, Dad?

16:08.510 --> 16:13.150
Is he from Iceland and a former warrior?

16:13.610 --> 16:17.770
Now, what did he say?

16:17.770 --> 16:22.410
I remember seeing numerous scars 
clearly left by blades all over his body...

16:22.840 --> 16:24.970
Don't get your hopes up.

16:24.970 --> 16:27.500
It's probably just like 
what happened with me.

16:27.500 --> 16:33.050
I know. I know that, but he matches 
the description so far.

16:33.640 --> 16:36.150
You seem very interested in
 him for some reason, Leif.

16:36.600 --> 16:39.310
Would you be willing to tell me about it?

16:40.810 --> 16:41.750
Yes.

16:43.160 --> 16:45.060
I've been looking for him.

16:46.170 --> 16:49.570
He's my friend's son, who was enslaved.

16:50.290 --> 16:53.400
It's been years now.

16:55.430 --> 16:56.530
What?

16:57.270 --> 16:59.310
W-We're going <i>where,</i> Pops?

16:59.310 --> 17:03.500
I was just thinking 
we could take a little detour

17:03.500 --> 17:07.040
and make a quick stop at Ketil's farm.

17:07.420 --> 17:10.830
It's not that far away, really.

17:10.830 --> 17:13.050
Ketil came here by boat, too.

17:13.050 --> 17:16.430
He said we could follow him back.

17:16.430 --> 17:19.480
How far is it from here?

17:19.480 --> 17:22.310
He said with favorable winds, 
it takes about five days.

17:22.620 --> 17:25.770
Then we'd lose more than ten days.

17:25.770 --> 17:27.800
That's not what you call a little detour.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.360
Listen to me, Mors.

17:29.360 --> 17:32.560
This Thorfinn is different.

17:32.560 --> 17:34.070
I think it's really him this time.

17:34.510 --> 17:36.990
It's already fall, Pops.

17:36.990 --> 17:40.780
If we don't get back soon, 
the Greenland Sea will freeze over.

17:40.780 --> 17:46.540
What are we gonna do if the winds and tides 
don't favor us after a ten-day delay?

17:47.370 --> 17:50.260
Sorry, but I can't go along 
with you this time.

17:50.710 --> 17:52.300
You gotta understand that.

17:59.100 --> 18:02.430
I'm surprised I'm getting an
 audience with His Majesty

18:02.430 --> 18:06.040
after requesting one just yesterday.

18:06.570 --> 18:11.190
You must have a lot of influence, Thorgil. 
I've changed my mind about you.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.400
Huh? Oh...

18:14.090 --> 18:17.480
Honestly, I'm surprised, too.

18:17.480 --> 18:20.010
He's a busy man.

18:20.890 --> 18:23.530
Maybe he liked your gifts.

18:23.530 --> 18:26.250
Yes, I'm sure he did.

18:26.720 --> 18:31.000
Our crops are the best and
 most plentiful in the south.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.510
He only stands to gain 
from making a deal with us.

18:37.190 --> 18:41.140
Ketil and family, you may enter.

18:41.580 --> 18:43.000
Let's go.

18:43.440 --> 18:44.340
Olmar...

18:45.610 --> 18:47.060
Be polite.

18:58.120 --> 19:02.010
Ketil, I saw your gifts as well.

19:02.010 --> 19:05.680
They are all high quality. I accept them.

19:05.680 --> 19:09.210
Y-Yes, Your Majesty. I'm honored.

19:10.170 --> 19:14.880
Were all those crops grown on your land?

19:15.160 --> 19:17.530
Yes, they were.

19:18.480 --> 19:24.020
The late King Harald was also 
pleased by my family's products.

19:25.890 --> 19:30.880
I have no intention of unnecessarily changing 
the way my father and brother did things.

19:30.880 --> 19:32.150
Don't worry.

19:32.970 --> 19:36.710
Strong farmers like you 
are the treasure of Denmark.

19:37.320 --> 19:42.650
You should continue serving as the foundation 
of our nation's strength with pride.

19:45.650 --> 19:47.220
I appreciate your words, Your Majesty.

19:47.680 --> 19:51.400
I hope to have the throne's 
continued support.

20:00.650 --> 20:04.300
You are in the presence of the king. Kneel.

20:04.730 --> 20:06.720
What are you doing?

20:06.720 --> 20:08.310
I'm t-terribly sorry for—

20:08.310 --> 20:12.190
Your Majesty, I have a request!

20:12.190 --> 20:15.340
Please allow me to join your forces.

20:15.340 --> 20:17.880
Ideally, serving as your guard
 alongside my brother.

20:20.330 --> 20:23.820
I've trained a lot. 
I promise I'll be useful to you.

20:24.250 --> 20:26.640
I'd even be willing to
 demonstrate my skills for you—

20:26.640 --> 20:28.480
Enough, you idiot!

20:28.480 --> 20:30.680
Who draws a sword in the presence of a king?

20:30.680 --> 20:33.390
Let go of me, Dad!

20:33.390 --> 20:35.420
I wanna fight!

20:35.420 --> 20:37.660
You've really outdone 
yourself today, you idiot!

20:37.660 --> 20:39.000
Well, well...

20:39.000 --> 20:42.320
Shut up, Dad!

20:40.920 --> 20:42.880
What shall we do, Your Majesty?

20:44.790 --> 20:49.720
It's fine, Ketil. 
Let's see how he handles a sword.

20:52.570 --> 20:53.130
What?

20:53.130 --> 20:53.850
Huh?

21:01.730 --> 21:05.130
That pig is the soldiers' dinner.

21:05.130 --> 21:07.300
Imagine it is a man and cleave it.

21:08.160 --> 21:10.990
Y-Yes, Your Majesty. 
I'll take a whack at it, then.

21:31.970 --> 21:33.700
Hey, what's going on?

21:33.700 --> 21:35.660
What's happening?

21:35.660 --> 21:36.670
I heard screaming.

21:36.670 --> 21:37.990
What's all this screaming?

21:50.010 --> 21:53.040
Enough. That's enough. I understand.

21:58.240 --> 22:01.540
Bones are... so hard...

22:04.950 --> 22:06.750
Olmar, was it?

22:06.750 --> 22:10.860
I'll consult with the captain 
regarding your request to join my guard

22:10.860 --> 22:12.720
and notify you of my decision tomorrow.

22:12.720 --> 22:15.990
Stay in town near the castle until then.

22:23.850 --> 22:25.380
Aw, man.

22:27.300 --> 22:29.930
You really screwed the pooch 
this time, Olmar.

22:29.930 --> 22:34.410
The other soldiers will be
 teasing me about this for a while.

22:36.680 --> 22:42.490
Unbelievable. The more cowardly a man is, 
the less predictable his behavior.

22:43.380 --> 22:46.880
In any case, what's done is done.

22:47.360 --> 22:52.010
Be careful not to do anything to 
embarrass our family further.

22:58.810 --> 23:00.680
Men like him are common.

23:01.570 --> 23:04.360
All pride, no skill.

23:04.840 --> 23:07.610
And no understanding 
of their own abilities.

23:08.250 --> 23:11.160
Men like him are the first 
to die on the battlefield.

23:11.690 --> 23:13.750
I wouldn't want him serving under me.

23:14.220 --> 23:17.800
I understand your thoughts 
as Captain of the Guard.

23:19.540 --> 23:22.710
Let me hear your thoughts 
from another perspective.

23:26.500 --> 23:30.010
That young man could be incredibly useful.

23:30.520 --> 23:32.890
You're right. He could be useful to us.

23:33.650 --> 23:37.880
He's a typical young Nord. 
A foolish one, at that.

23:38.440 --> 23:41.080
He'd surely act as we expect him to.

23:42.360 --> 23:44.600
Shall we proceed with the plan, then?

23:45.480 --> 23:49.080
Yes. The coronation hasn't happened yet,

23:49.080 --> 23:51.780
but we shouldn't let 
this opportunity pass us by.

23:55.030 --> 23:59.670
It's so the people can live in peace.
 I feel for them, but they must pay the price.

24:04.690 --> 24:09.370
Ketil's farm will be 
the first we requisition.

25:50.310 --> 25:54.940
<b>For Lost Love</b>

25:50.310 --> 25:54.940
<b>For Lost Love</b>

25:51.150 --> 25:53.940
"For Lost Love."
