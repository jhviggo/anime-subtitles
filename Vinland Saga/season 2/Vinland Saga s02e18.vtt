00:31.280 --> 00:33.700
<b>The wind is favorable, Your Majesty.</b>

00:34.950 --> 00:38.740
<b>If these fair winds continue,
we will be able to arrive at</b>

00:38.830 --> 00:41.120
<b>Ketil's farm in two to three days.</b>

00:41.620 --> 00:46.370
<b>In any case… To think that
the king himself is going to confront</b>

00:46.460 --> 00:49.380
<b>some wealthy family from the countryside…</b>

00:50.380 --> 00:53.760
<b>We, the Jomsvikings,
would have been more than capable</b>

00:53.840 --> 00:55.720
<b>of taking care of it.</b>

00:56.510 --> 01:00.720
<b>King Canute has his own reasons,</b>

01:00.810 --> 01:01.810
<b>Floki.</b>

01:02.310 --> 01:06.310
<b>As a vassal, you should refrain
from sticking your nose into such issues.</b>

01:06.980 --> 01:09.770
<b>Jomsborg is an ally.</b>

01:09.860 --> 01:12.780
<b>I don't exactly consider myself a vassal.</b>

01:13.280 --> 01:15.990
<b>Please don't forget that, Wulf.</b>

01:17.740 --> 01:21.030
<b>Do you think Ketil and his men will resist</b>

01:21.990 --> 01:23.330
<b>against their king?</b>

01:24.370 --> 01:26.290
<b>I can't say for sure.</b>

01:26.920 --> 01:30.920
<b>I heard that Ketil was so fierce that
he was named Iron Fist on the battlefield.</b>

01:31.420 --> 01:32.920
<b>We can't let our guard down.</b>

01:35.010 --> 01:37.470
<b>He sure didn't seem that way.</b>

01:39.010 --> 01:43.060
<b>Humans are a valuable resource.
I don't want to waste them.</b>

01:43.560 --> 01:46.980
<b>If Ketil cowers before my power as king
and surrenders,</b>

01:47.480 --> 01:49.100
<b>that would be best.</b>

01:50.520 --> 01:53.440
<b>Is that why you chose to
confront them yourself?</b>

01:53.940 --> 01:58.150
<b>However, they are the ones who acted
so shamelessly toward you, Your Majesty.</b>

01:58.660 --> 02:00.280
<b>Shouldn't we punish them</b>

02:00.370 --> 02:02.990
<b>and have them serve
as a warning to the people?</b>

02:04.450 --> 02:07.830
<b>If they resist,
I don't plan to go easy on them.</b>

02:21.850 --> 02:23.260
<b>"There's a tailwind.</b>

02:23.760 --> 02:25.600
<b>However, the waves are high</b>

02:26.100 --> 02:29.690
<b>and the land I seek is still far off."</b>

04:23.840 --> 04:27.390
<b>Oh, I thought Master Ketil was back.</b>

04:27.470 --> 04:28.810
<b>But it was Thorgil.</b>

04:32.890 --> 04:35.560
<b>Welcome back, Thorgil!</b>

04:35.650 --> 04:39.650
<b>Hey! Here's a souvenir for you. Catch!</b>

04:41.480 --> 04:42.650
<b>Woah!</b>

04:48.450 --> 04:49.700
<b>What!</b>

04:49.780 --> 04:51.450
<b>A human?</b>

04:51.540 --> 04:53.200
<b>Woah! Master!</b>

04:54.620 --> 04:57.330
<b>Give him some alcohol and put him to bed.</b>

04:57.420 --> 05:00.420
<b>Jeez, he's such a handful.</b>

05:00.500 --> 05:03.380
<b>Hey, all of you!</b>

05:03.460 --> 05:05.970
<b>It's no time to be drying fish.</b>

05:06.050 --> 05:07.430
<b>Get ready for war!</b>

05:08.140 --> 05:11.060
<b>Our enemy's army will be here soon.</b>

05:11.140 --> 05:13.890
<b>They're coming to take over
this entire farm.</b>

05:13.980 --> 05:16.690
<b>Gather all the men and weapons you can!</b>

05:19.770 --> 05:21.480
<b>-Hey…
-What?</b>

05:21.570 --> 05:23.190
<b>Who is this "enemy"?</b>

05:23.280 --> 05:25.860
<b>-How soon are they coming?
-And what happened to the master?</b>

05:25.950 --> 05:27.610
<b>-Hey, wait!
-What is going on?</b>

05:27.700 --> 05:28.990
<b>Thorgil!</b>

05:29.070 --> 05:33.120
<b>Before you start a war,
you've got to honor your side of the deal.</b>

05:33.200 --> 05:35.080
<b>I don't want to be caught up in this.</b>

05:36.330 --> 05:39.500
<b>Have that discussion with my dad.</b>

05:39.580 --> 05:41.090
<b>I'm busy.</b>

05:42.630 --> 05:45.010
<b>Olmar! Hurry up!</b>

05:47.340 --> 05:49.300
<b>This will be your first battle,</b>

05:49.390 --> 05:52.220
<b>so stay with me and learn how to fight.</b>

05:52.890 --> 05:55.430
<b>Although, considering our opponent,</b>

05:55.520 --> 05:58.560
<b>this may be your last battle.</b>

06:01.110 --> 06:03.230
<b>Aren't you happy, Olmar?</b>

06:03.320 --> 06:05.990
<b>You've been wanting to
fight in a war, right?</b>

06:11.410 --> 06:14.290
<b>Get it together, Ketil.</b>

06:14.790 --> 06:19.710
<b>You said you would purchase our cargo
at three times the standard price.</b>

06:20.290 --> 06:24.550
<b>That's why we agreed to transport
you guys all the way here.</b>

06:28.840 --> 06:30.340
<b>Arnheid…</b>

06:31.090 --> 06:32.220
<b>What?</b>

06:44.770 --> 06:46.650
<b>Hey, Ketil!</b>

06:47.320 --> 06:50.030
<b>Wait a second, Ketil!</b>

06:50.740 --> 06:53.070
<b>Come on, Ketil!</b>

06:58.500 --> 07:00.540
<b>I'm sure it'll be all right.</b>

07:02.710 --> 07:05.340
<b>Your gut is telling you, right?</b>

07:06.050 --> 07:09.260
<b>This time,
I'm sure it's the real Thorfinn.</b>

07:14.470 --> 07:15.560
<b>Yeah…</b>

07:17.270 --> 07:19.480
<b>I'll hope for the best.</b>

07:25.060 --> 07:27.820
<b>A war? Here?</b>

07:28.400 --> 07:30.610
<b>Within the next few days, apparently.</b>

07:30.700 --> 07:33.870
<b>Thorgil said to fix the walls of the fort.</b>

07:34.370 --> 07:37.160
<b>Don't make it sound so easy.</b>

07:37.240 --> 07:40.660
<b>There's no way
we can fix this in a few days.</b>

07:40.750 --> 07:42.500
<b>More like, who are we fighting?</b>

07:43.080 --> 07:45.540
<b>The thing is, he won't tell us.</b>

07:45.630 --> 07:47.880
<b>He said he'll announce it
when our army is ready.</b>

07:48.380 --> 07:50.630
<b>No matter who it is, we have no chance.</b>

07:51.260 --> 07:52.840
<b>There aren't enough</b>

07:52.930 --> 07:56.010
<b>people on this farm
with experience in fighting a war.</b>

07:56.510 --> 07:58.140
<b>And we lost</b>

07:58.220 --> 08:01.230
<b>five precious warriors just the other day.</b>

08:03.770 --> 08:05.060
<b>The guests</b>

08:05.770 --> 08:07.480
<b>seem agitated.</b>

08:08.690 --> 08:10.740
<b>Maybe the master has returned.</b>

08:13.280 --> 08:14.360
<b>I wonder</b>

08:14.860 --> 08:16.160
<b>what he will do</b>

08:17.280 --> 08:19.990
<b>when he finds out that Arnheid ran away.</b>

08:26.000 --> 08:29.090
<b>Will he punish her?</b>

08:31.340 --> 08:34.840
<b>It led to too many casualties.</b>

08:37.180 --> 08:38.430
<b>But</b>

08:39.260 --> 08:42.020
<b>the master adores Arnheid.</b>

08:43.430 --> 08:46.600
<b>He won't do anything too bad, right?</b>

08:48.230 --> 08:49.270
<b>Yeah…</b>

08:49.770 --> 08:51.030
<b>Maybe not.</b>

08:51.730 --> 08:53.990
<b>She's carrying his child too, after all.</b>

08:58.570 --> 09:00.120
<b>I'm so worried.</b>

09:01.120 --> 09:03.450
<b>Do you think she's okay?</b>

09:05.670 --> 09:06.960
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

09:08.880 --> 09:10.000
<b>Don't be.</b>

09:10.500 --> 09:13.260
<b>You fought Snake and the others, right?</b>

09:14.050 --> 09:16.090
<b>You did it for Arnheid and Gardar.</b>

09:18.590 --> 09:21.600
<b>You even went against your oath for them.</b>

09:26.190 --> 09:30.480
<b>There are times
when you just have to fight.</b>

09:32.020 --> 09:34.360
<b>Thank you, Thorfinn.</b>

09:38.950 --> 09:42.120
<b>I like Snake.</b>

09:43.240 --> 09:46.710
<b>I think he's a kind and rational man.</b>

09:48.750 --> 09:52.250
<b>I didn't want to fight Snake.</b>

09:53.840 --> 09:57.760
<b>And in the end, I let Gardar die.</b>

10:01.890 --> 10:04.850
<b>I'm not smart,</b>

10:05.350 --> 10:06.430
<b>so…</b>

10:07.560 --> 10:09.230
<b>I can't explain it that well but…</b>

10:11.190 --> 10:16.320
<b>I feel like there may have been
a better way to go about it.</b>

10:17.490 --> 10:19.860
<b>Was it really necessary</b>

10:19.950 --> 10:23.490
<b>to hurt so many people
and end so many lives?</b>

10:24.990 --> 10:29.120
<b>Did I even try
to find an alternative route?</b>

10:31.630 --> 10:33.130
<b>There was no way.</b>

10:33.960 --> 10:36.590
<b>So many guests were killed,</b>

10:36.670 --> 10:38.510
<b>so Snake couldn't back down.</b>

10:40.840 --> 10:42.300
<b>Even still…</b>

10:43.600 --> 10:44.810
<b>violence should be</b>

10:45.350 --> 10:47.140
<b>the last resort.</b>

10:50.520 --> 10:51.600
<b>But…</b>

10:52.610 --> 10:56.690
<b>what would have been the best thing to do?</b>

10:58.530 --> 11:01.910
<b>Where did all of this begin?</b>

11:04.700 --> 11:06.240
<b>I wish…</b>

11:07.620 --> 11:11.870
<b>I wish I knew how to choose
the course of action that's best.</b>

11:14.670 --> 11:17.090
<b>Nobody in this world</b>

11:18.260 --> 11:20.170
<b>deserves to be hurt.</b>

11:24.800 --> 11:26.350
<b>You're right.</b>

11:29.020 --> 11:30.560
<b>You're exactly right.</b>

11:45.910 --> 11:47.240
<b>Arnheid?</b>

11:48.120 --> 11:49.370
<b>Where are you?</b>

11:50.160 --> 11:51.500
<b>Arnheid?</b>

11:57.630 --> 11:58.960
<b>Where are you?</b>

12:04.930 --> 12:06.680
<b>Oh, what a surprise.</b>

12:06.760 --> 12:09.600
<b>You returned so early.</b>

12:11.640 --> 12:16.190
<b>I heard that King Harald passed away.</b>

12:18.440 --> 12:19.530
<b>Dear?</b>

12:23.280 --> 12:25.530
<b>A… Arnheid?</b>

12:29.660 --> 12:32.200
<b>If you're looking for
that shameless slave girl,</b>

12:32.290 --> 12:35.420
<b>she was tied up
and thrown into the stable.</b>

12:35.920 --> 12:40.170
<b>While you were gone,
she caused quite the trouble, after all.</b>

12:43.260 --> 12:46.300
<b>She plotted an escape.</b>

12:46.800 --> 12:50.060
<b>Forgetting about
everything she owed to you.</b>

12:52.350 --> 12:54.770
<b>"Escape"?</b>

12:57.480 --> 12:59.060
<b>Arnheid?</b>

13:00.860 --> 13:03.280
<b><i>A man from her past came around</i></b>

13:03.360 --> 13:04.200
<b><i>and helped her.</i></b>

13:05.240 --> 13:07.700
<b><i>Many guests died.</i></b>

13:08.990 --> 13:11.450
<b>Two of our male slaves</b>

13:11.540 --> 13:13.950
<b>helped her out as well.</b>

13:14.620 --> 13:16.870
<b>What a wretched woman.</b>

13:18.130 --> 13:19.460
<b>This issue</b>

13:19.540 --> 13:23.550
<b>must not be swept under the rug, dear.</b>

13:25.880 --> 13:27.380
<b>"Escape"?</b>

13:33.890 --> 13:35.100
<b>Why…</b>

13:36.100 --> 13:38.060
<b>Why is everything</b>

13:38.940 --> 13:41.690
<b>slipping away from my hands?</b>

13:44.690 --> 13:46.240
<b>"Escape," you say?</b>

13:49.490 --> 13:50.910
<b>Why?</b>

14:03.960 --> 14:06.970
<b>I never heard anything about this.</b>

14:07.470 --> 14:09.510
<b>I can't allow you in.</b>

14:10.300 --> 14:12.430
<b>It's true!</b>

14:12.510 --> 14:16.140
<b>Ketil promised me
that he will free Thorfinn.</b>

14:16.980 --> 14:19.190
<b>Anyway, I want to see his face at least.</b>

14:19.690 --> 14:24.280
<b>I want to know if the Thorfinn who's here
is the one I'm looking for.</b>

14:25.070 --> 14:27.610
<b>I have to confirm with the master first.</b>

14:28.490 --> 14:31.120
<b>Otherwise, there is no way I am allowing</b>

14:31.200 --> 14:33.910
<b>anyone to meet someone who is detained.</b>

14:36.370 --> 14:38.410
<b>All right, fine.</b>

14:41.130 --> 14:43.790
<b>Hey, come with me.</b>

14:44.300 --> 14:46.170
<b>Let's go find Ketil.</b>

14:47.760 --> 14:51.390
<b>I'm sorry to bother you
at such a busy time, Pater.</b>

14:52.430 --> 14:55.560
<b>No, I don't mind showing you the way…</b>

14:59.890 --> 15:02.690
<b>Is there something wrong?</b>

15:04.900 --> 15:08.070
<b>I'm afraid this is something
we can only ask</b>

15:08.150 --> 15:10.700
<b>an outsider like you.</b>

15:13.030 --> 15:14.950
<b>Excuse me, Leif,</b>

15:15.450 --> 15:19.330
<b>but do you have a surplus
in your budget for buying slaves?</b>

15:20.460 --> 15:22.790
<b>Well, a little.</b>

15:22.880 --> 15:26.590
<b>After all, I was promised
to get Thorfinn for free.</b>

15:27.380 --> 15:30.590
<b>The master always keeps his promise.</b>

15:31.680 --> 15:35.600
<b>I'm sure Thorfinn and Einar
will be no problem.</b>

15:36.810 --> 15:39.680
<b>But Arnheid would be difficult.</b>

15:43.690 --> 15:47.070
<b>I know I may be asking for too much,</b>

15:47.150 --> 15:48.480
<b>but Leif,</b>

15:49.440 --> 15:51.820
<b>will you please buy</b>

15:51.900 --> 15:54.990
<b>two more slaves in addition to Thorfinn?</b>

16:10.300 --> 16:11.880
<b>Arnheid…</b>

16:21.390 --> 16:23.690
<b>Jeez, this is boring.</b>

16:23.770 --> 16:27.770
<b>There's a woman in front of me
and I can't even do anything to her.</b>

16:33.110 --> 16:35.280
<b>Stop acting all solemn.</b>

16:35.780 --> 16:38.200
<b>You know, don't you?</b>

16:38.700 --> 16:39.950
<b>The master is just going to</b>

16:40.040 --> 16:44.250
<b>spank you a few times
and forgive you anyway.</b>

16:45.210 --> 16:48.750
<b>He is just so soft when it comes to you.</b>

16:52.380 --> 16:53.630
<b>You're lucky</b>

16:53.720 --> 16:57.260
<b>your punishment wasn't
left up to us guests.</b>

17:00.890 --> 17:04.560
<b>By now you would've been stripped naked</b>

17:04.640 --> 17:08.270
<b>and raped by us all
like nobody's business.</b>

17:09.400 --> 17:12.990
<b>As a way to avenge
our comrades who were killed.</b>

17:14.610 --> 17:16.610
<b>Otherwise,</b>

17:16.700 --> 17:19.410
<b>our comrades
won't be able to rest in peace.</b>

17:20.330 --> 17:22.700
<b>Don't you agree?</b>

17:24.500 --> 17:26.500
<b>What are you doing?</b>

17:27.830 --> 17:29.500
<b>Master!</b>

17:29.590 --> 17:31.550
<b>You are back?</b>

17:37.800 --> 17:39.220
<b>Get out.</b>

17:39.800 --> 17:43.140
<b>I have business with Arnheid.</b>

17:43.930 --> 17:46.390
<b>Master, I was just… um…</b>

17:46.480 --> 17:47.640
<b>Get out.</b>

17:59.070 --> 18:02.160
<b>You tried to run away from me?</b>

18:05.370 --> 18:07.790
<b>Why, Arnheid?</b>

18:08.330 --> 18:09.670
<b>Why?</b>

18:25.100 --> 18:26.600
<b>Why?</b>

18:28.140 --> 18:30.560
<b>Why don't you understand?</b>

18:31.900 --> 18:34.530
<b>What was it all for…?</b>

18:38.990 --> 18:41.280
<b>Do you look down on me?</b>

18:44.990 --> 18:48.370
<b>I won't forgive anyone
who robs me of my pride.</b>

18:49.670 --> 18:51.210
<b>Even if that someone</b>

18:51.790 --> 18:53.210
<b>is you,</b>

18:54.170 --> 18:55.630
<b>Arnheid.</b>

19:01.760 --> 19:02.970
<b>Stop…</b>

19:03.930 --> 19:05.220
<b>Not my belly…</b>

19:06.720 --> 19:09.230
<b>There's a baby inside…</b>

19:12.560 --> 19:16.230
<b>There is a baby inside my belly.</b>

19:16.320 --> 19:19.490
<b>Please have mercy on me.</b>

19:23.320 --> 19:24.910
<b>Whose child is it?</b>

19:27.740 --> 19:31.580
<b>I swear… I swear it is your child, Master.</b>

19:31.670 --> 19:34.000
<b>It's true. Please believe me.</b>

19:35.790 --> 19:38.010
<b>"Believe"?</b>

19:41.680 --> 19:42.840
<b>You were…</b>

19:44.050 --> 19:47.640
<b>You were the only one I believed.</b>

19:52.900 --> 19:55.770
<b>Believe in what?</b>

19:56.400 --> 19:58.530
<b>What does it mean to believe?</b>

19:58.610 --> 20:02.030
<b><i>"It's true"? "It's real"?</i></b>

20:02.990 --> 20:06.030
<b><i>I didn't doubt it for a second.</i></b>

20:06.120 --> 20:08.040
<b><i>And to lose it…</i></b>

20:08.120 --> 20:11.540
<b>I will not allow it!</b>

20:12.160 --> 20:15.540
<b>I will make you pay, you thieves!</b>

20:16.170 --> 20:19.170
<b>I will punish you with my own hands!</b>

20:27.010 --> 20:28.260
<b>Arnheid!</b>

20:33.850 --> 20:36.940
<b>Considering the gravity
of Arnheid's crime,</b>

20:37.020 --> 20:39.020
<b>flogging is a valid punishment.</b>

20:40.030 --> 20:43.280
<b>But if you keep hitting her,
it will turn into a death penalty.</b>

20:44.700 --> 20:47.620
<b>Arnheid is your slave, Master.</b>

20:48.120 --> 20:51.200
<b>You have the right to kill her.</b>

20:52.410 --> 20:54.250
<b>Are you okay with a death penalty?</b>

20:54.750 --> 20:58.380
<b>If you're okay with that,
I will let go of this stick.</b>

21:21.280 --> 21:23.940
<b>Treat her wounds, Pater.</b>

21:29.830 --> 21:30.950
<b>So scary…</b>

21:33.870 --> 21:37.120
<b>Ketil! If you don't want
that slave girl anymore,</b>

21:37.210 --> 21:40.130
<b>will you please sell her to me?</b>

21:42.920 --> 21:47.010
<b>I heard you had two more slaves
other than Thorfinn</b>

21:47.090 --> 21:49.590
<b>and that both of them are his friends.</b>

21:50.100 --> 21:51.890
<b>I will pay you money,</b>

21:52.810 --> 21:54.810
<b>so please give them to me.</b>

22:00.940 --> 22:03.480
<b>Who said I don't want her?</b>

22:04.820 --> 22:07.200
<b>As for Thorfinn and Einar,</b>

22:07.280 --> 22:09.990
<b>you can take them wherever you want.</b>

22:11.580 --> 22:14.160
<b>But I won't sell Arnheid.</b>

22:15.660 --> 22:17.370
<b>That woman</b>

22:18.670 --> 22:20.580
<b>belongs to me.</b>

22:47.780 --> 22:49.610
<b>She's alive.</b>

22:50.200 --> 22:52.950
<b>But she's still unconscious.</b>

22:54.330 --> 22:56.910
<b>I don't know if she'll make it.</b>

23:04.130 --> 23:06.380
<b>No, don't touch her, Einar.</b>

23:06.460 --> 23:08.010
<b>She shouldn't be moved.</b>

23:20.270 --> 23:22.270
<b><i>Unforgivable…</i></b>

23:23.020 --> 23:25.820
<b>Every single one of them is a thief.</b>

23:26.320 --> 23:28.690
<b>Everything that I've nurtured…</b>

23:28.780 --> 23:31.240
<b>Everything that I cherish…</b>

23:31.320 --> 23:33.530
<b>They're trying to steal it away.</b>

23:33.620 --> 23:36.990
<b>Dad! Where were you?</b>

23:37.080 --> 23:39.580
<b>There's a ton of things we need to do.</b>

23:40.870 --> 23:43.170
<b>Also, I need armor…</b>

23:43.670 --> 23:45.170
<b>Hey, Dad!</b>

23:51.880 --> 23:57.180
<b>Unforgivable… You thieves…
I will punish you.</b>

24:02.980 --> 24:04.770
<b>I don't care</b>
