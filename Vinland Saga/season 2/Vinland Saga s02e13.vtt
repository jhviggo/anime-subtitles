00:26.080 --> 00:31.880
<b>Dark Clouds</b>

00:26.080 --> 00:31.880
<b>Dark Clouds</b>

01:56.240 --> 02:00.100
I'm sorry. I was wrong!

02:01.140 --> 02:04.540
I'll apologize for everything!

02:04.540 --> 02:06.260
Forgive me.

02:07.640 --> 02:10.490
I'll release you.

02:10.490 --> 02:12.520
I swear to Odin, I will.

02:12.520 --> 02:14.920
Money! I'll even give you money.

02:14.920 --> 02:16.650
I'll give you as much as you want.

02:20.530 --> 02:22.300
That's not enough.

02:23.600 --> 02:31.040
It'll take more than that to wipe away 
the insults I've suffered until today.

02:32.870 --> 02:36.670
You try being a slave for once.

02:36.670 --> 02:41.770
You won't understand the
 depths of my rage otherwise.

02:45.880 --> 02:47.420
Okay!

02:49.390 --> 02:52.430
I'll become <i>your</i> slave.

02:52.430 --> 02:54.400
I'll serve you.

02:54.880 --> 03:00.700
As of today, you'll be the master, 
and I'll be the slave.

03:00.700 --> 03:05.350
Please, just spare my life, master.

03:09.010 --> 03:13.880
I see. So you'll become my slave.

03:14.770 --> 03:17.830
Yes, gladly.

03:22.760 --> 03:27.180
Then whether you live or die...

03:28.290 --> 03:32.140
is up to me.

03:57.120 --> 03:58.950
It's been a long time.

04:00.790 --> 04:04.730
Now I must go get her.

05:55.990 --> 06:02.900
I guess we won't be visiting 
Mister Sverkel to borrow his horse anymore.

06:05.360 --> 06:07.630
Why do you look so sullen?

06:08.520 --> 06:09.740
I, um...

06:10.800 --> 06:12.990
Have you already made your decision?

06:12.990 --> 06:14.950
Huh? About what?

06:16.090 --> 06:20.270
What you're going to do once you're free.

06:20.270 --> 06:22.920
Oh, that.

06:25.240 --> 06:32.200
How would you like to continue working 
for me as my retainers once you're free?

06:32.840 --> 06:36.520
I'd gladly welcome a couple 
of hard workers like you.

06:38.720 --> 06:44.140
I know what the master said, 
but I don't know.

06:45.240 --> 06:47.820
I've lived too long as a slave.

06:47.820 --> 06:52.540
I can't make a decision now that 
I'm free to choose whatever I want.

06:53.170 --> 06:54.760
That's odd.

06:55.500 --> 06:59.690
Does that mean you'd consider staying here?

07:02.200 --> 07:06.280
It's true that we don't have a good 
relationship with the retainers.

07:07.590 --> 07:15.670
But if I stay here, I might eventually 
get a chance to free Arnheid.

07:18.480 --> 07:19.790
I'm surprised.

07:20.380 --> 07:22.400
You're that in love with her?

07:22.400 --> 07:25.100
Don't. It's not like that.

07:27.440 --> 07:29.110
I just...

07:30.840 --> 07:32.920
You're taking forever, Gramps!

07:32.920 --> 07:34.780
Are you trying to kill me?

07:42.320 --> 07:45.450
Where's the old man? He's not with you?

07:46.430 --> 07:48.150
Huh? Oh...

07:48.680 --> 07:52.030
The old master isn't back yet?

07:52.030 --> 07:54.660
Not since he left for his farm this morning.

07:57.280 --> 08:02.370
Damn it. It's already time for dinner.

08:03.040 --> 08:05.850
He asked us to chop wood for him.

08:05.850 --> 08:10.100
That's odd. Normally he'd be home by now.

08:11.360 --> 08:15.280
I skipped lunch, too. Damn it, Gramps!

08:15.280 --> 08:16.680
Are you trying to kill...

08:19.070 --> 08:20.070
Huh?

08:22.650 --> 08:24.600
Where... Where are you going?

08:25.830 --> 08:27.860
To the farm. Follow me.

08:28.580 --> 08:30.020
The farm?

08:52.470 --> 08:53.560
Gramps...

08:56.070 --> 09:00.940
Hey, Gramps. Hang in there. Gramps!

09:43.170 --> 09:50.570
So I'm going to die in bed 
and not on my farm.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.820
It's open. Let yourself in.

10:05.960 --> 10:07.510
Excuse me.

10:08.780 --> 10:14.100
The mistress instructed me to come.

10:21.400 --> 10:24.420
W-Wow...

10:25.520 --> 10:30.850
I-Is there enough here for us, too, Arnheid?

10:32.200 --> 10:33.320
Yes.

10:33.680 --> 10:37.670
The old master said it would be all right 
for me to cook for you as well.

10:37.670 --> 10:40.200
I'm not sure if you'll like it, though.

10:41.810 --> 10:45.210
Oh, I see none of you pray first...

10:42.720 --> 10:44.160
So good!

10:44.160 --> 10:45.580
Delicious!

10:46.130 --> 10:47.480
It's so good!

10:47.480 --> 10:50.670
Master, please have something to eat.

10:47.840 --> 10:49.560
This is delicious!

10:52.480 --> 10:56.170
Starting today, I'll be taking care of you.

10:56.510 --> 10:58.580
I'll do anything you ask.

10:57.640 --> 10:58.760
So good!

10:58.760 --> 11:00.640
Have you had some of this?

11:00.640 --> 11:02.640
Will you be staying at my house?

11:02.360 --> 11:04.120
Have some of this!

11:04.120 --> 11:05.180
What is that?

11:04.120 --> 11:08.310
Yes, that's what the mistress told me to do.

11:08.740 --> 11:10.600
Is it so good it hurts?

11:09.490 --> 11:10.730
Now eat.

11:10.600 --> 11:11.740
You okay?

11:11.740 --> 11:15.480
Let me know if you don't like how it tastes.

11:17.910 --> 11:20.920
I don't need any. I'll eat later.

11:20.920 --> 11:23.320
I'm not hungry right now.

11:26.020 --> 11:27.450
Oh, I see.

11:28.320 --> 11:32.120
Don't mind him. 
Just shove the spoon in his mouth.

11:32.120 --> 11:32.870
What?

11:33.600 --> 11:38.720
Gramps is just embarrassed about being fed.

11:38.720 --> 11:40.800
Get used to it, Gramps.

11:40.800 --> 11:45.900
Until you've recovered, 
you're going to be fed for a while.

11:47.830 --> 11:49.740
Did you just laugh?

11:50.710 --> 11:52.060
N-No.

11:53.240 --> 11:56.670
I'm really not hungry. I'll eat laterâ€”

12:12.340 --> 12:15.020
Get out of here!

12:25.380 --> 12:27.950
I'll wash the dishes.

12:27.950 --> 12:30.100
No, I'll do it.

12:34.070 --> 12:39.400
I'm glad the old master seems to be 
doing better than I'd heard.

12:40.400 --> 12:43.980
And he doesn't seem as scary as they say.

12:44.520 --> 12:48.510
Yeah. He's actually a kind man at heart.

12:48.510 --> 12:50.370
He can be scary sometimes, though.

12:52.440 --> 12:54.500
I think I know what you mean.

12:55.590 --> 12:56.280
Hmph.

12:57.750 --> 12:58.680
But...

13:05.300 --> 13:12.040
I haven't had so much fun 
at a meal in a long time.

13:12.040 --> 13:13.640
Neither have I.

13:16.660 --> 13:21.580
It was like I was free again.

13:26.600 --> 13:30.010
You're right. It did feel like that.

13:48.900 --> 13:52.870
Hey, slaves. Is Snake around?

13:55.300 --> 13:56.970
A runaway slave?

13:57.960 --> 14:02.320
Yeah. He escaped from 
Kjallakr's farm three days ago.

14:03.220 --> 14:06.390
That Kjallakr, huh?

14:06.880 --> 14:11.340
He's always treated his slaves poorly.

14:11.340 --> 14:12.950
He got what he deserved.

14:13.440 --> 14:17.120
Actually, it's not that simple.

14:17.120 --> 14:23.740
The slave killed Kjallakr and his sons 
and set his house on fire.

14:24.780 --> 14:27.800
He's a violent man and a skilled fighter.

14:31.580 --> 14:36.440
Kjallakr's uncle said he'd give three 
horses to whoever catches him.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.710
What should we do, boss?

14:40.060 --> 14:45.300
The three horses aside, 
we should probably take precautions.

14:46.910 --> 14:52.280
Keep watch in groups of three for a while.

14:53.780 --> 14:58.730
Even if you spot him, 
don't try too hard to catch him.

14:59.220 --> 15:01.430
Call for reinforcements first.

15:04.340 --> 15:10.200
There's no telling 
what a cornered man will do.

15:57.720 --> 15:59.450
Look. That's him.

16:00.480 --> 16:03.600
That's his hilt catching the sun.

16:04.200 --> 16:07.680
Is he sleeping?

16:07.680 --> 16:13.180
Looks like it. Just based on appearances, 
he looks like a beggar or pilgrim.

16:13.180 --> 16:15.450
He looks pretty suspicious, right?

16:15.850 --> 16:17.780
Yeah, sure does.

16:18.120 --> 16:21.880
Hey, keep your voices down.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.550
Does that mean it's him?

16:23.550 --> 16:25.830
The guy worth three horses...

16:25.830 --> 16:28.120
Yeah, it's gotta be.

16:28.120 --> 16:28.860
Hey.

16:29.600 --> 16:31.690
It's our lucky day.

16:31.690 --> 16:34.110
You idiot, you can't assume that.

16:33.670 --> 16:36.230
Hey, keep your voices down.

16:34.110 --> 16:34.590
Huh?

16:34.880 --> 16:37.080
Isn't he supposed to be pretty tough?

16:37.080 --> 16:41.900
We'll be fine. We'll bag him easily 
while he's still asleep.

16:40.180 --> 16:41.900
Guys, keep your voices down.

16:41.900 --> 16:44.690
We should call for help, like the boss said.

16:44.990 --> 16:47.080
Don't be a wuss, Lizard.

16:47.080 --> 16:50.220
If we call for help, 
we'll get smaller shares.

16:50.220 --> 16:53.320
I told you to keep your voices down.

16:53.320 --> 16:57.260
How are you so confident when we 
don't even know how strong he is?

16:57.260 --> 16:58.940
The reward is horses.

16:58.940 --> 17:03.550
If we catch him now, 
each of us gets a whole horse.

17:03.550 --> 17:05.530
It's not gonna go that well.

17:05.530 --> 17:08.080
Keep your voices down.

17:06.120 --> 17:10.360
There's nothing wrong with butchering a horse 
and cooking a leg or two to eat, fatty.

17:10.360 --> 17:11.870
What was that, you shrimp?

17:11.870 --> 17:14.040
If you're so desperate to die, 
go die by yourself.

17:14.040 --> 17:16.010
I'll kill you first.

17:16.010 --> 17:18.200
Not if I kill you first.

17:16.950 --> 17:20.650
Keep your voices down, idiots.

17:18.200 --> 17:19.790
Bring it on.

17:51.400 --> 17:53.610
Man, it's hot.

18:03.670 --> 18:04.540
Okay.

18:09.840 --> 18:12.650
Thorfinn, I've got a lot of 
chopped wood waiting here.

18:12.920 --> 18:14.840
Keep 'em moving.

18:16.480 --> 18:19.370
Hey, Thorfinn.

18:22.420 --> 18:25.020
S-Sorry, one second.

18:27.860 --> 18:29.060
Sure thing.

18:30.280 --> 18:33.130
What is Thorfinn doing?

18:33.560 --> 18:37.670
Snake is reading the Bible inside.

18:38.060 --> 18:42.970
The old master can't read himself. 
Thorfinn's eavesdropping on them.

18:42.970 --> 18:47.890
I see. So Thorfinn is a Christian, too.

18:48.430 --> 18:53.900
No, but he says it's interesting.

18:57.330 --> 19:06.090
"You have heard that it was said, 'You shall 
love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'"

19:06.700 --> 19:15.780
"But I say to you, love your enemies and 
pray for those who persecute you,"

19:16.950 --> 19:20.800
"so that you may be sons of 
your Father who is in heaven;"

19:21.320 --> 19:26.310
"for He causes His sun 
to rise on the evil and the good,"

19:26.720 --> 19:33.100
"and sends rain on the righteous 
and the unrighteous."

19:34.420 --> 19:42.620
"For if you love those who love you, 
what reward do you have?"

19:44.700 --> 19:48.870
"Do not even the tax collectors do the same?"

19:49.330 --> 19:56.920
"If you greet only your brothers, 
what more are you doing than others?"

19:57.580 --> 20:02.340
"Do not even the Gentiles do the same?"

20:02.700 --> 20:12.730
"Therefore you are to be perfect, 
as your heavenly Father is perfect."

20:13.360 --> 20:16.620
Good grief, that's ridiculous.

20:17.390 --> 20:20.830
Gramps, I'm sick of the Gospel.

20:20.830 --> 20:22.520
Let's read the first bit again.

20:22.520 --> 20:24.360
It's more interesting than this, at least.

20:27.350 --> 20:30.140
Hey, Gramps, what are you doing?

20:30.140 --> 20:31.270
Going for a piss?

20:31.680 --> 20:34.960
The... The wheat...

20:35.600 --> 20:39.450
I must harvest the wheat.

20:40.950 --> 20:45.640
I told you, they finished 
the harvest a while ago.

20:45.640 --> 20:47.220
Stay in bed.

20:50.680 --> 20:52.150
Arnheid!

20:52.600 --> 20:55.060
Gramps pissed himself. Do you mind?

20:55.480 --> 20:56.350
Got it.

20:58.500 --> 20:59.990
I'll help, too.

21:07.380 --> 21:10.370
He's gone senile.

21:10.840 --> 21:13.750
He probably doesn't have much longer to live.

21:14.170 --> 21:14.800
What?

21:14.800 --> 21:15.500
What?

21:16.000 --> 21:21.420
But he's well enough to go out 
on the farm every day.

21:21.420 --> 21:25.130
Yeah, and he always goes fishing 
a couple times a day.

21:25.610 --> 21:28.160
But he's old enough to have great-grandkids.

21:28.160 --> 21:31.860
Old folks suddenly lose all their strength 
once their legs start to go.

21:32.800 --> 21:36.100
But it won't be right away.

21:36.490 --> 21:41.020
You guys should repay his kindness 
while you still have the chance.

21:44.390 --> 21:48.360
There's something I've been wondering.

21:48.840 --> 21:53.200
What's your relationship with the old master?

21:53.530 --> 21:58.080
Huh? It's nothing special.

21:59.520 --> 22:05.100
I'm just planning to inherit and sell 
that book once Gramps kicks the bucket.

22:09.420 --> 22:13.690
Get back to work. The sun's setting.

22:13.690 --> 22:14.630
Right.

22:32.990 --> 22:33.980
Ow!

22:35.080 --> 22:37.080
Ouch...

23:01.780 --> 23:03.480
He's riding fast.

23:03.480 --> 23:04.950
Is it one of my men?

23:06.320 --> 23:07.900
No...

23:08.280 --> 23:10.780
Hey, you on the horse. Stop!

23:11.920 --> 23:14.160
Boss!

23:15.470 --> 23:19.410
That's him! The runaway slave!

23:19.900 --> 23:23.920
He killed Lizard! Get him!

23:24.260 --> 23:26.800
Seriously? Damn it.

23:27.400 --> 23:29.170
My sword's inside the house.

23:31.040 --> 23:31.940
It can't be...

23:40.800 --> 23:42.190
Gardar!

23:56.560 --> 23:57.960
Arnheid!

24:03.750 --> 24:06.090
I've finally found you,

24:07.010 --> 24:08.980
my wife!

25:51.730 --> 25:55.110
<b>Freedom</b>

25:51.730 --> 25:55.110
<b>Freedom</b>

25:52.940 --> 25:54.090
"Freedom."
