WEBVTT

00:29.520 --> 00:30.970
Is that the last one?

00:30.970 --> 00:31.780
Yes.

00:37.160 --> 00:41.400
I doubt Ketil's forces 
have any will to fight left.

00:41.400 --> 00:44.940
I'll send a messenger 
recommending they surrender.

00:45.620 --> 00:46.600
Your Majesty.

00:48.660 --> 00:52.310
Would it be all right if we 
requisitioned some homes on the farm?

00:52.820 --> 00:56.860
My men are tired of camping out in tents.

00:56.860 --> 00:57.850
No.

00:58.660 --> 01:02.220
All forces are forbidden 
from entering the farm.

01:03.170 --> 01:05.880
If the soldiers enter the village, 
they'll begin pillaging.

01:06.570 --> 01:09.790
Pillaging is the victor's right.

01:10.140 --> 01:15.780
The goal of this battle is to requisition 
the entire farm, not pillage it.

01:17.270 --> 01:22.280
I shall provide the Jomsvikings 
with an adequate reward.

01:25.330 --> 01:26.980
As you command.

01:38.180 --> 01:43.820
You're showing them mercy now, Canute?

01:45.200 --> 01:51.290
You are right. This is what a king does.

01:52.130 --> 01:54.570
To achieve his grand purpose,

01:54.570 --> 02:00.390
he spares those who should live, 
and slays those he must kill.

02:00.770 --> 02:04.100
The masses could never bear 
such a heavy responsibility.

02:05.720 --> 02:10.480
This world is still far from 
being a paradise. It's hell.

02:10.480 --> 02:14.530
And hell has its own laws.

02:15.600 --> 02:23.020
Canute, you killed your 
father and your brother.

02:23.020 --> 02:30.090
Keep killing until your 
corpse-lined road reaches paradise.

03:09.010 --> 03:15.530
Thank you, Einar and Thorfinn.

03:17.360 --> 03:19.550
Thank you.

05:27.930 --> 05:32.640
<b>Courage</b>

05:27.930 --> 05:32.640
<b>Courage</b>

05:52.490 --> 05:54.080
Hold him still.

05:54.080 --> 05:55.920
It's no use. He's already dead.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.790
I need hot water over here.

05:57.790 --> 05:59.940
Kill me!

06:00.760 --> 06:02.230
Young master...

06:06.470 --> 06:07.820
Young master...

06:11.800 --> 06:16.730
My father's hands are gone.

06:25.440 --> 06:34.060
Y-Y-Young master, please look 
after my daughter and family.

06:45.920 --> 06:51.550
You can't even cut a pig.

06:59.490 --> 07:00.810
Young master?

07:08.480 --> 07:09.820
Young master!

07:16.380 --> 07:18.340
Are you all right?

07:18.920 --> 07:21.330
Are you injured as well?

07:23.830 --> 07:27.160
Is it your stomach? Does your stomach hurt?

07:28.820 --> 07:30.730
You should lie down.

07:44.440 --> 07:48.150
They have advised us to
 surrender a second time.

07:48.660 --> 07:52.900
The entire clan surrendering is 
their condition for a truce.

07:53.320 --> 07:56.570
You'll still be subjected to outlawry.

07:58.240 --> 08:02.860
You need to decide if we'll 
continue fighting or surrender.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.710
Y-You can't be serious!

08:06.030 --> 08:09.530
I refuse to be banished from the country.

08:09.530 --> 08:12.970
What do they expect us to do? 
Leave this land and become beggars?

08:12.970 --> 08:17.400
Snake, this happened because 
you're a spineless coward.

08:18.540 --> 08:21.050
You freeloader!

08:23.480 --> 08:24.620
Boss!

08:24.620 --> 08:26.060
You hag!

08:26.060 --> 08:27.380
Don't, Fox.

08:29.160 --> 08:33.360
If we say we'll keep fighting, 
what will you do, Snake?

08:35.480 --> 08:37.120
Fight along with you.

08:39.970 --> 08:41.750
That's what I wanted to hear.

08:42.200 --> 08:45.770
Don't worry, Mom. I'll handle this.

08:45.770 --> 08:50.630
Twenty men is enough to take the king's head.

08:53.010 --> 08:57.960
Defeating a larger force with only a handful 
of men is a glorious way for a man to go out.

08:59.010 --> 09:01.610
Calm down, Thorgil.

09:01.610 --> 09:04.600
That's not your decision to make.

09:04.990 --> 09:07.900
What? No, it's gotta be me.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.380
Dad's out of it.

09:10.780 --> 09:13.030
Are you saying you want to decide, Grandpa?

09:13.530 --> 09:15.450
It's not my decision, either.

09:16.260 --> 09:21.430
There's someone Ketil named as his successor.

09:48.400 --> 09:50.310
We'll surrender.

09:51.010 --> 09:51.900
What?

09:51.900 --> 09:54.160
How could you say that?

09:54.160 --> 09:57.150
Doesn't that embarrass you as a Norse man?

10:03.440 --> 10:04.730
It's embarrassing.

10:05.810 --> 10:07.290
It's embarrassing, but...

10:09.190 --> 10:10.410
I'm scared.

10:11.670 --> 10:16.640
I'm scared of people dying.

10:16.640 --> 10:18.820
I'm scared I might die.

10:20.310 --> 10:22.620
They can banish me or do 
whatever else they want with me.

10:23.230 --> 10:27.310
I just want this to be over.

10:29.190 --> 10:31.440
You can't be serious, Olmar.

10:31.440 --> 10:34.560
You wanted so badly to fight.

10:34.560 --> 10:37.940
You're the one who started this war.

10:38.880 --> 10:41.770
That's right. It's my fault.

10:42.380 --> 10:45.450
They mocked me for screwing up.

10:46.050 --> 10:48.020
I got mad and tried to show off.

10:50.210 --> 10:52.840
I'm sorry to Mom and everyone else.

10:53.590 --> 10:59.100
But because I started this, 
I want to end this.

11:02.430 --> 11:06.420
Sorry, I misspoke.

11:07.120 --> 11:10.850
The king wanted this farm from the start.

11:11.600 --> 11:15.610
But I gave them an excuse to start a war.

11:16.670 --> 11:21.370
People will always find a reason to fight.

11:21.370 --> 11:24.320
If it wasn't you, it would've been me or Dad.

11:24.920 --> 11:27.670
You defended your honor then.

11:28.200 --> 11:31.100
Right, Olmar? You did good.

11:31.100 --> 11:33.330
Your honor is more important than your life.

11:34.150 --> 11:38.230
Show us the courage of a
 Norse warrior one more time.

11:39.840 --> 11:40.970
No!

11:44.470 --> 11:47.850
That's not courage!

11:48.840 --> 11:52.730
I screwed up in the presence of the king.

11:53.670 --> 11:57.320
I'm an incompetent man 
who deserves to be mocked.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.000
But...

12:01.620 --> 12:03.400
But...

12:05.360 --> 12:13.020
I didn't have the courage to 
silently accept their mockery.

12:20.910 --> 12:25.380
I can't be like you, Brother.

12:26.100 --> 12:29.160
I don't care about 
the honor of Norse warriors.

12:31.650 --> 12:33.300
I'm going to surrender.

12:34.360 --> 12:36.120
Mock me if you want.

12:48.630 --> 12:52.290
The acting head of the family 
has made his decision.

12:52.780 --> 12:57.380
Olmar, go tell King Canute your decision.

13:02.840 --> 13:04.390
I'll go with you.

13:10.820 --> 13:14.090
I won't mock you, young master.

13:19.490 --> 13:21.150
I don't have time for this crap.

13:23.300 --> 13:25.030
Move. You're in the way.

13:26.390 --> 13:29.030
Wait. Where are you going, Thorgil?

13:29.290 --> 13:30.500
Shut up.

13:31.110 --> 13:33.340
Later, cowards.

13:47.650 --> 13:54.010
It's true that many have been 
supported by your strength.

13:55.600 --> 13:59.510
But I know you've seen it, too.

14:00.690 --> 14:06.250
How those possessed by 
wealth and power end up.

14:11.190 --> 14:15.430
But you haven't lost all of this for nothing.

14:17.860 --> 14:24.760
In exchange for your farm, 
your son has become a man.

14:35.270 --> 14:36.470
Why?

14:37.040 --> 14:38.980
Why did you let him go?

14:39.490 --> 14:43.860
Haven't you been looking for 
Thorfinn all this time?

14:43.860 --> 14:48.550
Didn't you come here to 
take Thorfinn back home?

14:50.790 --> 14:57.370
You're right. That oath has 
kept me going all this time.

14:58.200 --> 15:03.260
No matter how many times I lost him, 
I kept looking for him.

15:05.960 --> 15:08.300
I won't break my oath to my friend.

15:09.700 --> 15:15.260
But Thorfinn is being moved by 
something bigger than that now.

15:16.290 --> 15:19.740
Thorfinn said he'd come back.

15:21.080 --> 15:24.250
I trust what I saw in those eyes.

15:28.600 --> 15:29.500
<i>Thorfinn...</i>

15:55.450 --> 16:01.060
So, what? You're not part of 
Ketil's clan, shorty?

16:02.290 --> 16:05.500
My name is Thorfinn, son of Thors.

16:05.980 --> 16:08.570
I'm a retainer on this farm.

16:09.440 --> 16:12.150
I've come representing Ketil, 
the owner of the farm.

16:12.840 --> 16:14.820
Please inform His Majesty 
that I'm here to see him.

16:15.460 --> 16:18.580
A retainer? You're a slave, aren't you?

16:21.350 --> 16:23.640
You can always tell when someone's a slave.

16:24.310 --> 16:26.840
They stink like livestock.

16:32.430 --> 16:35.980
You're not good enough.

16:35.980 --> 16:40.600
We'll just keep fighting until 
someone from Ketil's clan shows up.

16:42.310 --> 16:45.610
I've met His Majesty before.

16:46.060 --> 16:49.050
He should know who I am 
if you tell him my name.

16:49.050 --> 16:53.070
Please let him know Thorfinn, 
son of Thors, is here.

17:00.550 --> 17:04.600
You and King Canute know each other?

17:06.240 --> 17:11.910
About four years ago, 
I served as his guard for a short while.

17:24.500 --> 17:27.100
Did that wake you up, shorty?

17:27.880 --> 17:31.830
I've never seen a guard 
as stinky and small as you.

17:33.620 --> 17:36.060
If I offended you, then I apologize.

17:36.060 --> 17:37.690
But it's true.

17:38.150 --> 17:40.250
Please tell His Majesty my name.

17:41.370 --> 17:43.000
Please.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.290
What's the matter, Drott?

17:45.290 --> 17:47.820
He's still talking nonsense.

17:47.820 --> 17:50.830
Apparently your punch was too weak.

17:52.810 --> 17:54.810
You don't wake easily.

17:54.810 --> 18:00.760
You must want me to get you up
gently like your mommy did, huh?

18:02.760 --> 18:03.740
Get him!

18:03.740 --> 18:05.390
You've got this, shorty!

18:05.390 --> 18:06.660
Come on!

18:09.560 --> 18:11.500
Did you determine 
what the commotion is about?

18:11.980 --> 18:15.780
Yes, Your Majesty. Ketil sent a messenger.

18:16.220 --> 18:21.440
Since Ketil himself hasn't come to surrender, 
my men are attempting to send him away,

18:21.440 --> 18:24.540
but he seems to be rather stubborn.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.820
Did you get his name and status?

18:27.820 --> 18:28.600
Yes, Your Majesty.

18:29.690 --> 18:34.800
He identified himself as a retainer on 
the farm named Thorfinn, son of Thors.

18:41.910 --> 18:45.160
Is he a young and small man?

18:45.890 --> 18:47.900
Yes, indeed.

18:48.900 --> 18:50.810
Do you know him?

18:54.320 --> 18:55.980
Get him!

18:58.840 --> 19:02.630
What would you like to do, 
Your Majesty? Will you see him?

19:06.290 --> 19:08.960
No, that won't be necessary.

19:14.210 --> 19:16.330
<i>Son of Thors...</i>

19:17.120 --> 19:18.630
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

19:19.220 --> 19:20.380
Kill him!

19:20.380 --> 19:21.680
Hit him back, shorty!

19:21.680 --> 19:23.720
The eyes! Go for the eyes!

19:25.720 --> 19:28.180
Wait. I don't want to fight.

19:31.730 --> 19:34.480
Oh? He's got some moves.

19:38.040 --> 19:39.980
What's the matter, Drott?

19:39.980 --> 19:42.220
You haven't hit him yet.

19:40.620 --> 19:42.570
Get your shit together!

19:44.810 --> 19:47.320
<i>Damn. I underestimated them.</i>

19:47.320 --> 19:49.980
<i>In any case, I need to change the situation.</i>

19:51.260 --> 19:53.950
Hit him already, Drott.

19:53.950 --> 19:56.380
We can't settle our wagers like this.

20:01.260 --> 20:02.920
All right!

20:02.920 --> 20:05.010
That's the first one!

20:05.010 --> 20:07.020
Get him!

20:05.990 --> 20:08.010
He's still looking lively!

20:08.010 --> 20:09.710
Kill him!

20:09.710 --> 20:10.590
Damn it.

20:11.960 --> 20:12.980
Thorfinn!

20:13.400 --> 20:14.360
Are you all right?

20:14.360 --> 20:17.320
Einar, what are you doing here?

20:17.320 --> 20:20.860
You idiot. I came here to 
stop you, obviously.

20:22.610 --> 20:23.580
Sorry.

20:26.660 --> 20:30.090
Just get up. We're getting out of here.

20:30.090 --> 20:33.280
There's no point in talking to these guys.

20:33.280 --> 20:35.710
Come on, pay up.

20:37.910 --> 20:38.710
Thank you.

20:42.230 --> 20:43.470
Thorfinn?

20:43.820 --> 20:46.470
What are you betting on?

20:48.800 --> 20:53.290
We're betting on how many punches 
it'll take for you to run away crying.

20:53.290 --> 20:55.980
Including unconsciousness or death.

20:56.530 --> 20:59.310
The most popular bet is fewer than ten.

20:59.310 --> 21:02.460
A few have bet on more than 20.

21:03.180 --> 21:05.320
Come on, you've got this.

21:05.320 --> 21:07.740
One more hit, and you can go to sleep.

21:06.530 --> 21:08.120
Hang in there until you've taken ten.

21:09.060 --> 21:10.820
They're unbelievable.

21:12.610 --> 21:16.250
I'd like in on that bet, too.

21:16.750 --> 21:19.130
I'll bet on myself.

21:21.680 --> 21:25.880
I don't need money if I win. Instead...

21:27.600 --> 21:30.460
I'd just like to talk to His Majesty.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.230
Did you guys hear that?

21:37.230 --> 21:40.020
Shorty just proposed 
something real interesting.

21:41.090 --> 21:44.480
All right, fine. I like your guts.

21:44.480 --> 21:48.840
But we're not letting you get away 
with betting on fewer than ten.

21:50.540 --> 21:52.910
What has no one bet on yet?

21:52.910 --> 21:58.040
Well, at least one person's bet on 
everything up to the nineties.

21:59.190 --> 22:01.720
100, then.

22:01.720 --> 22:04.920
If you can withstand 100 blows, you win.

22:05.460 --> 22:08.930
If you lose, we'll take your life.

22:10.040 --> 22:11.100
Fine.

22:11.100 --> 22:12.890
What? You...

22:13.990 --> 22:14.890
Thorfinn!

22:15.540 --> 22:20.150
Do you have to risk that much for Ketil?

22:20.680 --> 22:23.120
This is war.

22:23.120 --> 22:25.680
There's nothing one man can do about it.

22:25.680 --> 22:29.780
Leave this fight to the ones who want it.

22:32.420 --> 22:39.780
I'm glad I ended up on this farm.

22:41.440 --> 22:49.680
I only knew war, but the master, 
Pater, and the old master...

22:50.700 --> 22:54.010
They didn't forsake me. They were kind to me.

22:55.660 --> 22:57.500
I got to meet you, too.

23:01.110 --> 23:04.520
You understand that, don't you?

23:05.820 --> 23:10.500
Are you okay with not returning 
the kindness we received?

23:17.320 --> 23:18.440
Thorfinn...

23:18.440 --> 23:20.080
It's all right, Einar.

23:21.910 --> 23:24.100
There's a trick to getting hit.

23:24.920 --> 23:27.580
And I'm used to getting hit.

23:28.460 --> 23:30.160
Seriously?

23:30.160 --> 23:31.820
That's it, shorty!

23:31.820 --> 23:34.300
Get that big idiot!

23:36.420 --> 23:38.470
He thinks you're a wimp, Drott!

23:39.030 --> 23:41.140
Is your size just for show?

23:41.570 --> 23:43.990
Beat him already!

23:45.060 --> 23:51.990
The great Drott the Bear Killer has 
never been mocked like this before.

23:53.890 --> 23:55.720
I'll kill you.

23:56.870 --> 23:59.520
Is he stupid? He's gonna die!

23:59.520 --> 24:02.010
Make him last at least 20 hits!

24:02.010 --> 24:03.670
Kill him!

25:50.730 --> 25:54.940
<b>The King of Rebellion</b>

25:50.730 --> 25:54.940
<b>The King of Rebellion</b>

25:52.070 --> 25:54.170
"The King of Rebellion."
