00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.060
Your eye is next.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.010
Show me you're afraid.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.060
Don't, Fox!

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:52.760
Snake...

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.280
Aw, man. He's in rough shape.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.210
B-Boss, welcome back. 
Wh-Wh-When did you get here?

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.460
Fox.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.090
Yes, sir.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.680
Come closer.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.820
Y-Yes, sir.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:23.820
Badger.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.010
Yes, sir!

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.740
Explain.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.830
Yes, sir.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.820
Idiots.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.910
You're a bunch of idiots.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.790
<b>Awakening</b>

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.790
<b>Awakening</b>

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.200
What's the point of 
you guys bullying the slaves?

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.380
The young master's gotta do it himself.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.010
Yeah, b-but he...

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.270
H-He... got cheeky with us, so...

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.650
Sorry. These guys are idiots.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.390
I'm Snake.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.560
I'm Thorfinn.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.000
See that, Thorfinn?

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.770
Your body says it wants to live.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.820
I'm going to sleep.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.110
You guys had better 
graciously see them back home.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.130
I know I don't have to tell you...

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.590
that the day you cause 
any more trouble over this matter,

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.360
you won't be able to chew 
your own food anymore.

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:54.590
I didn't hear a "Yes, sir."

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.050
Yes, sir!

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.770
Thorfinn, you...

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.310
Do I want to live?

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.570
Live...

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.590
Live, and do what?

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:16.820
I see.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.410
Besides your ear, 
none of your injuries are very deep.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.650
Once they're healed, you'll be good as new.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.950
I'm sorry you two had to go through that.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:37.700
The master doesn't know what to do 
about his guests' misbehavior either.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:39.590
"Misbehavior?"

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.690
Their "misbehavior" nearly got us killed.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.330
It's not as though they'd actually kill you.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:49.650
You're wrong.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.510
If their boss Snake hadn't shown up, 
they really would've killed us.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:03.640
Guys like them think our lives are
 worth less than those of insects.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.070
Either way, we couldn't help it.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.570
The strong kill the weak.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.290
It's only natural.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.290
What did you just say?

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.370
Now, now, Einar.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:29.690
If they try to mess with you again, 
come talk to me instead of going with them.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:34.040
More importantly, 
we can't allow your wounds to fester.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.550
I'll put some medicine on them.

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:37.810
Medicine?

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.100
U-Uh, Pater, we don't...

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.930
Don't worry about paying me for the medicine.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.260
It's my responsibility to look after you two.

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:53.190
I'm sorry I struck a nerve.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:59.960
No, it's fine. Thank you.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.670
You'd better thank Arnheid, too.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:11.190
She ran all around the farm 
to tell me what happened.

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:21.050
Rest for today.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.200
I'll talk to the master about it.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.440
Also...

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.040
It's one of my old shirts, 
so it's probably a bit large for you,

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.940
but Thorfinn, you can have this.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:35.190
After all, yours is full of holes 
after what they did.

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:46.580
Don't you have anything to say to Pater?

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:57.690
Listen, you. You're supposed to say 
"thank you" in these situations.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:58.440
Go on.

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.530
Say it.

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:09.560
Why haven't you been saying anything, anyway?

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.840
It's not nice, 
when everyone's being kind to you.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:18.330
It's fine. I know Thorfinn doesn't say much.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:26.660
Thank you.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.970
Hey, where are you going?

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:53.380
He said we don't have to 
harvest wheat today.

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:55.980
I'm going to the woods.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.360
These injuries are nothing.

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:08.330
Wait up. I'll go with you.

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:46.610
<i>The way he moved when Snake attacked him...</i>

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:50.970
<i>He's no ordinary man.</i>

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:54.890
<i>And...</i>

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.020
The strong kill the weak.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.850
It's only natural.

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:15.320
Thorfinn.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.700
Have you ever been to war?

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:29.010
Yes.

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:39.290
Have you killed people?

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:42.370
Yes.

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:52.790
How many?

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:58.420
Five men? Ten?

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.810
Why do you want to know?

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:10.690
I thought you didn't like war.

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:15.380
Timber.

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:40.150
I don't remember how many.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.490
I've killed a lot of people.

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:52.120
I was on the battlefield since 
around the time I was five or six.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.610
I joined the Danish army's 
invasion of England.

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.770
I was a warrior.

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.210
Do you hate me now, Einar?

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:05.430
I was a warrior.

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:09.400
Do you hate me now, Einar?

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:55.370
I don't remember how many.

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:11.050
I've killed a lot of people.

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:33.050
Found you.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:42.680
Damn kid. Die!

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:53.960
You brat.

00:16:55.610 --> 00:17:00.620
Kill. Kill him. Die!

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:29.810
Damn it!

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:03.960
Einar...

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:14.760
Why do you wake me 
every time I cry out in my sleep?

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:32.450
I've killed people. I've killed a lot of people.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:41.250
From battle to battle, I've attacked
 villages and killed a lot of people.

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:48.570
I'm no different from the people

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:52.850
who killed your family.

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:13.490
Do you...

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:19.210
Does anything good come from being alive?

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.090
Not for me.

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:35.270
Not a single good thing has 
happened to me in my entire life.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:49.410
Do you want to die?

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:55.390
I don't know what kind of 
terrible fate you've suffered.

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:58.920
I don't want to know what kind of hell 
you've lived through, either.

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:09.120
But we're able to chit-chat, 
eat, shit, and sleep in this hell...

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:21.590
because someone kept us alive.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.510
How can you say nothing good's 
ever happened to you?

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:33.610
You're wrong.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.450
You're wrong!

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:43.090
Asshole.

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:46.970
Don't act so spoiled.

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:15.210
Besides...

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:21.830
It's not like you killed my family.

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:27.700
Don't be so arrogant.

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:45.570
Thank you, Einar.

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:52.720
Thank you for waking me.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.560
Jeez...

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:06.550
I can't get enough sleep because 
you won't stop talking in yours.

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:10.410
I see.

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:18.510
I'm sorry, Einar.

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:20.280
Just go to sleep already.

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:54.940
<b>Path of Blood</b>

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:54.940
<b>Path of Blood</b>

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:54.470
"Path of Blood."
