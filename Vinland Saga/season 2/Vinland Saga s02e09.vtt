00:42.590 --> 00:43.380
Huh?

01:03.790 --> 01:05.830
Oh, whew.

01:07.640 --> 01:09.550
It was just a dream.

01:10.380 --> 01:13.500
Boy, that was scary.

01:13.500 --> 01:16.440
Father had been killed.

01:16.440 --> 01:21.610
I wandered across battlefields 
fighting men who were like monsters.

01:22.260 --> 01:24.710
And in the end, I became a slave.

01:32.550 --> 01:34.250
I'm glad I'm here.

01:42.330 --> 01:43.810
<i>It's so peaceful.</i>

01:59.450 --> 02:02.140
What's with this guy?

02:02.140 --> 02:04.560
H-He's so persistent.

02:04.560 --> 02:08.980
Stay down already!

02:12.630 --> 02:14.390
Damn it.

02:17.550 --> 02:22.010
What's wrong? I'll keep fighting.

02:23.620 --> 02:32.510
Let's find out if we're beneath you or not!

02:39.210 --> 02:41.690
I don't have time for this.

02:42.260 --> 02:46.220
Aw, man. I've had enough.

02:49.470 --> 02:51.480
You'd better prepare yourselves.

02:52.320 --> 02:58.390
You slaves have got some serious punishment 
waiting for you after going this wild.

03:10.770 --> 03:13.240
We won.

04:49.310 --> 04:55.600
<b>Oath</b>

04:49.310 --> 04:55.600
<b>Oath</b>

05:10.650 --> 05:11.810
Father!

05:16.710 --> 05:18.820
Listen to this.

05:18.820 --> 05:21.270
I just had a crazy dream.

05:22.210 --> 05:25.090
A bunch of arrows came flying, and youâ€”

05:25.090 --> 05:27.340
I smell blood.

05:28.210 --> 05:29.130
Huh?

05:31.290 --> 05:32.910
Who did you kill...

05:35.150 --> 05:36.690
with that knife?

05:39.190 --> 05:40.050
What?

06:23.150 --> 06:25.450
It was to protect you.

06:28.210 --> 06:31.030
That strength was for protecting you.

06:34.180 --> 06:36.870
I'm sorry, Thorfinn.

06:38.510 --> 06:41.790
I still had things to tell you.

06:43.170 --> 06:46.830
There was still so much 
I needed to teach you.

06:51.790 --> 06:55.150
No. Father...

06:57.880 --> 07:00.980
I... This is...

07:01.320 --> 07:02.770
I'm sorry...

07:02.070 --> 07:04.980
I did this!

07:05.570 --> 07:08.000
...for leaving you alone.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.660
Father, wait! Wait! Father!

07:16.010 --> 07:18.460
You understand now.

07:21.750 --> 07:23.910
You don't have any enemies.

07:24.580 --> 07:28.150
Nobody has any enemies.

07:45.650 --> 07:49.950
There's no one who it's okay to hurt.

07:52.530 --> 07:54.130
There never was.

09:20.130 --> 09:26.510
What is this place? Valhalla?

10:00.950 --> 10:02.350
They're laughing...

10:26.230 --> 10:27.330
Bjorn?

10:40.900 --> 10:46.090
Still stuck up there, huh, Thorfinn?

10:56.070 --> 10:59.600
Hey. It's been a while.

11:12.900 --> 11:15.290
Askeladd...

11:17.070 --> 11:20.960
You never learn, do you?

11:20.960 --> 11:23.240
You're <i>already</i> back here again?

11:27.410 --> 11:30.850
Is this Valhalla?

11:34.050 --> 11:36.590
What? Valhalla?

11:43.900 --> 11:46.130
You think this is the afterlife?

11:46.700 --> 11:48.750
You can't be serious.

11:49.340 --> 11:51.770
The afterlife is a much nicer place than this.

11:53.730 --> 11:54.980
Look carefully.

11:56.770 --> 11:59.770
This place is no different 
from the world of the living.

12:02.430 --> 12:05.150
It's where all the shit gets dumped...

12:07.910 --> 12:11.250
Where <i>all</i> warriors wind up.

12:13.910 --> 12:16.570
It's the purest form of war.

12:19.740 --> 12:23.470
There is no victory. There is no end.

12:24.610 --> 12:28.990
In this place, everyone besides
 yourself is your enemy.

12:32.330 --> 12:37.630
Everyone... is your enemy...

12:40.010 --> 12:42.740
Do you remember, Thorfinn?

12:43.260 --> 12:48.330
You used to live here with us.

12:49.900 --> 12:57.010
But for better or for worse, you became empty.

13:03.350 --> 13:07.490
That's why you were able 
to escape this place.

13:10.140 --> 13:16.590
I shouldn't be saying this as the man 
who dragged you here, but you're lucky.

13:17.660 --> 13:21.670
Not many men ever manage to escape.

13:24.610 --> 13:27.090
Just look at Bjorn.

13:31.990 --> 13:38.930
You were once filled with the idea of being 
a warrior, but then you were emptied out.

13:40.610 --> 13:42.670
What's inside you now?

13:48.670 --> 13:52.970
I'm... still a warrior.

13:57.510 --> 13:59.970
I struck someone in a fit of rage.

14:00.830 --> 14:04.070
That's why I'm back here.

14:06.370 --> 14:08.710
I still reside in this place.

14:10.050 --> 14:14.160
My hands are about to give out, too.

14:16.110 --> 14:22.870
I'm pathetic. I never grow.

14:25.370 --> 14:28.060
Me, me, me.

14:28.060 --> 14:33.600
Good grief. A little soul-searching is all well
and good, but try to keep your eyes open.

14:38.070 --> 14:42.210
Something terrifying's 
right beneath your feet.

14:59.630 --> 15:03.590
You're kicking them? How cruel.

15:04.810 --> 15:09.340
Shouldn't you lend an ear to their complaints?

15:10.040 --> 15:11.070
Complaints?

15:12.430 --> 15:15.200
That's right. Look closely.

15:15.200 --> 15:17.350
I'm sure you recognize some of those faces.

15:18.810 --> 15:24.330
They're all of the people you killed.

15:27.820 --> 15:28.600
What?

15:36.890 --> 15:38.050
I...

16:11.970 --> 16:16.970
You... All of you...

16:18.750 --> 16:23.290
I don't know who you are 
or where you're from.

16:24.950 --> 16:34.170
I can't remember where or when I killed you.

17:01.070 --> 17:02.650
I'm sorry.

17:23.270 --> 17:28.070
Unbelievable. What an uncouth lot.

17:34.390 --> 17:38.260
Come on! You don't have time to cry.

17:38.260 --> 17:41.160
You don't want to fall back 
down here, do you?

17:44.070 --> 17:47.170
Even if they're hanging off you, keep climbing!

17:47.830 --> 17:49.430
Climb!

17:54.670 --> 17:57.630
That's your battle.

18:06.470 --> 18:07.670
Go!

18:09.160 --> 18:12.120
Take the people you killed with you!

18:13.040 --> 18:15.860
Fight your true battle!

18:16.390 --> 18:19.050
Become a <i>true</i> warrior,

18:19.740 --> 18:21.310
Thorfinn!

19:07.810 --> 19:08.950
A dream?

19:13.270 --> 19:14.730
A true...

19:31.860 --> 19:33.910
Einar. Einar!

19:34.340 --> 19:36.340
Hey! Are you alive?

19:44.070 --> 19:45.450
Yeah.

19:47.340 --> 19:51.510
We won the fight.

19:59.540 --> 20:02.270
Man, we've hit rock bottom.

20:03.230 --> 20:09.630
We're drowning in debt, our wheat 
has been ruined, and I'm a mess.

20:10.410 --> 20:14.580
On top of that, we'll be punished 
for getting into that fight.

20:17.860 --> 20:24.660
But seeing you punch 
that guy sure was satisfying.

20:27.310 --> 20:28.290
Ow...

20:31.060 --> 20:34.260
What's wrong? Are you in pain, too?

20:44.380 --> 20:54.290
Einar, I've used these hands
 to kill so many people.

20:57.420 --> 21:00.450
People no different from your family...

21:02.620 --> 21:04.620
People whose names I didn't even know.

21:06.100 --> 21:08.390
People who I bore no grudge against.

21:19.590 --> 21:24.590
And today, I struck another person.

21:30.670 --> 21:32.300
But it ends now.

21:37.510 --> 21:40.780
I'll never hurt anyone again.

21:42.010 --> 21:45.490
As of today, I'm swearing off violence.

21:47.180 --> 21:48.660
I'm going to be reborn.

21:49.860 --> 21:53.510
I need to be reborn and 
start atoning for what I've done.

22:13.090 --> 22:19.050
I'm going to fight my true battle.

22:22.650 --> 22:26.270
I see. All right.

22:27.340 --> 22:31.530
I don't really get it, 
but I hear you loud and clear.

22:37.190 --> 22:38.750
<i>I'm going to be reborn.</i>

22:48.770 --> 22:52.390
They're not going to be punished? 
That's ridiculous!

22:52.720 --> 22:57.140
Master, this matter concerns 
order and discipline on the farm!

22:59.620 --> 23:04.400
Pater found this on the
 ravaged farm this morning.

23:08.510 --> 23:12.240
By the way, Trygve, 
where's that coat you always wear?

23:12.240 --> 23:14.780
Huh? What? Uh...

23:15.630 --> 23:20.100
The farm was ravaged by wild boars. 
There was no fight.

23:20.100 --> 23:24.340
That's the story we're going with. Got it?

23:28.330 --> 23:31.390
Thank you, master.

23:32.650 --> 23:36.130
You're a strong man, Pater.

23:36.130 --> 23:40.190
You're not the slightest bit afraid of being 
ostracized by the people you work with?

23:41.150 --> 23:43.010
I've been through a lot.

23:43.690 --> 23:46.090
After all, I used to be a slave.

23:48.180 --> 23:51.010
Loosen up or you'll wear yourself out.

23:51.750 --> 23:53.820
Let the weight of the hoe do the work.

23:57.250 --> 23:58.050
Yes, sir.

25:51.730 --> 25:55.110
<b>The Cursed Head</b>

25:51.730 --> 25:55.110
<b>The Cursed Head</b>

25:52.690 --> 25:54.210
"The Cursed Head."
