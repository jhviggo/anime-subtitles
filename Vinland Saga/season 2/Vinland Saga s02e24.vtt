WEBVTT

02:05.820 --> 02:08.560
Wow...

02:08.980 --> 02:13.100
The rumors don't do it justice.

02:14.030 --> 02:18.260
Iceland is a harsh land.

02:19.530 --> 02:22.180
There are no trees at all.

02:24.970 --> 02:28.330
The sun's so low in the sky.

02:29.380 --> 02:32.940
I get it now. A land without farms, huh?

02:33.360 --> 02:37.190
You can't grow anything 
when the days are so short.

02:37.910 --> 02:39.680
It's winter, after all.

02:40.870 --> 02:44.310
During the summer, the days are long.

02:44.830 --> 02:49.730
Some people grow wheat 
where conditions are better,

02:49.730 --> 02:53.690
but it's not nearly enough to fill the 
stomachs of the island-dwellers.

02:54.160 --> 02:58.550
Are all the island-dwellers 
shepherds and ranchers, then?

02:58.950 --> 03:02.010
No, there are craftsmen and fishermen, too.

03:03.650 --> 03:09.490
There isn't enough pastureland 
for everyone to raise livestock,

03:09.490 --> 03:13.450
so some people live together and fish instead.

03:14.880 --> 03:18.280
Thorfinn's village is one of those.

03:19.540 --> 03:20.900
Huh.

03:21.300 --> 03:24.980
What does that mean? Didn't you live here?

03:25.510 --> 03:29.390
But I was just a child.

03:30.770 --> 03:33.180
I left home when I was around six years old.

03:33.840 --> 03:39.260
Since then, it's been a good... uh, at least...

03:40.480 --> 03:43.130
Wait, how old am I?

03:44.490 --> 03:48.660
Thorfinn, Einar, 
the village is coming into view.

03:53.270 --> 03:54.530
Whoa...

03:54.530 --> 03:57.750
I suddenly feel scared.

03:57.750 --> 04:01.000
How am I supposed to face my mother and sister?

04:04.070 --> 04:07.670
You'd better prepare for the worst, 
my "prodigal son."

04:09.830 --> 04:12.940
You're finally returning home.

04:10.100 --> 04:16.110
<b>Home</b>

04:10.100 --> 04:16.110
<b>Home</b>

04:20.760 --> 04:23.320
Okay, that's it.

04:24.950 --> 04:26.450
Good.

04:40.670 --> 04:41.710
There!

04:47.430 --> 04:48.660
Thorfinn...

04:51.880 --> 04:54.580
The villagers are waiting for you.

05:06.500 --> 05:07.280
Who's he?

05:07.280 --> 05:08.730
No idea.

05:08.730 --> 05:11.040
Did Ylva have a little brother?

05:14.530 --> 05:16.940
What's my name, then?

05:16.940 --> 05:17.640
What?

05:18.040 --> 05:21.300
If you used to live here, then you should know.

05:24.480 --> 05:27.050
F... Faxi?

05:27.360 --> 05:28.480
He got it wrong.

05:28.480 --> 05:29.980
He's suspicious.

05:29.980 --> 05:31.520
Should we tie him up?

05:31.520 --> 05:35.560
No, wait. I can't help it. It's been years.

05:36.790 --> 05:38.300
Mister Leif...

05:40.930 --> 05:44.190
Fine. I guess we'll let him see Ylva.

05:44.190 --> 05:46.070
Yeah.

05:47.620 --> 05:51.620
Ylva's over there, arguing 
with the Norwegian merchant.

05:53.930 --> 05:59.960
I warned you not to be so greedy here, Berge.

06:00.400 --> 06:05.840
S-Sorry, Ylva. I w-won't do it again.

06:05.840 --> 06:09.370
Huh? What was that? I didn't hear you.

06:09.370 --> 06:14.650
Th-That's enough, Ylva. He returned our money.

06:14.650 --> 06:17.000
Hey, Ylva.

06:19.940 --> 06:23.730
I finally brought him back.

06:24.950 --> 06:26.330
This is Thorfinn.

06:35.380 --> 06:37.380
Thorfinn...

06:39.960 --> 06:41.240
Thorfinn.

06:44.820 --> 06:46.090
Sister.

06:49.750 --> 06:50.800
Sister!

06:54.790 --> 06:57.700
I don't know a Thorfinn!

06:58.560 --> 07:02.840
Come on, Ylva. 
It's your little brother, Thorfinn.

07:02.840 --> 07:04.480
Little brother?

07:05.000 --> 07:08.680
Come to think of it, 
that might've been his name.

07:08.680 --> 07:11.450
My little brother died when he was a kid.

07:11.450 --> 07:13.720
He's actually alive.

07:13.720 --> 07:16.760
I told you I met him in York before.

07:16.760 --> 07:20.200
Then why didn't you bring him back then?

07:20.200 --> 07:23.540
Well, you know, there was a lot going on...

07:26.770 --> 07:31.180
You made that story up to cheer up 
my mother and me, didn't you?

07:32.040 --> 07:33.880
Thank you, Mister Leif.

07:34.820 --> 07:37.560
No, actually...

07:37.950 --> 07:40.140
More importantly...

07:40.140 --> 07:41.440
Huh?

07:42.060 --> 07:47.440
Hey, shorty. You've got some balls
 to trick Mister Leif like this.

07:47.440 --> 07:48.440
No, wait!

07:48.440 --> 07:51.000
If you've got something to say, spit it out.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.220
Man, this has gotten really complicated.

07:55.220 --> 08:00.020
It's surprisingly difficult 
to prove who you are.

08:09.390 --> 08:11.950
Let's go to your home, Thorfinn.

08:11.950 --> 08:14.720
Helga will know who you are.

08:15.560 --> 08:17.210
Thorfinn...

08:17.210 --> 08:18.440
Who's that?

08:18.440 --> 08:20.060
He's taking this hard.

08:22.690 --> 08:24.380
I can't blame them.

08:24.890 --> 08:29.280
I'd nearly forgotten the faces 
of my sister and mother, too.

08:31.800 --> 08:34.470
It's no surprise they've forgotten me.

08:38.340 --> 08:41.620
Who cares if they have?

08:42.450 --> 08:46.970
You get to see your mother's face 
after wandering for over a decade.

08:46.970 --> 08:49.910
If you don't consider yourself lucky, 
the gods will smite you.

08:51.220 --> 08:54.320
I was separated from my parents as a kid.

08:54.320 --> 08:57.140
I don't even know where they are now.

08:58.130 --> 09:01.010
I'm jealous of you.

09:04.530 --> 09:08.280
Or shall I go play the devoted son for you?

09:10.690 --> 09:13.160
No. I'm sorry, Bug-Eyes.

09:13.710 --> 09:14.810
Thank you.

09:32.860 --> 09:35.420
Grandma, who's Thorfinn?

09:35.420 --> 09:36.550
Tor-fin...

09:44.100 --> 09:45.320
Thorfinn...

09:46.640 --> 09:47.580
Ma!

09:47.580 --> 09:48.940
What are you doing?

09:48.940 --> 09:51.420
Stop making things more complicated.

09:51.420 --> 09:53.560
Aw, c'mon. Who cares?

09:53.560 --> 09:57.130
No, Helga. This one is...

10:02.920 --> 10:04.550
Thorfinn...

10:07.460 --> 10:08.860
Mother...

10:11.510 --> 10:16.090
You've grown so much.

10:23.620 --> 10:25.830
You look just like him.

10:27.650 --> 10:32.230
You really are your father's son.

10:43.970 --> 10:45.700
Mother...

10:46.790 --> 10:52.410
I'm sorry for everything.

10:55.520 --> 10:59.400
Welcome home, Thorfinn.

11:33.810 --> 11:36.960
Mother, I heard Thorfinn's back.

11:37.290 --> 11:39.480
Welcome back, Dad.

11:39.480 --> 11:40.920
Welcome back.

11:43.720 --> 11:45.030
Thorfinn...

11:52.900 --> 11:54.230
Ari...

11:55.940 --> 11:57.110
Thorfinn.

12:01.250 --> 12:03.930
Thorfinn, I'm sorry.

12:05.350 --> 12:09.000
Because of us, Mister Thors...

12:18.230 --> 12:22.420
Ari, I was an idiot.

12:32.160 --> 12:33.640
Well, then...

12:37.410 --> 12:40.150
Where are you going, Mister Einar?

12:40.440 --> 12:43.650
I should be leaving for the night.

12:44.050 --> 12:48.700
Mister Leif's crew is staying at 
the gothi's house. I'll join them there.

12:49.550 --> 12:52.280
You should stay here.

12:52.280 --> 12:56.010
It's a bit cramped, but we'll figure it out.

12:56.550 --> 12:58.210
But...

12:58.840 --> 13:04.020
If you're Thorfinn's brother, 
that makes you my son.

12:59.120 --> 13:00.640
This is my eldest son.

13:00.640 --> 13:02.390
Nice to meet you.

13:02.390 --> 13:04.020
Hello.

13:05.280 --> 13:09.770
This is your home. Don't be shy.

13:16.350 --> 13:22.820
Listen to this, Mother. That stingy 
merchant raised the price of salt again.

13:23.860 --> 13:28.000
Hey, it's you again! 
How dare you come into our home?

13:28.000 --> 13:30.840
Oh, uh... excuse the intrusion?

13:30.840 --> 13:32.700
Ylva, you haven't heard theâ€”

13:32.700 --> 13:34.810
Is this an inheritance scam, huh?

13:34.340 --> 13:34.990
What?

13:34.810 --> 13:38.250
Go find a rich family to trick.

13:34.990 --> 13:36.700
Ma's so fast.

13:36.700 --> 13:38.250
And strong.

13:39.040 --> 13:40.800
Ylva, wait.

13:40.800 --> 13:41.500
Huh?

13:42.180 --> 13:46.520
It's really him. Thorfinn's really come home.

13:46.520 --> 13:48.200
It's really him?

13:48.890 --> 13:52.330
What? I-It can't be.

13:52.330 --> 13:56.040
No way. Mister Leif didn't make it up?

13:58.310 --> 14:00.360
What? Really?

14:03.710 --> 14:06.410
He's the real Thorfinn?

14:07.860 --> 14:10.170
I'm home, Sister.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.250
Thorfinn...

14:16.250 --> 14:17.420
Sister!

14:19.520 --> 14:23.480
Where have you been until now?

14:36.920 --> 14:40.190
Hey... Are you okay, Thorfinn?

14:41.860 --> 14:44.950
I'm fine, Einar.

14:45.650 --> 14:49.320
I'm used to getting hit.

14:58.090 --> 14:58.820
That...

14:59.750 --> 15:01.880
That was just one hit...

15:05.310 --> 15:07.440
Ma's so strong.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.550
You're amazing, Ma.

15:09.550 --> 15:12.300
Ma's the strongest.

16:01.250 --> 16:02.420
<i>That night,</i>

16:03.660 --> 16:11.820
<i>Thorfinn told his family about everything 
he'd experienced over the past 16 years.</i>

16:15.090 --> 16:20.000
<i>From Thor's death to his 
departure from Ketil's farm.</i>

16:25.920 --> 16:30.840
<i>Though he spoke matter-of-factly 
and covered only the key points,</i>

16:30.840 --> 16:33.470
<i>his story of hatred and strife,</i>

16:35.670 --> 16:37.470
<i>death and destruction,</i>

16:40.740 --> 16:42.560
<i>despair and regret,</i>

16:45.940 --> 16:48.820
<i>sadness and rebirth</i>

16:50.320 --> 16:53.670
<i>left everyone who heard it at a loss for words.</i>

17:03.460 --> 17:05.880
The people I killed,

17:07.430 --> 17:11.710
the slaves who died in despair...

17:13.400 --> 17:18.330
They might've had warm families like this one.

17:21.970 --> 17:23.930
My sins are heavy.

17:26.880 --> 17:33.480
I have to go to Vinland 
to create a peaceful land.

17:39.890 --> 17:41.290
Do it.

17:43.410 --> 17:44.740
Mother...

17:45.370 --> 17:51.460
There are many people who wish 
they could flee from this world.

17:52.770 --> 18:00.600
Thors and I fled Jomsborg, 
the land of warriors, and came to this island.

18:03.030 --> 18:13.800
For those fleeing from war and slavery, 
far beyond the horizon,

18:14.560 --> 18:21.060
you will build a peaceful land where 
you'll wait to welcome those people there.

18:24.800 --> 18:31.830
You must live to do that, 
Thorfinn, son of Thors.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.870
Thank you, Mother.

18:41.990 --> 18:46.750
So basically, you're going to 
establish a country in Vinland?

18:46.750 --> 18:48.850
Sounds like a large-scale endeavor.

18:50.280 --> 18:51.910
He's right.

18:52.910 --> 18:55.450
I can tell you're determined.

18:55.880 --> 18:58.780
But you'll need people, livestock, materials...

18:59.230 --> 19:01.640
You'll need to buy more boats, too.

19:02.570 --> 19:04.280
It all comes down to money.

19:04.690 --> 19:09.590
It won't be easy pulling together 
that much money.

19:15.090 --> 19:18.250
Without my help, that is.

19:21.720 --> 19:24.090
Thank you, Mister Leif.

19:24.640 --> 19:27.200
You're not quitting sailing yet?

19:27.200 --> 19:28.770
I figured you'd say that, Mister Leif.

19:28.770 --> 19:30.880
Will it really be that easy?

19:30.880 --> 19:32.270
They'll be fine.

19:32.270 --> 19:35.150
Don't worry. There are plenty of ways to do it.

19:35.150 --> 19:38.400
Don't push yourself too hard, Dad.

19:38.400 --> 19:43.190
I'm not pushing myself. You still 
don't understand the kind of man I am.

20:03.350 --> 20:08.810
I can't believe you actually went with him.

20:10.020 --> 20:11.300
Sister...

20:15.830 --> 20:16.820
I'm sorry.

20:23.800 --> 20:27.940
Our father was a truly amazing man.

20:29.060 --> 20:31.900
He was strong and kind.

20:32.980 --> 20:37.960
He was looking far ahead 
at something I couldn't see.

20:45.640 --> 20:48.660
Well, he was a strange man.

21:12.810 --> 21:14.620
Whose grave is that?

21:15.700 --> 21:19.540
Someone Father once tried to protect.

21:21.490 --> 21:24.590
Were they important?

21:25.940 --> 21:27.430
He was a slave.

21:28.340 --> 21:30.890
He ran away from his master.

21:30.890 --> 21:34.860
My father saved him when
 he lay dying on the ground.

21:36.020 --> 21:40.730
My father apparently 
traded eight sheep for him.

21:41.080 --> 21:43.160
Eight sheep?

21:47.270 --> 21:51.270
I guess you get your good nature from your dad.

22:08.260 --> 22:10.830
Man, it's cold.

22:10.830 --> 22:13.970
It's even colder around here at night.

22:13.970 --> 22:16.260
I'm heading back, Thorfinn.

22:28.200 --> 22:29.210
Hey.

22:32.480 --> 22:36.620
Where do the people who 
want to run away from here go?

22:43.250 --> 22:46.570
You already know the answer to that, don't you?
