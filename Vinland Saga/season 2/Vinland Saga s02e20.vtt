00:18.900 --> 00:22.200
<i>In my life, I've killed 13 people.</i>

00:26.390 --> 00:31.940
<i>Compared to the average idiot, 
I think I'm pretty strong.</i>

00:34.800 --> 00:37.910
<i>Killing is fun.</i>

00:40.240 --> 00:45.000
<i>The look on the face of 
that posturing jarl's brat...</i>

00:48.020 --> 00:49.670
<i>That's how I know.</i>

00:51.460 --> 00:56.030
<i>This row of enemies in front of me...</i>

01:05.840 --> 01:08.400
<i>I'm scared! I'm scared, I'm scared...</i>

01:08.400 --> 01:11.980
<i>But damn it... they're enjoying this.</i>

01:26.140 --> 01:28.140
Fuck!

01:32.700 --> 01:33.960
Gudmund!

01:37.620 --> 01:39.390
<i>M-My legs...</i>

01:41.690 --> 01:45.250
<i>Ah, they're going to kill Badger.</i>

01:45.530 --> 01:47.850
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

01:47.850 --> 01:51.250
<i>How's he able to get so close 
to the Jomsvikings?</i>

02:02.580 --> 02:03.970
Boss?

02:04.280 --> 02:07.810
Fox, take Badger and fall back to the fort!

02:10.660 --> 02:13.610
All forces, retreat!

02:13.610 --> 02:16.030
Re—?! You can't be serious!

02:16.030 --> 02:17.610
I can still fight!

02:18.200 --> 02:21.320
Enough, Badger! Look around you!

02:21.800 --> 02:27.320
Damn it. Did all these men have to die for him 
to know how much stronger the enemy is?

02:28.330 --> 02:31.080
Retreat!

02:31.080 --> 02:32.800
What? Retreat?

02:32.800 --> 02:34.710
All right!

02:36.710 --> 02:39.970
Don't bunch up! Spread out and flee!

02:40.300 --> 02:42.600
Wait for me! My legs...

02:44.320 --> 02:48.560
Retreat? I didn't order a retreat!

02:48.560 --> 02:53.350
Where's your honor? 
And you call yourself Norse men!

02:53.350 --> 02:54.890
W-Wait up!

02:58.560 --> 03:00.450
I told you not to run.

03:01.060 --> 03:05.580
You think I'll forgive your debt after this?

03:08.760 --> 03:13.080
Debt? Either way, 
you're finished, Mister Ketil.

03:15.230 --> 03:20.510
Do you understand what
 it's like to be poor like us now?

03:21.570 --> 03:27.900
No matter how unfair it may be, 
you shouldn't defy the king.

03:28.360 --> 03:32.770
It's the same reason we've 
always listened to you!

03:34.050 --> 03:37.380
Might makes right, Mister Ketil.

03:38.010 --> 03:43.850
The world exists for people 
stronger than you.

03:52.150 --> 03:53.040
They're here!

04:04.010 --> 04:05.560
What is it, Wulf?

04:04.510 --> 04:10.180
<b>Pain</b>

04:04.510 --> 04:10.180
<b>Pain</b>

04:05.960 --> 04:07.600
Ah, Your Majesty.

04:08.360 --> 04:12.860
Someone who may have been Ketil 
was just defeated by one of my men.

04:13.960 --> 04:18.110
How inept. My orders were to capture him.

04:18.540 --> 04:21.880
Yes, Your Majesty. I apologize.

04:21.880 --> 04:23.740
I'll go confirm what happened.

04:24.500 --> 04:27.770
The Jomsvikings are attacking 
the backs of the fleeing soldiers.

04:27.770 --> 04:29.700
That goes against my orders as well.

04:30.060 --> 04:32.560
Tell Floki not to pursue them.

04:32.560 --> 04:33.430
Yes, Your Majesty.

04:45.360 --> 04:48.180
<i>I'm not sure why, 
but his guard captain left his side.</i>

04:49.240 --> 04:50.890
<i>This is my chance.</i>

04:55.860 --> 04:58.200
Treat the bodies with care.

04:58.200 --> 04:59.940
We'll return them to their families—

05:05.250 --> 05:10.950
King Canute, your head is mine!

06:53.090 --> 06:55.280
Th-Thorgil!

06:55.280 --> 06:57.150
Where'd you come from?

06:59.200 --> 07:01.460
From Helheim.

07:05.810 --> 07:07.840
I'm surprised.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.800
I didn't think you could block my swing.

07:10.800 --> 07:13.700
Your skills have improved, Your Majesty.

07:15.040 --> 07:16.950
<i>My right hand feels weak.</i>

07:17.780 --> 07:20.210
Did that single blow sprain it?

07:20.490 --> 07:22.020
Good.

07:22.840 --> 07:25.590
You're a commander worth killing.

07:39.080 --> 07:45.770
I wish we had time to play, 
but I'm in a hurry.

07:46.250 --> 07:50.280
Your head is mine.

08:04.690 --> 08:08.550
Bastard! How dare you kick the king!

08:16.180 --> 08:21.340
Die!

08:34.320 --> 08:36.720
Your Majesty, give your sword to me.

08:36.720 --> 08:37.990
Please stand back.

08:38.640 --> 08:41.210
Damn it.

08:45.410 --> 08:47.400
King's guard, fall back!

08:47.400 --> 08:49.550
Defend the king!

08:53.300 --> 08:56.340
Damn it!

08:56.340 --> 08:58.510
Stop, Thorgil!

08:59.620 --> 09:01.870
Don't pursue him too far, Wulf.

09:01.870 --> 09:03.770
You're seriously injured as well.

09:04.950 --> 09:10.900
I let my guard down, 
but more than that, he's a bold man.

09:12.210 --> 09:14.460
I wish he'd serve me again.

09:16.240 --> 09:18.990
King's guard, fall back!

09:19.360 --> 09:22.040
His Majesty is under attack!

09:22.040 --> 09:24.120
All forces, fall back!

09:24.120 --> 09:27.320
Run! Hurry!

09:29.280 --> 09:30.500
Your Majesty!

09:30.500 --> 09:32.040
Your Majesty!

09:31.040 --> 09:32.700
Wh-What's going on?

09:33.430 --> 09:37.260
Who would do something like that? 
Was it Thorgil?

09:41.680 --> 09:43.020
That was close.

09:47.730 --> 09:50.110
Master, are you alive?

09:54.290 --> 09:55.360
Okay.

09:56.040 --> 10:01.410
Looks like those soldiers 
didn't recognize you.

10:01.410 --> 10:03.370
You're a lucky man.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.870
Damn heavy, too.

10:09.600 --> 10:13.380
Don't think you can get off easy by dying.

10:14.260 --> 10:21.450
You have responsibilities as the 
losing force's leader, Iron Fist Ketil.

10:38.600 --> 10:40.890
I hear it...

10:45.760 --> 10:51.940
The sound I heard when my village burned.

10:54.440 --> 10:57.980
The sound of the world falling apart.

11:01.160 --> 11:05.020
They're fighting, aren't they?

11:06.580 --> 11:09.560
It's all right. Don't worry.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.470
We aren't slaves anymore.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.100
We're leaving this farm.

11:16.470 --> 11:21.180
That battle has nothing to do with us.

11:26.260 --> 11:31.120
Where will we go once we leave this place?

11:35.110 --> 11:37.000
We can go to my village.

11:38.530 --> 11:41.800
It's a bit cold, but it's a nice place.

11:45.540 --> 11:49.880
Do you have slaves there?

11:51.680 --> 11:56.120
Do you have wars?

11:58.960 --> 12:03.290
Yes. Battles were fought there once.

12:03.830 --> 12:07.910
I'd be lying if I said 
it would never happen again.

12:11.890 --> 12:15.300
I'm not going.

12:16.640 --> 12:21.420
I'm going somewhere else.

12:23.890 --> 12:27.880
Gardar and the children...

12:31.730 --> 12:34.840
are waiting for me.

12:37.250 --> 12:41.160
I just wanted to express my gratitude.

12:46.070 --> 12:51.820
Thank you, Einar and Thorfinn.

12:53.720 --> 12:55.700
Thank you.

13:01.140 --> 13:13.150
I felt like I was wandering through
 a terrible nightmare all alone.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.630
But...

13:25.030 --> 13:28.490
Our morning chats...

13:31.060 --> 13:36.410
I enjoyed your stories, Einar...

13:39.380 --> 13:41.250
No, Arnheid!

13:41.880 --> 13:44.780
Hang in there, Arnheid!

13:45.810 --> 13:47.500
Arnheid!

13:49.010 --> 13:54.850
Didn't you say you'd protect 
the child inside you?

13:55.210 --> 13:57.240
Arnheid!

14:03.120 --> 14:07.360
The child has already gone 
to the other side.

14:14.710 --> 14:16.780
They're all dead.

14:18.550 --> 14:21.370
All of my loved ones.

14:22.960 --> 14:27.420
What point is there in going on living?

14:30.240 --> 14:34.820
There's nothing left for me here.

14:37.610 --> 14:41.450
Why do I have to live?

14:46.180 --> 14:53.280
I... Because... Because I...

14:58.230 --> 15:00.960
Arnheid? Arnheid?

15:01.650 --> 15:02.960
Arnheid!

15:02.960 --> 15:04.900
Move, Einar!

15:09.510 --> 15:14.980
My father taught me this technique to
 bring someone back from the dead.

15:15.920 --> 15:19.350
Einar, speak to her as loudly as you can.

15:21.380 --> 15:24.230
Arnheid, don't go!

15:24.600 --> 15:31.360
I... I love you! I need you!

15:31.990 --> 15:34.990
I want you to laugh at my stories again!

15:34.990 --> 15:37.290
Please live!

15:38.540 --> 15:40.600
Live with me again!

15:42.000 --> 15:45.540
Please live!

15:58.740 --> 16:01.390
Einar, that's enough.

17:01.560 --> 17:03.320
Far to the west...

17:06.950 --> 17:14.200
and across the sea, 
there's a place called Vinland.

17:16.450 --> 17:19.860
Warm and bountiful, it is a distant land,

17:20.690 --> 17:26.490
beyond the reach of slave-traders 
and the flames of war.

17:27.830 --> 17:33.660
You would be able to live 
without suffering there.

17:36.480 --> 17:37.800
Arnheid...

17:39.750 --> 17:43.180
Let's go there together.

17:44.310 --> 17:48.340
Let's build a peaceful nation in Vinland.

18:12.690 --> 18:17.320
It's you guys. What are you still doing here?

18:26.340 --> 18:27.830
Don't, Einar!

18:28.690 --> 18:30.080
Ketil!

18:31.680 --> 18:34.660
You! You killed Arnheid!

18:36.270 --> 18:39.780
I'll kill you. I'll fucking kill you!

18:41.720 --> 18:46.020
Don't, Einar! Killing the master 
won't help anything!

18:51.640 --> 18:54.650
I see. Arnheid is dead.

18:56.550 --> 18:58.400
Open your eyes, Einar!

18:58.860 --> 19:00.030
Please!

19:00.520 --> 19:01.780
Einar!

19:30.840 --> 19:38.330
Einar, killing the master 
won't quell your rage.

19:40.470 --> 19:42.460
Anger begets more anger.

19:43.620 --> 19:45.880
It just results in deaths, one after another.

19:47.420 --> 19:52.670
I was stuck in that hell for a long time.

19:54.920 --> 19:57.740
Please, Einar.

19:58.560 --> 20:02.580
Don't fall under the same curse 
that afflicted me.

20:38.290 --> 20:39.270
Dad...

20:39.970 --> 20:43.420
I know. Get the ship ready to depart.

21:15.830 --> 21:22.310
<i>God... must be watching us,
even as we stand here now.</i>

21:29.490 --> 21:33.720
<i>People losing friends, and parents
 and children killing each other...</i>

21:34.530 --> 21:40.570
<i>He must be looking down on everything
 from up high in heaven.</i>

21:55.910 --> 21:56.980
Thorfinn...

21:57.870 --> 22:00.380
Wait. Where are you going?

22:00.800 --> 22:03.380
Wait! What do you intend to do?

22:04.880 --> 22:07.380
I'm going to see Canute.

22:07.790 --> 22:08.490
What?

22:09.940 --> 22:13.530
The master is still alive. 
He hasn't been captured.

22:14.090 --> 22:16.140
The battle isn't over.

22:17.510 --> 22:20.860
I may be able to prevent more deaths.

22:21.600 --> 22:24.550
That's ridiculous. We need to 
leave this place immediately.

22:25.420 --> 22:29.030
Why do you have to do this?

22:30.780 --> 22:31.530
Thorfinn!

22:39.600 --> 22:41.320
This time...

22:41.320 --> 22:46.250
This time, please let me 
take you back to Iceland.

22:48.050 --> 22:49.080
Please.

22:54.710 --> 22:59.020
Long ago, you once told me...

23:01.200 --> 23:10.780
that our ancestors fled from war 
and ended up in Iceland.

23:13.200 --> 23:18.970
At the time, I thought it was lame,

23:20.260 --> 23:24.250
but now, I'm really proud of them.

23:25.330 --> 23:26.470
Thorfinn...

23:30.040 --> 23:35.080
I'd estimate Canute 
only brought around 100 men.

23:36.340 --> 23:38.490
No matter how badly it turns out,

23:40.370 --> 23:43.770
I should be able to make it back alive.

23:55.300 --> 23:59.750
We'll have the ship 
ready to depart at any time.

24:00.440 --> 24:01.700
Don't push yourself too hard!

24:02.880 --> 24:08.720
We're going back to Iceland, 
no matter what, Thorfinn!

25:51.320 --> 25:55.030
<b>Courage</b>

25:51.320 --> 25:55.030
<b>Courage</b>

25:52.930 --> 25:54.230
"Courage."
