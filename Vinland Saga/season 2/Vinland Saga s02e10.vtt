<b>The Cursed Head</b>

01:48.790 --> 01:54.550
<b>The Cursed Head</b>

02:39.350 --> 02:41.740
Okay, here we go.

02:41.740 --> 02:43.890
Ready, push!

02:58.900 --> 03:06.040
Yes! That's the last one!

03:18.500 --> 03:21.300
I don't believe it.

03:22.010 --> 03:24.680
It really was possible.

03:24.680 --> 03:27.750
Together, we turned an
 entire forest into a farm.

03:28.220 --> 03:32.650
Yeah, I think it took more than three years.

03:33.820 --> 03:37.530
If only all this land were ours.

03:38.810 --> 03:41.820
That's one thing a slave can't have.

03:44.710 --> 03:48.980
We worked hard. We're nearly there.

03:50.040 --> 03:54.330
Yeah. The other day, Pater told me something.

03:55.880 --> 04:01.880
We'll be able to buy our freedom with the 
next harvest from this cleared land.

04:02.810 --> 04:05.080
We'll get some change back, too.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.280
I see.

04:11.430 --> 04:16.330
Einar, what are you going to do 
once you're a free man?

04:19.220 --> 04:24.280
I don't know. Even if I went back to my homeland, 
there's no family waiting for me.

04:25.450 --> 04:26.740
And besides...

04:28.470 --> 04:30.330
You're worried about Arnheid.

04:31.070 --> 04:33.670
Yeah, I feel awkward about it.

04:36.360 --> 04:39.380
If only Arnheid could be free, too.

04:40.230 --> 04:44.570
Then I'd feel better.

04:46.890 --> 04:50.920
The master has no intention 
of letting her go.

04:54.450 --> 04:56.200
What about you, Thorfinn?

04:57.120 --> 04:59.910
Will you go back to Iceland?

05:01.930 --> 05:06.160
Yeah. I think so. Probably.

05:06.600 --> 05:10.540
Seriously? You don't seem sure 
about your plans.

05:10.540 --> 05:12.070
Neither do you.

05:16.910 --> 05:20.540
Good grief. It's strange, isn't it?

05:21.350 --> 05:25.720
Freedom's just around the corner, 
and we're acting like this.

05:37.640 --> 05:40.570
There is something I'd like to try to do.

05:43.320 --> 05:45.510
Really? What is it?

05:47.240 --> 05:51.220
Well, there's a lot I'm still not sure about.

05:57.930 --> 06:00.550
What do you think, Einar?

06:03.410 --> 06:10.050
Would it be possible to rid the
 world of war and slavery?

06:25.540 --> 06:29.670
Well... that would be like a dream.

06:37.850 --> 06:42.480
Ah, you've finally felled the last tree.

06:42.480 --> 06:44.920
Well done, both of you.

06:45.390 --> 06:46.470
Master!

06:47.050 --> 06:51.710
Well? Do you think you'll be able 
to till the soil in time for planting?

06:51.710 --> 06:53.990
Yes, probably, if we hurry.

06:57.050 --> 07:01.720
I see, I see. All right. 
Then I'll give you a little discount.

07:03.110 --> 07:07.620
Once you're done sowing the seeds, 
the two of you will be free.

07:09.640 --> 07:13.830
You've worked hard, Thorfinn, Einar.

07:20.120 --> 07:24.440
What? You don't seem that happy.

07:24.440 --> 07:26.240
Huh? What?

07:26.240 --> 07:27.820
No! Wait, no!

07:27.820 --> 07:30.070
All right!

07:30.650 --> 07:33.340
Thorfinn, we finally did it!

07:33.340 --> 07:35.840
Y-Yeah!

07:35.840 --> 07:39.770
Wait, sorry. Don't celebrate yet.

07:39.770 --> 07:40.420
What?

07:40.850 --> 07:44.890
You'll have to wait until after I return.

07:44.890 --> 07:47.320
You're going somewhere?

07:47.320 --> 07:52.110
Yes. By the way, 
have you seen the old master?

07:52.600 --> 07:54.760
He hasn't been this way.

07:55.640 --> 07:59.610
I see. Maybe he's on his farm.

08:00.540 --> 08:02.750
Well, you'll do.

08:02.750 --> 08:05.080
If you see him, give him this message.

08:06.190 --> 08:12.600
Tell him I've gone to the palace 
in Jelling to visit King Harald.

08:13.740 --> 08:16.930
I'm sure I'll be back in time 
for planting, though.

08:17.340 --> 08:20.610
Make sure you till the soil by then.

08:20.610 --> 08:21.460
Yes, sir.

08:23.460 --> 08:25.830
Safe travels.

08:27.360 --> 08:29.060
Oh, right.

08:30.090 --> 08:37.030
How would you like to continue working 
for me as my retainers once you're free?

08:37.530 --> 08:41.000
I'd gladly welcome a couple of 
hard workers like you.

08:42.760 --> 08:45.160
Give it some thought.

09:01.430 --> 09:11.570
<b>What benefit is there for the worker from that
 in which he labors? I have seen the task which
 God has given the sons of mankind with which
 to occupy themselves. He has made everything

09:49.510 --> 09:51.700
Excuse me, Your Majesty.

09:52.950 --> 09:56.320
Our ship will be arriving in Jelling shortly.

09:57.010 --> 10:00.330
Please wake up, King Canute.

10:45.730 --> 10:49.930
Your Majesty, what are you doing out here?

10:49.930 --> 10:51.880
Our horses will be ready soon.

10:51.880 --> 10:53.300
Please wait inside your cabin.

10:53.820 --> 10:54.820
Here is fine.

10:56.500 --> 10:58.230
I haven't been back home in a while.

10:58.750 --> 11:00.070
I want to feel the breeze.

11:03.060 --> 11:04.230
Your Majesty.

11:07.750 --> 11:11.770
I am delighted to see you've
 safely returned from England.

11:11.770 --> 11:16.440
Thank you. Wulf, how is my brother doing?

11:16.780 --> 11:17.460
My liege.

11:17.860 --> 11:21.410
King Harald is not well.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.590
His pain has worsened over the past month.

11:24.590 --> 11:28.840
He's no longer capable of speaking.

11:30.550 --> 11:34.080
I see. How much longer does he have?

11:34.760 --> 11:40.450
According to those treating him, 
these next few days will be critical.

11:42.500 --> 11:47.000
Very well. Thank you for 
watching over him in my place.

11:47.000 --> 11:47.850
Yes, Your Majesty.

11:52.600 --> 11:53.610
Ouch.

11:53.610 --> 11:55.370
I won again.

11:54.730 --> 11:56.580
That ball game they're playing...

11:55.370 --> 11:56.840
Are you okay?

11:55.730 --> 11:57.030
Again.

11:56.840 --> 11:58.610
Don't hurt yourself.

11:57.570 --> 12:01.990
My brother was quite good at it 
when we were children.

11:58.850 --> 12:00.210
Darn you.

12:05.570 --> 12:09.080
He occasionally played with me.

12:13.830 --> 12:15.990
Harald, hit it again.

12:18.310 --> 12:21.370
Okay. Watch the ball closely, Canute.

12:22.230 --> 12:25.920
Those within the palace 
feuded amongst themselves

12:25.920 --> 12:29.060
over which of us would succeed our father,

12:29.870 --> 12:34.130
but my brother never paid
 any heed to it himself.

12:35.000 --> 12:35.930
Ready?

12:36.830 --> 12:37.830
Here it comes.

12:43.700 --> 12:45.120
Your Highness!

12:45.120 --> 12:45.930
Ragnar...

12:55.400 --> 12:57.100
I'm okay.

12:57.100 --> 12:58.450
I don't believe it.

12:59.690 --> 13:03.430
See? He's tougher than you think.

13:03.990 --> 13:08.330
You're a little too overprotective, 
you know. You shouldâ€”

13:08.330 --> 13:09.940
Impressive, Your Highness.

13:13.770 --> 13:15.360
I knew you could do it.

13:15.360 --> 13:17.760
Are you certain you're not hurt?

13:17.760 --> 13:20.100
Yeah. Thanks, Ragnar.

13:21.450 --> 13:24.460
But it's hard to move when 
I'm wearing so many layers.

13:24.460 --> 13:26.990
I'm hot, too. Can I take these off?

13:26.990 --> 13:28.570
No.

13:29.080 --> 13:33.210
A warrior must be properly equipped.

13:33.210 --> 13:35.580
Are you listening, Your Highness?

13:35.580 --> 13:41.070
Letting your guard down for even 
a moment can prove fatal.

13:37.510 --> 13:41.070
He was a strong, kind man.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.220
Even I once...

13:44.340 --> 13:48.130
My brother helped me often.

13:49.780 --> 13:51.770
I must thank him.

13:54.580 --> 13:55.530
Hup!

14:11.390 --> 14:14.200
Play somewhere else, children.

14:14.640 --> 14:16.250
Sorry.

14:23.890 --> 14:25.920
Don't hit it so hard, Asta.

14:25.920 --> 14:28.380
Hmph. You're just slow.

14:26.420 --> 14:30.020
Unbelievable. Children are so carefree.

14:28.380 --> 14:30.000
What did you say?

14:31.090 --> 14:32.600
Now you're mad.

14:31.810 --> 14:33.810
What is the matter, Your Majesty?

14:39.480 --> 14:40.850
It's nothing.

14:46.290 --> 14:53.160
<i>Sweyn's sons inherited their own 
respective territories from their father.</i>

14:54.470 --> 14:57.110
<i>The older brother Harald inherited Denmark,</i>

14:57.680 --> 15:00.680
<i>and the younger brother Canute 
inherited England.</i>

15:01.260 --> 15:04.020
<i>Their relationship was good.</i>

15:06.130 --> 15:09.280
<i>During Canute's conquest of England,</i>

15:09.280 --> 15:15.880
<i>his brother Harald directly supported him 
by sending a fleets of ships.</i>

15:16.790 --> 15:17.860
<i>However...</i>

15:19.120 --> 15:26.090
<i>Shortly after Canute became 
King of England, Harald fell ill.</i>

15:27.330 --> 15:30.630
<i>Harald had no heirs.</i>

15:33.480 --> 15:35.160
Brother Canute!

15:35.160 --> 15:38.550
You really did come to Jelling.

15:39.500 --> 15:41.930
Address me as "Your Majesty," Estrid.

15:41.930 --> 15:44.920
Your visit is so sudden. I was surprised.

15:47.590 --> 15:51.410
It's good to see you again, King Harald.

15:56.490 --> 16:01.000
Brother Harald, 
Brother Canute has come to visit you.

16:01.730 --> 16:03.460
Can you tell he's here?

16:04.600 --> 16:07.190
It's fine. You don't have to wake him.

16:07.580 --> 16:09.030
I'll be staying here a while.

16:09.450 --> 16:12.870
I'll speak to His Majesty 
when he's feeling better.

16:15.080 --> 16:17.530
Canute...

16:27.000 --> 16:30.290
King Harald, I am here.

16:32.640 --> 16:34.710
Please rest.

16:35.940 --> 16:39.690
You needn't worry about your kingdom.

16:43.770 --> 16:47.610
I've been waiting for you.

16:49.640 --> 16:51.790
Denmark...

16:54.760 --> 17:00.620
Denmark is yours.

17:07.240 --> 17:10.710
Don't be absurd, King Harald.

17:11.320 --> 17:16.050
Get well soon so we can play ball again.

17:17.260 --> 17:20.890
You've got some guts, Canute.

17:21.380 --> 17:26.520
I'm impressed you can lie about that 
like you don't know what's going on.

17:29.320 --> 17:30.310
Brother?

17:32.070 --> 17:36.250
You're visiting the man 
you poisoned yourself?

17:36.250 --> 17:44.290
What a farce. What will you 
accomplish by doing that?

17:45.560 --> 17:49.930
Harald was friendly to you.

17:49.930 --> 17:53.300
Why did you need to kill him?

17:53.300 --> 17:57.350
You could've ruled the world together.

17:58.600 --> 18:02.430
You didn't do it for the sake of 
peace and prosperity.

18:03.080 --> 18:07.800
Ambition now rests within your heart.

18:08.270 --> 18:13.990
The ambition to rule as
 king of all the North Sea.

18:17.480 --> 18:23.730
That is the curse. The crown's curse.

18:25.080 --> 18:28.040
<i>None</i> can escape it.

18:29.530 --> 18:38.570
By donning the two crowns 
of Denmark and England,

18:38.570 --> 18:43.250
you will suffer twice as much as I did.

18:51.690 --> 18:52.760
Brother!

18:59.800 --> 19:02.370
What's wrong? You suddenly went into a daze.

19:03.140 --> 19:05.130
Have you fallen ill, too?

19:15.530 --> 19:19.030
I'm fine. I just felt a little dizzy.

19:23.340 --> 19:25.220
Prepare a bedchamber.

19:25.580 --> 19:27.830
His Majesty is tired from 
his long voyage at sea.

19:58.990 --> 19:59.730
What is it?

20:00.160 --> 20:03.960
Lady Estrid instructed me 
to bring you something to drink.

20:06.010 --> 20:07.760
Where did it come from?

20:08.360 --> 20:11.640
What? Where is it from?

20:13.990 --> 20:17.150
I don't need any. I'm not thirsty.

20:18.580 --> 20:23.910
You fear being poisoned 
because you poison others.

20:24.570 --> 20:27.220
Isn't that right, Canute?

20:32.600 --> 20:38.750
It was rather mischievous of you to appear 
in the middle of the afternoon, King Sweyn.

20:39.290 --> 20:47.260
If you can see me during the day, 
then the curse must be growing stronger.

20:48.370 --> 20:49.640
Is he talking to himself?

20:50.420 --> 20:52.420
How long are you going to 
keep standing there?

20:52.420 --> 20:54.350
I need nothing from you. Leave.

20:54.350 --> 20:56.310
Y-Yes, Your Majesty!

20:59.370 --> 21:03.380
Uniting the nation is
 essential to creating a utopia.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.730
Two kings would eventually cause trouble.

21:08.540 --> 21:11.190
King Harald's death is necessary.

21:15.430 --> 21:17.920
I'm surprised.

21:18.380 --> 21:25.170
You've come to think 
like a real king, Canute.

21:30.890 --> 21:33.010
What are you laughing about?

21:34.330 --> 21:40.200
King Sweyn, I once hated you 
and wished for your death.

21:40.920 --> 21:42.820
But now?

21:43.890 --> 21:48.610
You're the only one I can speak to frankly.

21:51.160 --> 21:53.410
Let us be friends,

21:55.960 --> 21:59.060
as befits two cursed men.

22:12.580 --> 22:14.790
Brother, again!

22:18.120 --> 22:19.170
Okay.

22:21.140 --> 22:22.720
Here it comes, Canute.

22:22.720 --> 22:23.490
Okay.

22:24.100 --> 22:25.140
Harald.

22:29.300 --> 22:32.120
We're holding a war council. Join us.

22:33.500 --> 22:34.810
Yes, Father.

22:37.250 --> 22:38.920
Sorry, Canute.

22:39.410 --> 22:40.790
We'll continue another time.

22:43.410 --> 22:45.010
Thank you, Brother.

23:02.280 --> 23:05.030
Grow up strong, Canute.

23:06.870 --> 23:09.690
Stronger than me and father.

23:11.330 --> 23:12.180
Got it?

23:15.810 --> 23:16.520
Yes.

23:37.200 --> 23:41.450
Come, Your Highness. 
I'll be your next opponent.

23:41.450 --> 23:43.710
What? Can you even play, Ragnar?

23:43.710 --> 23:45.690
How dare you.

23:45.690 --> 23:51.210
I was once feared as Gullinbursti of the Lake, 
and for seven consecutive years...

24:01.030 --> 24:02.550
Is this all there is to it?

24:05.880 --> 24:07.910
This is nothing.

25:51.610 --> 25:55.070
<b>Kings and Swords</b>
