00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.820
Let's stay up all night chatting, young master.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.040
Tell us all about your youthful troubles.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.680
You're hoping I'll entertain you 
while you drink, aren't you?

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.540
Screw this. I'm going home. Let go.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.960
Oh, come on. Tell us everything 
that's on your mind.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.930
We're such good friends, aren't we?

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.320
Like hell we are. Let go.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.070
<b>Snake</b>

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.070
<b>Snake</b>

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.620
What's wrong with you? Hit him back.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.820
All right! Right there.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.710
Seriously? Again?

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.550
Those morons.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.340
They fell.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.300
Does that make it a tie?

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.090
Nobody knows what they're talking about.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.440
They don't get it.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.650
They don't even know what they don't know.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.410
There's no way they can understand me 
when they don't know what they don't know.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.680
Actually, I understand, young master.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.460
After all, 17 is a weird age.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.290
Not quite an adult, but no longer a kid.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.080
More.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.400
Sure thing.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.670
Here you go. Whoops.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.830
Look at you drink!

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:11.350
Fox, Badger... You're actually laughing 
at me on the inside, aren't you?

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.120
He's not a fun drunk today.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.440
I'm starting to sober up.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.150
We shouldn't have invited him.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.280
I can hear you!

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.540
You think bodyguards like you 
have the right to mock me?

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.920
You serve my dad for a pittance.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.250
Don't you have any pride as warriors?

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.200
Please, call us guests.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.680
Even men like us are useful in a fight.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.470
Oh?

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.880
You guys actually work sometimes?

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.740
I've never seen you do your job, Fox.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.980
This village is so peaceful, 
we're bored out of our minds.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.350
Draw your sword.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.790
I'll test your skills to make sure 
you haven't lost your touch.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.540
See?

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.210
We're your father's guests, 
and this is what he pays us to do.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.530
Damn it! Just kill me!

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.060
What should we do, Fox?

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.040
That's odd.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.360
We were supposed to have fun drinking 
together so Ketil's family would like us.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.360
I'm a nobody!

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.430
In other words, young master,

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.040
you don't like being treated 
like a child by respectable folk.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.380
You guys treat me like one, too.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.330
What do you expect?

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.840
You really are half a man.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.700
But for you to become a real manâ€”

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.080
Hey, you should be cheering him up.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.940
Quiet, you. I'm going somewhere with this.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.630
Just shut up and listen.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.100
You know, young master...

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.990
Becoming a real man 
isn't actually that difficult.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.860
All you gotta do is complete a... 
rite of passage, I think it's called.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.970
You need to kill a person.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.390
Killing a person will make
 you feel really confident.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.320
You oughta try it.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:58.440
Once you know how fragile human bodies are, 
you won't be afraid of others anymore.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.080
It'll grow you right up.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.340
It's how all boys become men.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.080
B-But... who?

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.490
Well, that's obvious.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.090
I know of the perfect target for a beginner.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.800
You've even got some right here on this farm.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.930
People you're <i>allowed</i> to kill.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.760
Boy, I slept well.

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:33.220
I'm hungry.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.810
One, two, three, four.

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:43.610
There's still a lot more wheat 
to harvest today.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:47.820
This farm is way too big.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:57.340
At this rate, we'll have hardly any time 
to clear the woods for next spring.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:01.370
I'd like to get it done in time 
for the fall planting season.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:07.930
But first, we've gotta dig up the roots 
and rocks, till the soil, and let it rest.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.050
I wonder if they'll let us 
borrow a heavy plow.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.480
Th-Thorfinn, what's wrong?

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.020
Are you still asleep? Hey, Thorfinn.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.520
Are you okay?

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.740
You were screaming like crazy.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.700
What kind of dream 
makes a man scream like that?

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:53.750
I was dreaming?

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.440
I wonder what it was. I can't remember.

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:08.890
Go wash your face and let's get
 started on our morning tasks.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.110
Dreams you forget are better left forgotten.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.760
Good morning. It's a nice morning, isn't it?

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.390
Uh, yes. Good morning.

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.040
Would you like to wash your faces?

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.760
Go ahead. I'm already finished.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.250
Oh, no. I mean, yes.

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.400
Uh, sorry. Take your time.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:55.020
Washing this face won't make it any better.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.540
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.290
I think you have a wonderful face.

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:08.640
Are you all right? Are you not feeling well?

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.670
It's my heart...

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:12.670
That's terrible. Does it hurt?

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:16.300
No, I'm fine. I'm not sick or anything.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.660
Then are you injured?

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:21.240
<i>What is this? I feel so uneasy.</i>

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:29.990
<i>I must have been dreaming 
about something I mustn't forget.</i>

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:36.760
My name is Arnheid.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.840
You came here recently, didn't you?

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.970
Y-Yes. I'm Einar.

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:42.950
I'm from England.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:49.580
England? You speak the language so well, 
I thought you were Norse.

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:55.950
Everyone in my village, including me, 
is descended from Nords.

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:59.290
We all speak English and Norse.

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:03.620
Though I'm sure it's hard for a lady like you
 to understand me, since my accent is so thick.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:08.410
Oh, that's right. Excuse me.

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:11.930
I hadn't mentioned 
my status here on the farm.

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:21.950
What? Aren't you the master's daughter?

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.700
No, I'm not.

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:29.560
Like you, I'm a slave.

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:32.870
I'm the master's personal attendant.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:34.780
What?

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:42.990
Good morning, gentlemen.

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:47.050
Have you slaves gotten together 
this morning to plot your escape?

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:49.020
Good morning.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.980
You, what's your name?

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.700
Thorfinn.

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:57.980
Are you a slave, too? I don't recognize you.

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:01.610
I'm E-Einar. I arrived this summer.

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:12.020
Thorfinn and Einar, come with me.

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:26.020
We're having a busy morning.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.520
Who are those guys?

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.850
They've got swords.

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:37.520
They aren't respectable folk, are they?

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.200
They're "guests."

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.410
They're the resident 
defensive force at the farm.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:46.970
Basically bodyguards.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:54.980
Whatever business they've 
got with us can't be good.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.950
I think you have a wonderful face.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:07.050
What is it? You're in a good mood, Einar.

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.050
Oh, sorry.

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:11.050
No problem at all.

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:14.060
You seem like a lively one.

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:42.880
Go on, young master.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.680
Make a nice clean cut.

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.760
A clean cut? You mean...

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.220
Very perceptive of you, big man.

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:55.260
What?

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:59.730
This ritual will allow the young master 
to become a man.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.180
Die for us.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:15.510
This ritual will allow the young master 
to become a man.

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:16.920
Die for us.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.460
Y-You can't be serious!

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:28.130
What have we done to deserve this?

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:30.120
You've done nothing wrong!

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:35.600
But your lives aren't your own. 
That's all there is to it.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:40.200
Your rightful owner is free to do 
whatever he pleases with his possessions.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:44.570
You're a slave that belongs to Olmar's family.

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:48.570
He's going to cut you down himself. 
You should be honored.

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.200
Lucky you.

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:52.810
Just give up already.

00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:00.120
Th-These guys belong to my dad.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.580
They're not mine.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:04.310
If I cut them down, 
I'll have to pay him back for them.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:08.650
Pathetic, young master.

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:11.090
You've made it this far, 
and you're still making excuses?

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.010
Are you afraid of your father?

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:16.040
Are you afraid to kill?

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.860
Or are you afraid of both?

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:20.980
Shut up! I'm not scared of anything.

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:24.860
Then do it. Make a nice clean cut.

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:29.300
Thorfinn, run.

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:32.110
It'll be fine.

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:37.100
Damn you...

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:40.560
What are you doing? Go, Thorfinn!

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.180
Tell the master!

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:44.680
You can do it, sir!

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.540
Your opponent is raring to go!

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:51.450
Don't move, shorty.

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.660
Shut up and watch.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.020
What a pain.

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:14.840
He can cut me down.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.640
You've got this, sir.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.650
You only need one of us, don't you?

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:25.900
Let him return to work.

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:28.650
He can cut me down.

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.470
Ow...

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.960
Oh, it's morning.

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:21.450
Hey, Gramps.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.220
Gramps, are you there?

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:44.300
Gramps, where's my breakfast?

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.160
Gramps!

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:50.000
You're asking about breakfast 
after waking up at this hour?

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.700
If you want to eat, help me with the 
harvest every once in a while.

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.800
No way.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.630
Then I'm not cooking for you.

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:02.310
Figure something out yourself.

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:04.650
That old fart.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:07.540
I'm not cooking for myself. 
What a pain in the butt.

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:10.330
I guess I'll head home.

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.080
I'll allow Master Olmar to cut me down.

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:32.330
Please let Einar return to work.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.030
We have another busy day.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:40.280
Wh-What did you just say?

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.900
Sorry, what's your name again?

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.230
It's Thorfinn.

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:01.210
All right, Thorfinn.

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:05.070
Do you understand what you just said?

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:08.120
Being cut down means dying.

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:10.900
Yes, it certainly does.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:16.710
You idiot! What are youâ€”

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.850
Keep your mouth shut. Stay out of this.

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:25.130
Did you hear that, boys?

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:28.740
You run into guys like him 
every once in a while.

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:35.660
I can't overlook what you just said.

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:41.360
Letting a remark like that slide 
reduces the value of our product.

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:49.050
Hey, Thorfinn. Do you know 
what product we warriors sell?

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:52.260
No.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:56.710
It's death.

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:07.470
Everyone is afraid to die.

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:10.490
I can tell you for certain 
that everyone fears it.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.020
Look at the young master.

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.160
He's even afraid of someone else dying.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.610
Shut up. I'm not s-scared.

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:22.860
You should be. 
Death has value <i>because</i> we fear it.

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:27.370
Otherwise we wouldn't be able 
to use our swords to make a living.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.510
You should be scared, too.

00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:41.820
Go on. Be afraid.

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.770
Aw, man. I'm hungry.

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:52.850
Hey, you punks.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.580
Stop!

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:04.330
Those idiots. They're up to no good again.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.060
Stop!

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:11.120
Damn it! You monsters!

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:13.900
Come on.

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:16.460
Beg for your life.

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:20.200
Don't hide your true feelings, Thorfinn.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.530
Ouch.

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:35.180
If you don't hurry up, your tiny
 little body will end up even smaller.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:48.320
Huh, he didn't even blink. Impressive.

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:53.210
Isn't that one of the master's slaves?

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:04.100
Why do we have to fear death?

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:11.320
Do we live because we don't want to die?

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:19.370
Does anything good come from being alive?

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:27.270
Not for me.

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:38.250
Not a single good thing has 
happened to me in my entire life.

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.300
Your eye is next.

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:06.090
Show me that you're afraid.

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:07.690
Don't, Fox!

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:15.770
S-Snake...

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:29.290
Aw, man. He's in rough shape.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:38.040
B-Boss, welcome back. 
Wh-Wh-When did you get here?

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:38.850
Fox.

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:39.960
Yes, sir.

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.480
Come closer.

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.800
Y-Yes, sir.

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:01.520
Badger.

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:02.920
Yes, sir!

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.980
Explain.

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:54.990
<b>Awakening</b>

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:54.990
<b>Awakening</b>

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.300
"Awakening."
