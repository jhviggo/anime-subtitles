02:33.230 --> 02:34.650
<b>What the hell!</b>

02:35.820 --> 02:38.570
<b>Just let us do it tomorrow! Not today!</b>

02:38.650 --> 02:40.860
<b>Hey, I'm just the messenger.</b>

02:41.530 --> 02:44.240
<b>Anyway, the mistress insisted
that it be done today.</b>

02:44.330 --> 02:45.620
<b>That old hag.</b>

02:46.330 --> 02:48.160
<b>All the other times, she leaves us</b>

02:48.250 --> 02:49.910
<b>in charge of guard duty.</b>

02:50.000 --> 02:53.250
<b>Maybe it has something to do with
the reward of three horses.</b>

02:53.330 --> 02:55.710
<b>She wants a part of the reward?</b>

02:55.800 --> 02:57.590
<b>What a greedy old hag.</b>

03:05.810 --> 03:06.640
<b>Jeez…</b>

03:08.930 --> 03:10.060
<b>Snake,</b>

03:10.940 --> 03:12.350
<b>will you</b>

03:12.440 --> 03:15.480
<b>let me see my husband, Gardar?</b>

03:15.570 --> 03:16.900
<b>No.</b>

03:18.990 --> 03:21.450
<b>He's injured, isn't he?</b>

03:22.070 --> 03:23.410
<b>How…</b>

03:23.990 --> 03:25.950
<b>How are his wounds?</b>

03:26.950 --> 03:28.790
<b>How would I know?</b>

03:29.410 --> 03:32.920
<b>Why do I have to care for
an enemy who killed my subordinate?</b>

03:35.500 --> 03:37.500
<b>Boss, here's a horse.</b>

03:37.590 --> 03:40.670
<b>All right.
We'll be at the mistress' place.</b>

03:40.760 --> 03:44.260
<b>You go and take Arnheid
back to Gramps' house.</b>

03:52.390 --> 03:55.310
<b>They took the horses
so we don't have any left.</b>

03:55.980 --> 03:58.940
<b>Are you serious? I have to walk…</b>

03:59.030 --> 04:00.490
<b>her back?</b>

04:07.580 --> 04:11.120
<b>Please, let me see my husband.</b>

04:11.700 --> 04:14.750
<b>I swear I'm not thinking of
helping him escape.</b>

04:14.830 --> 04:17.130
<b>I just want to care for his wounds.</b>

04:17.840 --> 04:19.920
<b>Huh? Well…</b>

04:23.260 --> 04:26.220
<b>But the boss said…</b>

04:36.560 --> 04:37.610
<b>Hey!</b>

04:38.310 --> 04:40.230
<b>What's going on?</b>

04:40.820 --> 04:43.360
<b>She's the cutie from Master Ketil's place.</b>

04:44.150 --> 04:46.070
<b>Uh, the boss…</b>

04:46.160 --> 04:48.200
<b>The boss gave her permission</b>

04:48.280 --> 04:51.200
<b>to care for Gardar's wounds.
I'm not lying!</b>

05:00.170 --> 05:01.550
<b>Gardar…</b>

05:03.590 --> 05:05.010
<b>Arnheid!</b>

05:41.500 --> 05:43.170
<b>You were beaten?</b>

05:45.760 --> 05:48.890
<b>Please cut this rope, Arnheid.</b>

05:50.090 --> 05:51.800
<b>Let's go home.</b>

05:52.470 --> 05:55.390
<b>-Hey…
-It's fine.</b>

05:55.480 --> 05:57.810
<b>She doesn't have any tools
that can cut the rope.</b>

05:58.390 --> 06:00.440
<b>If you say so.</b>

06:01.110 --> 06:02.770
<b>Hey, Arnheid!</b>

06:02.860 --> 06:05.820
<b>Your husband came
all the way here to take you back.</b>

06:06.400 --> 06:10.200
<b>Forget about his wounds. Why don't you
give him something more special?</b>

06:13.030 --> 06:16.080
<b>I can't care for his wounds
if he's tied up like this.</b>

06:16.620 --> 06:18.330
<b>Can you untie him just for now?</b>

06:18.410 --> 06:21.380
<b>That's not going to happen.</b>

06:21.460 --> 06:23.420
<b>His "thing" isn't tied up, though.</b>

06:23.500 --> 06:25.590
<b>You can still take care of that.</b>

06:26.920 --> 06:28.760
<b>That's right!</b>

06:32.720 --> 06:34.220
<b>Arnheid…</b>

06:39.060 --> 06:40.900
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

06:44.980 --> 06:46.030
<b>I will</b>

06:46.610 --> 06:48.150
<b>never</b>

06:48.650 --> 06:50.610
<b>leave you and Hjalti</b>

06:50.700 --> 06:52.700
<b>alone again.</b>

06:53.700 --> 06:55.620
<b>Never again…</b>

06:57.870 --> 07:00.830
<b>I was wrong.</b>

07:02.710 --> 07:04.130
<b>Please forgive me,</b>

07:05.380 --> 07:06.920
<b>Arnheid.</b>

07:35.450 --> 07:37.700
<b>I made you suffer so much.</b>

07:38.450 --> 07:40.200
<b>Let's start over.</b>

07:40.290 --> 07:42.670
<b>Let's go back to how it was.</b>

07:44.330 --> 07:46.960
<b>Please let me free.</b>

07:49.170 --> 07:52.050
<b>I'm sorry, Gardar.</b>

07:52.970 --> 07:55.050
<b>I'm sorry.</b>

08:01.230 --> 08:02.850
<b>What are you saying?</b>

08:02.940 --> 08:06.110
<b>I'm the one who must
ask for your forgiveness.</b>

08:07.150 --> 08:10.190
<b>Come now, Arnheid.</b>

08:10.280 --> 08:12.150
<b>Get a hold of yourself.</b>

08:21.660 --> 08:23.160
<b>That ruined the mood.</b>

08:24.000 --> 08:28.420
<b>It's starting to rain harder.
I'll take a rest in the hut.</b>

08:28.500 --> 08:30.420
<b>What? Hey!</b>

08:30.510 --> 08:32.550
<b>We were told to keep watch.</b>

08:33.130 --> 08:35.260
<b>One person is enough.</b>

08:35.340 --> 08:37.300
<b>You're the one who brought that woman,</b>

08:37.890 --> 08:39.560
<b>so you take responsibility.</b>

08:40.850 --> 08:42.310
<b>Seriously?</b>

08:46.480 --> 08:47.770
<b>Hey.</b>

08:48.860 --> 08:51.480
<b>Hey, Arnheid!</b>

08:51.570 --> 08:54.820
<b>Are you done? Isn't that enough?</b>

09:03.500 --> 09:07.460
<b>My only fault
is that I'm a sucker for women.</b>

09:08.670 --> 09:10.460
<b>Your time's up.</b>

09:12.710 --> 09:14.090
<b>Come on, get up.</b>

10:26.580 --> 10:29.620
<b>Arnheid! He has a knife on his belt.</b>

10:29.710 --> 10:31.920
<b>Use that to cut my rope.</b>

10:33.210 --> 10:35.920
<b>Hurry up! Arnheid!</b>

10:38.800 --> 10:41.510
<b>Hey! This is bad! He's dead!</b>

10:41.590 --> 10:43.220
<b>I don't know! Just hurry!</b>

10:43.300 --> 10:44.430
<b>Get it together!</b>

10:45.100 --> 10:46.220
<b>Hurry up!</b>

10:46.720 --> 10:48.020
<b>My rope!</b>

10:49.060 --> 10:51.100
<b>We'll both be killed!</b>

10:56.900 --> 10:58.320
<b>Arnheid!</b>

11:24.140 --> 11:25.760
<b>It's no use, Boss.</b>

11:25.850 --> 11:28.100
<b>None of them are breathing.</b>

11:32.350 --> 11:33.980
<b>Those idiots.</b>

11:35.360 --> 11:38.070
<b>I told them to not let their guard down
so many times.</b>

11:42.950 --> 11:44.870
<b>Over here, Boss.</b>

11:47.910 --> 11:49.120
<b>His sword…</b>

11:50.580 --> 11:52.500
<b>Take a look at the tip.</b>

11:53.210 --> 11:57.090
<b>The rain washed away the blood,
but there's still oil on it.</b>

11:57.170 --> 11:59.380
<b>He must have stabbed his opponent.</b>

12:00.460 --> 12:02.840
<b>-That's a deep wound.
-Yes.</b>

12:03.590 --> 12:06.220
<b>He was wounded
on top of being wounded already.</b>

12:07.050 --> 12:09.390
<b>There were no horses here either.</b>

12:11.310 --> 12:12.480
<b>Go after him!</b>

12:13.060 --> 12:15.230
<b>He hasn't gone far.</b>

12:16.110 --> 12:18.730
<b>We will settle this on this farm!</b>

12:20.570 --> 12:21.740
<b>As soon as I find him</b>

12:23.820 --> 12:25.570
<b>I will kill him.</b>

13:00.150 --> 13:02.150
<b>You couldn't sleep,</b>

13:02.230 --> 13:03.240
<b>Einar?</b>

13:07.660 --> 13:09.740
<b>You haven't slept yourself.</b>

13:10.280 --> 13:12.450
<b>You weren't woken up by a nightmare.</b>

13:16.000 --> 13:17.290
<b>Yeah…</b>

13:18.380 --> 13:20.170
<b>Were you keeping an eye on me?</b>

13:21.380 --> 13:23.420
<b>Did you think I would</b>

13:23.510 --> 13:25.510
<b>do something crazy during the night?</b>

13:28.550 --> 13:29.800
<b>I wouldn't.</b>

13:30.390 --> 13:32.520
<b>I don't want to make
life harder for Arnheid.</b>

13:37.810 --> 13:39.440
<b>It's not fair, is it?</b>

13:40.770 --> 13:44.240
<b>We were just living in peace, that's all.</b>

13:46.780 --> 13:48.200
<b>Violence</b>

13:48.860 --> 13:51.660
<b>has robbed us of our freedom,
and that's just wrong.</b>

13:52.740 --> 13:54.160
<b>It must be wrong.</b>

14:02.000 --> 14:03.340
<b>As someone</b>

14:04.050 --> 14:07.010
<b>who was doing nothing but fighting wars,</b>

14:07.760 --> 14:09.680
<b>I don't have the right to say anything.</b>

14:10.430 --> 14:11.720
<b>But…</b>

14:12.850 --> 14:14.430
<b>it's wrong.</b>

14:15.270 --> 14:16.980
<b>It was wrong.</b>

14:19.400 --> 14:21.110
<b>Arnheid</b>

14:21.190 --> 14:23.730
<b>doesn't know that
you used to be a warrior.</b>

14:26.280 --> 14:27.860
<b>I'm pathetic.</b>

14:28.490 --> 14:30.110
<b>I'm scared</b>

14:30.200 --> 14:33.580
<b>of the thought of people like her
finding that out about me.</b>

14:35.120 --> 14:38.080
<b>How was I able to hurt all those people</b>

14:38.160 --> 14:40.080
<b>like it was nothing?</b>

14:42.840 --> 14:44.920
<b>I can't even imagine</b>

14:45.000 --> 14:46.170
<b>you being that way.</b>

14:50.220 --> 14:51.640
<b>Hey Thorfinn,</b>

14:52.470 --> 14:54.760
<b>you know that thing you mentioned before?</b>

14:55.310 --> 14:57.770
<b>-Are you serious about it?
-What?</b>

14:58.850 --> 15:00.810
<b>Remember you asked me if I thought</b>

15:00.900 --> 15:03.230
<b>it was possible to rid this world</b>

15:03.310 --> 15:04.770
<b>of war and slavery?</b>

15:06.360 --> 15:09.320
<b>It just sounds like a dream to me.</b>

15:09.860 --> 15:12.570
<b>But as someone who has
experienced both sides,</b>

15:12.660 --> 15:14.780
<b>I bet you can come up with an idea.</b>

15:18.410 --> 15:19.660
<b>What do we need to do?</b>

15:20.790 --> 15:21.920
<b>How do we</b>

15:22.500 --> 15:25.170
<b>get rid of war and slavery?</b>

15:29.800 --> 15:31.260
<b>I only know</b>

15:31.340 --> 15:34.050
<b>about the things I experienced myself.</b>

15:36.260 --> 15:39.640
<b>But there's no doubt that wars
produce many slaves.</b>

15:40.770 --> 15:43.150
<b>Those who are defeated in war</b>

15:43.230 --> 15:45.440
<b>are turned into slaves.</b>

15:46.320 --> 15:50.070
<b>Just as you and Arnheid were.</b>

15:51.860 --> 15:55.280
<b>The line between warriors
and slave traders is ambiguous.</b>

15:56.490 --> 15:59.700
<b>There are other things
that lead to slavery,</b>

15:59.790 --> 16:02.080
<b>but I think the biggest cause is war.</b>

16:02.670 --> 16:06.590
<b>If the number of wars decline
the number of slaves will too.</b>

16:10.510 --> 16:13.340
<b>But Nordic men</b>

16:13.430 --> 16:16.510
<b>don't view war as something bad.</b>

16:17.930 --> 16:21.850
<b>Nordic men measure their worth
by valor and wealth.</b>

16:22.810 --> 16:24.810
<b>The more people you kill</b>

16:24.900 --> 16:28.360
<b>and the more wealth you return with,
the more you are respected.</b>

16:29.730 --> 16:32.610
<b>That is why fathers
teach their sons how to fight,</b>

16:33.360 --> 16:36.120
<b>give them weapons and armor,
and take them on warships.</b>

16:36.780 --> 16:39.620
<b>That has always been
the normal thing to do</b>

16:39.700 --> 16:41.790
<b>for us Nordic men.</b>

16:43.410 --> 16:47.710
<b>Whatever it is, it's always difficult
to stop doing what is considered the norm.</b>

16:50.090 --> 16:52.880
<b>But there are also men like you.</b>

16:53.880 --> 16:56.470
<b>Is vowing to never hurt another person</b>

16:56.550 --> 16:58.550
<b>such a strange thing to do?</b>

17:00.720 --> 17:02.730
<b>In Nordic society,</b>

17:03.390 --> 17:05.520
<b>cowards cannot survive.</b>

17:10.440 --> 17:11.900
<b>But that's fine.</b>

17:12.740 --> 17:15.570
<b>If it means I don't have to
carry any more of them,</b>

17:15.650 --> 17:18.240
<b>I would happily be an outcast.</b>

17:20.200 --> 17:21.200
<b>"Them"?</b>

17:27.000 --> 17:28.670
<b>The dead.</b>

17:30.920 --> 17:33.800
<b>The people I have killed.</b>

17:35.130 --> 17:37.800
<b>Their ghosts appear before me
almost every night</b>

17:38.430 --> 17:40.430
<b>and torment me.</b>

17:41.060 --> 17:42.970
<b>They say, "Why did you kill?</b>

17:43.060 --> 17:44.850
<b>After your father was killed,</b>

17:44.930 --> 17:47.940
<b>you were so angry and resentful.</b>

17:48.480 --> 17:50.940
<b>So why did you, out of all people,
kill so many</b>

17:51.020 --> 17:53.190
<b>fathers, brothers, and sons?"</b>

17:55.150 --> 17:57.030
<b>I have to make amends</b>

17:57.110 --> 17:59.570
<b>for what I did to these people.</b>

18:00.120 --> 18:02.990
<b>I have to take these people to a place</b>

18:03.080 --> 18:05.120
<b>where they can rest in peace.</b>

18:07.920 --> 18:09.540
<b>I'm at my limit.</b>

18:10.540 --> 18:14.170
<b>I can't take on even one more person.</b>

18:21.180 --> 18:22.890
<b>I'm constantly thinking</b>

18:23.810 --> 18:26.810
<b>about how I can repay them.</b>

18:28.270 --> 18:31.940
<b>Vowing to never kill
or destroy anything anymore isn't enough</b>

18:32.020 --> 18:33.770
<b>to be called atonement.</b>

18:37.030 --> 18:40.160
<b>To make up for all the wheat
I've trampled on,</b>

18:40.240 --> 18:42.280
<b>I have to grow more with my own hands.</b>

18:43.620 --> 18:46.330
<b>To make up for
all the houses I've burned down,</b>

18:46.410 --> 18:48.460
<b>I have to build more with my own hands.</b>

18:49.830 --> 18:53.340
<b>I still don't know how to
rid this entire world</b>

18:53.420 --> 18:55.170
<b>of war altogether.</b>

18:56.170 --> 19:00.010
<b>But even if it's just
one place in this world…</b>

19:00.510 --> 19:02.760
<b>It could even be just one village…</b>

19:05.100 --> 19:06.850
<b>I want to create</b>

19:06.930 --> 19:09.560
<b>a place where we no longer need swords.</b>

19:20.990 --> 19:22.490
<b>But</b>

19:22.570 --> 19:25.160
<b>how would you protect that place?</b>

19:26.660 --> 19:28.790
<b>I hate war myself.</b>

19:29.620 --> 19:33.670
<b>But Vikings will come wherever you are.</b>

19:34.420 --> 19:37.050
<b>Sometimes you have to fight</b>

19:37.130 --> 19:39.260
<b>to protect your peace and freedom.</b>

19:42.970 --> 19:43.970
<b>But</b>

19:45.010 --> 19:47.310
<b>that won't do.</b>

19:48.720 --> 19:51.440
<b>There's no point
if you use war to keep peace.</b>

19:51.940 --> 19:53.650
<b>If you do,</b>

19:53.730 --> 19:56.770
<b>you'll never be able to escape
from that bloodstained hell.</b>

20:02.950 --> 20:04.240
<b>I guess</b>

20:04.990 --> 20:07.490
<b>a story that sounds like a dream</b>

20:07.580 --> 20:09.580
<b>is nothing but a dream.</b>

20:11.660 --> 20:14.790
<b>We have to go to the ends of the earth,</b>

20:14.880 --> 20:17.130
<b>somewhere far, far away.</b>

20:18.050 --> 20:21.090
<b>Somewhere even Vikings can't get to.</b>

20:22.420 --> 20:25.260
<b>A land</b>

20:25.970 --> 20:28.220
<b>just for outcasts.</b>

20:36.610 --> 20:39.440
<b>If we run away far beyond the ocean,</b>

20:39.520 --> 20:42.690
<b>I wonder what we'll find there.</b>

20:45.320 --> 20:46.450
<b>I'm sure</b>

20:46.950 --> 20:48.450
<b>there will be nothing.</b>

20:49.330 --> 20:52.910
<b>No matter how far you go,
it'll be the same as it is here.</b>

20:53.710 --> 20:57.540
<b>There will only be war and slave traders.</b>

21:06.970 --> 21:08.550
<b>Far west…</b>

21:09.550 --> 21:11.220
<b>Beyond the ocean…</b>

21:17.810 --> 21:20.400
<b>A land out of the reach of any ruler,</b>

21:20.480 --> 21:23.320
<b>a land no slave trader knows about,</b>

21:23.400 --> 21:26.320
<b>a land far beyond the horizon.</b>

21:29.370 --> 21:31.740
<b>There is actually a place like that?</b>

21:31.830 --> 21:35.330
<b>There is. I had forgotten about it.</b>

21:35.410 --> 21:38.170
<b>When I was a child, a sailor named Leif</b>

21:38.250 --> 21:40.250
<b>told me about it.</b>

21:42.000 --> 21:43.760
<b>Beyond the vast ocean to the west,</b>

21:43.840 --> 21:46.300
<b>there supposedly is fertile land.</b>

21:47.010 --> 21:49.390
<b>He said there's land that's untouched.</b>

21:52.140 --> 21:54.640
<b>That's amazing.</b>

21:55.230 --> 21:58.400
<b>Then… Then if we go there…</b>

21:58.480 --> 21:59.900
<b>No…</b>

22:00.860 --> 22:03.780
<b>He also told me
that it is tremendously far.</b>

22:03.860 --> 22:05.860
<b>And I don't know the exact location.</b>

22:08.070 --> 22:10.700
<b>Plus, we're talking about
building a nation.</b>

22:10.780 --> 22:13.870
<b>We have to take a multitude
of outcasts there.</b>

22:14.580 --> 22:16.160
<b>It'll be a huge project.</b>

22:22.750 --> 22:24.170
<b>I see.</b>

22:25.010 --> 22:27.050
<b>But you know,</b>

22:28.720 --> 22:32.260
<b>that's the best thing
I've heard in a while.</b>

23:04.290 --> 23:05.500
<b>Be careful.</b>

23:06.170 --> 23:07.340
<b>He's strong.</b>

23:10.090 --> 23:12.720
<b>Wh… What is going on</b>

23:12.800 --> 23:14.510
<b>so early in the morning?</b>

23:18.980 --> 23:22.480
<b>It doesn't seem like anyone's here.</b>

23:22.560 --> 23:25.270
<b>I can't tell with all this junk.</b>

23:25.360 --> 23:28.280
<b>Throw everything out!</b>

23:31.150 --> 23:34.410
<b>Jeez, what is this all about?</b>

23:36.450 --> 23:37.950
<b>He escaped.</b>

23:38.040 --> 23:41.670
<b>-What?
-Gardar escaped.</b>

23:41.750 --> 23:45.460
<b>Is there any other reason
why they would be ransacking our shed?</b>

23:51.930 --> 23:53.510
<b>Arnheid!</b>

25:53.840 --> 25:54.760
<b>''Cause.''</b>
