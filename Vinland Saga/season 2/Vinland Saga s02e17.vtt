<b><i>He's fast!</i></b>

02:03.910 --> 02:06.500
<b><i>Faster than anyone</i>
<i>I've ever fought before.</i></b>

02:20.050 --> 02:22.300
<b><i>And that sword…</i></b>

02:23.180 --> 02:25.600
<b><i>He uses the curve on the blade</i></b>

02:25.680 --> 02:28.100
<b><i>to make up for the difference in reach.</i></b>

02:30.310 --> 02:33.690
<b><i>You've got to be kidding me. He's unarmed!</i></b>

02:34.650 --> 02:37.570
<b><i>I'm a warrior from Miklagard,</i>
<i>for crying out loud.</i></b>

02:41.820 --> 02:45.200
<b><i>"I have never once been glad," was it?</i></b>

02:47.120 --> 02:48.250
<b><i>Jeez…</i></b>

02:48.750 --> 02:53.000
<b><i>What kind of monsters</i>
<i>was he surrounded by?</i></b>

03:08.270 --> 03:09.560
<b><i>I'll keep hammering him.</i></b>

03:14.400 --> 03:15.730
<b><i>You can't hit me!</i></b>

03:31.290 --> 03:32.580
<b><i>-He's strong.</i>
<i>-He's strong.</i></b>

03:34.250 --> 03:38.090
<b><i>Why is such a skilled fighter</i>
<i>working as a bodyguard on a farm?</i></b>

03:38.670 --> 03:42.380
<b><i>How did a man like him become a slave?</i></b>

03:43.800 --> 03:48.720
<b><i>No, I need to calm down.</i>
<i>I can't let him set the pace.</i></b>

03:50.060 --> 03:51.640
<b><i>All I need to do…</i></b>

04:03.700 --> 04:05.530
<b><i>He can move even faster?</i></b>

04:09.910 --> 04:10.950
<b><i>I can see it.</i></b>

04:26.510 --> 04:27.760
<b><i>He got me.</i></b>

04:29.260 --> 04:30.890
<b><i>Gardar is…</i></b>

04:53.410 --> 04:54.960
<b>-Snake!
-Don't do it, Snake!</b>

04:59.420 --> 05:00.590
<b>Don't kill…</b>

05:02.090 --> 05:03.510
<b>Gardar.</b>

05:05.470 --> 05:06.630
<b>Please…</b>

05:07.470 --> 05:09.470
<b>let him go.</b>

05:16.940 --> 05:20.480
<b>Get your head out of the clouds, Arnheid.</b>

05:21.480 --> 05:24.780
<b>He killed five of my subordinates.</b>

05:24.860 --> 05:26.650
<b>There's no way I can forgive him.</b>

05:27.450 --> 05:34.040
<b>Snake! I will do everything that I can
to honor the deaths of your subordinates.</b>

05:34.120 --> 05:37.460
<b>-Even if that means selling my fields--
-Shut up, Gramps!</b>

05:37.540 --> 05:39.460
<b>It's not about the money.</b>

05:43.130 --> 05:46.590
<b>It's true that
my subordinates and I are all</b>

05:46.670 --> 05:49.390
<b>stupid, good-for-nothing,
small-time crooks.</b>

05:50.050 --> 05:55.390
<b>We're vagabonds who can't even use
our real names because of past offenses.</b>

05:56.060 --> 05:59.900
<b>Is that why you don't care
even if they die?</b>

06:00.610 --> 06:03.690
<b>Is Gardar's life worth that much?</b>

06:03.780 --> 06:06.360
<b>Is it worth more than
five of my subordinates?</b>

06:06.440 --> 06:09.780
<b>Tell me, Thorfinn and Arnheid,</b>

06:10.490 --> 06:12.830
<b>the difference in their worth.</b>

06:22.710 --> 06:25.670
<b>That means there is no difference.</b>

06:26.880 --> 06:29.550
<b>-Well then…
-No!</b>

06:30.130 --> 06:32.180
<b>I will have him pay</b>

06:32.760 --> 06:35.680
<b>a life for a life!</b>

07:21.270 --> 07:23.100
<b>Are you still going to fight?</b>

07:24.900 --> 07:26.820
<b>Will you get revenge</b>

07:27.480 --> 07:28.610
<b>for Gardar?</b>

07:33.610 --> 07:37.540
<b>You're the one who cut
Gardar's rope, right Arnheid?</b>

07:39.370 --> 07:42.330
<b>You guys will be punished
for what you did.</b>

07:43.620 --> 07:46.130
<b>I'll tie you up until the master returns--</b>

08:16.950 --> 08:19.580
<b>That's enough! Gardar!</b>

08:23.500 --> 08:25.580
<b>If you keep that up he'll die!</b>

08:26.290 --> 08:27.590
<b>Gardar!</b>

08:28.250 --> 08:30.800
<b>Damn it! How strong is he?</b>

08:35.970 --> 08:37.680
<b>Gardar!</b>

08:40.390 --> 08:41.600
<b>Let go!</b>

08:44.270 --> 08:45.350
<b>Gardar!</b>

08:56.490 --> 08:58.120
<b>Gardar…</b>

09:00.120 --> 09:02.580
<b>Let's go back, Gardar.</b>

09:11.500 --> 09:13.210
<b>It's all right now.</b>

09:14.260 --> 09:18.050
<b>No one is trying to
get in our way anymore.</b>

09:19.050 --> 09:21.560
<b>Hjalti is waiting for us too.</b>

09:48.170 --> 09:49.670
<b>Hjalti…</b>

09:52.800 --> 09:54.130
<b>Where</b>

09:55.760 --> 09:57.680
<b>is he now?</b>

10:12.650 --> 10:16.900
<b>Your older brother
is looking after him in Birka.</b>

10:17.400 --> 10:20.490
<b>I had him take refuge there
before the war began.</b>

10:22.910 --> 10:24.490
<b>I see.</b>

10:25.490 --> 10:28.370
<b>My older brother
is always taking care of me.</b>

10:29.290 --> 10:32.210
<b>When we go to pick up Hjalti,</b>

10:32.290 --> 10:34.750
<b>I have to take a thank you gift.</b>

10:37.880 --> 10:41.140
<b>-Excuse me, you there.
-Huh?</b>

10:41.840 --> 10:44.850
<b>Is this wagon yours?</b>

10:45.720 --> 10:47.100
<b>I would like to borrow it.</b>

10:48.020 --> 10:51.150
<b>-No…
-It's mine.</b>

10:52.610 --> 10:54.360
<b>I'll give it to you,</b>

10:55.070 --> 10:56.400
<b>Gardar.</b>

11:02.410 --> 11:05.120
<b>Pardon me for speaking to you
from up here.</b>

11:05.200 --> 11:07.910
<b>What is your name, sir?</b>

11:09.120 --> 11:11.290
<b>I'm Sverkel.</b>

11:12.210 --> 11:15.880
<b>Go on, back to your home.</b>

11:17.380 --> 11:20.930
<b>Thank you, Sverkel.</b>

11:27.930 --> 11:29.230
<b>Thorfinn…</b>

11:30.850 --> 11:37.190
<b>Words cannot express my gratitude
for you and Einar.</b>

11:38.190 --> 11:40.570
<b>This is reckless, Arnheid.</b>

11:41.570 --> 11:44.620
<b>Gardar isn't going to…</b>

11:51.750 --> 11:52.960
<b>It's fine.</b>

11:58.590 --> 12:00.460
<b>Please send us off.</b>

12:48.010 --> 12:49.390
<b><i>It's cold.</i></b>

12:51.770 --> 12:54.890
<b><i>I'm frozen to the core.</i></b>

13:08.660 --> 13:09.830
<b><i>How pitiful…</i></b>

13:11.740 --> 13:14.080
<b><i>Such unfortunate beings who were</i></b>

13:14.870 --> 13:17.000
<b><i>abandoned by the gods.</i></b>

14:28.780 --> 14:30.200
<b>You are…</b>

14:32.530 --> 14:35.410
<b>You are my new pride and joy.</b>

14:36.830 --> 14:41.210
<b>Hjalti! Hjalti, son of Gardar!</b>

14:43.040 --> 14:45.380
<b>I will continue fighting…</b>

14:46.130 --> 14:49.260
<b>so you can take pride in my honor</b>

14:49.970 --> 14:52.890
<b>and so we can become wealthy someday.</b>

15:55.530 --> 15:57.080
<b>One second!</b>

16:24.730 --> 16:25.810
<b>What is it?</b>

17:18.030 --> 17:19.450
<b>For honor</b>

17:20.280 --> 17:21.870
<b>and wealth.</b>

17:24.960 --> 17:26.120
<b>Gardar?</b>

17:33.630 --> 17:35.550
<b>How old</b>

17:36.430 --> 17:37.970
<b>is Hjalti now?</b>

17:39.760 --> 17:40.890
<b>Eight?</b>

17:41.510 --> 17:42.850
<b>Nine?</b>

17:47.190 --> 17:48.350
<b>He's six.</b>

17:51.270 --> 17:52.940
<b>My goodness…</b>

17:53.610 --> 17:57.530
<b>I've lost track of time
ever since I became a slave.</b>

17:59.200 --> 18:02.620
<b>Six, huh? I see…</b>

18:02.700 --> 18:03.990
<b>That's too bad.</b>

18:05.080 --> 18:08.370
<b>I couldn't see him
at his most adorable age.</b>

18:10.040 --> 18:13.460
<b>He was still one when I parted with him.</b>

18:15.880 --> 18:17.130
<b>Man…</b>

18:18.260 --> 18:21.930
<b>He has probably long forgotten about us.</b>

18:26.020 --> 18:31.940
<b>Considering the fact that he's my child,
I bet he's causing quite the mischief.</b>

18:32.940 --> 18:35.530
<b>Like setting fire to the horse's tail.</b>

18:37.530 --> 18:41.280
<b>You did such a thing
when you were a child?</b>

18:42.030 --> 18:45.540
<b>Yeah. My father got so mad at me.</b>

18:52.420 --> 18:54.040
<b>When he becomes old enough,</b>

18:55.050 --> 18:58.220
<b>he'll probably say that
he wants to become a Viking.</b>

18:58.880 --> 19:00.970
<b>Like all boys do.</b>

19:06.060 --> 19:08.810
<b>But I will not allow that.</b>

19:24.490 --> 19:25.580
<b>Gardar!</b>

19:41.720 --> 19:43.180
<b>It's okay.</b>

19:44.970 --> 19:47.220
<b>I'm a little tired, that's all.</b>

19:49.470 --> 19:51.100
<b>Just let me rest.</b>

20:33.480 --> 20:35.650
<b>You're sure about this?</b>

20:35.730 --> 20:38.650
<b>Yeah. We've made up our minds.</b>

20:38.730 --> 20:42.530
<b>If we get the iron,
we'll be able to live comfortably.</b>

20:42.610 --> 20:44.450
<b>Your family too.</b>

20:49.950 --> 20:52.450
<b>-Okay. I'll go too.
-All right!</b>

20:55.210 --> 20:57.710
<b>Everyone's gathered at the village square.</b>

20:57.790 --> 20:59.710
<b>Come on, let's hurry.</b>

21:24.860 --> 21:26.320
<b>Arnheid…</b>

21:28.660 --> 21:30.280
<b>Hjalti…</b>

21:33.290 --> 21:35.500
<b>I will never</b>

21:36.710 --> 21:39.130
<b>leave you two alone</b>

21:40.630 --> 21:41.500
<b>again…</b>

23:31.700 --> 23:35.910
<b>I'm… home…</b>

23:54.340 --> 23:55.390
<b>Welcome home…</b>

23:57.850 --> 23:59.430
<b>Welcome home…</b>
