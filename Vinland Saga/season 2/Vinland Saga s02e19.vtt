00:20.410 --> 00:25.460
<b>The Battle of Ketil's Farm</b>

00:20.410 --> 00:25.460
<b>The Battle of Ketil's Farm</b>

00:23.730 --> 00:26.080
There's about 350 here.

00:26.580 --> 00:30.150
Only around 100 of them 
will be any good in a fight.

00:30.640 --> 00:33.800
Get an exact head count later.

00:35.360 --> 00:39.220
Are we really doing this, boss?

00:40.240 --> 00:43.230
The master insists on fighting.

00:43.230 --> 00:44.620
We have no choice.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.440
They're out of their minds.

00:51.200 --> 00:55.610
Do they think they stand a chance 
against the king's forces?

00:56.480 --> 00:59.930
They all owe money to the master.

00:59.930 --> 01:04.360
They were told he'd cancel their debts 
if they fought in the battle.

01:05.300 --> 01:09.510
If they'd known they'd be fighting the king, 
they probably wouldn't have shown up.

01:09.510 --> 01:14.180
But now that they're here, their vanity 
as Norse men won't allow them to leave.

01:15.590 --> 01:18.730
And the more of them there are, 
the bolder they get.

01:19.260 --> 01:21.610
They start feeling like 
they could actually win.

01:22.040 --> 01:25.560
Waiting until they were gathered 
to tell them they'd be fighting the king

01:25.560 --> 01:27.440
was a smart choice.

01:30.520 --> 01:34.920
Thorgil's a better strategist 
than I expected.

01:55.160 --> 01:56.680
The master intends to fight.

01:57.180 --> 01:59.090
The soldiers have gathered.

02:00.230 --> 02:03.050
This place will become a battlefield.

02:04.670 --> 02:06.880
See? It's just like we told you.

02:06.880 --> 02:11.480
We need to leave this farm right away, 
or we'll get caught up in it, Thorfinn.

02:12.180 --> 02:14.980
I know, but...

02:24.870 --> 02:26.300
Mister Leif.

02:28.520 --> 02:34.500
We can't leave the farm with
 Arnheid in this condition, sir.

02:36.640 --> 02:43.560
Thank you for caring about me.

02:46.660 --> 02:49.020
You've changed, Thorfinn.

02:50.160 --> 02:53.540
When I first saw you, 
I thought you were someone else.

02:57.240 --> 03:00.950
The look on your face is 
better these days, Thorfinn.

03:06.550 --> 03:08.890
I finally got to see you.

03:08.890 --> 03:13.860
I can't leave without you.

03:16.400 --> 03:17.950
Mr. Pater, she's coughing again.

03:17.950 --> 03:19.710
Roll her onto her side.

03:19.710 --> 03:22.120
Don't let her choke on anything she spits up.

03:23.540 --> 03:28.810
Pater, would it be possible to move Arnheid?

03:29.720 --> 03:33.400
We should be cautious with her now.

03:34.050 --> 03:37.850
We'd know how she's doing if she'd wake up,

03:38.520 --> 03:43.940
but honestly, not even I can tell 
her condition right now.

03:45.030 --> 03:48.340
There's also the child inside her to consider.

03:48.760 --> 03:52.030
Rest is the what she needs most right now,

03:52.030 --> 03:55.080
at least until she regains consciousness.

03:57.520 --> 04:03.290
One day. Let's wait and see 
how things go for just one more day.

04:04.190 --> 04:06.410
Are you serious?

04:06.410 --> 04:08.970
What about after that?

04:17.910 --> 04:19.940
Boss, hurry.

04:21.200 --> 04:22.350
North?

04:22.350 --> 04:23.200
Yes.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.690
Where I'm pointing.

04:30.870 --> 04:32.840
They're here sooner than expected.

04:33.840 --> 04:35.360
Notify the master!

04:35.360 --> 04:37.540
Ships have been spotted 
in the sea to the north!

04:38.870 --> 04:42.120
The king's forces have arrived.

06:30.450 --> 06:32.700
Idiot, don't shoot unless you're told to!

06:33.080 --> 06:35.660
You'll never reach them at this range.

06:35.960 --> 06:38.660
Once they're closer, we'll fire off a—

06:51.840 --> 06:55.060
Crap! Retreat, retreat!

06:55.870 --> 06:57.100
Damn it!

06:57.530 --> 07:00.120
How are they reaching us from so far away?

07:09.490 --> 07:12.620
Fan out and take control of the area!

07:12.620 --> 07:14.990
Aid His Majesty's landing!

07:25.760 --> 07:29.720
It seems Ketil intends to fight me.

07:31.060 --> 07:33.310
Send a messenger, Ulf.

07:33.310 --> 07:36.860
We'll take up position here 
and await Ketil's response.

07:36.860 --> 07:37.750
Yes, Your Majesty.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.410
This is good land.

07:45.080 --> 07:47.140
It'd be a shame to stain it with blood.

07:56.440 --> 08:00.330
For the aforementioned reasons, 
His Majesty, King Canute

08:00.330 --> 08:07.880
has sentenced the insurrectionist Ketil 
and his clan to ten years of outlawry.

08:08.470 --> 08:12.280
Though normally they would be 
executed for their crimes,

08:12.280 --> 08:19.500
Ketil's clan shall be allowed to live 
thanks to His Majesty's kindness.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.940
Humbly accept your punishment.

08:24.960 --> 08:29.520
That's all. If you don't want to die, 
then get out of the country.

08:29.520 --> 08:32.360
We'll wait until tomorrow morning 
for your response.

08:40.290 --> 08:44.290
How could you useless lot 
let them land without a fight?

08:46.040 --> 08:49.550
Insurrectionist? Outlawry?

08:49.550 --> 08:52.920
Don't push your luck, boy.

08:53.680 --> 08:55.380
I'm back.

08:56.300 --> 09:00.810
Ah, Thorgil. How did Canute's forces look?

09:01.780 --> 09:05.440
They were cooking and eating 
their lunch at leisure.

09:06.200 --> 09:09.200
Two warships, two cargo ships.

09:09.200 --> 09:12.570
They've pitched tents 
right next to their landing site.

09:12.570 --> 09:15.450
There are about 100 of them.

09:17.520 --> 09:19.050
100?

09:19.050 --> 09:22.380
Yeah, excluding slaves and servants.

09:28.130 --> 09:33.590
That's less than a third of our numbers.

09:34.200 --> 09:41.240
Did Canute think we'd kneel 
if the king himself came?

09:41.760 --> 09:46.870
This land is full of reckless men 
who won't yield to the king.

09:47.350 --> 09:49.800
Muster your courage, men!

09:49.800 --> 09:54.940
Whoever brings me the king's head 
will receive whatever he wants!

09:58.210 --> 10:00.060
What fools.

10:02.640 --> 10:04.760
That's not just any 100 men.

10:06.260 --> 10:11.610
The guys around the big tent are thegns.

10:12.600 --> 10:16.260
Y-You mean the king's really here?

10:17.360 --> 10:23.060
And if they're the king's guard, 
they're among the strongest men in Denmark.

10:23.560 --> 10:26.150
They're Thorgil's former brothers-in-arms.

10:26.940 --> 10:30.090
I-In other words,

10:30.870 --> 10:34.470
they're all about as strong as Thorgil?

10:35.640 --> 10:39.480
Wh-What about the guys in white capes?

10:39.480 --> 10:42.430
Are they weaker than the king's guard?

10:42.430 --> 10:45.400
You mean you've never seen them before?

10:46.560 --> 10:49.500
Those are Jomsvikings.

10:53.440 --> 10:57.300
I've never seen you 
open your eyes so wide before.

11:01.170 --> 11:03.670
We can't beat them.

11:05.520 --> 11:10.700
They far outclass our ragtag 
group of peasant soldiers.

11:10.700 --> 11:15.600
They're the kind of guys who think about war
 and nothing else from morning 'til night.

11:16.760 --> 11:20.760
The master won't understand that 
until we fight them once.

11:22.920 --> 11:25.390
If you want to run, then run.

11:25.390 --> 11:28.410
King Canute has given us time to flee.

11:29.490 --> 11:32.710
B-Boss, what are you going to do?

11:33.430 --> 11:36.590
I'm the commander. I can't run.

11:37.490 --> 11:43.960
I'll do my best to keep as many of 
those 350 cocky idiots alive as I can.

11:44.860 --> 11:51.160
Th-Then let's tie up Ketil's clan 
and hand them over.

11:51.160 --> 11:54.350
Yeah, then we won't have to fight.

11:54.890 --> 11:57.470
Are we going to tie up Thorgil, too?

11:57.470 --> 12:01.260
Don't be a wuss. 
I bet eight of us could take him.

12:01.260 --> 12:04.110
Thorgil isn't the only problem.

12:04.540 --> 12:07.370
There's also the renowned Iron Fist Ketil.

12:07.370 --> 12:10.750
You heard he beat a bear to
 death with his bare hands, right?

12:13.910 --> 12:17.520
Run away with us, boss.

12:17.520 --> 12:20.900
There's no point in being stubborn.

12:23.800 --> 12:25.640
Iron Fist, huh?

12:27.040 --> 12:30.180
I know all about the Iron Fist.

12:31.990 --> 12:34.600
I met him when I was around 15 or 16.

12:35.130 --> 12:38.510
He taught me how to fight on the battlefield.

12:38.510 --> 12:41.350
He was insanely strong.

12:42.770 --> 12:46.410
He was like an older brother or boss to me.

12:48.780 --> 12:52.990
Years ago, I screwed up.

12:52.990 --> 12:55.290
I ended up on the run.

12:55.960 --> 12:59.790
I thought Ketil would shelter me.

12:59.790 --> 13:03.980
I followed the rumors to this farm.

13:05.640 --> 13:10.390
But when I finally arrived...

13:11.540 --> 13:14.890
Who are you? Do you have business with me?

13:16.000 --> 13:19.670
...I found a completely different person.

13:23.150 --> 13:26.410
Wh-What? Seriously?

13:27.360 --> 13:30.150
The master's full of shit.

13:30.150 --> 13:33.410
He's taking advantage of the fact 
that they share the same name.

13:34.900 --> 13:36.440
That's appalling.

13:36.440 --> 13:39.290
I'm amazed he's never been 
exposed before now.

13:39.680 --> 13:46.720
With nowhere else to go, 
I've stayed here as his guard dog.

13:48.430 --> 13:51.450
I've been getting a free ride 
for long enough.

13:53.120 --> 13:56.500
It's time to pay my tab.

14:07.810 --> 14:10.530
You boys do what you want.

14:10.530 --> 14:15.270
All I meant is that the master is 
a con artist not worth dying for.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.790
Take care.

14:41.700 --> 14:44.380
Don't try to show off, idiots.

14:44.380 --> 14:47.820
You'll die before you get 
the chance to pay off your tabs.

14:47.820 --> 14:49.850
Sh-Sh-Shut up!

14:50.870 --> 14:57.580
Dine-and-dashing on a con artist 
would make us absolute scumbags.

14:57.580 --> 15:00.790
We'll work to earn our board.

15:04.040 --> 15:07.720
Don't go telling anyone else 
what I just told you.

15:37.600 --> 15:40.120
Their backs are to the sea.

15:40.120 --> 15:43.110
The king's forces have formed two lines here.

15:44.530 --> 15:46.780
This circle is King Canute.

15:46.780 --> 15:52.260
They've beached their ships, and their 
backs are completely undefended.

15:53.300 --> 15:57.390
They know we don't have proper forces.

15:59.890 --> 16:04.160
The terrain provides good visibility. 
Surprise attacks won't work.

16:04.160 --> 16:06.570
Olmar, how would you attack?

16:07.400 --> 16:11.200
What? U-Uh, at night?

16:11.200 --> 16:16.000
Wrong. Only first-class soldiers 
attack at night.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.910
Amateurs can't pull that off.

16:19.760 --> 16:23.580
They're useless pieces of shit.

16:23.580 --> 16:26.170
They'll all be dead by the time 
you count to 100.

16:26.560 --> 16:31.910
Wh-What? Then why did 
we bother gathering them?

16:34.040 --> 16:35.550
You amateur.

16:35.930 --> 16:38.180
Isn't it obvious?

16:39.490 --> 16:44.920
They'll draw the king's attention 
while you're counting to 100.

16:59.480 --> 17:03.160
Thorgil! Where are you, Thorgil?

17:04.120 --> 17:06.790
This is an important moment.

17:07.800 --> 17:10.550
Master, everyone's ready.

17:10.550 --> 17:14.330
All right. Fire on my command.

17:15.240 --> 17:16.660
Draw!

17:19.140 --> 17:22.270
Master, this is my final warning.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.240
If we fight, we'll lose.

17:26.250 --> 17:28.100
Enough, Snake.

17:28.640 --> 17:34.070
The great Iron Fist Ketil is a match 
for that youngster in every way.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.890
Fire!

17:55.770 --> 17:57.260
It's started.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.580
Stay safe, Mister Pater.

18:06.020 --> 18:06.950
Damn it!

18:11.880 --> 18:14.110
It's all right. Let's keep going.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.950
Both forces are locked in combat.

18:19.510 --> 18:21.620
Slowly. Try not to shake the wagon.

18:28.160 --> 18:30.970
Don't blame me for whatever happens.

18:30.970 --> 18:34.840
This is theft, isn't it? I'm a thief now...

18:35.210 --> 18:39.160
Don't worry about it. 
We left behind enough to pay for her.

18:40.760 --> 18:43.850
You get things done when you need to, huh?

18:44.280 --> 18:47.910
She's Thorfinn's friend. 
We can't abandon her.

18:47.910 --> 18:50.820
If she stays here, she'll be killed.

18:57.380 --> 19:01.700
We didn't get to say goodbye 
to the old master.

19:36.680 --> 19:39.430
Are the children asleep?

19:44.610 --> 19:45.740
Yes.

19:47.300 --> 19:51.620
The rocking of the cart 
puts them to sleep so quickly.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.180
Are you afraid?

20:03.120 --> 20:07.780
Don't worry. 
We'll be out of these dark woods soon.

20:09.800 --> 20:14.420
This place is a heap of pain and despair.

20:14.420 --> 20:17.460
A forest of beasts who thirst for blood.

20:18.160 --> 20:20.820
Not a place to foster life.

20:24.140 --> 20:28.460
We have a warm home waiting for us.

20:30.470 --> 20:33.620
It's been a long and difficult road.

20:34.440 --> 20:37.670
But that pain will end soon.

20:40.100 --> 20:41.170
Yes.

20:43.600 --> 20:44.870
You're right.

20:59.780 --> 21:00.860
But...

21:03.700 --> 21:05.380
They're still here.

21:08.000 --> 21:12.140
Lives still try to survive here.

21:18.050 --> 21:19.030
Gardar?

21:21.540 --> 21:28.090
Tell them—the ones who 
looked after you—farewell.

21:33.730 --> 21:37.540
I'll be waiting for you here 
with the children.

21:43.270 --> 21:44.570
You're right.

21:45.620 --> 21:49.850
I need to thank Einar and the others.

21:56.410 --> 21:58.680
S-Stop! Stop the cart!

22:00.370 --> 22:02.620
It's me. Do you recognize me?

22:02.620 --> 22:03.920
How are you feeling?

22:07.440 --> 22:09.670
Einar...

22:19.350 --> 22:21.300
Advance 50 paces!

22:21.300 --> 22:25.570
Be thorough. Show them your superiority.

22:37.680 --> 22:40.680
The Jomsvikings certainly are impressive.

22:40.680 --> 22:45.030
Not even a single 
thin line of 70 men crumbles.

22:46.130 --> 22:48.280
We won't need the rearguard.

22:48.680 --> 22:52.090
Use the second line of thegns to capture Ketil.

22:52.090 --> 22:53.100
Yes, Your Majesty.

22:53.100 --> 22:56.460
Don't retreat! Charge in there!

22:56.460 --> 22:59.220
Show some backbone!

23:00.810 --> 23:05.180
Damn it. Where are my sons?

23:21.010 --> 23:26.360
I c-can't swim with a sword on my back.

23:31.970 --> 23:34.870
I can't do it, Brother.

23:37.010 --> 23:42.020
I can't be like you.
