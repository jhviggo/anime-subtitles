WEBVTT

00:20.140 --> 00:22.120
There were two of them.

00:22.120 --> 00:24.990
It must be them again.

00:25.170 --> 00:32.090
<b>Iron Fist Ketil</b>

00:25.170 --> 00:32.090
<b>Iron Fist Ketil</b>

00:26.010 --> 00:28.250
Their footprints do look similar.

00:28.250 --> 00:31.710
Why'd this have to happen 
while the master's gone?

00:32.950 --> 00:34.050
What's the damage?

00:35.250 --> 00:38.610
One bag of flour and some dried meat.

00:40.570 --> 00:42.720
It's no use, boss.

00:42.720 --> 00:46.580
They're all mixed up with
 other footprints. I can't track them.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.270
No matter.

00:48.640 --> 00:53.060
They don't steal much, 
but they've developed a taste for it.

00:53.060 --> 00:56.030
Do they think we don't know, Snake?

00:58.770 --> 01:02.830
Fine, then. 
Sounds like they need to be punished.

02:42.170 --> 02:44.940
What? That's incredible.

02:44.940 --> 02:48.020
That means the old master likes you.

02:50.020 --> 02:51.680
Does he?

02:51.680 --> 02:53.240
Yes, he does.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.380
Not only does he 
lend you his tools and horse,

02:55.380 --> 02:57.740
but he invited you to eat 
at the same table with him.

02:57.740 --> 03:01.610
He's just paying us back 
for doing his chores.

03:03.390 --> 03:05.560
We're slaves.

03:05.560 --> 03:08.170
Normally, people <i>don't</i> pay us back.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.240
Oh, right.

03:15.250 --> 03:18.010
Now that you mention it, 
I guess you're right.

03:18.010 --> 03:20.010
That's right.

03:20.010 --> 03:24.270
But why does he like us, then?

03:26.870 --> 03:29.020
Huh? U-Uh...

03:29.020 --> 03:30.630
I'm sorry.

03:31.340 --> 03:33.780
Einar, you're a good person.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.450
You just don't realize it yourself.

03:41.800 --> 03:45.440
What? No, wait, but...

03:45.440 --> 03:48.170
Einar, I'm heading out.

03:46.060 --> 03:49.160
I'm not that special.

03:50.290 --> 03:52.540
Huh? Oh, sure.

03:54.230 --> 03:56.910
Is he trying to be considerate?

03:59.920 --> 04:03.880
He's a good guy, too. 
Doesn't talk much, though.

04:03.880 --> 04:04.990
I know.

04:04.990 --> 04:06.680
Arnheid!

04:06.680 --> 04:09.300
Oh, no. It's the mistress.

04:09.300 --> 04:11.480
Sorry for keeping you tied up.

04:11.480 --> 04:12.890
Not at all.

04:12.890 --> 04:17.650
I look forward to every morning 
now that I have someone to talk to.

04:19.530 --> 04:20.870
See you later.

04:22.420 --> 04:24.690
See you tomorrow morning.

04:28.830 --> 04:30.910
Yahoo!

04:32.410 --> 04:34.330
She called me a good person.

04:35.790 --> 04:37.630
I'm a good person!

04:41.960 --> 04:47.430
How dare you stay out there chatting 
when breakfast isn't even ready yet.

04:47.430 --> 04:49.700
I'm sorry, mistress.

04:49.700 --> 04:52.600
We don't keep you around for fun, you know.

04:52.600 --> 04:55.090
You have to earn your keep.

04:55.090 --> 04:56.940
Yes, mistress.

04:56.940 --> 05:00.820
The master will be returning 
from the thing today.

05:00.820 --> 05:05.820
He might be bringing guests back with him, 
so prepare accordingly.

05:07.820 --> 05:13.210
I suppose an enslaved man <i>would</i> be 
a good match for an enslaved woman.

05:16.090 --> 05:18.400
Hey, they're sprouting.

05:18.400 --> 05:20.460
These are wheat seedlings, Thorfinn.

05:22.350 --> 05:26.090
They look so... feeble.

05:26.870 --> 05:28.450
Do they always look like this?

05:29.160 --> 05:30.890
Yup, they sure do.

05:33.260 --> 05:37.850
How strange. So these become bread?

05:37.850 --> 05:39.800
Surprised?

05:39.800 --> 05:40.560
Yeah.

05:41.220 --> 05:42.980
Impressive, isn't it?

05:44.090 --> 05:46.290
Yeah, it's amazing.

05:46.860 --> 05:50.700
We'll grow and sell, grow and sell,

05:50.700 --> 05:53.370
and eventually buy ourselves back.

05:54.030 --> 05:56.170
It might takes years, but someday...

05:59.790 --> 06:02.800
All right. I'm feeling motivated.

06:02.800 --> 06:05.600
This is our first step toward freedom.

06:05.600 --> 06:10.170
Let's clear these woods,
 so we can plant double next year.

06:12.670 --> 06:13.480
Oh...

06:15.180 --> 06:21.440
We can eventually buy our freedom by farming,

06:21.960 --> 06:25.080
but I wonder if Arnheid has a similar deal.

06:28.190 --> 06:31.430
I don't know. Why don't you ask her?

06:34.270 --> 06:36.930
You think it'd be okay to ask that?

06:37.960 --> 06:41.020
More importantly, what are we 
doing with these today?

06:41.020 --> 06:45.340
Oh, the wheat? 
We won't have anything to do for a while.

06:45.960 --> 06:48.880
I see. So we should keep clearing the woods.

06:48.880 --> 06:50.720
So we'll pray.

06:50.720 --> 06:52.470
What? Pray?

06:58.680 --> 07:00.190
Almighty God!

07:00.190 --> 07:02.020
Make our crops grow!

07:02.020 --> 07:04.060
Make them ripen and grow!

07:04.060 --> 07:05.650
Keep insects and mold away!

07:05.650 --> 07:09.400
Send the rain our way!

07:11.430 --> 07:13.520
Join me.

07:13.520 --> 07:14.620
What?

07:15.530 --> 07:19.370
Who am I supposed to p-pray to?

07:19.370 --> 07:21.280
Anyone.

07:21.280 --> 07:26.210
Yahweh, Freya...
 Pray to everyone and everything.

07:28.050 --> 07:29.730
Get down here.

07:33.370 --> 07:37.620
If we want a successful harvest, 
all we can do is pray to God.

07:37.620 --> 07:39.160
We have nothing to offer.

07:39.160 --> 07:41.980
But we'll pray extra hard to make up for it.

07:42.640 --> 07:45.320
Make our crops grow!

07:45.320 --> 07:47.460
Come on. Put your hands 
together and pray with me.

07:47.460 --> 07:48.890
What? O-Okay...

07:50.440 --> 07:53.740
M-Make our crops grow...

07:53.740 --> 07:55.240
I can't hear you!

07:55.240 --> 07:56.370
Okay!

07:56.370 --> 07:58.160
Make our crops grow!

07:58.160 --> 07:59.440
Don't be so embarrassed.

07:59.440 --> 08:02.120
Nothing's more embarrassing 
than doing it half-assed.

08:02.120 --> 08:03.700
O-Okay!

08:03.700 --> 08:04.980
Ready, and...

08:04.980 --> 08:06.880
Keep insects and mold away!

08:06.880 --> 08:10.630
Send the rain our way!

08:22.360 --> 08:27.030
Wow, the farm hasn't changed at all.

08:27.770 --> 08:31.540
Are Mom and Olmar doing well, Dad?

08:31.540 --> 08:35.900
Yeah. Olmar is so full of energy, 
he's a pain in my ass.

08:35.900 --> 08:39.030
He's anxious to head off to battle like you.

08:41.590 --> 08:44.600
He hasn't changed since he was little either,

08:44.600 --> 08:46.580
even though he's a coward.

08:46.580 --> 08:50.210
Everyone has their strengths 
and weaknesses, Thorgil.

08:50.210 --> 08:52.440
He's not fit for battle.

08:52.440 --> 08:56.050
People should stay where they belong.

08:57.050 --> 08:59.680
I wouldn't be so sure.

08:59.680 --> 09:03.730
Sometimes the battlefield changes a man, 
like King Canute.

09:03.730 --> 09:05.180
"King"?

09:05.180 --> 09:08.280
Nobody calls him a prince anymore.

09:08.280 --> 09:11.720
He changed quite a lot in this war.

09:11.720 --> 09:14.470
He's a proper general now.

09:16.250 --> 09:19.580
Why not send Olmar to the battlefield 
and see how he fares?

09:20.160 --> 09:22.000
You can't be serious.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.050
He'd never survive with his skills.

09:29.170 --> 09:31.580
Isn't that the master?

09:31.580 --> 09:33.850
Perfect timing.

09:35.550 --> 09:37.300
Isn't that...

09:37.760 --> 09:41.180
It really is you, Thorgil.

09:42.110 --> 09:43.640
When did you get back?

09:43.640 --> 09:45.310
Five or six days ago.

09:45.800 --> 09:50.230
I ran into Dad at the thing, 
so I thought I'd stop by.

09:50.740 --> 09:53.730
You're a tough one. You haven't died yet?

09:53.730 --> 09:57.990
Thanks to the training 
you put me through, Snake.

09:58.460 --> 10:01.370
Snake, what have you got trailing behind you?

10:01.860 --> 10:03.120
Oh, right.

10:03.120 --> 10:04.530
Hey.

10:06.080 --> 10:08.540
Come on, hurry up.

10:10.580 --> 10:12.100
They're thieves.

10:12.100 --> 10:14.600
I was going to hand them over to you.

10:14.600 --> 10:15.840
Thieves?

10:15.840 --> 10:20.020
We'd been experiencing a rash 
of similar burglaries recently.

10:20.020 --> 10:24.150
I've got a hunch they're behind all of them.

10:27.810 --> 10:30.730
They may be kids, but theft is theft.

10:31.120 --> 10:34.950
They need to be punished, master.

10:56.850 --> 10:59.430
Sture, my hands hurt.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.970
What's going to happen to us?

11:07.910 --> 11:09.450
Are we going to die?

11:11.030 --> 11:14.610
It's okay. It's all right.

11:15.750 --> 11:17.370
I'm right here with you.

11:20.130 --> 11:22.110
In other words...

11:22.110 --> 11:24.660
people talk about military units,

11:24.660 --> 11:27.740
but nobody really cares who their 
allies or enemies are supposed to be.

11:28.360 --> 11:33.380
Once the fighting starts, you and your 
clansmen pick your targets and attack.

11:33.990 --> 11:37.310
Everyone's desperate to prove they're 
the greatest daredevil on the North Sea.

11:39.510 --> 11:42.760
After the battle, 
you enjoy plundering the spoils.

11:42.760 --> 11:46.600
Guys kill each other all the time 
over women they can sell.

11:48.210 --> 11:49.030
Olmar.

11:49.030 --> 11:49.980
Huh?

11:49.980 --> 11:53.500
What do you say? 
Do you want to go to England?

11:53.500 --> 11:55.160
Uh, I...

11:55.730 --> 11:57.980
What? You don't want to?

11:57.980 --> 12:01.280
Oh, o-o-of course I'll go to war!

12:01.280 --> 12:03.350
I'd love a chance to prove myself!

12:03.770 --> 12:06.490
That's my little brother!

12:03.850 --> 12:04.790
Ow...

12:06.490 --> 12:09.920
Maybe I'll give you a souvenir.

12:09.920 --> 12:11.980
Bring me my necklace.

12:11.980 --> 12:12.730
Yes, sir.

12:21.230 --> 12:24.310
What is this, jerky? Can I eat it?

12:25.410 --> 12:28.560
Sure, but ears don't taste very good.

12:28.560 --> 12:29.640
Huh?

12:30.390 --> 12:32.890
They're the ears of Englishmen.

12:33.300 --> 12:35.810
Ears?

12:46.740 --> 12:48.180
Oh, uh...

12:48.180 --> 12:50.420
You really are a scaredy-cat.

12:50.420 --> 12:52.470
How are you going to fight like that?

12:54.000 --> 12:57.430
We're sons of Iron Fist Ketil.

12:58.750 --> 12:59.290
Iron...

12:59.850 --> 13:01.130
Iron Fist?

13:01.130 --> 13:03.060
You don't know?

13:03.060 --> 13:05.630
Our dad was a legend when he was young.

13:06.870 --> 13:13.390
As soon as the fighting started, his weapon 
would shatter under his own strength,

13:14.490 --> 13:17.520
so he'd fight the rest 
of the battle bare-handed.

13:17.520 --> 13:21.050
He accomplished more than 
anyone fighting like that.

13:23.940 --> 13:27.570
What? Our dad?

13:27.570 --> 13:32.220
When I talk to the veterans, 
the name Iron Fist comes up a lot.

13:32.220 --> 13:34.810
You should show more respect to Dad.

13:36.960 --> 13:40.140
Thorgil, you must be tired from your journey.

13:40.140 --> 13:42.550
Why don't you rest inside?

13:42.550 --> 13:45.300
I'm not that weak.

13:45.300 --> 13:46.650
Thorgil.

13:52.090 --> 13:55.560
If the great Iron Fist Ketil commands it.

13:56.650 --> 13:57.690
Master.

13:59.440 --> 14:04.770
I'm sorry, but could you take care of
 those two before you go off to rest?

14:14.090 --> 14:17.270
First, why don't you tell me your names?

14:19.490 --> 14:21.390
Come on, tell him your names.

14:21.960 --> 14:23.620
Don't do that.

14:23.620 --> 14:26.120
They can't speak because they're frightened.

14:26.120 --> 14:27.170
Sorry.

14:29.570 --> 14:32.100
Tell me your names.

14:34.010 --> 14:39.230
I-I'm Sture. My younger sister's name is Thora.

14:39.230 --> 14:43.620
I see, I see. Sture and Thora.

14:43.620 --> 14:46.480
Do you have anyone who could 
speak in your defense?

14:47.020 --> 14:50.360
Besides them, their family consists of 
their mother and a baby.

14:50.860 --> 14:54.900
Their mother was sick in bed, 
so I didn't bring her here.

14:54.900 --> 14:57.030
Their father is missing.

14:57.820 --> 15:01.000
What's your father's name? Is he well?

15:03.110 --> 15:04.500
Answer him.

15:06.570 --> 15:08.810
My d-dad is Snorri.

15:09.520 --> 15:17.320
Last fall, he went out to sell vegetables 
and never came back.

15:18.320 --> 15:23.230
Is your grandfather's name by any chance Bo?

15:25.150 --> 15:26.110
Yes.

15:28.190 --> 15:30.360
Their father is Snorri, son of Bo.

15:30.360 --> 15:33.680
He owes money on the land 
he rents from you.

15:33.680 --> 15:36.480
Ah, that Snorri.

15:36.480 --> 15:38.970
I knew I hadn't seen him recently.

15:39.620 --> 15:41.820
He must be dead.

15:41.820 --> 15:43.780
He hasn't come back in a year.

15:43.780 --> 15:45.250
He's not coming back.

15:45.740 --> 15:47.920
A thief probably killed—

15:47.920 --> 15:50.720
You're wrong! Dad's just out on an errand!

15:59.160 --> 16:01.900
<i>Traditionally, families that have 
lost their breadwinner</i>

16:01.900 --> 16:06.110
<i>are hired by other families to do work.</i>

16:06.580 --> 16:11.940
<i>These children may be healthy, 
but they have a sick mother and a baby.</i>

16:11.940 --> 16:13.900
<i>Nobody would take them in.</i>

16:15.120 --> 16:17.410
What's the matter, honey?

16:19.490 --> 16:22.270
J-Just got a bit of dust in my eye.

16:26.630 --> 16:30.260
So, what did these two steal?

16:30.260 --> 16:36.820
Their crimes are numerous, but they 
confessed to stealing one bag of flour.

16:36.820 --> 16:39.310
My men and I can attest to that.

16:39.720 --> 16:42.430
You didn't threaten them 
into saying that, did you?

16:42.430 --> 16:47.690
No, of course not. 
Though I did convince them to talk.

16:50.810 --> 16:55.570
I'll wait until this bag is empty.

16:56.040 --> 16:59.510
You'll get off easy as long as you're honest.

17:01.760 --> 17:07.230
I told them your name's written 
on the bottom of our bags.

17:09.400 --> 17:11.500
That's practically threatening them!

17:11.500 --> 17:17.220
What? That wouldn't have been enough to 
make them confess if they weren't guilty.

17:17.850 --> 17:21.470
Then it's simple. One arm.

17:24.640 --> 17:29.230
M-My sister's still little! 
Please go easy on her!

17:29.700 --> 17:34.940
Oh? Then you'll accept 
your sister's punishment, too.

17:34.940 --> 17:36.990
We'll cut off both your arms.

17:39.070 --> 17:41.050
No... Sture...

17:42.910 --> 17:49.960
Well... I know what I said, but I'd like 
to ask you to go easy on them, too.

17:52.710 --> 17:55.590
Then it's decided. Right, Dad?

17:59.110 --> 18:00.570
<i>He's horrifying.</i>

18:01.100 --> 18:03.570
<i>I can hardly believe he's my son.</i>

18:05.330 --> 18:09.100
<i>Why did you have to steal from me?</i>

18:09.780 --> 18:14.580
<i>I have no choice but to punish you.</i>

18:17.480 --> 18:19.200
I'm against it.

18:19.200 --> 18:21.800
You'd be practically executing him.

18:21.800 --> 18:24.540
It's too great a punishment for theft.

18:24.540 --> 18:25.690
Pater...

18:26.300 --> 18:30.380
May I offer my opinion, master?

18:31.890 --> 18:36.380
Yes. Yes, speak, Pater.

18:37.670 --> 18:41.400
As one who helps run this farm,

18:41.400 --> 18:45.600
I don't think it's right to harshly 
punish such a young boy.

18:45.600 --> 18:49.020
Cutting off both his arms 
would make him useless.

18:49.990 --> 18:52.520
Sture, how old are you?

18:53.710 --> 18:55.020
Twelve.

18:55.020 --> 18:59.510
Good. That's old enough 
to start working with the adults.

19:01.390 --> 19:05.920
You must be compensated for their theft, 
and their father's debt must be repaid.

19:05.920 --> 19:09.400
They can pay you back by working.

19:09.400 --> 19:16.050
I recommend that you hire these children 
and their mother to work on your farm.

19:16.560 --> 19:23.300
They can grow crops on the
 land you lent to their father.

19:23.300 --> 19:26.520
I'll teach Sture what to do.

19:26.520 --> 19:31.940
If he grows into a good worker, 
you'll be fully compensated for this matter.

19:32.710 --> 19:35.700
They won't need to steal anymore, either.

19:35.700 --> 19:37.680
It solves the problem.

19:38.580 --> 19:41.060
Yes, yes. I couldn't agree more.

19:41.060 --> 19:44.070
I must be compensated 
for the loss, yes. In that case—

19:44.070 --> 19:50.080
For the aforementioned reasons, I believe a 
beating would be an appropriate punishment.

19:54.370 --> 19:55.470
What?

19:57.010 --> 19:59.230
Well, I understand your argument.

20:00.970 --> 20:06.820
No. No, wait. They can pay back 
what they stole by working for me.

20:06.820 --> 20:09.930
Paying off their debt 
can be their punishment.

20:11.310 --> 20:16.290
They can't get off with 
no punishment at all, master.

20:16.840 --> 20:20.610
If you don't, people won't take us seriously.

20:26.250 --> 20:29.890
And nobody likes a kid with sticky fingers.

20:30.740 --> 20:33.540
Punishing them is for their own good.

20:39.950 --> 20:42.310
How many strokes will it be?

20:50.090 --> 20:55.050
Five... Ten. Ten strokes.

20:55.940 --> 20:58.010
That's ten strokes each.

20:59.330 --> 21:02.550
You're first, boy. Bite down hard.

21:04.270 --> 21:05.840
Sture...

21:05.840 --> 21:07.240
Stay back!

21:07.240 --> 21:08.280
Sture!

21:08.280 --> 21:12.140
Twenty! Hit me 20 times!

21:12.140 --> 21:15.370
Just please, please don't hit my sister!

21:17.880 --> 21:21.500
Oh? Now this is interesting. 
You've got some guts.

21:21.940 --> 21:24.380
Dad, let me do it.

21:24.780 --> 21:28.360
What? But you don't know how to hold back.

21:27.270 --> 21:29.530
N-No...

21:28.360 --> 21:29.660
Don't kill him.

21:29.660 --> 21:30.510
Yeah, yeah.

21:30.510 --> 21:31.980
Be gentle.

21:31.980 --> 21:33.040
Yeah, yeah.

21:33.040 --> 21:35.060
Don't hit his head or anything.

21:35.060 --> 21:36.520
Okay, okay.

21:36.520 --> 21:40.730
Gentle, right? Here we go, kid.

21:46.560 --> 21:47.570
Sture!

21:51.140 --> 21:52.800
One.

21:52.130 --> 21:54.160
Sture!

21:52.800 --> 21:55.200
W-Wait. Stop, Thorgil.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.070
I'll do it. I'll do it myself.

22:25.610 --> 22:26.970
Where's Dad?

22:27.650 --> 22:29.500
He went to bed.

22:29.500 --> 22:33.870
Good grief. Iron Fist Ketil 
must be getting old.

22:37.850 --> 22:41.310
All that Iron Fist stuff is a lie.

22:43.550 --> 22:48.090
A Norse man can't be a coward
 and make it in this world.

22:50.650 --> 22:55.570
Everyone expects me to be brave.

23:00.350 --> 23:08.850
Nobody suspects a "great man" 
like me would lie about that.

23:15.540 --> 23:20.450
I'm afraid of Thorgil, my own son.

23:22.070 --> 23:26.010
I'm afraid of war. I'm afraid of violence.

23:29.990 --> 23:34.700
Being kind can't possibly be a bad thing.

23:35.790 --> 23:39.680
I know your pain.

23:41.250 --> 23:45.450
You're the only one who'd say that to me.

23:46.200 --> 23:51.690
You're the only one I can tell everything.

23:54.990 --> 23:56.490
Stay with me.

23:58.240 --> 24:05.370
Without you, my world is full of darkness.

25:51.520 --> 25:55.030
<b>An Empty Man</b>

25:51.520 --> 25:55.030
<b>An Empty Man</b>

25:52.480 --> 25:54.190
"An Empty Man."
