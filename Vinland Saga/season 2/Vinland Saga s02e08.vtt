00:41.490 --> 00:43.430
Einar...

01:03.630 --> 01:07.380
No, wait. Wait!

01:07.380 --> 01:08.630
Wait!

01:32.390 --> 01:33.470
<i>Damn it...</i>

01:35.150 --> 01:38.070
<i>Why am I here?</i>

01:43.190 --> 01:44.710
<i>I mustn't fall.</i>

01:46.110 --> 01:48.040
<i>If I fall down there...</i>

01:58.130 --> 02:00.470
No! Please, don't!

02:02.010 --> 02:03.830
I'm begging you!

02:21.350 --> 02:23.910
Good morning, Thorfinn.

02:24.300 --> 02:27.620
You were screaming even more 
than usual this morning.

02:32.870 --> 02:36.630
I dreamed about falling down a cliff.

02:37.670 --> 02:40.750
You remember your dream this morning?

02:41.320 --> 02:42.880
A little.

02:42.880 --> 02:46.300
You were saying all kinds 
of things in your sleep,

02:46.300 --> 02:50.520
like "Father" and "Askeladd."

02:51.100 --> 02:54.150
Is "Askeladd" someone's name?

04:37.230 --> 04:38.350
<i>No matter what...</i>

04:40.050 --> 04:46.840
<b>An Empty Man</b>

04:40.050 --> 04:46.840
<b>An Empty Man</b>

04:40.250 --> 04:44.380
<i>No matter what I do, 
I can't fully remember my dreams.</i>

04:48.520 --> 04:53.500
I followed her wondering what she wanted 
to show me, and it was a moth this big!

04:49.410 --> 04:52.090
<i>I know only that they're horrifying.</i>

04:53.500 --> 04:58.540
I spent a half-hour explaining to 
Lotta that it was a moth, not a butterfly

04:53.910 --> 04:57.050
<i>And I feel like...</i>

04:58.530 --> 05:02.940
<i>I feel like I've forgotten 
something really important.</i>

04:58.540 --> 05:01.180
but she insisted on keeping it.

05:01.180 --> 05:04.580
Then Mom suddenly showed up, and...

05:07.090 --> 05:10.990
<i>It's like a fish bone stuck in my throat.</i>

05:12.790 --> 05:15.830
<i>It scares me. I wish I could truly forget.</i>

05:17.250 --> 05:19.950
<i>But I get the sense it's something 
I mustn't forget.</i>

05:25.490 --> 05:26.710
<i>I wonder what it is...</i>

05:41.770 --> 05:43.210
Pull!

05:45.190 --> 05:49.110
Hey, look at how much 
their wheat has grown already.

05:49.840 --> 05:52.850
Maybe the land's fertile 
because they just cleared it.

05:53.250 --> 05:55.800
No, it's Einar.

05:56.330 --> 05:59.750
They suddenly made a bunch of progress 
clearing the land since he showed up.

06:00.580 --> 06:02.880
Push!

06:10.410 --> 06:13.010
The master's out of his mind.

06:13.010 --> 06:19.680
Farm work is for free men, 
and he's allowing slaves to do it.

06:20.640 --> 06:25.900
This isn't right, even if it's on his orders.

06:25.900 --> 06:32.300
The world will fall into chaos if slaves 
are treated the same as retainers.

06:32.300 --> 06:33.910
Right, guys?

06:42.590 --> 06:47.570
Askeladd is the man who killed my father.

06:50.340 --> 06:52.830
He was a Danish warmonger.

06:54.510 --> 06:58.080
He was a strong and cruel man.

07:00.330 --> 07:01.260
Catch.

07:01.260 --> 07:02.690
Oh, right.

07:04.350 --> 07:07.820
So, he showed up in your dream?

07:08.180 --> 07:10.190
I'm not sure.

07:13.930 --> 07:18.130
I followed Askeladd onto the battlefield,

07:19.660 --> 07:22.110
so I could avenge my father.

07:22.960 --> 07:28.010
I fought for ten—no, 11 years.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.650
I hated him so much.

07:34.150 --> 07:35.560
I wanted to kill him.

07:39.700 --> 07:42.600
So, did you get revenge?

07:45.040 --> 07:46.360
No.

07:47.410 --> 07:54.690
Askeladd was killed by another man 
right before my eyes.

07:59.420 --> 08:01.730
Thorfinn, throw me the next one.

08:02.210 --> 08:03.680
Oh, right.

08:06.670 --> 08:08.130
Hup.

08:10.320 --> 08:14.620
Well, I don't know the details,

08:14.620 --> 08:19.090
but I'm starting to understand 
why you're always so listless.

08:22.120 --> 08:27.570
If you're dreaming about him, 
then you must not be over it yet.

08:28.570 --> 08:35.210
You're right. Maybe you're right, but...

08:37.590 --> 08:41.370
<i>That's not all. There's something else.</i>

08:42.590 --> 08:46.170
<i>I feel like I've forgotten 
something more important.</i>

08:47.510 --> 08:50.370
<i>Something very important.</i>

08:59.510 --> 09:05.510
Well, it's not the kind of thing you can 
get over just because someone tells you to.

09:07.930 --> 09:14.010
But your quest for revenge is over now.

09:15.620 --> 09:20.660
And besides, hating a dead man 
won't get you anywhere.

09:21.160 --> 09:22.030
Isn't that right?

09:25.880 --> 09:27.580
Stay back, Thorfinn!

09:27.580 --> 09:34.290
Become a true warrior, son of Thors...

09:37.430 --> 09:40.570
I don't hate him anymore,

09:42.990 --> 09:45.670
which is exactly my problem.

09:49.530 --> 09:52.770
Without my hate,

09:55.870 --> 09:57.230
I'm empty.

10:01.910 --> 10:05.210
I survived on my hatred alone.

10:08.790 --> 10:12.530
I don't know anything 
besides the battlefield.

10:14.380 --> 10:16.890
I don't know the first thing 
about fixing a roof.

10:17.650 --> 10:19.010
I can't do anything.

10:19.730 --> 10:22.170
I don't even know what I <i>should</i> be doing.

10:25.510 --> 10:26.850
I'm empty.

10:31.560 --> 10:33.320
Work.

10:33.830 --> 10:35.140
Sir!

10:35.140 --> 10:38.570
If you've got time to flap 
your gums, then work.

10:38.570 --> 10:42.010
That's not the only job 
I've got for you today.

10:53.020 --> 10:55.830
You ready? Watch this.

11:11.950 --> 11:13.290
Give it a try.

11:13.850 --> 11:15.990
Catch some big, fleshy ones.

11:20.400 --> 11:23.620
Huh? It's not spreading.

11:23.620 --> 11:25.160
Pull yourself together.

11:25.160 --> 11:29.520
We can't eat meat right now 
because it's Lent.

11:29.520 --> 11:32.670
Are you trying to force this old man
 to eat nothing but wheat?

11:36.630 --> 11:38.760
Hey, looking good.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.080
It's no use. I didn't catch a single one.

11:42.080 --> 11:46.890
Put more spin on it, like this.

11:46.890 --> 11:50.200
Don't keep throwing in the same area.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.210
Okay.

11:57.770 --> 12:02.590
You can start learning things one at a time.

12:06.160 --> 12:09.680
If you're empty, then you can 
fit anything inside you.

12:09.680 --> 12:15.050
In fact, it's better to be empty 
if you want to be reborn.

12:16.080 --> 12:18.220
What? Were you eavesdropping?

12:18.220 --> 12:19.460
I just happened to overhear.

12:25.290 --> 12:28.530
<i>Can</i> I be reborn?

12:29.720 --> 12:33.230
Work. Your hands aren't moving.

12:40.910 --> 12:42.400
It's so cold.

12:42.400 --> 12:44.450
It's definitely gonna snow.

12:44.450 --> 12:47.870
Catching fish will be rough in this cold.

12:48.290 --> 12:51.530
I'd like to redeem myself, though.

12:52.110 --> 12:54.790
Yesterday, between the two of us,

12:54.790 --> 12:57.960
all we caught were three little fish 
and a bunch of clams.

12:58.460 --> 13:00.210
Right, Thorfinn?

13:00.640 --> 13:05.210
Huh? Oh, sorry. I wasn't listening.

13:05.720 --> 13:08.850
Were you lost in thought again?

13:11.990 --> 13:15.120
Do you think people can change?

13:16.590 --> 13:18.390
What does it take for someone to change?

13:21.310 --> 13:26.560
Thorfinn, you used to be a warrior, right?

13:26.560 --> 13:28.760
Huh? Yeah.

13:28.760 --> 13:31.370
Warriors are, you know...

13:31.370 --> 13:36.370
"Life's all about carrying axes into battle, 
plundering the spoils, and drinking beer!"

13:36.370 --> 13:38.380
"Hardy har har!"

13:38.380 --> 13:39.610
Those guys, right?

13:41.000 --> 13:47.130
M-More or less. I didn't carry an axe, though.

13:49.390 --> 13:55.410
Looking at you now, there isn't anyone 
who'd think you're a former warrior.

13:58.220 --> 13:59.660
You think so?

13:59.660 --> 14:02.270
"You think so?"

14:02.640 --> 14:06.930
Take a look at your own face in the water.

14:11.810 --> 14:17.660
I'm really glad I didn't meet you 
back when you were still a warrior.

14:18.570 --> 14:22.450
Worst case, you might've killed me.

14:25.350 --> 14:27.970
People can change, Thorfinn.

14:28.830 --> 14:33.690
You're probably on your way to
 becoming a better person right now.

14:45.750 --> 14:48.110
You think so?

14:49.490 --> 14:50.610
I do.

14:54.580 --> 14:56.990
Thank you, Einar.

15:02.170 --> 15:04.710
What's wrong? Einar—

15:17.980 --> 15:19.030
The wheat...

15:46.450 --> 15:47.570
It's all...

15:49.380 --> 15:53.810
Did people do this? Why?

15:56.690 --> 15:59.350
Wheat is a hardy crop.

16:00.530 --> 16:06.470
It gets back up on its own 
even if the wind blows it down.

16:07.880 --> 16:10.490
They knew exactly what they were doing.

16:11.360 --> 16:13.670
They dug up the roots.

16:19.970 --> 16:21.540
Hey, where are you going?

16:21.540 --> 16:23.030
It was the retainers.

16:23.580 --> 16:26.540
They're the only ones who would've done this.

16:26.540 --> 16:29.080
Wait. What are you planning to do?

16:29.080 --> 16:30.030
Einar...

16:30.550 --> 16:32.240
Don't you get it?

16:32.240 --> 16:34.550
If slaves attack free men...

16:35.060 --> 16:38.210
I don't care. I'll kill them.

16:38.930 --> 16:40.340
Calm down.

16:40.340 --> 16:42.960
We don't have proof they did it.

16:42.960 --> 16:45.560
Even if we question them, 
they're bound to deny it.

16:45.560 --> 16:47.180
Stop, Einar.

16:47.180 --> 16:50.070
Let's talk to Pater first.

16:52.020 --> 16:53.770
You're awfully calm, Thorfinn.

16:54.450 --> 16:57.450
Do you not understand this situation?

16:59.130 --> 17:02.990
We used up the soil's fertility, 
but we'll have no harvest.

17:03.920 --> 17:06.950
We'll have to borrow seeds 
for the next planting, too.

17:07.580 --> 17:12.590
But more than that, they... they...

17:13.280 --> 17:17.840
They should know the difficulty 
and joy of growing wheat.

17:19.010 --> 17:21.310
They're farmers, too!

17:23.850 --> 17:26.640
How could they do this?

17:27.100 --> 17:29.060
You should be angry, Thorfinn.

17:29.060 --> 17:32.610
Our wheat has been ruined!

17:38.470 --> 17:39.590
I...

17:40.830 --> 17:48.490
Until now, I've been someone 
who took and destroyed.

17:49.980 --> 17:57.010
Unlike you, I have no right 
to be angry at the retainers.

17:58.420 --> 18:02.810
If you want to kill the retainers,

18:03.710 --> 18:08.650
then I deserve to die by your hand 
a hundred times over, too.

18:19.400 --> 18:26.010
First, let's calm down. Please, Einar.

18:33.370 --> 18:35.050
I see...

18:35.050 --> 18:38.560
This certainly is awful.

18:39.050 --> 18:43.150
Neither of you saw it happen?

18:43.700 --> 18:44.510
No.

18:45.060 --> 18:49.360
Leave this field the way it is until 
I'm finished with my investigation.

18:49.360 --> 18:54.070
They may have left some clues behind.

18:54.660 --> 18:57.940
So, do you have any idea 
who might have done it?

18:59.710 --> 19:02.350
The retainers.

19:03.240 --> 19:05.080
I see...

19:05.080 --> 19:09.140
All right. I'll report 
all of this to the master.

19:09.140 --> 19:10.940
Leave the rest to me.

19:14.210 --> 19:19.220
I suffered a lot as a slave, too.

19:19.760 --> 19:27.110
I wondered why my bullies would do something 
that didn't benefit them in any way.

19:28.440 --> 19:31.920
People who love to discriminate 
can be found everywhere,

19:31.920 --> 19:34.360
but not everyone is like that.

19:35.020 --> 19:37.730
Don't lose hope, you two.

19:56.350 --> 19:57.780
Apparently...

20:00.330 --> 20:03.910
the master has really 
taken a liking to Arnheid.

20:07.590 --> 20:13.150
She doesn't have a deal like ours that 
allows her to earn her freedom by working.

20:15.750 --> 20:20.230
It seems like she's given up
 on ever being free again.

20:22.030 --> 20:25.540
Even if they like you, 
you become bound to them.

20:25.540 --> 20:28.490
If they hate you, this is how they treat you.

20:30.650 --> 20:35.910
What kind of lives are we living?

20:46.100 --> 20:49.580
That was more work than
 I expected. I'm exhausted.

20:49.580 --> 20:52.160
What are you talking about? 
You were just watching.

20:52.160 --> 20:52.720
Yeah.

20:52.720 --> 20:54.990
Let's go another way, Einar.

20:56.850 --> 20:59.280
Don't, Einar.

20:59.280 --> 21:02.030
There's no reason for us to sneak around.

21:04.890 --> 21:07.870
Well, speak of the devil.

21:12.460 --> 21:16.040
What's wrong? Why the long faces?

21:16.930 --> 21:20.670
Restrain yourself, Einar. 
Don't listen to them.

21:28.080 --> 21:31.430
What's your problem? Move.

21:32.170 --> 21:36.190
You're the one who ravaged 
our farm, aren't you?

21:36.190 --> 21:38.350
What? Farm?

21:39.050 --> 21:41.940
I have no idea what you're talking about.

21:44.820 --> 21:46.040
Einar!

21:46.040 --> 21:50.620
I see, I see. So your farm was ravaged.

21:50.620 --> 21:52.700
I'm sorry to hear that.

21:53.060 --> 21:55.910
But don't let it get you down.

21:59.070 --> 22:01.750
It was wheat grown by <i>slaves</i>.

22:02.830 --> 22:05.760
It would've been too putrid 
for anyone to eat.

22:35.440 --> 22:37.070
Crap...

22:41.270 --> 22:44.340
His jaw looks broken.

22:47.050 --> 22:49.090
What a punch!

22:49.090 --> 22:51.240
You brat!

22:51.240 --> 22:54.430
How dare you, slave! I'll kill you!

22:57.480 --> 23:00.460
Slave this, slave that... Shut up already!

23:00.460 --> 23:02.730
Quit crying and come at me.

23:02.730 --> 23:05.230
Y-You idiot, don't—

23:07.020 --> 23:07.740
Thorfinn.

23:07.740 --> 23:09.070
Are you okay?

23:10.750 --> 23:12.900
Let go, damn it.

23:18.580 --> 23:19.620
Damn you!

23:19.620 --> 23:21.580
D-Don't...

23:28.470 --> 23:30.470
<i>H-Huh?</i>

23:31.060 --> 23:33.610
<i>What are you...</i>

23:47.190 --> 23:50.450
<i>F-Father?</i>

23:52.570 --> 23:56.450
<i>He's telling me something...</i>

23:59.470 --> 24:00.380
<i>It's no use.</i>

24:01.970 --> 24:04.960
<i>I'm... falling...</i>

25:51.480 --> 25:55.030
<b>Oath</b>

25:51.480 --> 25:55.030
<b>Oath</b>

25:52.980 --> 25:54.090
"Oath."
