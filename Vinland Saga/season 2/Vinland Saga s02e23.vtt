01:47.120 --> 01:53.090
<b>Two Paths</b>

01:47.120 --> 01:53.090
<b>Two Paths</b>

01:48.920 --> 01:53.300
Can you stop me...

01:57.630 --> 02:01.720
as Askeladd did back then?

02:05.490 --> 02:07.340
Please leave, Thorfinn.

02:08.600 --> 02:12.440
You're a strange man, 
but it'd be a shame to kill you.

02:16.920 --> 02:19.990
This is how the world works.

02:20.410 --> 02:24.090
In the end, might makes right.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.180
Damn Vikings.

02:35.180 --> 02:39.340
My foolish son.

02:40.370 --> 02:43.640
You're still not yet a king.

02:44.830 --> 02:52.060
Why did you reveal your 
true feelings to such lowly men?

02:54.740 --> 03:00.230
Surely you don't expect that 
you will understand each other.

03:01.670 --> 03:05.340
They're a poor flock of sheep.

03:06.760 --> 03:10.490
You are an aloof shepherd.

03:11.290 --> 03:16.220
You raise them, cull them, and skin them.

03:16.750 --> 03:22.880
How could the sheep understand 
the work of a shepherd?

03:23.640 --> 03:26.250
There is only control.

03:27.100 --> 03:31.390
It is what's best for the sheep.

03:32.950 --> 03:34.250
Canute.

03:38.500 --> 03:43.320
If you intended to use your 
authority to force your way...

03:43.780 --> 03:45.160
Kill him.

03:45.680 --> 03:48.410
He's dangerous.

03:49.080 --> 03:56.200
A single sheep can lead the entire flock 
astray and towards a cliff.

03:57.750 --> 03:58.670
I will...

03:58.670 --> 04:00.250
Kill him.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.800
Do your job as king.

04:04.800 --> 04:05.880
I will...

04:11.810 --> 04:12.860
run.

04:32.160 --> 04:35.760
You'll simply... run?

04:40.960 --> 04:42.250
That's all?

04:45.360 --> 04:47.460
What else can I do?

04:48.470 --> 04:51.590
Do you want us to kill each other here?

04:56.240 --> 05:03.670
The paradise you describe helps 
many people while oppressing few.

05:04.280 --> 05:06.740
That's how it works, right?

05:08.390 --> 05:11.960
I don't know if that's a good or bad thing,

05:12.600 --> 05:15.500
and I don't have the right to 
criticize your crazy ideas.

05:17.380 --> 05:20.420
So the only option left is to run.

05:21.870 --> 05:23.600
Einar, let's go.

05:22.710 --> 05:25.880
You're an exceptional warrior.

05:23.600 --> 05:24.340
What?

05:25.880 --> 05:27.690
There are other ways.

05:28.370 --> 05:29.620
Did you...

05:32.070 --> 05:38.790
Did you let that happen to your face 
merely so you could admonish me?

05:40.610 --> 05:42.520
I wasted my time.

05:44.610 --> 05:47.640
Goodbye, Your Majesty.

06:29.160 --> 06:29.910
There are...

06:30.930 --> 06:33.620
There are many who wish to bargain with me.

06:34.420 --> 06:36.730
Some try to ensnare me, too.

06:37.990 --> 06:39.030
But...

06:41.080 --> 06:43.040
But you're unbelievable!

06:43.610 --> 06:45.240
You absolute fool!

06:47.010 --> 06:49.210
You don't have anything up your sleeve?

06:49.210 --> 06:52.900
Completely unarmed and thoroughly beaten,

06:52.900 --> 06:56.280
you simply came to tell me 
not to seize this farm?

07:00.210 --> 07:02.620
Is it really that funny?

07:03.200 --> 07:08.490
It is. I've never participated in such 
ridiculous peace talks before.

07:17.650 --> 07:19.450
You'll run, huh?

07:23.440 --> 07:24.410
Yeah.

07:29.360 --> 07:34.660
So the Vikings are capable of 
producing someone like you.

07:35.540 --> 07:37.370
You're a beautiful man.

07:44.640 --> 07:48.040
Where will you go to escape war?

07:49.030 --> 07:51.110
Somewhere other than here.

07:51.860 --> 07:54.260
I can't tell you where.

07:57.170 --> 07:59.900
My territory continues to grow.

08:00.530 --> 08:04.840
My power may eventually reach that place.

08:06.900 --> 08:09.300
I'll run as far as I can.

08:10.100 --> 08:14.020
As long as I've got 
someplace to run, I won't fight.

08:16.260 --> 08:23.740
I'll create a peaceful place beyond the king's 
reach using methods different from yours.

08:25.880 --> 08:30.630
For the people who can't live in 
the world you create.

08:31.810 --> 08:35.590
For you and for me.

08:38.900 --> 08:43.980
So you'll fill the hole my work cannot.

08:46.150 --> 08:48.540
Are you capable of that?

08:50.480 --> 08:55.020
My power is so much smaller than yours.

08:55.480 --> 08:57.990
I can't fill a very large hole.

08:59.160 --> 09:06.950
If you keep oppressing people, 
eventually no one will be able to save you.

09:10.070 --> 09:14.660
You need to try harder. 
Don't make more work for me.

09:20.210 --> 09:24.730
You've become rather eloquent.

09:26.560 --> 09:29.820
Who did you take after?

09:45.090 --> 09:50.620
Interesting. I've never participated in 
such challenging peace talks before.

09:58.420 --> 10:01.720
What... <i>is</i> this?

10:03.440 --> 10:04.840
The ships are gone.

10:05.830 --> 10:08.410
Where did you go, King Canute?

10:08.410 --> 10:10.260
You can't be serious!

10:11.250 --> 10:17.340
Our battle hasn't been settled yet!

10:22.360 --> 10:25.740
Floki was dissatisfied.

10:26.320 --> 10:29.430
He said he doesn't understand why
 we're withdrawing from the farm.

10:31.440 --> 10:34.180
As you dissatisfied as well, Wulf?

10:35.940 --> 10:36.920
No.

10:39.100 --> 10:42.890
I'm canceling our plans 
to seize other farms as well.

10:43.510 --> 10:46.420
I wouldn't want to create 
more work for Thorfinn.

10:58.850 --> 11:05.940
Until now, I thought you were 
the only one fighting with me.

11:07.760 --> 11:12.090
But today, I gained new allies.

11:24.960 --> 11:30.000
<i>Later, Canute ordered the disbandment 
of the Danish army stationed in England</i>

11:30.000 --> 11:33.750
<i>that had been pressuring English finances.</i>

11:37.030 --> 11:46.150
<i>In the end, Canute's Danish forces 
dwindled to a mere 16 ships.</i>

11:51.620 --> 11:57.140
<i>However, the English uprising people
 feared would occur never happened.</i>

11:59.490 --> 12:04.750
<i>The English nobility realized the
 trust Canute had placed in them</i>

12:04.750 --> 12:06.940
<i>when he relinquished his military forces,</i>

12:08.200 --> 12:13.850
<i>and the relationship between conqueror 
and conquered began to change.</i>

12:31.320 --> 12:32.860
I feel good.

13:54.930 --> 13:59.110
As long as you're alive, you can...

14:05.650 --> 14:09.070
Why do I have to live?

14:27.760 --> 14:29.130
Thorfinn...

14:30.780 --> 14:32.920
Are you good now?

14:32.920 --> 14:38.850
Yeah. I still feel a little dizzy, 
but I'm fine.

14:42.900 --> 14:45.750
Don't do crazy stuff like that.

14:47.190 --> 14:48.280
Sorry.

15:01.040 --> 15:03.780
Are we going, Thorfinn?

15:05.000 --> 15:07.910
To the land beyond the sea.

15:11.890 --> 15:13.350
You mean Vinland.

15:15.720 --> 15:17.260
Vinland.

15:21.540 --> 15:28.170
When Arnheid drew her last breath,

15:29.350 --> 15:32.410
I couldn't answer her right away.

15:33.880 --> 15:37.670
I couldn't tell her why she had to live.

15:39.010 --> 15:43.910
What am I supposed to say 
to a soul that's been through hell

15:45.560 --> 15:48.460
and yearns for the peace of death?

15:55.840 --> 15:58.390
I want a world where I can tell people to live.

16:00.170 --> 16:06.470
One I can proudly describe to people 
whose only salvation is death.

16:07.090 --> 16:11.050
A place more appealing than death.

16:14.610 --> 16:24.570
That's all we ever wanted 
in this world we live in.

16:45.720 --> 16:48.340
I won't accept it.

16:51.960 --> 16:54.810
If a place like that doesn't exist...

16:59.200 --> 17:01.820
then I'll make one.

17:06.550 --> 17:07.610
Einar.

17:15.430 --> 17:18.150
Brother, come with me.

17:18.930 --> 17:22.260
We'll build a peaceful land in Vinland.

17:22.990 --> 17:25.990
One we can proudly tell Arnheid about.

17:27.960 --> 17:30.060
Let's do it, brother.

17:30.560 --> 17:35.400
Beyond the sea, let's create 
a country without slavery or war.

17:41.140 --> 17:42.980
For Arnheid.

18:30.370 --> 18:34.010
Are you sure you're okay with this?

18:35.440 --> 18:39.500
It was presumptuous of me to do that.

18:41.670 --> 18:44.380
I've told the master and
everyone on the farm

18:44.380 --> 18:47.930
that the young master 
convinced the king to withdraw.

18:48.580 --> 18:49.880
Thank you.

18:51.700 --> 18:56.420
You can count on me to protect Arnheid's grave.

19:01.820 --> 19:04.330
Truly, thank you.

19:05.490 --> 19:06.630
Oh, it was...

19:07.530 --> 19:12.380
Thorfinn, I want to be like you.

19:13.140 --> 19:19.160
Strong and kind like you. A real man.

19:24.200 --> 19:30.900
Olmar, I heard you made 
the decision to stop fighting.

19:31.980 --> 19:33.700
That's amazing.

19:36.310 --> 19:40.250
It took me fifteen years to do that.

19:43.830 --> 19:44.700
But...

19:49.580 --> 19:54.040
I've finally figured out what I should do.

19:55.940 --> 19:59.020
This is a wonderful farm.

20:00.020 --> 20:03.060
I hope you'll rebuild and protect it.

20:06.770 --> 20:08.010
Old Master,

20:09.270 --> 20:14.650
thank you for always helping us.

20:16.870 --> 20:21.080
I told you, it was just a deal we made.

20:21.610 --> 20:24.440
You shouldn't be thanking me.

20:31.360 --> 20:35.640
I wish he would've taken 
at least a single silver mark.

20:44.590 --> 20:47.580
Thorfinn, Einar!

20:49.160 --> 20:54.580
My name is Roald, Son of Grim!

21:00.980 --> 21:04.000
Thank you, Roald!

21:04.000 --> 21:06.490
Take care, everyone!

21:42.310 --> 21:43.270
Come here.

21:56.450 --> 21:58.250
Good boy.

21:59.170 --> 22:01.540
<b>Carve it.</b>

22:01.870 --> 22:03.130
Hup!

22:11.550 --> 22:16.430
<b>Carve it into your flesh.
 Carve it into the land.</b>

22:22.690 --> 22:24.440
<b>Carve it into the sea.</b>

22:30.200 --> 22:34.830
<b>Carve it into your spoils.
Carve it into your enemies.</b>

22:36.000 --> 22:37.370
<b>Carve it.</b>

22:38.620 --> 22:40.380
<b>Carve it.</b>

22:40.380 --> 22:44.130
Boss, when are you going to 
start working? Come on.

22:44.550 --> 22:48.600
Shut up. I was just taking a little break.

22:49.010 --> 22:52.300
I'll show you what farm work really looks like.

22:52.300 --> 22:54.510
Oh, yeah? Let's see it, then.

22:55.560 --> 22:58.520
I'll get this done in a snap.

22:58.520 --> 23:01.770
<b>Carve what you feel into me.</b>

23:15.730 --> 23:22.490
In my life, I've always endured.

23:23.510 --> 23:28.570
I thought that pain was the way of the world.

23:34.260 --> 23:38.960
I never thought I'd meet men like them.

23:38.960 --> 23:40.300
Right, Arnheid?

23:44.360 --> 23:53.360
They're headed toward a world 
we never even imagined.

23:56.500 --> 24:01.180
Someplace that's not here.

24:04.540 --> 24:11.840
<b>Carve that encounter into me.</b>

25:51.480 --> 25:54.990
<b>Home</b>

25:51.480 --> 25:54.990
<b>Home</b>

25:52.820 --> 25:54.140
"Home."
