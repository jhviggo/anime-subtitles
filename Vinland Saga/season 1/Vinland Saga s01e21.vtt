WEBVTT

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.980
In 1014,

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.610
York

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.070
was controlled by the Vikings of Denmark,
led by King Sweyn.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.280
The land was used as a base

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.910
for exporting slaves all over Europe.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.250
The Vikings served as

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.040
slave traders.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.550
I know how you feel, boss.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.140
But we're not rich enough to free
the slaves out of compassion.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.950
Reunion

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.720
It's been 11 years already.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.190
Isn't it about time now?

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.520
That day, without Thors,

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.150
we wouldn't have gotten out of there alive.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.320
I must repay him for his help.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.450
Hurry! All of these over here!

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.160
Over there!

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.160
<i>Hurry! Go!</i>

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.210
What?

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:31.960
Hey! You!

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.670
You in the dirty cargo ship!
Get that ship out of the way!

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.590
Hurry up! The first ship's almost here...

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.760
Heave ho!

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.930
Heave ho! Heave ho!

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.810
Hurry up! A nobleman's ships

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.690
are about to pull in along this pier!

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:52.980
I got it.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.990
So, this is York.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.700
It's a big town.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.740
Yes. It's an old town that prospered
in the days of the Roman Empire.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.250
People and goods from both Northern Europe
and England all gather here.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.170
His Majesty the king must be planning to
establish the capital of his new dynasty here.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.340
It's a good decision. I'd do the same thing.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.180
Come on! Who cares if they're nobility?

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.770
Those guys are a pain. Damn.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.270
Hey, boss. Take care of the one on the stern.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.610
That man...

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.320
That's right. It's definitely him.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.950
I'd never forget that face.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.420
Askeladd! The pirate who killed Thors!

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.490
Hey! Don't push!

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.920
<i>Who's ships are those?</i>

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.710
<i>His Highness'.</i>

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.710
What will you do?

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.130
The king is going to strike at tomorrow's banquet.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.300
Well, about that...

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.180
It's obvious that we're going to lose out
at the Imperial Council tomorrow.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.310
For example, he could give different territories

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.190
to you and Thorkell to isolate you.

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.230
He'd be giving you a reward,
but he'd also be giving you an order.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.240
If you refused, you'd be suspected
of harboring rebellious intentions.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.450
It's all up to the king what he wants to do with you.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.620
If he takes Thorkell from us, we're in trouble.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.250
True. We'd be in trouble.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.090
So... What's the plan?

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:43.970
How about this?

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.640
We could try exposing the secret
to the people around here.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.890
Exposing the secret?

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.310
Which one is the prince?

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.060
Isn't that him?

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.680
Your Highness Canute.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.940
I mean that you're going

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.280
to die here right now.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.460
He got shot!

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:18.920
His Highness the Prince got shot!

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.170
<i>Raise your shields!</i>

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.170
Where'd it come from?

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.590
From the north bank! Find them!

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.220
He was shot from this side? Unbelievable.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.720
What an easy job.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.060
Hey!

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.480
What's happening?

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.980
This is bad.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.360
We better not get involved in this.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.400
Hey! Where are you going, boss?

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.110
It's him! He was there!

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:54.580
What's wrong?

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.790
Are you okay?

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.540
You're bleeding!

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.140
You wasted so much of my time.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.080
Hey! You bastards!

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.540
What's going on?

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.540
I bet you're the snipers!

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.630
He's the sniper. It wasn't me. Here's the weapon.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.340
What's that?

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.640
Is it a bow?

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.080
That's the weapon?

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.350
Is he your friend?

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:56.430
No, I...

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.930
You can't fool us!

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.480
You're just trying to blame everything on him

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.400
and save yourself!

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.940
I said it wasn't me!

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.440
No! I can tell from your eyes!

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.150
Your eyes are so murky.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.110
It's so obvious that you're a villain...

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.200
Don't resist, you bastard!

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.000
Wait! Wait! Wait!

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.210
He's using a knife.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.750
He's small and he's young.

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.670
Are you...

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.550
Thorfinn Karlsefni?

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:33.630
Thorfinn?

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:35.600
Karlsefni?

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:37.560
Who is he?

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.390
You idiot! Don't you know who he is?

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:43.310
He's the man who won a duel against
Thorkell the Tall with only two knives!

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:44.980
What? No way!

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.110
In that case, this is bad.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.320
He's one of His Highness's vassals.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.280
Seriously?

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.240
Excuse me for a bit.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:54.860
You...

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:56.620
Are you...?

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.040
You're from Iceland, right?

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:03.580
Your name

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.170
is Thorfinn, son of Thors!

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.210
You're...

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:13.760
Old Man Leif.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:22.930
You're alive! I'm so glad.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.850
I'm so glad!

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.690
Out of the way!

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:30.190
Don't shake him, you idiot!

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.190
Where was he hit?

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.190
His chest. It's bad!

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.950
Your Highness! Hold on!

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:36.570
Your Highness! We're going to cut off your clothes.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:54.550
I had that feeling all along.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.970
His Highness is a woman!

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.810
This is big news!

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.220
<i>No way!</i>

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:02.720
You idiots.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.560
I'm right here.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:09.940
You're right.

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.190
Why did you choose a woman?

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.660
We couldn't find any male slaves who looked similar.

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:22.700
Can you save her?

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.910
No. Not with where she got shot.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.040
If there was poison on the arrow,
then she's probably already...

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:35.800
I'm sorry.

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.390
Take care of her.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:44.930
Do everything you can.

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:46.270
Yes.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:51.020
Well, you know...

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:54.280
Your precautions have paid off, Your Highness.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:59.320
It seems that there are people hiding here in York

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:01.370
who want to do you harm.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.160
I see.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:08.960
You want to get revenge.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:13.250
Yes. I'm going to kill him, no matter what.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.800
With my father's dagger.

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:20.890
He's all beaten up.

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:25.140
A young child survived on the battlefield.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.100
I'm sure he's seen hell.

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:31.400
No. I can't.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.150
In order to save this child,

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:36.440
I have to forget these last 11 years.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:38.570
Leif.

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:42.870
What's happening in Vinland right now?

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:46.450
My father had wanted to go there.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:49.250
I dream about it sometimes too.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.040
Did you build a village already?

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.840
Why aren't you asking me about your mother
and your sister, who you left behind?

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:02.970
After you left, Helga's health got worse.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.260
Go see her, Thorfinn.

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:08.810
It would make Helga feel better...

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:11.560
I'm asking you about Vinland!

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.060
Don't talk to me about things I didn't ask you!

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:19.400
Hey. Hey! Where are you going? Thorfinn!

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:24.030
Let's go home, Thorfinn.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.330
You've had enough, right? Let's go home together.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.200
Enough?

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.290
You have no idea.

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:37.500
You don't know anything about

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:39.590
what I went through between that day and today.

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:41.010
Right?

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:43.880
As long as Askeladd

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:47.720
is still alive, eating and shitting, it'll never be enough!

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:50.220
It'll never be enough!

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.610
How could this have happened?

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:00.070
That cheerful young child.

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:11.250
I'm going to stay in this town
until you change your mind!

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:13.620
Thorfinn!

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.170
Let's go home!

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.510
Hey. Here's some booze.

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:24.760
Thanks.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.970
Nice room, Bjorn. I'm jealous.

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:33.520
This room is too small of a reward
for risking my life.

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:41.780
By the way,
Atli said he wanted to apologize to you.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:47.280
I've got no hard feelings for anyone
who cut me on the battlefield.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:52.040
Thorfinn's the only one who holds a grudge about it.

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:56.330
I'm okay. So go.

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.250
It's time for you to make your evil plans.

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:01.750
Yeah. See you later.

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:06.180
Askeladd.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.390
How is your leg?

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.310
Well, I've been hit by a lot of arrows.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.110
But, well...

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:26.150
It's good enough for me to hold a sword.

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:28.860
I see.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:31.580
Then tomorrow.

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:34.830
Okay.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:36.830
Tomorrow.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.880
We've been outwitted, Floki.

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:48.970
I apologize.

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.310
Askeladd? He's doing well.

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:00.980
He's laid a curse on this town.

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:07.530
The prince got killed?

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:09.820
No! It was a body double.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.030
It's so dangerous out there.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.250
We can't sleep in peace at night.

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:22.630
What I don't understand

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:26.800
is why the assassin was targeting the prince?

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.380
Well, he's an important person!

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:31.300
Of course someone would want to kill him!

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:35.600
But King Sweyn is here!

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.230
If they were going to go after someone, it would be him!

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:39.850
Oh, you're right.

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:42.810
And there are two heirs.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:46.610
So the fact that they went after the younger brother
must mean that...

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:47.740
You there!

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:52.280
I have some interesting information regarding that.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:55.950
Well,

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.750
it's only a rumor, after all.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.460
Only a rumor?

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.210
That's perfect.

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:07.710
It's better not to offer definite proof.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.920
We should leave the king with some room.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:15.350
So you're the one who hired the assassin?

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:17.100
You performed a part in your own play?

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:20.100
It was some good acting, right?

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:23.060
Spreading rumors isn't enough.

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:28.360
That acting made the rumor seem real.
That's how the rumor will spread.

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:32.860
Everyone knows of the dispute over succession
within Denmark's royal family.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:36.160
Now, there's been an assassination attempt,
and the rumors will spread.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:37.990
Well then, everyone.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:42.080
How is this going to affect tomorrow's meeting?

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:43.500
I see.

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:47.630
He won't be able to issue any orders
that would put me at a disadvantage.

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:49.590
That's right.

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.470
If he took Thorkell away from you,

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:56.010
or sent you to a warzone, it would only feed the rumors.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.390
The king depends on public favor.

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:03.690
If he gets a bad reputation among the military,
he won't be able to ignore it.

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:08.110
Especially if they found out he murdered his own child.

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:13.070
You're so cunning.

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:15.570
Where did you learn how to do it?

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:19.080
Brute force isn't the only way to fight.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.490
Did you learn something new?

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:23.790
The king might not strike

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:25.920
for the time being.

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:28.380
It's a good way to buy time.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:30.960
But

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:34.220
I won't let you use a double for me ever again.

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:37.680
Yes. I apologize.

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:43.930
I'm so impressed, Askeladd!

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:46.770
I feel like I have a force of ten thousand on my side!

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.110
Thanks.

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:52.360
Well, it looks like our discussion is wrapping up.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.450
I'm going to run some errands now.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:58.410
Wow! Having him here is so reassuring!

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:01.550
Your Highness.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:05.330
You must not trust Gunnar.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.080
He's probably communicating with King Sweyn.

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:12.090
Why do you think so? Tell me your reason.

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:15.550
It's my gut feeling. But I'm sure about it.

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:19.640
Then wasn't that bad just now?
He'll find out about what we were talking about.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.050
I don't care.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.470
I've only talked about things that are superfluous.

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:28.150
If Gunnar is on their side, then he's going to
tell them tonight about what he just heard.

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:31.480
I asked Thorfinn to follow him to make sure.

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.860
What are you going to do if Gunnar is a spy?

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:36.650
Are you going to kill him?

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:40.450
Let him work.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:45.700
We'll use him to tell the king

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:47.960
that we don't want a short-term battle.

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:51.670
If he hears it from his spy, he'll believe it, and relax.

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:56.510
In order to avoid conflict for now, it's necessary to have
an understanding from both sides.

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:00.430
My plan is complete now.

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:07.310
You're unbelievable.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:12.690
I'm looking forward to seeing
the king's reaction tomorrow.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.490
That's the king's house.

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:23.910
Now, we know for sure.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.880
Everyone's obsessed with deceiving each other.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.090
Is that what a warrior is supposed to do?

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:36.550
There's only one thing

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:38.260
I'm supposed to do.

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:50.810
Do we really have to do this before the Imperial Council,

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:52.350
Thorfinn?

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:01.320
Wouldn't it be better to wait
until your right arm heals?

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.740
Well, I'm fine with it either way.

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:08.830
I shall be the witness.

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:12.460
The duel is over when I tell you to stop.

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.130
You both agree with that?

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:16.670
Fine with me.

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:19.670
But please wait a moment, Your Highness.

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.300
I have a previous engagement.

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:24.600
I will return later.

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.520
Sorry, Thorfinn.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:38.780
We'll be done soon.

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:46.280
Understood. Begin.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.760
Askeladd.

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.480
You're strong and smart.

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:15.810
I look up to you.

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:19.190
Even though

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:22.860
you hate me from the bottom of your heart.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.910
Hey, Askeladd.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.540
I'm not the only one.

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:32.660
You hated

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:34.750
our friends who died...

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.670
and even yourself.

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:43.920
Aren't you lonely?

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.390
Rejecting everything

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:49.470
like that?

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:53.140
I...

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.190
wanted...

00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:59.270
Wanted...

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:03.490
to be friends with you.

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:32.180
Sorry! I missed the vital spot! I'll put you at ease.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.560
Askeladd...

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:38.770
I wanted to be friends with you...

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.700
Yeah. Bjorn...

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.200
You're

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:52.410
my only

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:54.700
friend.

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:11.510
Send me off.

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:41.460
Well, then. Sorry to keep you waiting, kid.

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:43.210
Come.

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:49.970
I'll play with you.
