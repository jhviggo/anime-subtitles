00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.030
NORTHERN ENGLAND EARLDOM OF NORTHUMBRIA
VIKINGS' BASE

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.370
It was a Saturday.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.950
Vikings bathe on Saturdays.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.960
The English knew about this custom.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.060
Enemy attack.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.650
Burn them all.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.360
Don't spare the women or children.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.650
Kill them all. Those are the king's orders.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.030
SWORD

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.130
Hang in there. This is it.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.260
Yeah.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.470
I killed Snorre.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.770
Damn.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.390
All right. Spear troops, advance.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.310
Charge.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.570
The battlefield went that way.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.830
Why do I always get killed so fast?

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.870
Dead men aren't supposed to talk, Thorfinn.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.130
You're always the first one to die, Faxi.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.500
Yeah.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.510
In Valhalla, in heaven, you
get to eat meat every day.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.720
You can't enter Valhalla unless
you're a strong warrior.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.220
I see.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.690
I wonder if my mother and my
sister will get into Valhalla.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.530
Did they kill you, Thorfinn?

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.240
If you die in the snow, you'll catch a cold.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.750
You're leaving tomorrow?

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.750
You're so lucky. Where
are you going this time?

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.540
To Norway. I'm not going there for fun.

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:21.500
I'm going to trade goods.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.260
I take wool and fur,
and trade it for wine.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.010
Then I'm going too.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.180
No. What do you mean, "then"?
Don't say it so casually.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.970
What? You're so stingy.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.480
I don't care if you end
up hitting an ice floe.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.150
I want to get some wine
before the end of the year.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.860
I'm going to celebrate
the birth of Jesus Christ

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.240
with the people of my home
country with some wine.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.120
My father likes mead.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.370
Ask him for some.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.330
It has to be wine.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.790
I thought there'd be some
wine in this village, though.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:04.800
Thorfinn.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.510
Can you pass on a message
to your father for me?

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:09.510
What?

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.760
A warship has come.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.900
How's this, master?

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.900
The leak's been fixed this time.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.820
Try putting some water in it.

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.290
This is difficult.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.580
You put too much strength into it, Thors.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:38.960
Father.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.790
Father.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.460
I'm over here, Thorfinn.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.090
Father.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.470
Another warship came. It's huge.

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.150
They asked for Thors the Troll.
They've been waiting there ever since.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.610
Thors? Are they talking about Thors?

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:13.740
Troll?

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.790
They're no amateurs.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.120
They're not like Halfdan's thugs.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.130
Oh, Thors.

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.880
Are they planning to
invade this village?

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.720
Jomsvikings.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.640
I'm right here.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.400
They're bowing to Thors.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.530
I never imagined you'd come
this far looking for me.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:52.860
Floki.

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.620
We haven't seen each other since the Norway campaign, Thors.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:04.000
I never imagined you'd be hiding
here, at the end of the earth.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.170
Tell me your business, Floki.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.050
Well, then. First give us
your permission to land.

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.430
Who is Thors?

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.390
I heard he used to work on the
battlefield when he was young.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:21.480
They'll hear you, Ari.

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.440
He doesn't talk about himself much.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.730
Let me see.

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.900
He said "Jomsvikings," right?

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.110
Know anything about them?

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:33.280
Not really...

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.780
Father is angry.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:41.790
They made a surprise attack
while they were bathing.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:47.710
Many Danes were killed by English troops in Danelaw.

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:50.170
Gunhilde,

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:53.050
the sister of Sweyn,

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:55.760
the King of Denmark, was one of the victims.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.260
Revenge for his sister.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.850
King Sweyn has a good excuse now.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.940
A big war is about to begin.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.150
It's time for us warriors to shine.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.110
War?

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:08.540
Tss.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.530
The Jomsvikings will join
the army of Denmark.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.780
Our invasion of England will begin this coming spring.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.160
Do what you will.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.040
This is a small village at the
northern edge of the world.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:26.330
Whatever these big countries on the other side of
the North Sea decide, it's none of my business.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
That will not do.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:36.720
Our leader Sigvaldi ordered me to gather the entire fleet at Jomsborg.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.180
No exceptions.

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:40.140
Do you understand?

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.470
Even if that man deserted the army.

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:48.480
Deserted?

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.110
Captain of the Jomsvikings.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:55.690
Thors the Troll.

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.070
This is a war...

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.080
in which you too will fight.

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:16.090
Thors.

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:20.390
Our leader is doing this
out of his own goodwill.

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:24.430
After going missing 15 years ago,

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.230
you have a chance to return
to the battlefield with honor.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.980
Our leader is willing to overlook everything.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:37.030
That's how much our leader wants you.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:42.240
You didn't have to come on
a warship just to tell me that.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.160
The villagers are afraid.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:50.120
You've changed a lot, Thors.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:53.420
Or did this village change you?

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:55.030
Run away.

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:56.370
Run away.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.170
He's scary.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:01.090
This is a nice village.

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:03.140
I can tell from the children.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:07.350
They've lived a life free
from war, until today.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:15.770
Hear that? There's
going to be a war.

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:16.860
Wow.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:17.970
This is my first war.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:22.360
He came all the way across
the ocean to invite Thors.

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:25.120
Your father is amazing.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.500
But I wonder if he'd
take us with him.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.500
You have no chance. You're weak.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:33.800
What are you talking about?

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.120
You're no good unless you're strong.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.960
Well, I got that covered.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.880
You've never killed anyone, right?

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:45.220
It all depends on whether you've
had that experience or not.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.260
Sorry.

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:55.440
I'm not just...

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:58.150
a powerless messenger, you know.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.320
If you're saying you're not going to fight in the war,

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:06.740
I can't carry out my master's orders, and our
leader's reputation would be damaged.

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:11.200
I can't go back empty-handed
in a situation like that.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.000
You understand, don't you?

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:26.970
The Jomsvikings.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.930
They're an army with a base in Jomsborg,

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.850
a port town in Wendland.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.020
I never imagined

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:36.900
that Thors used to be a Jomsviking.

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:38.650
Are they strong?

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:39.860
They're strong.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.490
They're so strong

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:45.570
that the King of Wendland was
unable to collect taxes from them.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.370
They take pride in being the
strongest army in the Northern Sea.

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:52.120
Withdraw. All troops,
return to the ship.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:55.870
Withdraw.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.840
What was that just
now? That was weird.

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:07.930
You've been saved, Ari.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:14.100
Listen, villagers.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.980
I'm Floki of the Jomsvikings.

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:19.900
At the orders of my master,

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.400
I have come to this land

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.150
to ask the hero Thors
Snorresson to join our forces.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:25.900
Hero?

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.740
Our leader has requested

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:33.080
that Thors be provided with one warship.

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.210
If you have what it takes,

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:38.750
join Thors and come with us to Jomsborg.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.390
Farewell, Thors.

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:50.970
We shall meet on the battlefield.

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:59.400
We're going to war.

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:05.840
How many decades has it been?

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.470
What?

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:08.240
I'm going to kill them all.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.030
It'll be an honor to die
on the battlefield.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.200
Let's get started right away. Let's
prepare the ships tomorrow.

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:22.000
I guess you couldn't say no, Thors.

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:25.260
I dragged the village into this.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:30.390
A long time ago,

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:33.350
I used to earn my living by killing people.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:35.600
But one day...

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:39.440
One day, I suddenly hated it all.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.560
I didn't want to kill

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:43.480
or be killed.

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:46.190
That's why I ran away

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:48.360
from the battlefield.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:57.080
I thought I succeeded in
making it look like I died.

00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.250
You could do that again.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:05.920
If I run away, this village will
be punished in my place.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.090
The Jomsvikings never
forgive deserters.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:18.730
The time has come

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:22.230
for me to take responsibility
for what I've done.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.780
All right. Ready?

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:33.870
One, two...

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:35.990
Heave, ho.

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:37.740
Heave, ho.

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:39.370
Pull.

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:41.330
Heave, ho.

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:44.380
What? I thought you
were leaving today, Leif.

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:46.750
Thors asked me.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.550
I decided to join the
fleet with that warship.

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:50.760
I see.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:52.880
That would be safer.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.390
We'll protect you in a pinch.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.970
Here we go.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.020
I'm counting on you.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.810
Pull. Pull.

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:04.150
Heave, ho.

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:05.940
Though,

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.360
everyone really does love war.

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.370
You're so mean.

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:19.660
Darn you, Thorfinn.

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.160
Surround him.

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:23.620
Bastard.

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:26.840
We did it. I killed Thorfinn.

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:28.960
That hurt.

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:32.010
What's wrong with you? Die,
Thorfinn. You got killed just now.

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:33.680
Follow the rules.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.760
That's right.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:38.430
What's wrong with you?

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:39.640
Are you okay?

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.520
Wait, Thorfinn.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.150
All right. Lift.

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:53.650
One, two, three.

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:56.910
All right. One more time.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.580
Thors.

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:00.910
Can you take a look at this?

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.170
The pain.

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:06.920
It's broken.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.090
Someone hit too hard. It's
supposed to be a game.

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.510
Keep the splint on for one month.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:14.920
Sorry, Thors.

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:16.510
Thorfinn did it.

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:18.680
He pisses me off.

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.010
He's too rough.

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.970
I'm never playing with him again.

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.730
Is that true? My son did this?

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.440
Yes.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.860
I'm sorry.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.480
I'll talk to him about this.

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:32.940
Don't take it so seriously.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:34.360
It's between the kids.

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.030
He's only 6, right?

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:39.950
If he can hurt kids that are four
or five years older than him,

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:41.240
he must be pretty strong.

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:44.080
He'll grow up to be a good fighter.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.210
He takes after you, Thors.

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:01.430
You're giving me all of this, Dad?

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:04.600
They're family treasures from my grandfather.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.520
Fight with all your might.

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:07.600
Ari.

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:10.190
You look good, Ari.

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:11.860
Look at mine.

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:15.360
It can cut off a horse's head in one stroke.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.900
Wow, it's huge.

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:18.700
Spears are what's best for plundering.

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:20.490
Really? Want to have a match?

00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:27.290
What's wrong with you?

00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:29.920
Don't throw everything on the floor.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.500
Hey. Are you listening to me?

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.670
I'm going to throw it away if you don't pick it up. Got it?

00:17:34.750 --> 00:17:36.760
Go ahead. I don't want it anymore.

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:42.550
What are you doing, searching
through the storage room?

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.220
Where are our weapons?

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:45.850
What? Weapons?

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.350
I need a weapon.

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:49.850
If I had a weapon...

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:52.020
Are you thinking...

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:56.190
you're going to become a warrior
and sail on your father's ship?

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.900
I'm telling you now, don't
waste your time trying.

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:01.870
A little kid like you can't do it.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.290
Thorfinn.

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:54.250
It's beautiful.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:08.310
What is it? What's wrong, Ylva?

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:14.020
Do you want a sword, Thorfinn?

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:17.650
A sword is a tool for killing people.

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:21.950
Who were you planning to kill with this?

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:25.870
The... The enemy.

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.790
Who is your enemy?

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:33.120
Like...

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:35.290
Halfdan.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.710
Listen closely, Thorfinn.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.600
You don't have any enemies.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.520
No one has any enemies.

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:03.490
There's no one who it's okay to hurt.

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:10.280
You're wrong.

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:13.790
Father, you're going off to war tomorrow.

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:16.250
You're going to kill the enemy, right?

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:19.790
I'm not a kid anymore.

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:22.170
You're lying, Father.

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:23.970
I can tell.

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:27.220
Thorfinn.

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.430
Thorfinn.

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:30.220
You let your guard down.

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:31.610
That was dangerous.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:33.350
Hey.

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:34.890
You made me bleed.

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:42.900
Helga.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:45.030
Yes?

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.820
Take care of him for me.

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:10.720
The wind blows faintly
from the west north-west.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.390
The waves are calm.

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:16.230
Odin is in good spirits this morning.

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:19.810
This is a good morning for your departure.

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:21.980
Indeed.

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:32.350
FAROE ISLANDS
STREYMOY

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.580
You said it.

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:39.170
If I throw left-handed and
hit it, the barrel is mine.

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:41.080
No way.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.220
You can talk after you hit it.

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:42.050
I beg you, God...

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:44.630
Here I go, Christian monk.

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:46.670
If you dodge, I'll kill you.

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:54.100
You bastard. You dodged. You dodged
just now. I'm going to kill you.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.560
Move. It's my turn.

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:01.150
Oh, no. The priest...

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:04.270
I told you not to dodge.

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.570
You're just bad.

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:10.360
Hey, Jomsvikings.

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:12.320
Want to have a drink?

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.160
They have good manners.

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:19.370
Leave them alone.

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:21.830
They said they don't like cheap alcohol.

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:23.080
Hey.

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:27.510
How many points do I get for his leg?

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:33.590
Your men don't have any class, Askeladd.

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:39.140
We just hate Christians, Floki.

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:43.350
Enough about that. Let's get down to business.

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:49.900
My men and I are bored of being kept
here waiting in the middle of nowhere.

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:52.660
There are no major changes.

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:57.990
You will be compensated
with five pounds of gold.

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:01.500
I will only pay you in
exchange for his dead body.

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:06.420
You can do whatever you want
with their ship, and their cargo.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:11.550
Kill Thors.
