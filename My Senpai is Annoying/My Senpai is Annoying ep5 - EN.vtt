00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.940
That was such a compelling movie.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.270
It sure was. I felt betrayed by
the final scene, but in a good way.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.940
Uh-huh.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.700
Oh, Valentine's Day is next week, huh?

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.360
My, how time flies...

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.330
Speaking of which, what kind of
chocolate should I make this year?

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.790
You make such good chocolate
that it's really hard to decide.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.460
Where am I?

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.250
My map app has let me down...

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.090
Hey there!

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.180
We kind of know this part of town.
Would you like us to show you the way?

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.100
W-Would you?

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.860
This is that over there,
and you go along here like this.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.650
Thank you, Ladies! Thank you so much!

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.360
No worries.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.620
Hey, you think you can manage by yourself?
If you want, we could walk you there.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.410
Oh, that's okay. I'm meeting somebody...

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.460
...and they'd tease me if you did that.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.920
Oh, okay. Be careful now.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.800
I know my way now, so I'll be okay.
You were such a great help.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.350
Futaba, how long do you
plan to keep on waving?

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.900
Natsumi, he said, "Ladies."

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.410
Hey there, Igarashi.
You look like you're in a good mood.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.330
Lately it seems people are finally
starting to recognize I'm a grown woman.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.300
I really don't see the connection
between me and being childish, anyway.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.340
What do you mean?

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.590
That's the part of you
I'm seeing right now.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.610
"Episode 5: Valentine Symphony"

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.820
I want chocolate!

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.990
What's with you all of a sudden?

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.370
Valentine's Day is next week, right?

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.370
I'd like to get some heartfelt chocolate
from somebody this year for sure!

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.330
"From somebody"? You don't care who?

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.880
Well, chocolate from Sakurai-<i>san</i>
would be great, if she'd give it to me.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.630
She gives it to you every year.
Courtesy chocolate, that is.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.510
You never know...
This year may be different.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.390
For some reason, I get the feeling our
eyes have met more often than last year.

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.270
Twice out of every ten times, for sure.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.520
That's just because
you stare at her too much.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.940
Hello, everybody!

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.740
Hey there!

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.070
Hey.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.330
Aren't you going to ask her?

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.500
V-Valentine's Day is coming up, isn't it?

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.210
Oh, it's that time of year again? Guess I
should start getting ready for it, then.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.420
By "getting ready," are you saying...

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.300
...there's someone you'd like to give
some extra special chocolate to?

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.100
"Extra special"?

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.100
By that I mean, heartfelt chocolate...

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.850
"Warm Beverage"

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.480
I'm saying I need to get the chocolate
for everyone in the office ready.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.110
Like I do every year.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.860
"Warm Beverage"

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.610
See? What'd I tell you?

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.570
We won't know for sure
until the day arrives.

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.620
These are pretty heavy...

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.710
Senpa... i...?

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.300
Senpai!

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.930
Senpai! Senpai?

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.050
Oh, if you're looking for Takeda-<i>kun</i>,

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.510
he left to make some
sales calls this afternoon.

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.970
Oh, he did?

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.060
Do you wish you'd gone
with him, Igarashi-<i>chan</i>?

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:06.150
Please don't get the wrong idea! I was
only wondering where he could've gone.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.120
Hello, Chief?

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.120
Takeda-<i>kun</i>. Did things go well?

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.000
It ended without a hitch, so I think
things went as well as we could hope for.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.630
It's almost quitting time, so you can go
straight home from there today.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.800
What? You sure?

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.380
Everyone here's starting to head home.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.340
Okay. Bye!

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.350
"Chief
Call Ended"

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.350
That means she's on her way home, too.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.770
See you tomorrow!

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.190
"Da-ding!"

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.190
"Takeda Harumi:
I'm done here,
so how about dinner?
Let's have ramen!"

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.490
See you tomorrow!

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.530
See you!

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:57.290
"Igarashi Futaba: Okay! It may take me
30 minutes to get there."

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:00.710
"Igarashi Futaba: Okay! It may take me
30 minutes to get there."
I've got some time before she gets here...

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.330
Guess I'll grab a coffee...

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.050
H-Help!

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.130
Shut up, kid! This is a shakedown!

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:08.880
Fork over the dough!

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.930
"Australopithecus Dentistry"

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.300
You okay?

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.310
Y-Yes, sir...

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.310
Catch!

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.440
Um... Thank you so much, sir.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:30.740
Hey, no worries. I keep myself fit
for times like these. But look, kid...

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.740
A man shouldn't cry so easily
over a little thing like that.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:40.000
Was it really such a little thing?

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.710
But still, no matter what I do,
nothing ever works out right for me...

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:50.130
I mean, really, it seems like someone's
always coming to my rescue...

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:56.550
Just the other day, in fact, I got lost,
and these kind people helped me out...

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:58.890
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:01.890
I think it's good
that you can rely on others.

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:03.900
Do you really think so?

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.900
Senpai! Sorry to keep you waiting!

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.320
Hey, aren't you...?

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.660
Did things go okay the other day?

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.620
Wait, you guys know each other?

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.330
Yes, sort of.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:22.370
Thank you so much for
your kindness the other day.

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:24.040
Oh, it was no trouble.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.040
"A Big Hit"
"Meaty and Juicy!!"
"Manta? Bowl 500yen"
"It's tasty!"

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:29.840
Um, my name's Sakurai Yuto.
When we met the other day,

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.630
I couldn't find where I was
supposed to meet my big sister...

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.090
Sakurai?

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:36.390
Big sister?

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.390
Come to think of it,
I do see a resemblance...

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:40.600
You're right.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.890
Um...

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:44.850
Yuto! Sorry I'm late!

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:46.310
Sis!

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:53.030
That's strange! What are
the two of you doing here?

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.320
So, you <i>are </i>Sakurai-<i>san</i>'s...

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:59.910
It's a small world, huh?

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:03.200
Do both of you know my sister?

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.370
Yeah...

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.080
We all work at the same office.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.630
Really?

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:12.760
Hey, we were just about to go have some
ramen. Do you guys want to come with?

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.050
Ramen?

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:17.470
Hey, uh, this was a spur-of-the-moment
thing, you know!

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:20.640
I was just getting hungry. Please--

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.020
I'm sorry, but we have plans this evening.

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.850
We're going now, Yuto.

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:30.440
Goodbye!

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.730
Be careful now!

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.150
Well, we'd better get moving, too.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:36.320
All right.

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:40.660
I wanted to have some ramen, too.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.120
We'll go some other time.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.540
They're so expensive!

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.290
Yeah, they're a bit expensive, huh?

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:47.620
They've got them in our color...

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.710
--Yeah, they do!
--Aren't they cute?

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:51.670
They're really excited, aren't they?

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:55.590
It sure looks that way. You might even
get some chocolate this year, Yuto.

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.180
Who, me?

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.850
I bet there's a girl who likes you, Yuto.

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.940
N-No there's not!

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:13.610
Yeah...

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.030
I bet these are really good.

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:27.500
I wonder if Sakurai-<i>san</i>
gave somebody some chocolate.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.790
Yeah, I'm really dying to find out.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:31.630
Let's go around and ask
the girls one by one.

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:33.090
That's a great idea!

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:44.560
Hey, did you give somebody
some chocolate, Touko?

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:48.140
No, that's not something I...

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:52.190
Yeah, I guess you popular girls
aren't like the rest of us.

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:55.900
They come flocking to you, and you don't
even have to bribe them with chocolate.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.740
Hey, what's that supposed to mean?

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.200
Sis?

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.790
Are we swinging by the store to get
the stuff we need for dinner?

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:11.540
Yeah.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.460
"Gyoza"

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.960
"Itomaki Ramen"

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.300
Howdy!

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.930
Welcome!

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:24.800
Oh, it's just you, Harumi.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.890
That's no way to talk to a customer.

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.730
I'd completely forgotten you were one.

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:37.730
This is Igarashi. She's my <i>kouhai </i>at work.
Make her some of your tasty ramen.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:39.650
Nice to meet you.

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:42.530
Yeah, same here.

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:47.410
Do you come here often, Senpai?
He called you by name just a minute ago...

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:51.250
Yeah, I've been coming here
since I was a student.

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:52.500
Really?

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.380
So, what'll you have?

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:54.790
"Menu Ver. 2.12"

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:56.380
"Menu Ver. 2.12"

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:56.380
I recommend the Valentine's Day special.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.380
"Super Sweet!!
Valentine Chocolate Ramen"

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.380
I recommend the Valentine's Day special.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.510
Chocolate ramen...?

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:03.340
Not another one of your crazy ideas.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.430
What do you mean "crazy"?

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:10.640
Always pushing the envelope.
That's my policy, you know!

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:15.020
I admit it's pretty gutsy of you,
but who'd actually eat this stuff?

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.820
What did you say?

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.980
I don't eat sweet stuff
that often, anyway.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.950
Give me a bowl of <i>tonkotsu </i>ramen.

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.990
Uh... I'll have what he's having.

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:40.300
Mommy, look!

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.670
Shush! You mustn't stare!

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:46.430
Look! When I walk on this,
I'm taller than you!

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:48.050
You sure are.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.230
S-Sir?

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:55.190
You need to pay in cash...

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.710
Mmm, all of these are simply amazing!

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.720
I think your coworkers will be
very pleased, Futaba.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.340
Really?

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:34.020
I'm not giving Takeda-<i>senpai </i>any!

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:38.360
No one said anything about him...

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:42.280
Wouldn't you feel sorry for Takeda-<i>san</i>
if he was the only one who didn't get any?

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.580
"Powdered Green Tea"

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.000
Wow!

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:56.710
"Thanks Everybody!"

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.080
"Thanks Everybody!"
--What's that?
--It looks so good!

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.290
"Thanks Everybody!"
This is homemade, isn't it?

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:04.670
Who would make something this wonderful?

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:06.260
Wow...

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.340
It looks too good to eat...

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:13.310
So does your chocolate, Futaba-<i>chan</i>!
You even added some cute illustrations.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:16.850
I like to draw, that's why.

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:20.770
This bear looks just like Takeda-<i>san</i>.

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.820
Are you giving one to him, too?

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:27.860
Well, he is always looking out for me...

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:32.280
But he doesn't eat sweet stuff that often.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:36.370
Well, you're really amazing, Futaba-<i>chan</i>.

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:42.040
"Suzuki: Meeting"
"Takeda: Sales Calls (Back @ 4PM)"

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.510
What's the matter with Kazama-<i>san</i>?

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:02.230
Hey there! Today's the day we've all
been waiting for... Valentine's Day!

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:05.860
Yep, that's right.

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:08.610
Okay, here you go.
Thanks for always being a great help.

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:10.530
Thank you.

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:15.870
I've got to ask you just to make sure.
My chocolate's heartfelt, right?

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:17.660
Right?

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.330
No, it's courtesy.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.500
Of course, it is.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:29.170
That's strange.
Your chocolate's gone, Hijikata-<i>kun</i>.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.800
I set it down right here...

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:39.730
This is pretty good.

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:42.810
Hey, that's for Hijikata-<i>kun</i>!

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:43.810
Oh.

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:45.610
Hey, hold on there!

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:47.530
That's mine. Give it--

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:55.870
Calm down and feast on this instead.

00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:01.120
It's my special homemade vodka chocolate.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.870
Good, huh?

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:09.670
Hey, are you all right?

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:12.760
I scored some homemade chocolate!

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.010
What a tough mentality you've got!

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:27.230
Hey there.

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:29.980
Oh, good afternoon.

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:35.280
Takeda-<i>senpai</i>, what's that?

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:39.540
Oh, this? I got it at a client's.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:42.580
That's some pretty expensive
chocolate, you know.

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.790
Really? It is?

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:48.500
Compared to that, mine's...

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:55.840
Wait a sec. Could that actually be
heartfelt chocolate?

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:59.010
You normally wouldn't give
something like that as a courtesy...

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:01.220
Hey, you all right?

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.440
Y-Y-You're too close!

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:07.400
Sorry, sorry. It's just that you had
this strange look on your face.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.190
And whose fault do you think that is?

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:12.360
Forget it.

00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:15.530
You want to have some of this?

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:21.450
It's from the wife of the chief at
Maki Textiles. He gives you his regards.

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:23.200
Uh...

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.170
How the heck do you pronounce this?

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.710
The chief at Maki Textiles?

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:34.260
Oh! That chief at Maki Textiles.
Is that so...

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:37.970
Go-ba-d-day-da-da...

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:40.810
Um... here you go...

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:43.560
They're homemade...

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:49.520
You did? Wow. Hey,
did you draw the bear, too?

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.400
Well... yeah...

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.400
Thanks! You mind if I have some now?

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.530
G-Go right ahead.

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:00.080
Okay, then! Thanks!

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:07.000
Um, how does it taste?

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.330
Mmm, this is great!

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:13.420
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:17.010
Wait a sec. This kind of
tastes like green tea.

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:20.220
I-I mixed in some powdered green tea.

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:24.890
I figured that way it'd be agreeable
for someone who doesn't eat sweets.

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:28.770
Oh, really? That makes sense.

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:32.230
"Mon Energy Drink"

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.710
Hey, are you okay?

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:51.670
You look kind of down today.

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:54.300
I'm just fine.

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:59.680
Seriously, what's wrong?
Are you not feeling well?

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:05.220
You're not acting like your usual self.

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:09.440
And I was so looking forward
to giving you this.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:15.150
A chocolate bar? Why?

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:18.320
Because it is Valentine's Day, after all.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.860
Here you are.

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:26.910
Which kind of chocolate is this?

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:29.790
Hmm, I wonder.

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:32.790
Well, I'm 100% sure it's courtesy.

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:39.510
Why did you jump to that conclusion?

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.390
Because it's just a chocolate bar.

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.480
Sakurai?

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.730
A chocolate bar is still chocolate,
you know!

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:55.400
Homemade or expensive chocolate
may taste better, but...

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.320
...this is still perfectly good chocolate!

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:02.490
It's the thought that counts, right?

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:07.450
I never thought you'd be one to judge
based on appearances, Kazama-<i>kun</i>!

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:21.760
Weren't you walking with
some other guy the other day?

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:30.480
You gave it to him, right?
Your heartfelt chocolate, I mean.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:34.060
Are you talking about my little brother?

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:46.240
Looks like someone got the wrong idea.

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:52.960
I probably wouldn't give heartfelt
chocolate to my brother.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.500
N-No, you probably wouldn't.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:20:59.800
Thanks.

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.300
For the chocolate bar.

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:12.350
Oh, Kazama-<i>san</i>!

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:15.560
This is from the chief.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:17.690
Okay, thanks.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:23.400
I'm dead serious! Kazama-<i>san</i>
had this huge grin on his face!

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.610
You're kidding!

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:26.110
I am not!

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:28.070
I find it hard to believe.

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:31.830
To smile like that... I bet you something
really good happened to him.

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:34.000
Like what?

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.920
Um... like maybe he got
some heartfelt chocolate?

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.500
--What?
--Yeah, right. From who?

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.630
Yeah, like who?

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:46.180
If you want my opinion, I think it's...

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:49.850
H-Hey guys! How about we have
some of this cake here?

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:54.100
Somebody brought it here,
and it looks so delicious!

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:58.480
But who the heck made this?

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.230
My thoughts exactly.

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:01.690
I bet Chief did.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:07.660
He likes this sort of thing.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:11.580
But this year he really outdid himself.

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:18.120
No way!

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:24.050
Happy Valentine's Day!
