00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.440
Man, it sure is cold.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.690
What's the matter? You okay?

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.400
I lost my scarf.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.110
Oh...

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.080
Then, let me give you mine.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.340
But won't you be cold, Miss?

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.550
No, because I was born in
a place where it snows a lot.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.400
Thank you, Miss!

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.040
It's pretty nippy...

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.250
I should swing by a convenience store
and get some hand warmers.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.670
You really are a good gal. Put that on.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.300
You must never tell anyone about this!

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.890
All right, all right.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.600
And then, you know what Igarashi did?
She took her own scarf and wrapped it...

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.190
--Hey! Did you hear what
I said back there?
--...around the freezing girl's neck.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.690
--Even though she looked
a bit cold herself.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:49.770
--Keep your big mouth shut!
--Even though she looked
a bit cold herself.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.480
--Keep your big mouth shut!
--But she endured it
for the girl's sake.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.030
--Those two are as inseparable as ever.
--Senpai, I told you not to tell anyone!
--Isn't she such a good gal?

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.570
--They sure are.
--Senpai, I told you not to tell anyone!
--Isn't she such a good gal?

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.580
"Episode 3:
And Then, It's Christmas"

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.000
All right, everyone! Form a line!

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.090
Well, it looks like Christmas
has rolled around again.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.590
Come draw your lot. Don't be shy now!

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.970
Not another Santa lottery...
All you do is hand out sweets.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.730
Do a good job again this year.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.480
No way! I never want to do it again!

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.520
What did you draw, Takeda-<i>senpai</i>?

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.730
Safe!

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.820
Who's it going to be this year?

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.740
"Safe" "Safe" "Safe"

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.620
"Santa"

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.620
It's me!

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.870
"Santa"

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.870
Huh?! It's you, Sakurai-<i>san</i>?

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.080
"Santa"

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.080
Darn. It finally came my way.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.640
Last time I had my picture taken so many
times. Now it's your turn, Sakurai-<i>san</i>...

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.890
"Santa"

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.400
Looks like there are two Santas this year.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.410
"<i>Oshiruko</i>"

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.830
I'm going to be Santa two years
in a row. How unlucky can you get?

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.540
They're all Christmas-related.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.630
"Xmas Presents That Men Will Love"

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.940
I could get him a gift...

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.230
<i>Dobryy den!</i>

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.030
Tsu-Tsukishiro-<i>san</i>! You snuck up on
me again. Please, quit doing that!

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.910
So, what are you drinking today?

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.780
Uh... <i>Oshiruko</i>.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.330
<i>Oshiruko</i>? Is it any good?

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.450
It sure is. Would you like to try some?

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.750
Much obliged.

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.470
Do you not like sweet stuff?

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.470
Darn that's hot...

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:54.850
Huh?

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.810
The food was great!

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.320
I'm glad you liked it.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.070
The food was great, huh?

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.360
Yeah, it was so satisfying!
Let's go there again.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.120
Oh, how beautiful!

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.670
Would you look at that!
It's Christmas already, huh?

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.550
It sure is...

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:28.760
What are your plans this Christmas?

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.720
Why, work of course.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.060
You planning on getting anyone a gift?

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.720
Wh-Why?

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.520
Oh...

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.890
Just thought I'd ask.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.480
Well, I've got to admit...
I have given it some thought.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.820
You have?

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.360
Wait, are you telling me you've got a--

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.030
No! He's just a <i>senpai </i>at work.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.740
A <i>senpai</i>?

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.410
He's always looking out
for me, so I thought...

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:00.790
But it only crossed my mind. I'm not
actually going to get him anything.

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.050
Why not? You should get him something.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.170
Really?

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:10.470
A gift to express your habitual
feelings of gratitude for him.

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.970
I think that'd be really nice.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:15.600
Okay, so...

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.180
...if I was going to get him something,
what would make a good gift?

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.100
Well... What about a necktie?

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:27.320
I think that'd be the perfect gift for
a coworker who's looked out for you.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.190
A necktie, huh...?

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:32.490
Do you feel like getting
him something now?

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:36.950
W-Well... I guess so...

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.290
It's not what you think!

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.420
Really, it's not!

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.960
I haven't said a word.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:56.760
I didn't know there were
so many different neckties...

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:00.890
Oh, that's a cute one.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.110
But on Senpai? No...

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:10.440
Here's one with pandas.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:14.070
But he's more of a bear...

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:17.080
What's this?

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:28.290
Which one should I pick?!
I'm at an utter loss here!

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.220
Are you looking for something?

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:42.770
I-I'm shopping for a gift,
but I don't know what to choose...

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:48.020
These two-toned neckties are a popular
choice among women buying gifts.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.860
Hey...

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.610
This could be the one...

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.070
Thank you for shopping with us!

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.740
I actually bought it...

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.330
Merry Christmas!

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:15.470
No laughing! And no photos!

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.050
Here you go!

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:20.310
Oh, this just made my Christmas!

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.220
Please do this again next year!

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:25.310
Well, we'll just have to wait and see...

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:27.020
Kazama-<i>kun</i>.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:30.070
Merry Christmas to you!

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.530
Thanks.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:36.400
I'm swallowing my pride
to do this, you know!

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.070
My bad, my bad.
You're looking good again this year.

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:42.450
Flattery will get you nowhere!

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.200
Just hurry up and take them!

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.540
Futaba-<i>chan</i>, it's one
per person, remember?

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.930
In spite of what we said,
playing Santa was pretty fun, huh?

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:02.220
Well, all in the line of duty, I guess.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:06.060
Hey, aren't you going
to give Takeda-<i>san </i>a gift?

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:09.060
Wh-Wh-Wh-Who, me? As if!

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:16.650
I think Takeda-<i>san </i>would be happy
to get a gift from you, Futaba-<i>chan</i>.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:38.130
Igarashi-<i>chan</i>? Sorry to ask, but...

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:39.880
...could you give me a hand with this?

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.260
Sure!

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.640
Oh, that took longer than I thought...

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:56.860
"Nishimura/Nihonmatsu: Trip to Kumamoto
Ito: Filing | Takamoto: Mtg @ HQ
Nakagawa/Ooishi: Mtg @ Shiro Electric 3pm"

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:06.330
Shall we go where we
usually go again this year?

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:16.420
What should I do with this...?

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.880
"Today
Merry Xmas, Futaba.
You give him the gift?"

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:26.390
"No, not yet."

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:31.640
Hello?

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.810
You didn't give it to him?

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:37.480
I couldn't find the right time.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.360
The right time, huh?

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.530
It's not like I could give it to him with
other people around, so I had no choice.

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:48.750
I mean... on second thought, I don't have
a reason to give him anything, anyway.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:53.920
So, I don't think I really need to
go out of my way to give him this.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.630
Is that how you really feel?

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:58.090
Yeah... but...

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:04.090
Well, if that's how you feel,
Futaba, then that's okay, I guess.

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.470
Oh, pizza's here.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:07.970
Talk to you later.

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.820
It's how I really feel.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.250
It is, but...

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:40.300
Oh, for crying out loud!

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.970
Good! No one's here.

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:59.980
It's not like I have to give it
to him personally or anything.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:04.450
If I put it on his desk, it would stand
out, so maybe... on the seat of his chair?

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.160
Mornin'.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:10.450
K-K-K-Kazama-<i>san</i>!
You're here awfully early!

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:14.620
We don't have much time left
until offices close for year's end, so...

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:17.170
Man, I'm drowsy.

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:19.590
No, we sure don't.

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.930
--Yes, that's right.
--I'll check on that right away
just to be sure.

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:31.180
Chief! There's a call for you on Line One.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.350
Yes.

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:33.560
Please accept our apologies.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:37.100
--Oh, I'm so sorry.
--I'll call you right back.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.070
What's the deal?
We're, like, crazy busy...

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:43.070
Was it always like this at year's end?

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.650
Futaba-<i>chan</i>, did you eat lunch?

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:50.030
No, not yet, but... I'm fine.

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:52.290
Oh. Then, take this.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:53.370
"The One Bar That Satisfies"

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:54.620
Take it easy, okay?

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:57.000
Thank you.

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:05.340
Igarashi, can I have a word with you?

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:06.340
Yes?

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:10.720
I got called into a meeting on
short notice. Can you come along?

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.060
Yes, of course.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:22.110
That was exhausting.
You did a great job today, Igarashi!

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:25.990
I'm sorry for rushing around in
a panic before we left the office.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:29.030
You didn't look that way to me.
I think you're doing really well.

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:30.370
I see...

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.740
All right, let's go.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:38.750
Huh? Are we just going to go
our separate ways after this?

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:42.340
If so, that means...

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.710
Now's my only chance to give him this...

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.220
Excuse me!

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.360
Your stomach's rumbling pretty hard there.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.530
It's because I couldn't eat lunch today!

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:10.200
You want to go get something to eat?

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.610
Sure.

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:13.160
Any place you want to go?

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:16.450
What? Well...

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:21.960
"Xmas Special Roast Chicken
3 pcs for 1,480 yen"

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.080
How about chicken?

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.960
Oh, that sounds great!

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:36.260
This is so good! Great call, Igarashi!

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.600
This is the best!

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.850
This is still kind of Christmassy, huh?

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:44.230
Yes... I suppose it is.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.210
What are you looking at?

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:05.170
Huh?

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:08.340
Weren't you taking pictures
of Futaba-<i>chan</i>?

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:16.510
Did I look that weird playing Santa?

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:19.600
No, you didn't. Not in the slightest!

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:23.230
Oh, really?

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.860
Just teasing you!

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.030
You might be next, Kazama-<i>kun</i>.

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:33.320
It might be you again, Sakurai.

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:38.200
I'm usually pretty lucky
at lotteries, though.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:43.330
Well... I guess you weren't
so lucky this time.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:45.330
Well, maybe...

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.300
What is it?

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:57.680
I was just thinking that...

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.850
...maybe drawing the Santa lot
was kind of lucky in a way.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:08.940
Because you were out here waiting
for me, weren't you Kazama-<i>kun</i>?

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.830
Um...

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:25.620
Please, don't tease me so much.

00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:28.170
A-All right...

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.050
Sorry, sorry.

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:38.300
Okay, see you next week!

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.510
Okay.

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.680
Sakurai!

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:50.020
Um... Since it is Christmas and all...

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:53.610
Would you like to go somewhere
to get something to eat?

00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:59.410
--Yes!
--A-All right.

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.700
It's going to be a Christmas party
without any presents, though...

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:10.090
Eating good food will be our presents.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:11.710
Yeah.

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:27.390
I...

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.280
Did you say something?

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.160
No.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.660
Ramen! I want to eat ramen!

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:46.120
But this is a Christmas party, you know.

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.920
The place I have in mind
makes it really good.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.580
Well, okay I guess...

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.000
It's settled, then. Come on, let's go!

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.050
Hey!

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:00.640
--All Christmas cakes are now half-price!

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.300
--They're half-price. Wanna get one?
--All Christmas cakes are now half-price!

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:06.310
--Well... I'm pretty stuffed, so...
--Would you like one?

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:11.100
Oh. It'll be kind of dull
when Christmas is over, huh?

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.270
It certainly will...

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:21.280
What is it? Oh...

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:24.950
Hey, look! It's snowing, Igarashi!

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:30.040
Gotcha! Gotcha!

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:36.670
Feels cold.

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:37.920
Takeda-<i>senpai</i>!

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.800
Huh?

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:43.010
Today's Christmas, and...

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:47.310
...since you're always
looking out for me, Senpai...

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:54.520
This is...

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.940
I-It was pretty hard finding
the right time to give it to you...

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:02.200
And because you're older,
I really had no idea what to get.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:08.750
So, if you don't like it, I'm totally okay
with you throwing it away.

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:14.960
Thanks! I'll take good care of it!

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:21.220
Th-Then, I guess... that's great.

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.550
Yeah! Oh, I almost forgot.

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:27.350
Here you go.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:32.020
What's this?

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:35.940
You gave that girl your scarf, right?

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:39.070
Well, that there's...

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:42.110
...my Christmas gift to you.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.080
Th-Thank you so much.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.290
It's nothing special, though.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:05.760
"Last day of work before year's end!
Allow ample time to do
a thorough cleaning!"

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:13.230
I wonder if Takeda-<i>senpai </i>will come to
work wearing the necktie I gave him.

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:15.810
Morning!

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:22.820
Hey, Igarashi. There's something
I've got to ask you.

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:30.200
It's about that gift
you gave me the other day.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.080
--I knew he wouldn't wear it.
--It looked really good
when I tried it on.

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.620
--I didn't know what his
taste in ties was.
--And personally,
I like it a lot, but...

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:38.210
--And personally,
I like it a lot, but...

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:40.000
--It's really no big deal...
--...it might get dirty
if I wear it, so...

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.710
--I did say he could throw it away.
--...it might get dirty
if I wear it, so...

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:45.510
--So then, why am I about to cry?
--...it might get dirty
if I wear it, so...

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:46.970
Hey, are you okay?

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:50.140
Oh, I'm sorry. What did you say?

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.770
I said,

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:56.850
"Could I take this necktie you gave me
and put it on my desk for show?"

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:03.900
I thought I'd come to
the office wearing it,

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.950
but it's just too good for that.

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:06.240
--If it's on my desk,
it won't get dirty...

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.320
--No. You. Can. Not.
--If it's on my desk,
it won't get dirty...

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.160
Huh?

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.620
No, you can't!

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:14.290
Why do you think I bought it for you?

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:18.750
Okay, I'll display it at home, then.

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:22.090
Just put it on!

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:24.590
"And so he did."

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:59.560
"Illustration: Asanagi"
