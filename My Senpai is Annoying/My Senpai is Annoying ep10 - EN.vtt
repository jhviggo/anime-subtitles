Ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.840
I ran too much, and now I'm totally sore.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.630
Morning, Sakurai.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.590
Ohhh, morning.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.350
Hey, why are you dragging your feet?

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.310
What?

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.720
Are you all right?

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.310
Uhhh... Uh, yeah.
I'm totally fine, so don't worry.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.950
That was close. I'm too embarrassed
to tell him I'm on a diet.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.280
Are your legs all right?

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.200
Y-Yeah, they're fine.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.160
But...

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.250
They're fine. Really.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.300

like glue this morning.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.420

Oh, what's this I feel? It's so soft.
I just can't stop touching it.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.100
I heard you joined your
school's basketball club.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.220
Yes, I'm having fun just
chasing the ball around!

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.390
What are you practicing right now?

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:44.020
I want to learn how to make baskets.
I still can't do it at all.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.400
If you want, I can give you some pointers.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.610
Huh?! You know how to play, Kazama-<i>san</i>?

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.780
Well, yeah, I used to play.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.340
It didn't even touch the rim...

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.090
Yeah, it sure feels nice.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:14.600
Just try to throw the ball high,
and that should help... I think.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.350
Really?

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:24.730
With practice, you can do it, Yuto-<i>kun</i>.
Just try copying what I did.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.110
O-Okay!

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.950
Lower your hips and let the power
travel to your fingertips.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.370

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.950
And your left hand just acts as a guide.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:40.910
Oh, a <i>senpai </i>told me the same thing.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.290
I can do this.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.050

Kazama-<i>kun</i>.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.930
Yuto told me you taught him
some basketball the other day.

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.430
He said he had a really good time.

00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:59.470
Yeah.

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.940
I promised him I'd do it again sometime.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:05.400
Really? Could I come and watch?

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:09.280
Sure. But it might not be
that much fun for you.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.950
Oh, I'm sure it will be. I'll make us
some rice balls or something.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:15.320
I could eat a ton of those.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.990
--All right, then.
--Yeah.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.840
Let's grab a bite to eat before we leave.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.090
Okay, how about the pizza place
in front of the station?

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.050
Oh, sounds good!

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:35.260
Hey, Tsukishiro!

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.510
Yeah?

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:40.350
Hey, thanks for your help
the other day, Takeda-<i>san</i>.

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:43.520
No worries. It turned out
to be a lot of fun.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.600
What?

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.770
We ran into each other at Itomaki.

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:49.520
He split some pork buns with me.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.820
He did?

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:54.280
Why'd you go there in the first place
if you can't eat piping hot food?

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.070
The pork buns I bought at the
convenience store were cold, so...

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.120
I bet they were the microwaveable kind.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.370
Seriously?

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.330
You're a strange one, aren't you?

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:08.790
People often say that, but I don't know
what they find so strange about me.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.220
Well, I'm leaving with Touko,
so if you'll excuse me.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:16.430
Okay.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:22.100
Well now, let's go get some grub.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.850
A-All right.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.900
Hey, Igarashi...

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.570
Is something the matter?

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:33.530
On second thought, let's go to Itomaki.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:35.530
But why?

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:40.120
Because you look like you want
to have some pork buns.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.750
Your face is like an open book, Igarashi.
It makes things so much easier for me.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:56.380
Hey, what gives?

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:05.230
Thanks for helping me.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.980
No problem. I like to cook,
so I don't mind at all.

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:15.320
Aw... I can't quite make them triangular.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.950
Hey, that's totally fine. They look
cuter when they're round.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:19.860
Really?

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:20.950
Yeah.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.290
Yeah, that's it. Imagine the ball being
sucked into the palm of your hand.

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:28.540
Okay.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:34.840
Hey, guys! Want to break for lunch soon?

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.680
Let's eat!

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:41.510
This is <i>so </i>good.

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:44.100
I'm glad. Eat as many as you want.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.850
Thank you so much for teaching me today.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:51.190
I wanted the exercise, too,
so it's no problem at all.

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:52.230
It's just...

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:53.270
Just what?

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:58.030
Well, actually I invited Hijikata
and the guys today, but...

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:00.860
...they had a scheduling conflict
and couldn't make it.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.660
Oh...

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:12.830
It'd really be more fun if
a few more people were here...

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:15.670
In that case...

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:16.630
Hey!

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:17.760
There you are.

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:25.430
Yeah, they're both here.

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:27.850
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:29.560
Kurobe invited us.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.690
I invited these two without telling you.

00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:34.310
Thank you so much!

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:36.820

You're not going to play, Sakurai-<i>san</i>?

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:20.820
No, because my muscles
are a bit sore. I'll be the ref.

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.650
So, that was the reason why.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:27.120

How come?!

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:03.360
She's a girl, so I'd better
keep my distance.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.250
Wow! That was awesome!︎

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.220

Yuto-<i>kun</i>, you've got a bloody nose!

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:32.770
Guess I was lucky!

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:44.690
Now it's our turn! Get out of my way!

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:47.490

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.010
Hey, no fair! That was really immature!

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:17.520
I want to make cool shots, too. After all,
I <i>am </i>in the school's basketball club.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:21.820
Hey, don't worry. If you need us,
we're there for you.

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:24.570

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:40.080
I wonder if I can get past him. Still...

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:43.420
...I've got to try!

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:53.510
I made it past him!

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.150

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:22.630
Okay, bring it on, Igarashi!

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:27.630
Senpai, please crouch down a little.
You're too big.

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:31.680
Well, all right...

00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:37.310
You actually fell for it.

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:39.060
--She shoots!︎
--Why, you little!

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.800
Here he comes!

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:19.350
He's so fast!

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:27.980
Not too shabby!

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:30.570
I didn't know Kazama-<i>san</i>
could move like that.

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:32.450
That was so cool!

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:38.790
Were you just going easy
on your defense the last time?

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:42.330
You're a girl, so I didn't want
to bump into you.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:47.630
Well, it's still one to three,
so let's get on with it.

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:50.880
Uh-oh, she's getting herself
all worked up.

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:56.590
Here I go.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.860
I won't let him!

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.160
You'd better stay on your toes, okay?

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.630
"Two Hours Later"

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.550
Hey!

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:34.630
This is supposed to be practice for Yuto.
How long are you going to keep this up?

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:36.380
Sorry...

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:40.810
I didn't mind at all.
Actually, I learned quite a bit!

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:45.310
Well, we had a good time ourselves. But...

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:48.690
...it looks like her battery's dead.

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:50.480
Shall we call it a day?

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.190
Yeah, maybe I'll hit the public bath.

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:54.820
That's a great idea.

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:58.870
I'm all sweaty. I want to take a shower.

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:01.990
Well, I'd better get going, too.
Let's do this again sometime.

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:05.710
Okay! Thank you for coming today!

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.290
Huh?

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:12.880
No, Kazama-<i>kun</i>. You're coming with me.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:13.920
What?

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:18.390
I didn't get a chance to spend
any time with you!

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:20.220
Wha...?

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.260
Then, Yuto-<i>kun</i>'s coming with us.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.520
--Huh?
--Come on, let's go.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:25.930
O-Okay.

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:37.070
You want to get something to eat?

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:42.080
Yeah.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.830
Okay, we're here.

Hey, you awake?

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:58.630
Hey! Wh-What am I doing
on your back, Senpai?

00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:02.720
Your battery died and you fell asleep.
Just like a grade schooler.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.390
Okay, I'll get off of him now!

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:06.810
Well, we were just about
to hit the public bath.

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:09.190
Huh?! Guys and gals in the same bath?!

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:10.690
Heck no.

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:16.610
This is paradise.

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:20.410
Hey, you sound like an old fart...

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:23.530
Too bad you didn't get to
bathe with Takeda-<i>san</i>, huh?

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:27.290
What?! ︎That's the last thing I would do!

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:28.870
Hmm...

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:32.210
What is it?

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:35.710
You haven't changed a bit
since junior high, have you?

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:37.550
Huh?!

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:40.340
How much taller are you now?

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:43.970
I didn't mean it like that!

you can stretch your legs in.

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:55.860
Y-Yeah, I guess...
Takeda-<i>san is </i>a pretty big guy...

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.110
Takeda-<i>san</i>?

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:58.030
Yeah?

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:01.360
How can I get as big as you?

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:07.950
Get big? Well, I just ate and slept a lot.

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:11.210
I see... Diet and rest...

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:15.460
If you aren't fussy about
what you eat, you'll get bigger.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.090
Oh, and most importantly, milk!

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:24.760
Milk...

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.390
You drink it much?

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:30.560
Well, my sister drinks a lot, but...

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:35.520
It strengthens your bones. It's perfect
if you're going to play basketball.

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:44.530
Thanks.

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:47.660
This brings back memories.

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.660
It's okay to have something
like this once in a while.

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:02.670
It's okay to be selfish
once in a while, too.

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:03.630
What?

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:06.140
I-I didn't say anything!

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:09.680
What? No ketchup?

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.470
Oh, I forgot.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:13.640

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.240

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.900
Both of you bought some, too.

it'll help you get taller!

O... Oh, and diet and rest
are also very important!

Igarashi has a hearty appetite.

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:49.890
And she gets plenty of rest.

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:51.930

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:54.270
Shall we make a toast?

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:55.850
O-Okay!

00:21:56.850 --> 00:22:02.440
Um, well... Thank you very much
for joining me today.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.570
