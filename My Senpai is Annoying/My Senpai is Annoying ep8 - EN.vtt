00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.560
Tomorrow's the start of Golden Week.
Are you planning on going anywhere?

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.400
No, not really. Maybe just
the gym or a public bath.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.740
Senpai, that's what you always do!
You shouldn't let Golden Week go to waste.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.530
Yeah, you're right.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.740
It always seems like even the long
holidays are over before you know it.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.790
So, what are your plans, Igarashi?

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.620
My Golden Week schedule's totally packed!

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.800
I'm going to clean house, brush up
on my skills, and enjoy my hobbies.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.340
I'm planning on making
good use of the time off!

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.800
Oh, that's great.
What a great gal you are!

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.310
Hey! Don't tousle my hair!

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.640
On the first day of Golden Week, I'll
meet my dream girl. We'll start dating,

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.770
and get hitched by
the end of the holidays.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.690
That's my plan for Golden Week.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.070
Picking up girls, huh?

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.110
The girl's going to make
or break that plan.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.200
So, what are you doing for Golden Week?

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.790
Gaming. I'm going to beat this
new game that just came out.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.670
I'm going to a river
to collect some rocks.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.800
I guess it's tough for a gamer and a rock
nerd to spend their holidays like normies.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.050
All right!

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.300
Once my dream girl and I
have tied the knot,

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.100
I'll set up a mixer for you
and invite some of her friends--

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.810
Training.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.440
Oh, you startled me...

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.270
I'm going to devote myself to my training.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.110
What? Really?

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.400
What kind of training?

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.950
Well, I'm glad you asked.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.660
A hundred <i>ri </i>to the west...

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.080
Sakurai-<i>san</i>, thanks for your help.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.000
Not at all.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.710
The documents you make are amazing.
They're so easy to understand.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.040
Well, that's what I do.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.010
Could I thank you by
taking you out to dinner?

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.470
I'm friends with the owner of this posh
restaurant that's hard to get into.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.220
If you're with me,
we could get in right away.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.980
Wow, that sounds great!

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.730
But I'm sorry. I already have
plans for this evening.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.860
Oh, okay. Perhaps another time, then.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.610
"S: Let's go out to eat tonight."

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.360
"S: Let's go out to eat tonight."
"S: Ramen!!"

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.450
He's always drinking
orange juice at meetings.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.120
Oh, really?

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.540
I'm so pathetic...

I'm going to make the most of this holiday
and become a capable woman!

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.340
Hey!

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.430
Kazama-<i>kun</i>!

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.980
Sorry to keep you waiting!

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.060
Sh-She's so cu...

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:18.980
Were you waiting long?

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.520
No, I just got here.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.490
Actually...

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.110
We've still got time before
we're supposed to meet...

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.490
Well...

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.700
Shall we go?

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.080
Sure.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.080
I was so surprised.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.300
You suddenly asking me out like that.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.010
Okay, let's go to this ramen shop tonight.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.350
Yeah, let's...

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.310
...go to the aquarium.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.770
Huh?!

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.100
That came out of nowhere.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.940
Sorry...

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.230
It's just that...

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.990
...I didn't want to lose you
to someone else...

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.660
Hey, that girl is seriously cute.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.240
Whoa, she's major league.

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:23.500
But now that I've asked her out,
what am I supposed to do?

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.590
Thinking of it as a date makes me nervous.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.590
So, let's think of it as a game.

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.600
"Kazama, protect Sakurai!"

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.600

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.650
All right...

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.530
Game on.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.170
I hope I'm a step closer now
to becoming a capable woman!

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.260
Next up, a TV yoga class!

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.140
"True Horror Stories"

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:12.970

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.770

It was a gorgeous day
during Golden Week.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.390
"Reenactment TV:
What Single OLs Have Seen!!"
She'd just finished
cleaning her room

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:22.060
"Reenactment TV:
What Single OLs Have Seen!!"
and was about to do
some yoga when...

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.900
Thinking a package had arrived,
she went to the door.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.200
She started to open it...

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:38.580
...but feeling kind of uneasy, she chained
it and looked through the peephole.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:43.460
It was so dark out that she couldn't
even see the door opposite hers.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.050
All she could see were two red lights
like eyes floating in the darkness...

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.760
Lower your chest to the floor,
then push up with your arms!

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.350
It'll feel good once you're done!

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:00.680
It's hard work. That's what makes it fun!

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:06.150
Three, two, one... Done!

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.440
I've got nothing to do.

Hmm?

Hey, Igarashi, what's up?

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:22.580
Oh, Takeda-<i>senpai</i>.

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.580
Wait, are you crying?

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.340
No, I'm not.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.460
Your voice is shaking.

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:34.720
I just... wanted to hear your voice.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.890
It's not like you to say that.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:39.430
You sure you're okay?

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:41.470
I-I'm fine!

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.100
I've calmed down a little, so goodbye!

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:55.110
I'll try to ride this out by watching
some cute animal DVDs...

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:06.420
What's wrong with Futa-<i>kun</i>?
He's worked up all of a sudden.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:11.760
How did things turn out like this?

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:24.350
I'm scared. I'm scared.
I'm really, really scared...

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.020
Hey!

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.820
I knew you were crying.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.080
Senpai...!

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.950
You seemed to be having trouble
talking on the phone, so...

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:46.540
...here I am.

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:47.790
You okay?

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:00.470
Uh, two adult tickets, please.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.180
We have a couples ticket.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.730
Couples can get in at a discount.

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:08.980
Well, um...

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.240
Yes, we're a couple!

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:19.070
We got the discount.

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:21.120
Yeah...

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.450
Did she say that so we could
get the discount? Or...

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:31.080
I haven't been to an aquarium in ages!
Come on, let's go!

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:40.760
I'm sorry to bother you
during the holidays...

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.180
I don't mind.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.890
I had too much free time.
There was nothing to do but work out.

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:48.520
You work out when you've
got nothing to do?

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.980
You want to hang out this Golden Week?

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.610
Huh?

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.650
If you're scared to be alone,
I'll stay with you.

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.320
Oh, wait. You had plans, right?

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.280
Oh. No, not really...

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:05.950
Please stay.

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:07.200
Sure!

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.670
Wow, they're so adorable.

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:17.300
Yeah, but I hate the ones that sting.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.090
There are lots of different animals here.

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:21.130
Yeah. Pretty amazing.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:35.270
So, this is what you're into, huh.

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:39.780
Yes, I just love movies with cute animals.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:59.260
Ouch, ouch.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:04.180
The dolphin show is about to start.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.970
Hey, there's a dolphin show!

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:08.930
I've never seen a live dolphin before.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.430
Didn't you go see one on a field trip?

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:14.810
I caught a cold, so...

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:17.400
Oh, you poor thing...

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.740
Welcome to our dolphin show!

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:26.410
And now introducing... the dolphins!

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:28.410
Maki-<i>chan </i>the Pacific white-sided dolphin!

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:31.580
Haruto-<i>kun</i>!

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:33.870
And...

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:36.920
...Souta-<i>kun</i>!

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.800
We've got the same name...

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.550
And you look alike.

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:01.360
Close, but no cigar, Haruto-<i>kun</i>!

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:09.830
Souta-<i>kun</i>, nice save!

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:16.210
Souta-<i>kun </i>may have an unfriendly stare,
but he's actually very kind.

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:24.340
Souta-<i>kun </i>the dolphin's
a lot like you, Kazama-<i>kun</i>.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:29.350
Oh, you mean the unfriendly stare?

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.180
You both have the same stare, but...

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:37.060
When I found myself in a jam, you were
behind the scenes to help me out.

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:41.360
Many... many times since
I started working there.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.360
You're a kind person, Kazama-<i>kun</i>.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.360
To Futaba-<i>chan </i>and everyone else, too.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.450
Not everyone.

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:56.080
I'm not helping everyone out...

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.500
I...

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:01.500
And Souta-<i>kun</i>... jumps!

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:07.800
Great job!

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:13.850
I guess you can really get
soaked at a dolphin show.

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:17.810
Come to think of it,
they were renting rain ponchos.

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:21.020
I'll grab a towel later.

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:26.360
The only time you look happy
is when you're staring at my chest.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.950
The sunny weather is perfect for outings,
and places all over Japan

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:36.500
are packed with visitors.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:40.290
Now, let's look at conditions
across the country.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:44.420
It doesn't feel like a holiday when
I'm eating lunch with you, Senpai.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.380
You said it!

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:51.220
But places are packed during Golden Week.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.390
Here it's nice and empty.

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:55.770
Hey, sorry my shop's empty!

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:58.940
It may be empty, but the ramen's good.
It's the perfect combination, right?

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.980
Ain't it though? You get it, don't you?

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:06.150
And this concludes our dolphin show.

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:08.360
Thank you for watching!

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:12.450
"Underwater Seating"

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.450
Souta-<i>kun</i>'s jump was spectacular!

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:17.080
Yeah, it was...

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:20.790
It got me pretty soaked, though.

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:21.960
Sorry...

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.090
Sorry? For what?

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:27.050
Well, uh... for not shielding you.

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:29.130
Shielding me?

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.140
You mean like that?

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.520
Yeah, something like that.

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.770
She's laughing at me.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.360
"Gift Shop"

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.940
What should I buy?

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:51.700
What would make a good aquarium souvenir?

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.490
A stuffed animal, maybe?

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:57.160
Hey, it looks like that dolphin's
got his own merchandise...

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.660
Kazama-<i>kun</i>, hold this.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.670
You guys are so cute!

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:09.170
She's really laughing now.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.090
My stomach hurts from all that laughing...

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.760
Well, it looks like she's having fun,
so who cares?

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.810
It's so cute...

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:25.610
Is that what you want?

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:30.610
Yeah, but I really stink at claw machines.

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:32.740
Well, all right then!

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:37.830
Let me handle this!

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:49.710
You were way off!

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:52.050
What? I was?

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:55.470
Senpai, have you ever played
a claw machine before?

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:57.680
Nope, never.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.600
What? You can't be serious!

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.270
You won't get anywhere
if you give up without trying.

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:04.730
But still...

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:07.110
It's all right.

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:11.030
I'm doing this because I want to,
so just relax and watch me play.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:15.700
Oh! I had it there for a sec!

00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:17.820
"One Hour Later"

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:20.490
All right! Come on! Come on!

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:30.920
I got one!

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.470
Senpai, you're the greatest!

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.050
You can have it.

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:38.640
Thank you so much!

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:41.850
I'm sorry you spent so much money on this.

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:44.390
That's all right. I had a good time!

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:45.980
We hit the mother lode!

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:47.770
It was easy pickings here!

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:50.770
This is a pretty honest arcade.

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:52.690
The machines paid out so fast!

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:01.870
When we're walking down the street
like this, it feels like just another day.

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:03.750
You're right about that.

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:09.330
Well, it's not exactly
what I'd planned, but...

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:13.090
This is fine, too... I guess.

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:21.220
I had a great time!

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.810
I can't believe it's over already.

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:28.400
Sakurai.

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:31.060
Wait here for a sec.

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.480
I'll be right back.

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.360
Did he forget something?

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.530
The dolphins were so cute.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:44.330
Really? Then, let's come back sometime.

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:45.370
Yeah!

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:49.170
Hey, Beautiful!

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:52.340
You wanna come have some maté tea with us?

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:55.920
Hey! You don't know her yet,
so don't speak so casually!

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.840
Oh, right...

00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.430
I'm sorry...

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:01.430
Oh, brother...

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:03.970
Sorry, I'm with someone.

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:06.220
Oh, really...

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:10.900
Then, how about just one cup?
Maté tea's really good, you know!

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.900
Hey...

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:16.400
Hey, guys.

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:20.360
What do you think you're doing?

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.160
Who's asking?

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.160
I'm with her.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.170
You can start by letting go of her hand.

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:34.000
She's mine, you know.

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:41.380
What's with him?

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:45.060
Maybe he got embarrassed by what he said.

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:47.890
Look, it's a UFO.

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:48.930
Huh?

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:50.850
Huh?!

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:52.400
Come on, let's go!

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.820
Hey, wait!

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:01.070
Hold up a sec!

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.990
But maté tea's really good, I tell you...

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:23.970
Um... uh... what was that you said?

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:32.350
What I said back there... was a line from
a <i>shoujo </i>manga I read a long time ago.

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:37.480
I see.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:40.280
That's so like you, Kazama-<i>kun</i>.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.860
Pretty lame, huh?

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:43.280
No, it wasn't.

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:48.030
It sounded cool, like it was supposed to.

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:53.870
Oh, that's right...

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:58.800
Um... here you go.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.930
It's Souta-<i>kun</i>!

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:07.220
Well, I hope it doesn't bother you...

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:08.560
I'm so happy!

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:12.980
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:15.520
I'll carry it until it's time to go home.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:16.980
Thanks.

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:20.780
Well, the train's on its way. Shall we go?

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.070
Okay.

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:31.700
Thanks for today, Souta.

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:38.960
What's the matter?
Let's get going, Kazama-<i>kun</i>.

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.760
You're one lucky dolphin...

00:21:58.650 --> 00:21:59.060
"Here are some treats.
-Sakurai"

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:00.770
"Here are some treats.
-Sakurai"
Hey, Takeda-<i>senpai</i>!

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:03.320
"Here are some treats.
-Sakurai"
Sakurai-<i>san </i>brought us some treats!

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.700
"Munch" "Munch"

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.280
Not bad, huh?

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.490
They're quite good.

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:12.370
Oh, yeah...

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:17.790
And here's a keychain Sakurai-<i>san </i>gave me.

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:23.210
What an unfriendly-looking dolphin.
