00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.180
Morning.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.600
Morning.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.980
Looks like Igarashi-<i>chan </i>got up on
the wrong side of the bed this morning.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.440
Isn't she always like that?

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.780
What should I do? Last night I drank too
much and said something I didn't mean...

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.460
Why couldn't I be your wife?

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.920
Wh-Wh-Wh-What the heck am I saying?!

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.510
What should I do? What should I do?

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.600
Hey, are you all right?

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.020
I-I feel sick...

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.850
Don't puke here!

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.650
I'm going to throw up!

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.360
Hold it in! We're going to the restroom!

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.900
I wish I could erase the whole thing
from my memory...

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.530
There's no way I'd want
to be Takeda-<i>senpai</i>'s wife!

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.120
I've got to take back what I said...

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.950
Takeda-<i>san</i>!

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.620
Good morning.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.540
Morning, Sakurai!

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.090
Yo, Igarashi!

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.640
G... G... Greetings! How are you?

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.010
Huh?

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.640
How are you, Takeda-<i>kun</i>?

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.810
Fine, I guess.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.650
Igarashi, what's wrong?

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.280
N-Nothing!

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.490
I can't do this here!
I'll try again at lunch!

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.590
"Episode 2:
Udon with the Occasional Full Moon"

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.640
Takeda-<i>kun</i>, care to join me for lunch?

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.390
That sounds good!

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.930
Darn!

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.390
E-Excuse me!

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.520
Yeah?

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.350
Ah... er... um...

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.190
Oh, that's right!

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.110
I forgot I had an urgent
matter to attend to.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.320
Takeda-<i>kun</i>, I'm sorry.
We'll have lunch together next time.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.200
Igarashi, want to get something to eat?

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.330
Sure.

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.080
"Soba"

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.750
You mean to tell me you're still upset
about what happened last night?!

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.010
Guess that's why you had such a pained
look on your face all morning!

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.930
Don't laugh so much!
It's really annoying! Stop it!

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.810
Sorry, sorry.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.140
Well, it's nothing to worry about.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.770
It's not?

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.940
No. Because I knew
it was the liquor talking.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.900
Looking after his drunk <i>kouhai</i>
is part of a <i>senpai</i>'s job, you know?

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.200
Sorry to have caused you so much trouble.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.620
No worries. Now let's eat
before our noodles get limp.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:58.250
Is this... a good thing?
I don't know, somehow... somehow...

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.840
Oh, heavenly angel!

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.930
Oh, divine goddess!

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.310
Fate has brought our paths together!

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.890
I must go up and talk
with them right now...

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.850
Okay, but eat your ramen first.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.810
Oh, would you look at her?

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.610
Her perfect figure!

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.280
Her long, silky hair!

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.700
Her graceful and charming walk!

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.280
It's...

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.750
...Sakurai-<i>san</i>! Outside the office,
her high class stands out even more.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.580
No wonder she's the most
popular lady in the office.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.710
What a lovely smile...

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.170
No matter how many times I ask her out,

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.260
she always politely declines
with that lovely smile of hers.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.640
It's not just you, Hijikata.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.100
Huh? What?

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.020
Kazama, did you ask her out, too?

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.350
Like I could!

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.980
She's way out of our league.
None of us has got a chance.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.190
Well, I for one am not giving up!

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.150
Since she turns me down for drinks,
I'm going to ask her out for dinner first.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.950
None of the guys has even gotten that far.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:13.620
I wonder what kind of guy
she'd say "yes" to.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:17.160
"Limp Ramen Noodles Maki Maki"

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.960
"Limp Ramen Noodles Maki Maki"
Thanks for your business!

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.630
Hey, it's you guys!

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.090
Takeda-<i>san</i>. Igarashi-<i>chan</i>.

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.510
Let me see if I can remember here...

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.100
Hello there, <i>Koishi</i>-<i>san</i>.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.730
It's <i>Ooishi</i>. Did the two of you
have lunch together as usual?

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.980
Yeah, today we went to a soba shop.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.610
You guys really are close, huh?

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:44.900
Wha--?!

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.780
You're being rude, <i>Koishi</i>.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.240
It's <i>Ooishi</i>.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.240
There's nothing going on between
Takeda-<i>senpai </i>and me except

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.320
what goes on between
any <i>senpai </i>and <i>kouhai</i>!

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.830
Yeah, come to think of it...

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.330
Whenever I see the two
of you side by side,

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:59.870
you look just like a father and daugh--

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.420
Hey!

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.750
If we don't get a move on, we won't
have time to grab some coffee.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.630
Yeah, you're right.

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.470
See you back at the office!

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.130
Sure!

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.180
Those three are pretty close, huh?

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.430
Senpai?

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:15.510
Yeah?

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:19.890
Do others really only look at me
and think I'm your daughter?

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.690
Oh, who cares what they think?
Let's kick some butt this afternoon!

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:30.280
Hey, quit it! That's exactly what
gives people the wrong idea!

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.780
Honestly...

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:36.410
It doesn't matter how others see us.
It's got nothing to do with work.

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:37.910
But...

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:44.830
Maybe... Senpai doesn't
see me as a real woman...

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.960
"Soy Milk"

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.220
Sakurai-<i>san</i>, you've got big ones, right?

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.180
Huh?!

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:59.180
Tell me. Is there some kind of trick
to making them bigger?

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:02.020
Some kind of trick?

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:11.440
Futaba-<i>chan</i>, I think you're
the cutest just the way you are.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:16.530
Don't give me that! You big-breasted
women just don't understand!

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:19.120
Today's homework was so hard.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.620
"Elementary School"
You said it!

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:25.630
"Junior High School"

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:30.340
"High School"

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:36.590
The haves will never understand
the pain of the have-nots!

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:43.230
But it's not so easy when they're big...

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:47.150
And besides, I don't think Takeda-<i>san</i>
cares about that sort of thing.

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:52.570
But I at least want mine
to be average-sized.

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:55.570
Why did you bring up
Takeda-<i>senpai </i>all of a sudden?!

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.450
He's got nothing to do with this!

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:03.460
No, of course he doesn't.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.790
Oh, enough already!

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:15.800
Senpai, I'm taking off now.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:19.600
Looks like you're in a hurry.
You got some stuff to do?

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.770
Today after work, I'm going
shopping with a friend.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.100
I see. Well, be careful!

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.640
All right.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.770
Try not to get lost or anything.

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.110
I'm not a kid, you know!

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:37.950
Honestly...

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.240
Hey, Gorgeous. You free?

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.830
Uh, excuse me, Gorgeous?

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:51.290
You wanna get a bite to...
Hey, you listening to me?

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.630
Natsumi!

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:56.380
Sorry to keep you waiting!

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.890
Thanks for coming out this far.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.760
I got some running in, so no worries.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.640
Excuse me...

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.770
Ow-ow-ow!

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:09.770
Think he'll be okay?

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:12.020
Oh, he'll be fine.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.400
Before we go shopping,
let's pop by the arcade.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.530
Okay.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.120
Her breasts, huh... That explains it.

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:52.190
Natsumi, I see you haven't lost
your touch at arcade games.

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:53.940
Guess not.

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:58.650
We're doing a promotion now!
Please, take one!

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:04.160
These cute bear buns are really soft!
Please, take one!

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.660
We're giving them away!

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:10.120
They must be getting rid of their stock...

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.830
No thank you...

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:13.670
Wow!

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:17.510
I'll take two!

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:20.260
Okay, thank you!

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.850
Futaba, you really like
that kind of stuff, don't you?

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:27.890
They're so cute.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.900
H-Hey, Natsumi?

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:34.770
Yeah?

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:39.690
There are some outfits that caught my eye.
Do you mind if I go try them on?

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.240
Go right ahead. I'll be waiting.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:06.300
W-With these in there,
I look surprisingly ladylike... don't I?

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.350
Are you finished trying stuff on?

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.730
Oh, how cute!

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:20.780
Futaba, I'd just love to get
some more pics of you being cute.

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:28.450
What a haul!

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:30.370
Keep those in there
until you get home, okay?

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:34.080
Kill me now! Please!

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:39.880
Say, Futaba, you dating someone?

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.510
Huh? Wh-Why do you ask?

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:44.260
Somehow I thought you might be...

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:49.180
Well, I'm not! I'm not dating anyone!
My job is everything to me right now!

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.100
Is there someone at work
you can't stop thinking about?

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:56.900
I'm telling you, there's not.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.700
Okay, see you later! Next time I want
to hear all about that special someone.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.990
I told you, there's no one like that!

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:19.420
Darn! I should have taken them out after
I said goodbye to her at the train station.

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:24.920
But as long as nobody I know
sees me like this, I guess...

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:29.220
Please watch your step.
The doors on the right side will open.

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:35.310
Yeah, that last dunk was pretty awesome...

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:41.520
Wh-Wh-Why, of all people,
does it have to be these two?!

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.860
The train sways as we pass over a curve.
Please be careful.

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:49.240
They haven't spotted me, have they?
I'll just stay like this until they leave...

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:54.200
Oh, are you all right?

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.250
I'm fine, thanks...

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:59.080
Say, is that you, Igarashi?

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.010
Wait, I remember now. You said you were
going shopping with a friend, didn't you?

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:08.430
Y-Yes, well... That's right...

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.060
So, what'd you buy?

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:15.680
Um... clothes... and stuff.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.850
What did you do?

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:20.770
We went to see Kazama's
<i>kouhai </i>play basketball.

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.070
Next time, you want to come with?

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:26.440
I don't know much about sports...

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:30.530
Okay, well, this is our stop.

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:31.450
See you!

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:33.120
O-Okay.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.170
Takeda-<i>san</i>?

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:40.420
Yeah?

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:44.300
Did you notice anything unusual
about Igarashi-<i>chan </i>just now?

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.300
Well...

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:47.630
Nope, not particularly.

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:49.930
You're kidding, right?

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:55.520
He didn't even laugh... He didn't
notice them in the first place...

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.390
This proves it.

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:05.280
Takeda-<i>senpai </i>doesn't see me
as a woman at all...

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.620
♪ I forgot the words... ♪

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.870
"Futaba"

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.670
It's Futaba calling!

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:28.970
Hello, Futaba! It's not every day
that I get a call from you, eh?

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.300
Grandpa...

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:33.510
Wh-What's wrong, Futaba? Are you crying?!

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:37.640
There's something I want
to ask you, Grandpa...

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.230
What is it? Go on, Futaba, ask! Ask away!

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:47.230
Grandpa, what would you think
if my breasts got bigger all of a sudden?

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.700
Wh-What are you talking about?

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.030
Well, actually...
A lot of stuff happened today,

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:56.120
and my breasts got bigger
for a little while.

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.370
What?

00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:03.120
And my friend didn't even notice...
What do you think, Grandpa?

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.130
Huh?

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:08.510
My darling granddaughter, who rarely
ever calls, is asking me for advice!

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:12.220
As her grandfather, I've got to give her
some strong words of encouragement.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:18.180
Futaba, your appeal consists
of more than just your breasts.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:24.060
I'm sure your friend is so dazzled by you
that he doesn't care how small your--

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:26.690
Futaba? You there?

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:30.110
Darn... The battery's dead...

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:42.540
I know it's not Takeda-<i>senpai</i>'s fault...
So, why am I so upset, then?

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:47.130
I've got to hand it to you, Sakurai-<i>san</i>!

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:50.260
These data tables are amazing
and so easy to read!

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.760
They're no big deal. And anyway,
it's my job to make them.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:58.600
They certainly are a big deal. I'm so glad
I asked you to make them, Sakurai-<i>san</i>.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.310
Let me thank you by taking you out.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.930
Won't you join me for drinks tonight?

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:06.350
I'm sorry, but I have
other plans this evening.

00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:09.520
Well, what about tomorrow, then?
Tell me which night you're free.

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:11.940
When would be okay with you?

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:13.950
Sakurai-<i>san</i>?

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:15.490
You've got a phone call!

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:17.620
I'll be right there!

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:20.370
Excuse me, I've got to take that call.

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:35.430
Thank you for waiting. This is Sakurai.

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:39.390
Hello?

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:43.890
Um... uh... How are you?

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:45.890
Kazama-<i>kun</i>?

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:00.240
Sorry. Wrong number.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.590
Sakurai-<i>san</i>? Is something wrong?

00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:15.760
I just got the strangest
wrong number call.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.590
That's awful!

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:32.070
You can barely reach it...
Want me to lift you up?

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:36.110
Oh, be quiet!
That's no way to talk to a lady!

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:37.990
You meant "girl," right?

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:38.320
--Please watch your step.
The doors on the right side will open.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.780
--What did you say?!
--Please watch your step.
The doors on the right side will open.

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:51.880
Huh?

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.290
Hold on there!

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:58.010
L-Let go of me!

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:00.010
Excuse me!

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.300
I said, "Let go!"

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.020
Senpai!

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.520
Quit trying to put up a fight.

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:18.400
What do you think you're doing?!

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.200
Huh? A camera?

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:27.910
This creep was taking
candid shots up your skirt.

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:29.960
Really?!

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.210
F-Forgive me.

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:34.840
No. What you did is inexcusable.

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:42.510
Takeda-<i>senpai</i>, I didn't know
you practiced judo.

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:45.680
Yeah. Pretty cool, huh?
I'm a red and white belt.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:49.390
Sorry, I don't know much
about belts and stuff.

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:52.980
When I was a student,
I trained pretty hard.

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:58.570
You did? But is it okay for an experienced
wrestler to throw a complete novice?

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:02.990
They might take away my belt.

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:07.910
Huh?! That would be bad, wouldn't it?

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:15.250
I'd rather lose my belt
than see my <i>kouhai </i>get hurt.

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:17.880
I am your <i>senpai</i>, after all.

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:26.350
It's getting late. I'd better call Chief
and tell him we'll be going straight home.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:35.190
Hello, Chief? It's Takeda.
Sorry for not calling you sooner.

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:37.020
We ran into a bit of trouble.
No, it wasn't work-related...

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:42.610
He may not see me as a real woman, but...

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:45.070
...he does care about me.

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.370
Kazama-<i>kun</i>!

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:02.170
Thanks for that wrong number call.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:06.510
All I did was dial the wrong number.

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:09.100
Do you have any plans for tonight?

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:12.100
I was just going to go home
and play some video games.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:18.270
Would you like to go out
for dinner together?

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.860
Oh, will Igarashi-<i>chan </i>also be joining us?

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:29.450
No. Futaba-<i>chan</i>'s going straight
home from her client's office.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.170
Do you like... ramen?

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.040
I love it!

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:41.380
All right, let's have ramen, then.

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:42.840
Okay.

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:48.050
"Soba and Udon"

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.100
We had to skip lunch today.

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.850
Yeah, I'm starving.

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:55.600
There you go!

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.810
Oh, finally!

00:21:59.810 --> 00:22:01.860
But...

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:05.820
I guess even you can be
cool sometimes, Senpai.

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:08.530
I respect you just a teensy bit more now.

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:14.660
Well, Igarashi, I admit you are a woman,
a peculiar type of wo--

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.750
For such a little lady,
you pack quite a punch!

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:22.170
The "little" part was uncalled for!

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.970
"No running in the halls!"
"Illustration: Karameru"

00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:58.140
"Illustration: Karameru"

00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:59.560
"The End"
"Illustration: Karameru"
