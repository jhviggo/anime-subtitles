00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.560
"Episode 6: Grandpa Hearts Futaba"
What are you looking at?

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.190
I got a text from Grand-- my grandfather.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.980
Really?

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.780
"G: I put them on display
again this year"
Hina dolls?

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.280
"G: I put them on display
again this year"
He's put them on display for the Doll
Festival every year since I was born.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.700
"F: I'm 23 now..."
He must really adore you.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.660
Let's do something to make him happy.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.000
Do you really think
this'll make him happy?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.420
We sending him an update?

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.590
I thought we'd show him
how healthy and happy you are.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.880
Now both of you,
hold your hands in front of you.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.100
Like this?

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.600
There are so many useful apps these days.
Now, hold still while I take your picture.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.570
I couldn't send him this...

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.990
Sorry, I already hit "send."

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.410
Hey!

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.870
"G: Who the heck is he!!!"

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.370
"G: Who the heck is he!!!"
Oh, he replied.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.750
"G: Who the heck is he!!!"
"G: What rock did he
crawl out from under."

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.750
"G: Hey! You never told me"

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.880
"G: Hey! You never told me"
"G: about this guy!!"
That's strange. Sounds like he's mad...

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.960
"G: I've cared for you from birth!!
He doesn't know how long you wet the bed."

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.710
"G: I've cared for you from birth!!
He doesn't know how long you wet the bed."
He's started talking about
you wetting the bed, Futaba-<i>chan</i>.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.260
H-H-H-H-Hold on! Hold on!

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.550
Block friend!

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.810
Um, I'm sorry. I thought it was okay.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.690
You still wet the bed?

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.480
Heck no!

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.830
"Entrance Ceremony"

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.500
So, what prompted you to say you
wanted to swing by a flower shop?

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.300
It's not like I asked you to
come with me or anything...

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.510
Well, I figured as long as you were going,
I'd tag along. What about you, Igarashi?

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.970
I'm here to get myself a birthday present.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.850
What?! Today's your birthday?!

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.400
Yes. Why do you ask?

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.900
It's my birthday, too.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.730
Huh?

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.070
No way!

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.450
Yeah, is that incredible or what?

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.330
Tell you what, I'll get you your gift
if you get me mine, okay?

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.290
What?

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.460
You can just get me whatever.
And I'll do the same for you.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.130
Huh...?

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.880
If you're having trouble deciding,
I'm here to help!

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.130
How about some tulips?

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.680
Well...

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.100
I recommend these as well.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.390
Let me see...

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:33.440
Thank you for shopping with us!

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.100
Flowers as gifts are kind of clichÃ©, huh.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.270
Well, we can't return them now.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.480
Come on, let's do this.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.570
Sure!

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.080
--Happy birthday to you!
--Happy birthday!

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.170
Um... Thank you.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.050
Same here! I'll take good care of them.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.340
Come on, we're going.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.970
Sure, let's go get something to eat.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.400
Here comes a real tough guy.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.360
No, it can't be...

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.750
Happy birthday, Futaba!

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.630
Who the heck are you?

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.300
Hey!

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.810
You're that guy from the picture!

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.900
Give me back my Futaba, you bastard!

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:08.360
Igarashi Futaba is not an object.
She belongs to no one.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.660
Who <i>are </i>you, anyway?

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.200
He's my grandfather.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.580
What? This jerk?

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.790
Who are you calling a jerk?

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.710
Futaba, who <i>is </i>this jerk?
What rock did he crawl out from under?

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.460
Hey, what gives <i>you</i>
the right to call me a jerk?

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.010
I'm older than you are, so there!

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:30.970
What's going on?

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.220
Those are two huge guys.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.600
Hey, it's kind of embarrassing
for you to be doing that here,

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.140
so can't we take this somewhere else?

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.640
"Itoguruma"

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.940
I don't care if you <i>are </i>Futaba's <i>senpai</i>,

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.530
you've got no business taking
pictures of just you and her.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.490
Oh, you mean that picture we took for fun?

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.870
What? Are you toying with Futaba?

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.660
Huh? What the heck are you talking about?

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.250
Hey!

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.540
Futaba's <i>my </i>adorable little granddaughter!

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.630
Igarashi's <i>my </i>trusty <i>kouhai</i>!

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.510
You think you can put your hand
on Futaba's head without asking?

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.520
You saying I can't?

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.560
I'm the only one who's allowed
to pat Futaba on the head!

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.900
What?!

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.410
Futaba, have you been hanging out
with that big lug these days?

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:41.620
What?

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:46.250
I came all this way to celebrate
your birthday, Futaba, and you...

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.590
Grandpa's very unhappy.

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:54.930
Wh... What are you talking about? I told
you Takeda-<i>senpai</i>'s a <i>senpai </i>from work!

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:57.680
Are you two in <i>that </i>kind of relationship?

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.100
What?! I've had it! If you
keep on saying stuff like that,

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.190
then you should just go home!

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.650
Oh, Futaba...

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:12.740
"39 (Thank You) Ice Cream"

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.530
Natsumi!

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:19.580
Futaba, sorry it's a day late, but...
Happy birthday!

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.160
Thanks.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.830
Whatever you want, it's my treat!

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:27.670
Sweet! Then, I want some cake.
I didn't get to eat any yesterday.

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:29.210
Oh, really?

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.770
Oh, my aching head...
Guess I drank too much...

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:45.060
Huh? Futaba? Where are you? Futaba!

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:49.360
Surely she didn't go out
on a date with that big lug...

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:53.110
"I'm going out to meet Natsumi.
--Futaba"

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.280
Natsumi-<i>chan</i>? Really?

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:06.040
She'd hate me for asking...

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.500
--I don't understand the way
Futaba's been thinking lately...

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.050
--What a plot twist, huh?
--I don't understand the way
Futaba's been thinking lately...

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:15.010
It really blew me away!

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.470
"A masterwork depicting the facets of love
of today's teens and twentysomethings!!"

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:24.390
"A masterwork depicting the facets of love
of today's teens and twentysomethings!!"
Maybe if I watch this,
it'll help me understand.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.150
"Movie In Progress"

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:39.070
I never would've thought
their love would be so pure.

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:44.290
So, young ladies these days trade places
with guys in their dreams, huh?

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:53.550
Now I kind of understand.
I can rest easy for now.

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:59.260
Wait. Hold on... So that's why
she's been so cold to me lately...

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:04.390
Then, Grandpa...

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:06.640
He's just worried about you.

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:11.360
It's from Grandpa.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.190
He must really love you.

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:17.570
"G: Who are you?"

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.830
"G: Who are you?"

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:30.170
I guess she's out on a date
with that big lug after all...

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.340
What are <i>you </i>looking at?

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:37.880
What the heck are <i>you </i>doing here?

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:45.390
Oh, so <i>this </i>is where you've been!
Well, I'll be!

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.440
What are you babbling about?

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.570
Looks like I've finally caught one!

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:30.100
Um...

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:36.320
Futaba hasn't responded.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.860
"Batting Center"

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:43.200
Oh, I haven't done this in a while...

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.600
Wow...

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:14.940
"Cheese Umeebou"
"Crispy & Delicious"

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:17.480
Thanks guys!

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:19.780
Can I get my prizes, please?

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:24.320
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm all out of prizes...

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.070
No way!

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:32.710
"Itomaki Ramen"

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.920
Oh, Harumi! You free? I bet you are!

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:49.010
The shopping center has us doing this
volunteer work. Thanks for pitching in!

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:51.430
Oh, it's no big deal.

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.440
It's him...

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.190
If you don't mind, could you help us out?

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:16.580
Hey, what's the big idea?

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.750
It's first come, first served.

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:24.130
I've collected this much already.

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:25.510
Same here.

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:50.530
Hey, Harumi, how are things go--?

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:07.380
Hey, nice work there.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.890
Same to you.

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.100
Cheers!

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:24.650
For a man with your looks,
you're a pretty okay guy!

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:26.700
You're one to talk.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.530
That's for sure!

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:39.080
"G: Who are you?"

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.670
"G: Who are you?"
Futaba...

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:43.880
You're really crazy about
your granddaughter, huh?

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.880
Of course I am.

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:52.800
Futaba... Futaba...
was such an adorable kid!

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.100
Futaba!

"Futaba: Age 6"

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:03.440

Hello, Grandpa!

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:07.110
Grandpa's home!

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:09.110
You happy to see me?

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:10.950
Yeah, but you smell kind of funny.

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:13.320
You're happy, huh? That's great!

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:20.040
Futaba, I'm home! Where are you?

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:21.920
Hello, Grandpa. Um, Grandpa?

"Futaba: Age 8"

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.300
Yes? What is it?

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.180
I got a hundred on my test.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:34.390
Really? Way to go, Granddaughter!

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:38.560
Hey, stop it! Only kids
get their hair tousled.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.640
Tonight we must celebrate!

You want to live alone in Tokyo?

"School Prospectus"

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.150
I want to try living on my own.

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:57.040
I don't think it's good for me to be
dependent on you forever, Grandpa.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.750
I understand.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:03.250
You look so grim!

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:05.670
Huh? You sure it's okay?

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:10.630
Futaba, I know you. You made up your mind
after giving it a lot of thought, right?

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:16.640
Well, you know what they say: "If you
love your child, send her on a journey."

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:19.310
Th-Thanks!

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:21.270
However!

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:27.190
Beware of those city boys.
They're wolves, the whole lot of them.

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:29.530
A-All right...

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:35.120
I'm more or less done unpacking...

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.870
Tomorrow's the first day of school.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:43.620
I wonder if I'll make any friends.
Well, I've got to try....

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:46.330
Oh. So...

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:51.800
...she's been living on her own since
then. That's why she's such a good cook.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:56.640
What? Don't tell me you've had
some of Futaba's home cooking.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.970
I have, and it was really good.

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:02.560
Whaaaaat?!

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:09.320
You're such a good cook, Futaba.

00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:15.200
So, what did you make that fellow?

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.620
Enough is enough! You come
and spend the night uninvited.

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:22.500
You go head-to-head with Takeda-<i>senpai</i>.
Knock it off, okay?

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.910
I'm worried about you, Futaba.

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:27.830
I'm 23, you know!

00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:30.920
It's doesn't matter how old you are.
I still worry about you.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:38.430
Oh, how lovely!
Is this your White Day gift?

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:43.730
I just love macarons. Thanks!

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:45.440
I'm glad to hear that.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:50.400
Sakurai-<i>san </i>loves macarons.
Better make a note of that...

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.740
I doubt that note will ever get any use.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:54.740
Hey.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.780
You seen Igarashi around?

00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:01.120
Oh, Igarashi-<i>chan</i>? I think she's...

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.330
Oh, there you are.

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:07.710
Igarashi...

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.960
Oh, Senpai...

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.590
Uhhh...

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:20.350
There sure is a lot of
pollen flying around.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:23.640
Here, I went and got you a variety
of stuff from the drug store.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.350
Thank you...

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:29.520
Open your eyes.
I'm putting the drops in now.

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:37.360
That got rid of some of the discomfort...
Sorry about that.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:41.870
That's okay. But you should at least learn
how to put drops in your own eyes.

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:45.000
I don't know why, but the tip
of the eye dropper scares me.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.290
Sounds like you've got a sore throat, too.

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:48.870
Have some hard candy.

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:50.920
Thank you.

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:56.170
Okay, I'm heading back to my desk.

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:58.010
All right.

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:00.970
Since you shared that chocolate
with me a while back...

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:04.010
...let me thank you by
treating you to a meal today.

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:06.220
See you later.

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:09.270
That's right. Today's White Day.

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:10.350
"Strawberry Candy"

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:13.230
He remembered...

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:19.360
So, what do you want to have?

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.610
Let me think...

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:26.750
Sorry, first I've got to take a leak...

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.910
In that case, I'll hold your briefcase.

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:30.620
Thanks!

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.580
I'll be right back!

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:41.340
Ohhh, I almost wet my pants.

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:44.470
What the heck are <i>you </i>doing here?!

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:47.350
It was just a coincidence.
A coincidence, I tell you!

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:51.270
"Keep Our Restroom Clean"

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:52.480
Hey...

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.770
Yeah?

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:57.190
Is Futaba doing a good job at work?

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.400
Why don't you ask her yourself?

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.660
I don't want her to hate me
for asking strange questions.

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:07.790
In a weird way, you're kind of a sissy!

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:12.870
She's doing a fine job. She's also pretty
headstrong, like <i>somebody </i>here.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:19.920
We were just about to go get
something to eat. Come join us.

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:24.430
W-Well, I'll be...

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:26.720
Hey, stop it!

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:30.640
What's a little kid like you doing
wearing a business suit?

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.390
Wh...

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:36.230
Wait, don't tell me you're actually a
businesswoman. That's hysterical!

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:38.530
Seriously?

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:40.690
Hey now, don't cry.

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:43.820
It makes it look like we're
doing something mean.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:49.040
Come on, stop crying.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.540
There's a good girl...

00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:00.170
Hey, who said you could touch her?

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:05.680
What's this? Daddy's come to the rescue?

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.390
He's just acting tough
in front of his kid.

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:14.730
Hey.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:20.480
You guys got it all wrong.

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:26.780
<i>Grandpa's </i>come to the rescue, <i>punks</i>!

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:34.370
I'm sorry!

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:38.340
Please, don't apologize. I wasn't hurt.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:41.630
My granddaughter's got a heart of gold...

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:44.630
What are you doing here, Grandpa?

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:50.060
Even though we were here, we couldn't
shield you from that awful experience...

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:53.270
I said, "What are you
doing here, Grandpa?"

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:57.440
Futaba, you must've been scared...

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:04.570
Whenever you feel like crying,
you can cry in Grandpa's arms anytime!

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:11.530
Well, what can you do, I guess.

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:16.750
All right, let's go get something to eat.
You too, Gramps.

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:19.500
Grandpa, what do you want to have?

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:21.170
Futaba...

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:59.520
