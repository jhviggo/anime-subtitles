Oh!

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.940
"School Sports Day"

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.990
"School Sports Day"
We did it! Yay!

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.570
"School Sports Day"

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.630
"Episode 7:
Here and Now"

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.090
Thanks for helping Yuto the other day.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.510
No problem.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.220
He's always getting lost.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.390
Hey! Don't say that!

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.850
And thank you, too, Natsumi-<i>chan</i>.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.310
No prob.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.610
Thank you both so much!

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:17.900
No worries.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.610
Thank you for waiting.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.830
This looks <i>so </i>good!

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.920
This is so yummy my cheeks'll fall off.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:39.670
Hey, what are you--?

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:40.800
Well...

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.090
I'm just trying to keep them
from falling off.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.010
I didn't mean it literally.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.970
No fair! I'd like to touch them, too!

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.640
Quit it!

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.520
You two are pretty close, huh?

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.440
Well, we've been friends
since junior high, so...

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.610
Really?

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.780
I had the worst first
impression of her, though.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.860
You did?

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.030
Yeah, I did!

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.370
I'd love to hear more about it.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.580
Ahem! It was a spring I'll never forget.
My first year in junior high.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.380
What should I do?

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.880
It's bouncing all over the place...

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.050
I can't be late on my first day
at a new school! I just can't!

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.260
What am I supposed to do?

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.770
S-Sorry.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.940
She looks kind of scary.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.400
But she's wearing my school's uniform.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.030
All right, I guess I'll just follow her.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.790
Hey! Wait!

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.000
Why are you running away?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.170
Wait!

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.770
You're too fast!

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.400
Why are you following me?

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.280
I got lost... Can I follow you?

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.370
Fine. Whatever.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.000
She doesn't seem like a bad person...

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.550
She's got a nice figure...

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.970
...and she's pretty, too.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.050
Compared to her, I'm...

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.470
Hey, how old are you?

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.810
I-I'm... 13.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.230
No way... You're older than me?!

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:59.310
What?

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.650
Oh, we're both in the same grade. You're
so short that I thought you were younger.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.950
I may be... short, but...

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.740
Don't judge people by the way they look!

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.410
Okay, I'm sorry...

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:19.460
But I think I would've noticed someone as
short as you at the entrance ceremony...

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.750
Well, I transferred here today.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.460
Oh. So, that's why you got lost.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:31.390
Well, I didn't know what to do at first,
but you've been so kind to me. Thanks.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.930
I've got a name, you know.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:39.060
It's Natsumi. Kurobe Natsumi.
What's yours?

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.940
Igarashi Futaba... N-Nice to meet you...

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.940
Yeah, nice to meet you, too.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.490
She's cute when she smiles.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.740
We're here.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.460
This is a video arcade.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:01.460
Yep.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.830
What about school?

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.920
I never said I was going there.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.420
I'm ditching today. See ya!

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.760
Really?

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.350
Because of her, I was way late
for the first day at my new school!

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.400
Yeah... I kind of remember
something like that happen--

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.270
Because it <i>did </i>happen!

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:31.110
You two really <i>are </i>close.

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:35.660
Ahem! Well... yeah, I guess.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.910
Was she always this adorable?

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:39.250
You bet she was!

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.750
Hey, I'm sitting within earshot, you know!

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.460
What are you doing?

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:50.550
Oh, hey!

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:53.930
You know about this month's blossom
viewing party? This is who's doing what.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:57.350
Oh, right. It's that time
of year already, huh?

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.430
I'm taking care of saving a spot.

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:02.480
I can do that.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.610
This is the kind of thing you
should let your <i>kouhai </i>handle.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:09.360
Oh. Okay then, let's both do it!

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:14.200
Well, if you're okay with that, then...

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:14.700
"Staff Whereabouts"

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.620
"Staff Whereabouts"
Takeda-<i>kun</i>, could you
come here for a second?

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:18.660
"Staff Whereabouts"
Sure.

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:33.050
"Takeda & Igarashi"

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:56.530
I'm so exhausted...

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:59.240
Yuto-<i>kun</i>?

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.450
Kurobe-<i>san</i>!

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.330
Small world, huh?
You always been a runner?

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.460
Long-distance running, huh?
That brings back memories.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.590
Yes... We keep track
of our times in pairs.

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:17.930
But I'm the only guy
paired up with a girl, so...

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.890
You don't want to look uncool, huh?

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:32.150
Kurobe-<i>san</i>, why must you
talk while we're running?

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.940
Sorry, I was doing it on purpose.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.280
"Take Your Garbage With You"

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.110
How come you have so much stamina?

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.910
Because I did track and field.

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:47.420
Wow, that's awesome!
I'm no good at exercising...

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.460
Still, you keep at it,
and that's commendable.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:56.630
Me? I just...

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.930
...like to run.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.730
Isn't there something you like, Yuto-<i>kun</i>?

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:10.860
I-I like basketball,

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.440
but people are shocked by how bad I am...

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.690
What about joining the basketball club?

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:20.120
I'd like to, but... I'm sure
I'd just get in the way...

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:23.620
But you like it, right?

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.120
Give it a shot, then.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:28.790
I think you should do it while you can,
so you won't regret it later on.

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:32.460
Your life as a student is over
before you know it.

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:46.980
School clubs...

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.940
Turn in your club application before
you leave school today. All right?

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:55.980
All right.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.860
"Club Application"

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:02.530
Hey, that's bad manners!

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.950
What club are you joining?

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:10.830
Me? I'm going to join...

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:15.420
...the art club! I like to draw.

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:18.550
Really?

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:20.930
What about you, Natsumi-<i>chan</i>?
Track and field?

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.800
What? You're kidding. Why would I?

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:29.100
Because you're such a fast runner...
Don't you like to run?

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.020
It's not that...

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.440
It's just...

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.860
...I hate competitions.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:46.450
But you like to run, right?

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:50.080
Then, why don't you just run
for your own sake?

00:11:54.830 --> 00:12:00.470
Igarashi, right? Well, I'll just pick
any old club and go to the arcade.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.640
You're not supposed to
ditch school, you know.

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:10.680
Pretty magnificent, huh?

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.850
They sure are.

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:18.530
But two weeks from now, all the
cherries'll have fresh green leaves.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:19.820
Something wrong with that?

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:25.120
Well... don't you think
green's plainer than pink?

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:29.580
Really? I think green's a pretty color.

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:32.290
Green's... pretty?

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:36.840
R-Really? W-Well,
it's my natural hair color,

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:41.970
so I try to keep it looking
sort of good, I guess...

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.550
I was talking about the cherry trees.

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:45.140
Huh?!

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.220
Oh... right...

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:54.270
Well to be honest, I don't know much
about beauty or anything, but...

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:56.940
...I like your hair.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.150
It smells nice, too.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.860
Y-You pervert!

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:05.820
What?!

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:09.030
Have you always been sniffing me?

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:12.040
No! When you work with someone
as close as we have,

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.460
you smell them even if you don't mean to!

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:31.390
Tonight everyone's good conduct has been
rewarded with the cherries in full bloom.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:35.140
Let's all let our hair down
and have a good time.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.270
Cheers, everyone!

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:39.900
Cheers!

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.070
Please try some, if you like.

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:45.700
Those look good.
Did you make them yourself?

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:49.030
Yes, but I'm not sure you'll like them...

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:57.750
Mmm. You're a good cook, Igarashi-<i>san</i>.

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:02.000
Oh, not really. Well, there's plenty more,
so please feel free.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.420
Beer tastes great outdoors, huh?

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:05.840
It sure does.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.970
Ta-da! There's lots of other stuff, too.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:10.390
Oh, wow!

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:12.100
Ooishi, come drink with us!

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.640
I'm fine, really.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.930
Oh, come on now, let's party tonight!

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:16.810
Do I have to?

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:19.520
Hey, don't force it on him now.

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:23.020
Here you go.

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:25.400
Thanks. This looks <i>so </i>good.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.400
Yeah.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.660
Got enough beer?
Here, let me pour you some.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.280
Oh... thanks.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.750
Shall I guess the way you look right now?

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.080
No, that's okay.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:48.130
♬ A lover's ploy, the theater of dreams
I cannot forget a single line ♬

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:49.340
Hey, Chief!

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:50.090
Huh?

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:52.430
Whas'sat shong yer shingin'?

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:58.560
Can't ya shing it widda little more shoul?

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:02.110
Ooishi-<i>kun</i>, you sure do act
different when you're drunk.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:07.740
Hey, lisshen! A shong's gotta
have shoul. Ya hear me? Shoul!

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:08.610
Well, now.

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:10.280
What are you doing, stupid?

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.830
Hey, stay outta dis!
Da fun's juss about ta start.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:16.240
I'm so, so sorry!

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.830
Was Ooishi-<i>san </i>always like that?

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:21.460
I heard he was in the pop music club
when he was a student.

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:23.000
Oh...

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.460
What club were you in, Igarashi?

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.050
I was in the art club.

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:30.880
Oh, I remember that bear you drew me.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.970
I liked it. It had character.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:35.430
Hey now, don't flatter me!

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:37.220
I didn't say it to be polite.

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:41.270
You like to draw, right?
Then, be confident.

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:45.360
I think that being passionate
about something is a fine gift.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:50.950
A friend once said
something similar to me.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.240
We've been friends since we were kids.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.950
Now we both live here in Tokyo,
and we often hang out.

00:15:56.950 --> 00:16:01.160
Oh, is she the one in that picture
you've got in your room?

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.500
Picture? How do you know about that?

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.380
I went to your place when you were sick
in bed, remember? That's how--

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:08.880
Shush!

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:13.720
The girl in the picture's name is Natsumi.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:17.680
It's because of her
that I still like to draw.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.600
Did something happen?

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.020
Oh, this and that.

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:26.560
Oh, come on, tell me the story.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.530
Well, if you insist...

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:31.650
Hey, look.

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:32.780
Huh?

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:34.990
Hey, Igarashi!

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:37.120
Wh-What?

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.700
Whatcha drawing?

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.000
Come on, show us!

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.580
Uh, well... that's...

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:46.960
What <i>is </i>this?

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:47.960
It's a bear.

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.210
What?

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:56.010
You're kidding, right?
It looks more like a pig!

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:59.310
Are you done now? Give it back.

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:02.980
Hey, I've got it! Why don't cha
let us draw something?

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.270
Huh?

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.940
G-Give it back! That notebook's
really important to me!

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:12.900
Hey now, don't get all serious on us...

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:13.950
Please!

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:17.120
All we wanna do is draw a picture, too.

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:22.580
Hey... you're gonna cry now?!

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.540
Wh-What was that?

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:32.090
That's the girl who's always tardy...

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:33.590
This is <i>not </i>good.

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:35.630
Somebody go get the teacher.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.470
Igarashi.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.470
This is important to you, right?

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:46.940
Stop giving her a hard time.

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:50.980
"Club Application"

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:54.490
Oh, man, you can't be serious!

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:56.950
Hey, I think you'd better stop...

00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:01.490
Igarashi, you're joining the art club
even though your drawing stinks?!

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.090
Is he all right?

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:16.800
Shut your big, fat mouth...

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:20.760
Igarashi can join the art club.
So what if her drawing stinks?

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.850
She's doing it because she likes to draw.

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.240
What's this?

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.070
Just what do you guys think you're doing?

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:47.500
I hope Natsumi-<i>chan</i>'s okay...

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.750
Igarashi.

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:52.960
Wh... What?

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:57.340
At first, all we wanted to do was
give you a bit of a hard time...

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:01.760
But we didn't realize your notebook
was important enough to cry about...

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:05.350
Anyhow, we're joining the baseball club.

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:08.560
Because we like baseball, you know?

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.730
But we both still kind of suck at it...

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:18.950
So... when Kurobe punched me,
I realized what I said was pretty mean.

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:22.160
I'm really sorry for getting so worked up
and saying all those mean things.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.490
Me, too.

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.080
Natsumi-<i>chan</i>!

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.830
Are you all right?

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:39.050
You should be worried about those boys.
They told the teacher what happened.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:42.090
But actually, I was the one
who knocked the chair over...

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:45.100
...and the one who started the fight...

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.850
Don't go punching anyone else, okay?

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:50.850
Well, I'm glad you're all right, Igarashi.

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:58.360
Natsumi-<i>chan</i>, if it's okay with you,
I'd like you to call me Futaba.

00:19:58.360 --> 00:19:59.570
What?

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:00.820
Is that a no?

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:03.110
Well... okay, I guess.

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:08.240
Then, you can just call me
Natsumi without the "-<i>chan</i>."

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.870
Got it!

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:13.330
--Natsumi!
--Futaba!

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:19.630
Okay, I'm going home now.

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:22.090
Hey, wait a sec!

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:25.300
Um... If you don't want to, it's okay,

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:29.220
but will you join the art club with me?

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:33.140
I thought it'd be more fun,
if you were there too, Natsumi...

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:38.690
Sorry, Futaba. I just finished
turning in my club application.

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:40.570
Which one did you choose?

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:41.900
Track and field.

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:44.950
But why...?

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:48.700
Because I like to run.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:53.920
Natsumi...

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:58.210
...taught me to have the courage
to do what I liked.

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:02.300
When I was feeling anxious
about coming to Tokyo by myself,

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.720
I remembered what she said to me that day.

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:09.970
Natsumi's such a great gal.

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:16.350
Hey, could you draw me
something else sometime?

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:22.740
I don't know much about art,
but... I like your pictures.

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.610
Okay, I will.

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:26.820
Love and...

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:27.950
Shoul!

--Come on! Knock it off!
--Shoul!

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:33.460

with us the other day.

Yeah, it's close to work.

Oh, it looks like Yuto-<i>kun</i>'s trying
really hard at long-distance running.

How'd you know?

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:37.080
But lately he's been
running in the morning,

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.210
and it appears he's joined
the basketball club.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.880
Does he look like he's enjoying it?

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:48.590
Yeah! He told me it's pretty hard
but also a lot of fun.

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:54.350
That's nice. Tell him I'm
cheering for him, okay?
