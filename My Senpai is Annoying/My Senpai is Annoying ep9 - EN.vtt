WEBVTT

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.430
Okay, we're here!

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.770
The beach!

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.690
We're going to have a blast!

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.230
Yeah!

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.480
Now hold on a minute!

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.070
--What's your problem?
--Got to go potty?

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.780
No! Why are all of you here
like it's totally normal?!

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.320
You see, today...

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.830
Futaba-<i>chan</i>, would you like to spend
the night at the beach this weekend?

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.000
The beach?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.790
I'm planning on going with my brother.
Would you like to join us?

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:47.920
Are you sure it's all right?

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.670
Yeah. It'll be more fun if more people
come, so please invite your friends.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.760
Okay!

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.470
It was supposed to be just Sakurai-<i>san</i>,
her brother, and me...

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.180
I invited them.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.560
You should have told me.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.850
I wanted to surprise you.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.730
Well, you <i>did </i>surprise me, but...

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.610
Hey, don't be such a drag.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.650
We came all the way out to the beach.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.610
Wouldn't it be more fun if
all of us hung out together?

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.570
You must be Takeda-<i>san</i>.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.450
I'm Kurobe Natsumi. I've been friends
with Futaba since junior high.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.460
You're Kurobe Natsumi?
I've been wanting to meet you.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.920
Futaba's always talking about you.
I've been wanting to meet you, too.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.500
Now hold on, Natsumi!

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.470
Well, let's go get changed.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.650
"Episode 9:
A Light-Hearted Summer Vacation"

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.740
Set that up there.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.410
Okay.

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.040
Oh, let me help you.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.540
Thanks.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.040
Thank you for always
being so kind to my sister.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.800
Oh. Well, it's my pleasure.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.090
They're so alike.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.640
Hey guys!

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.520
Oh, you're quite an eyeful!

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.650
Hey, where's Igarashi-<i>chan</i>?

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.610
She's right here.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.990
Oh, you're so cute!

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.200
Ow! Hey! Ouch! Come on, that hurts!

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.420
Kazama-<i>kun</i>, let's go for a swim!

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.590
I've got some, too, you know.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.520
It's the ocean!

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.520
Shall we go?

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.570
Okay!

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.360
It's the ocean!

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.570
Hey now, no horsing around!

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:44.570
Hurry up!

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.240
Wait!

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.030
Still want to go?

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.290
Sure, why not?

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.800
Here goes!

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.770
Are you all right?

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.230
Sorry!

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.100
I-I'm okay.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.770
Nice serve!

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.480
I've played a bit of volleyball before.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.950
Hey, Senpai︎!

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.910
We're a long way from the shore!

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.870
Oh, you're right.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.170
Please don't look at me so much!

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.920
What's there to look at?

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.130
Ouch!

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.590
You men are all the same.
You just like big boobs.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.180
Of course we do!

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.600
But you know what, Igarashi?

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:03.530
You're a very competitive, considerate,
hard-working, and kind person.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.280
It's those inner qualities
that I like about you...

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.080
...way more than your chest
or how you look.

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.830
Whoa! What are you doing?

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.340
Hey--! Come on--! Knock it off--!

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.380
Boo!

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:34.430
Qu-Quit it! You know I can't swim!

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.640
You <i>are </i>in the water,
so why don't you try practicing?

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.640
Huh?

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.890
Hey, that's a great idea!

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.730
Swimming feels nice, you know.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.280
I'll teach you how.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.490
All right... Would you?

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.330
Okay, here we go!

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.250
Oh, looking good!

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.260
Okay, now stick your head in the water!

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.380
Huh?!

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.930
Don't worry, I've got you.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.870
Whoa!

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:37.700
Great job!

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.000
Hi-yah!

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.090
Aw!

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:49.090
Close, but no cigar!

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:56.050
Aw, that's too bad.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:06.820
I kind of thought this would happen...
There's nothing left to eat...

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.320
This is so pretty!

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.490
Why don't you take it as a souvenir?

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:21.200
Yeah, I should.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.080
Hey!

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.170
It's time to get going!

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:27.130
Oh, okay!

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.090
"Shiraito Inn"

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:31.920
"Shiraito Inn"
Thank you for having us!

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.890
We've been expecting you.
Please, do come in.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.220
Man, I'm starving!

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:41.060
Dinner will be ready shortly.

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.600
O-Okay, thanks.

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:47.900
Whoa!

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.150
This looks really good.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:53.610
Please, take your time.

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:55.660
Thank you for the meal!

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.250
That was fast.

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:10.090
I was starving, that's why.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:12.550
Senpai, I'll refill your bowl for you.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:13.380
Hmm?

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.010
There's a tub of rice here.

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:17.390
Oh, thanks.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.470
No problem.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.180
Here you go. Because I know
they're your favorite, Yuto.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:26.940
Oh, so you like those.
Then, I'll give you mine, too.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.810
Th-Thank you.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:34.190
You're blushing.

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:38.370
Oh, they're so supple.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:42.830
I know! Yuto's cheeks are really supple.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.370
Sis!

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:49.880
I love the way it feels.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.880
H... Hey!

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.090
Hey! Yuto-<i>kun </i>doesn't like you doing that!

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:56.880
Really?

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:01.140
Yuto-<i>kun</i>, do you hate it
when I touch your cheeks?

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:05.270
Um... uh... well... I...

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:06.480
Natsumi!

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.610
Okay, I'm sorry. He's just so cute.
I couldn't help myself.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.190
Here you go.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:15.940
Th... Thank you.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.990
Thanks, Kazama-<i>kun</i>.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:26.660
No problem.

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:30.540
Since this inn is by the sea,
the fish here is excellent.

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:33.630
This simmered fish tastes really good.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.760
Futaba, you make an excellent
simmered fish, too, you know.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.430
You're a good cook,
aren't you, Futaba-<i>chan</i>?

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:45.970
Yeah, Igarashi makes
some really good food.

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:48.640
Takeda-<i>san</i>, you've tried her cooking?

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.600
Yeah. Some hamburger steak the other d--

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.900
Yuto-<i>kun</i>, you can have mine, too!

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:58.570
Go on, eat it!

00:10:58.570 --> 00:10:59.820
U-Uh...

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:03.740
Oh, then you can have mine, too!

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.370
Uhh...

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.750
Man, I'm stuffed!

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:12.210
I've had my fill.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.380
My stomach hurts...

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.380
What should we do after this?

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.380
Oh, I've got just the thing.

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:28.310
I haven't played with fireworks in years!

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:31.520
I do it every year with my grandpa.

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:36.190
He looks like someone who loves fireworks.

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:38.990
He loves launching skyrockets.

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:43.740
Here it is! Let's set this one off next.

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:45.780
"Roaring Thunder Legend: One Shot"

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:45.780
Here it is! Let's set this one off next.

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:47.790
"Roaring Thunder Legend: One Shot"

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:47.790
That's a great idea!

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.290
Here goes!

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:22.860
Why is it following me?! Keep away!

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.370
You're a real scaredy-cat, Igarashi.

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:31.540
See? I put it out.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:42.760
Aw...

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:45.180
Huh?!

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.800
Kurobe-<i>san</i>...

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.520
Here, have another go at it.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.140
What's the matter? You look kind of down.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.230
No, it's nothing really...

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:58.110
It's okay. Talk to me.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:13:02.860
Actually, there's this girl who
has the same hobby as me.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:03.860
Uh-huh.

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:07.490
We went shopping together
to buy what we were looking for.

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:11.330
And we ran into some people
from school there.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:12.660
Really?

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:18.340
And the people there
gave us a hard time...

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.250
I see.

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:24.840
Is it weird for a boy
and girl to be friends?

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:29.260
Well, I don't think so.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:35.480
If you enjoy being with them,
then I think that's fine.

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:39.860
But you really can't tell how your
relationship with someone will change.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:42.860
It all depends on the circumstances.

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:44.320
But who knows?

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:48.740
The person you thought of as a friend
might turn into the one you love.

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:53.830
Aw...

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:58.210
D-Don't you start making fun
of me, too, Kurobe-<i>san</i>!

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.670
Okay, I'm sorry.

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:04.130
All right, let's head on back.

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:05.720
All right!

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:12.060
This'll test your courage a little.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.100
You're right. It's pitch black.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:29.570
I'm sorry...

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:33.740
That's okay...

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:39.080
If you're scared... Here, take my hand.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:43.040
Wh-What are you talking about?
I'm not a kid, you know!

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:53.760
Oh, it's just a cicada.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.730
Kazama-<i>kun</i>?!

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.740
Guess it's time to call it a night.

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.450
Yeah, you're right.

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:16.700
Okay, then.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.250
Good night.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:19.250
All right.

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:20.670
Night.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.130
Hey, Futaba.

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:28.510
What?

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:30.970
How are things going with Takeda-<i>senpai</i>?

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:34.300
Huh?! Wh-What are you talking about?

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.890
You guys were pretty close today.

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:39.850
N-No, we weren't.

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:42.060
Are they pretty close at work, too?

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:49.360
Yeah, really close. They always go out to
make sales calls and eat lunch together.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.950
Oh, really...

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:56.580
I'm going to bed now! Good night!

00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:00.080
Hey, Futaba!

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.330
Oh, you're no fun...

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.290
What about you, Sakurai-<i>san</i>?

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:06.130
What?

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.840
Fried shrimp...

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.260
--I can't eat any more fried shrimp...

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.260
--Is there somebody you like?
--I can't eat any more fried shrimp...

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:23.480
Well... I'm not sure...

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.360
I can't sleep...

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:34.200
Good morning, Takeda-<i>san</i>.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.240
Oh, morning.

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:39.830
It's a beautiful day today.

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:41.120
Yeah.

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:49.000
Oh, good morning.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.460
Morning.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:53.470
Kazama-<i>san</i>, you look sleepy.

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:54.430
Yeah...

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:57.850
Really? Did that happen?

00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:59.220
Yeah.

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.430
Those voices...

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:04.390
--It's Takeda-<i>san </i>and Sakurai.
--They kept bugging me
to drink maté tea...

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:07.770
--That's not a pairing you see every day.
--They kept bugging me
to drink maté tea...

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:12.320
And Kazama-<i>kun </i>protected me from them.

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.070
Wow.

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:17.700
Sakurai.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.700
Seems you and Kazama are pretty close.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:23.250
What?

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:25.870
You think so?

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.050
But it seems you and Futaba-<i>chan</i>
are awfully close, too, Takeda-<i>san</i>.

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:41.810
Of course we are!
Igarashi's my trusty <i>kouhai</i>!

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:46.230
Huh?

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:52.110
Let's have a blast until
it's time to go home!

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:53.820
Yeah!

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:02.910
Are you glad you're not riding that?

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:06.370
Yeah, I didn't sleep well last night...

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:07.870
Oh...

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.420
Let's go buy something to drink.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.840
I'm going to buy this to start with.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:23.600
Thanks. I'll pay you back later.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.100
I'm going to buy something frozen.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.730
Which should I get?

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:32.320
Oh!

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:43.490
Seeing that brings back memories.

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:45.410
You want some, too, Kazama-<i>kun</i>?

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:48.080
Yeah, thanks.

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.630
Okay, here you go.

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:54.750
Huh?

00:18:56.670 --> 00:19:00.140
Well, on second thought, that's okay...

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:05.930
Sorry, sorry.

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:10.690
Here you go, Kazama-<i>kun</i>.

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:12.520
I'll give you the other one.

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:21.530
"Shaved Ice" "Fried Noodles"

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.620
Guess they wore themselves out
from having so much fun.

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:31.120
Probably.

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:36.840
They're both sleeping like children.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:40.380
I'm glad.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:41.340
Huh?

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:45.390
Glad that everyone at
Futaba's office is so nice.

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:47.970
Natsumi-<i>chan</i>...

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:50.810
It looks like Futaba's enjoying herself,
and that makes me happy.

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:53.560
Let's hang out again, Natsumi-<i>chan</i>.

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.770
Definitely! And Yuto-<i>kun</i>, too.

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:57.610
O-Okay!

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:11.210
Guess they wore themselves out
from having so much fun.

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.380
Yeah.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.170
We really whooped it up, huh.

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:16.710
Yes, we did.

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:22.220
You were right, Senpai.

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:24.930
All of us hanging out
together was more fun.

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:26.050
Yeah.

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:30.680
Summer's almost over...

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:41.650
Takeda-<i>senpai</i>?

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:43.110
Yeah?

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:45.530
U-Um...

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:46.830
What is it?

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:53.040
Will you hang out with me
again next summer?

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.540
Tomorrow's okay, too, you know.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:00.090
That's not what I meant!

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.140
Good morning.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.510
Morning.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:12.770
What's the matter?

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:15.900
Oh... it's nothing really.

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:29.700
Wow.

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.330
You're really tan!

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:38.420
That's why I didn't want you to look...

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:41.590
Why? It's nothing to worry about.

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:43.720
No photos, please!︎

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.640
But what happened? Did you forget
to put on sunscreen yesterday?

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:52.470
I always spend this time of year
at Grandpa's house, so...

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:55.850
I never worried about getting tan.

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:58.610
Oh, I was so careless...

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:03.400
Why am I the only one who got so tan?

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:08.030
A-Anyway, I didn't ask for this.

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:09.660
No photos!

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:11.740
Hey, morning!

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:15.580
T-Takeda-<i>senpai</i>, this is...

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:22.500
Igarashi, you've got such a dark tan!
