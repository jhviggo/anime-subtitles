Thank you for this food I'm about to eat!

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.980
Let's go to work!

Good morning, Sakurai-<i>san</i>!

wish mine were bigger...

Hmm?

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.230
N-No, it's nothing...

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.190
Hey, your eyes look a little bloodshot.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.240
I stayed up late last night thinking
about today's presentation.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.330
You did?

Good morning, Chief!

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.150
Morning. Igarashi-<i>chan</i>, you're always
so chipper. What a fine attitude!

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.990
Yo, Igarashi!

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:32.750
T-Takeda-<i>senpai</i>?! You scared me half
to death! Your voice is much too loud!

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.130
I wanted to give as hearty
a greeting as you do, Igarashi.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.840
What are you doing competing
with your <i>kouhai</i>?!

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.860
Senpai, would you please check
these presentation documents?

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.360
Sure!

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.360
Takeda-<i>senpai </i>has a big voice...

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.490
...and a body to match.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.740
Looks great! Well done!

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.460
Don't tousle my hair!
I'm a full-grown adult, you know?

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.840
It's not funny!

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.340
My bad, my bad.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.390
You did such a great job on
those presentation documents.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.020

and a little... annoying.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.360
Honestly...

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.360
He's so quick to tousle my hair
and treat me like a kid.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.660
But...

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.790

Don't sneak up behind me like that!

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.170
Sorry about that. You having coffee?

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:08.970
Yes. It's what adults drink
in the morning.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.390
It's bitter, so I add
a little extra sugar.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:15.890
I see.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.980
Would you like some, too?

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:24.070
No thanks. What I drink
in the morning... is this.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:34.040
H-Hold on there, Tsukishiro-<i>san</i>!
You shouldn't be drinking vodka at work.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.250
It may be in a vodka bottle,
but it's actually water.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.010
See you later.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.100
She certainly is strange...

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.770
All right. I'm going out
to make some sales calls.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.730
I'm going, too!

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.530
Be careful out there!

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.500
Hey, Senpai, aren't you
walking a little slowly?

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.960
You think so?

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.140
I keep telling you that you don't have
to adjust your pace to match mine.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.760
I'm not.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.230
What's wrong with walking
a little slowly, anyway?

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:47.070
In sales, speed is of the essence.
Now pick up the pace!

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.700
All right.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:28.110
Are you going to get something to drink?

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:32.410
No, I was just thinking that
it doesn't have <i>oshiruko</i>.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:36.660
Not all vending machines have it.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.410
I see.

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:43.330
Why don't we get ourselves some lunch?
Igarashi, what are you in the mood for?

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:48.710
We're always going to
the places I want to eat at.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:52.220
Let's go somewhere you
want to eat at for a change.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.800
I'm fine with whatever!

00:07:53.800 --> 00:08:00.020
People who say that are the worst.
Okay, how about...

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.690
Hi, can I take your order?

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:05.190
I'll have five Jaja King Burgers
and three orders of fries.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:07.020
Anything else?

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:08.730
Igarashi?

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.030
"Ends Today!!"

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:18.200
What's this? I love how you can't tell
where it's looking. It's so adorable...

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:23.540
But I can't order a Lucky Meal.
I'm with Takeda-<i>senpai </i>right now...

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.920
All right, one Lucky Meal.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.670
And give her one of those dolls.
It looks like she wants one.

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:33.800
Coming right up!

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:44.440
Don't laugh so much!

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.730
Sorry, sorry. You okay?

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.570
Of course I am.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:53.360
I thought this might happen,
so I spread a handkerchief on my lap.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:59.280
I'm in my second year at the company,
so I know how to manage a crisis!

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.080
Really?

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.710
Igarashi, do you want
to give today's presentation?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.250
You prepared the documents,
so you know what's in them.

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:11.760
If you feel like giving it--

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.220
I do! Please, let me handle it!

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:17.680
Okay, it's in your hands now.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:23.140
It's my second year working for the
company, and now the day has finally come!

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.060
If I give this presentation,
and it leads to a contract,

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:30.520
then I'll be a full-fledged salesperson!

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.150
I'll show them I can do this!

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:46.290
Uh-oh... I'm starting to get nervous...

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:49.880
Wh-Wh-What should I do?

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:54.170
Thank you for taking the time
to meet with us today.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:59.800
We at Itomaki Trading present this
proposal with our utmost confidence.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.810
We hope you will give it
your consideration.

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:05.560
Break a leg.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:13.730
All right, then. Please allow me,
Igarashi, to present our proposal to you.

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:19.740
Yes! It's over!

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.280
You did great back there!

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.040
Excellent work!

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:30.330
I. Told. You. Not to tousle my hair!

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.840
But your hair is so easy to tousle.

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.090
You've got some grip!

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.970
Hey, get a load of those two!

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.980
What are you doing?

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.900
W-Wait, Kazama-<i>san</i>?
What are you doing here?

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.520
You done making your rounds?

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.360
Yes, I'm just about to
head back to the office.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.780
Okay, let's go together, then.

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.320
Oh, really?

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.540
Yeah, I hear their food's pretty good.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.830
Maybe I should go there sometime.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:18.550
Why am I not surprised? She's been
working so hard on not enough sleep.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.140
She's chewing on her hair.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.060
She's sound asleep.

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:31.230
Do you want me to wake her?

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:34.980
No, that's okay.
Let's let her get some rest.

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:39.900
Takeda-<i>san</i>, may I?

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.540
"Takeda & Igarashi: Sales Calls""

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.170
Oh, Igarashi-<i>san</i>'s back.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.380
That's so adorable!

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.250
Isn't it?

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:57.130
Look who's back!

00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:58.550
Sakurai-<i>san</i>.

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:01.050
Did you have a nice nap,
Futaba the kitten?

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:01.880
"The kitten"?

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.680
This is just too cute!

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:08.140
Wh-What's that?!

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.270
"Igarashi-<i>chan</i>'s asleep."
"Oh, how adorable!"

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:17.820
Kazama-<i>san</i>, do you have any last words?

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:19.440
C-Calm down, Igarashi--

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.190
Divine wrath!

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:30.830
I gave the presentation all by myself,
so now I'm a full-fledged salesperson.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.040
"Da-ding!"

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.420
"Grandpa: How are you?"

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.920
"Great. Today I climbed up a step
on the stairs of adulthood."

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.180
"Stairs of adulthood!?"
"What happened!?"
"Who's the bastard!"

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.930
"What happened!?"
"Who's the bastard!"
"I mean, the lucky guy?"
"Can I call you?"

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:55.350
What are you going on about, Grandpa?
Oh, who cares?

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:57.810
I'm going to take a bath.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:06.530
Maki Textiles called and said they
received the wrong number of items.

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:09.240
They suspect it was
a miscommunication on our end.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.870
That can't be!

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:16.670
I'm sure I placed the order with the
manufacturer following their instructions.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:21.460
What's the matter?

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:25.880
The numbers in the purchase order
are off a line.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.600
Takeda-<i>kun</i>, did you check this?

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.760
No, I...

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.680
I placed the order
without checking it with him.

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.100
I thought I had to hurry...

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:39.480
You must always check these things.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:43.230
I'm sorry! This happened
because of my negligence!

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.740
--Yeah, and then...
--Okay, would you take care
of that for me?

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:56.920
Senpai, I'm so sor--

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:01.840
I'm not the one
you should be apologizing to.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.210
We're going to see the client!

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.010
O-Okay!

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:10.680
Please accept our apologies!

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:15.980
Please... Please accept
our sincerest apologies!

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.270
It's all my fault...

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:24.440
What's wrong with Futaba-<i>chan</i>?

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:27.450
I heard she had some
trouble with a client.

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:32.200
Futaba-<i>chan</i>, are you all right?

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:36.080
I'm fine. Sorry if I made you worry.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:43.920
I think I'll have some <i>oshiruko</i>.

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:49.050
It's sold out...

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.360
Oh, there you are!

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.400
Senpai...

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.860
Igarashi, catch!

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:12.570
<i>Oshiruko</i>?

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:14.330
Don't worry too much.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:38.020
It's so sweet.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.140
I'm taking off now!

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.600
See you tomorrow!

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.520
Futaba-<i>chan</i>?

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:47.320
Why don't we go out and have a little fun?

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.030
You deserve a break.

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:51.450
But...

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.370
Go with her.

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:56.580
Breaks are important, you know?

00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:59.450
How about we go to an arcade?

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:06.420
That's a great idea! The more the
merrier... Let's go, Futaba-<i>chan</i>!

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.760
Okay. Thanks for inviting me.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.590
Thanks for inviting me out tonight.

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:16.430
No problem. See you tomorrow!

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:17.600
See you!

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.890
Okay, good night.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:32.450
I made them worry...

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:36.990
H-Hold on! Where's my commuter pass?

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:40.910
Oh, I left it at the office.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:51.420
I-I'm not scared... I'm not
scared because I'm an adult...

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.600
Hey...

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:09.820
This is the first time I've ever seen
Takeda-<i>senpai </i>asleep at his desk.

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:15.490
This is the purchase order I messed up...

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:24.330
Why... Why are you being
so nice to a <i>kouhai </i>like me?

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:36.930
I fell asleep.

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:41.770
"Green Tea"
"You're working too hard.'"

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.980
"Green Tea"
"You're working too hard.'"
Igarashi was here?

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:50.770
I left the purchase order out
on my desk. She must've seen it.

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:51.650
Huh?

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:55.150
"Thanks. I'll buy you a bowl of udon."

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:00.450
Hello. This is Itomaki Trading.

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:04.370
Yes... Yes, hold on...

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:09.170
Senpai! How's this estimate?

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:10.540
Yes... I see...

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:15.340
I'm glad. It's better when
Futaba-<i>chan</i>'s her chipper self.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.300
Yeah, you're right.

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.320
"Sweet <i>Oshiruko</i>"

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.780
Please look it over once more!

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:43.030
Isn't this a great idea?

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:45.080
Not only did you rectify the error,

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:49.000
you proposed a new sales plan.
We really appreciate that.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.830
Let's proceed with this.

00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:58.760
Thank you so much!

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:04.260
The client was really pleased.

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.270
Isn't that great?

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:11.560
Igarashi?

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:17.440
I-I'm so sorry for all
the trouble I caused!

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:21.820
I still have a long way to go before
I'll be a full-fledged salesperson.

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:24.830
Relax. Don't worry about it.

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:27.750
You made up for your mistake, didn't you?

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:31.420
You did a great job.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:38.260
It's not fair of you to say that now.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.930
Let me buy you a bowl of udon.

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:43.720
While I like a good bowl of udon...

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:48.600
...nothing beats raising our glasses
in a toast to a job well-done!

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:53.310
Tonight I'm buying! Igarashi,
order whatever you feel like!

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:57.730
No! I was the one who got us into trouble.

00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:00.490
I can't let you treat me to this, Senpai.

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:04.570
But in the end, we got the contract,
so does it really make a difference?

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:06.870
Yes, it does!

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:10.370
You're my <i>kouhai</i>, so let me treat you.

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:14.040
What'll you have?

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.170
For starters...

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:16.460
We'll have some beer!

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:22.010
That hit the spot!

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:25.640
Honeshtly! I can't believe I made
shuch a shimple mishtake.

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.970
I'm sho dishappointed in me.

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:35.860
Hey, Shenpai! It'sh not fun--
Aw, go ahead and laugh!

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:39.690
Chew me out for making
shuch a stupid mishtake...

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:43.150
...in spite of having two yearsh
of shales experience!

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:46.780
I'm not going to chew you out.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:51.120
Messing up may have got you down,
but you worked hard and followed through.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.790
You'll make a good salesperson.

00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:01.460
What? Why...

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:06.220
Why are you being
so nice to a <i>kouhai </i>like me?

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:08.260
Shenpai!

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:13.560
Sh-Shenpai...

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:23.030
Shenpai, you must really like me!

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:27.030
Yeah, of course I like you.

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:29.280
Huh?

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:36.040
If I had a wife and kid,
I'd want that kid to be like you.

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:41.380
What'sh that shupposed to mean?

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:50.850
Sorry, sorry. For some reason
I feel like looking after you.

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:54.640
...fe?

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.060
What'd you say?

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:05.490
Why couldn't I be your wife?

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.710
Wh-Wh-Wh-What the heck am I saying?!

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:20.000
"October 24: Bear Advisory in Effect"

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:20.000
Wh-Wh-Wh-What the heck am I saying?!

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.710
"October 24: Bear Advisory in Effect"

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.710
