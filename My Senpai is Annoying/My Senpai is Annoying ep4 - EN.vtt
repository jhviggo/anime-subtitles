WEBVTT

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.190
It's freezing.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.240
That's not like her.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.290
Well, it has been pretty cold lately.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.700
Morning.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.040
What are you guys doing?

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.750
Oh, that's right. You aren't
a member of our group.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.170
What group?

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.260
First off, you don't have
a smartphone, do you.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.550
That's because I've got this.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.100
That's the company's cell phone...

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.480
Futaba-<i>chan</i>'s out with a cold today.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.310
"F: Sorry, I've got a cold and fever.
Please let me take today off."

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.280
She's got a cold, huh...

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.630
"Episode 4:
Someone Who'll Be By Your Side"

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.760
I stayed home from work...

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.430
It's the first time I've caught a cold
since I started living on my own...

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.140
I feel so alone...

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.770
What if it gets worse,
and no one finds me...

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.740
Noooo!

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.330
"Grandpa"

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.290
Grandpa...

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.290
"G: Hotpots are the best
cold winter meals."
"G: I'd love to share one with you."

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.540
"That hotpot looks good."

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.800
"That hotpot looks good."
"I'm sick with a cold."

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.640
I can't. I'll just make him worry. Plus...

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.140
Futaba! I'm on my way!

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.270
...I bet he'll come right over.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.270
"I'm sick with a cold."

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.030
I feel sick, but I should
probably eat something.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.860
I've got to get over this fast
so I can go back to work.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:14.750
"Miso"

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.040
"Water" "Butter"
"Miso"

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.550
I was planning on going grocery shopping
on the way home from work today...

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.300
I've got to go out and get something...

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.770
It's too much of a pain
to change clothes...

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.620
The front door seems so far away...

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.010
Huh?

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.770
Looks like I came here just in time.
I bought you some food and energy drinks.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.900
Wh-Why...?

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:17.980
Take it.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.150
Seems like something's been going around,
so I'm not surprised you got sick.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.700
You okay?

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.820
Uh... Uh...

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.120
Well, eat that and get some rest.
Get well soon, now!

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.370
Uh, um...

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.960
I'm not feeling so good right now,

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.840
so I'm not sure whether
I can eat on my own.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.090
It'd be a big help if someone
could cook for me.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.390
Yeah... You must've felt so alone.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.320
All right!

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.280
Oh, where does she keep her bowl?

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.830
It's on the kitchen rack.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:13.790
What?

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.460
It's on the kitchen rack...
left-hand side, bottom shelf...

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.580
Left-hand side, bottom shelf...

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.250
Oh, there it is.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.210
I'm sorry about this.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:26.760
No worries.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.730
It's ready. Can you eat?

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.270
All right...

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.150
Udon!

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.240
I know how much you like udon.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.240
Careful now, it's hot.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.160
Thank you for making me this.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.450
No prob.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.460
It's nice and warm.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.130
She's got an appetite,
so she should be fine.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.150
Please don't look at those.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.030
My bad.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:41.460
Senpai, I had some documents that
need to be turned in by tomorrow...

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.630
I already took care of those.
Don't worry about it.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.090
Sorry...

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:49.710
What are you talking about?

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.340
We should help each other out
at times like these.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:57.060
Sakurai, Kazama, and the gang
were all worried about you.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.220
Okay.

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:00.930
Wha--?!

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:03.230
You've got quite a fever.

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:04.480
Go to sleep now.

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:26.040
My fever's gone down.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.000
Takeda-<i>senpai</i>?

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:35.640
"Take another day off and get some rest.
If anything happens, call me.
-Takeda"

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.470
Senpai...

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.860
He saw my apartment...

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:56.660
Good morning!

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.290
Futaba-<i>chan</i>!

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:01.620
Are you over your cold?

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.460
Yes, thank you for your concern.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.460
It was so lonely without you
that I couldn't focus on my work.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:09.710
You've always had trouble
focusing on your work.

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:11.090
Morning.

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.050
G... Good morning.

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.760
--Are you feeling better?
--Yes, I am.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.310
That's great. You had quite
a fever, you know.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:24.560
Huh?

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.020
T-Takeda-<i>senpai</i>!
Let's go make some sales calls!

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.610
Hey, you sure are raring to go!

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.490
You're just getting over your cold,
so don't push yourself too hard.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:39.160
I'm feeling better now.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.580
Okay.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.410
You like stuffed animals?
You had a lot of them at your place.

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:46.790
I've been collecting them
for a long time now.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:49.040
Really?

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.840
I should've gone to
check on you much earlier.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.130
I was the only one who didn't
know you'd caught a cold.

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:58.130
"Reserve one of the new smartphones
that everyone's talking about!!"

00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:59.890
"The latest models have arrived!"

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.390
Guess it's time I got a smartphone...

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:07.060
You should! That way we could
get in touch with you easily.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:11.310
But I don't know what kind to get...

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.570
I could help you.

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:15.070
Really?

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:18.490
I'm free on our next day off.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.450
Igarashi!

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:27.660
Hey there.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.580
Thank you for waiting.

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:32.960
--You okay with spending your day off...
--Would the customer with ticket #95...

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.510
--...helping a geezer pick out a smartphone?
--Would the customer with ticket #95...

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.970
--...helping a geezer pick out a smartphone?
--...please come to the reception desk?

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:41.340
This way it'll be easier
for me to get hold of you.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.470
Oh, okay.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:45.520
Plus...

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.140
You did take care of me when I was sick...

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:51.770
Sir?

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:56.360
Did you come here with your daughter?
We also have smartphones just for kids.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.740
Thank you for your patronage!

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:02.700
You're a real lifesaver!

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.990
I don't know what I
would've done without you.

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:11.000
Well, if you break it or lose it,
next time you'll have to come by yourself.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.420
All right, all right.

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:16.210
Now I can get in touch with you anytime.

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:19.300
You'd better not contact me
unless it's work-related.

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.510
Something wrong?

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:23.760
Here.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:24.550
Huh?

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:28.980
Our contact cards? If we don't exchange
them, we can't get hold of each other.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:30.770
Oh, I get it.

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:32.980
Please add me to your friends list.

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:36.190
Where do I do that?
All I see is myself on the screen.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.370
Senpai?

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:49.950
Yeah?

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:54.540
If you ever catch a cold, I'll take
care of you like you did for me.

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:55.750
Okay.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:04.220
Well, well!

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.110
"Natsumi"

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.650
Natsumi...

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:18.860
Hello?

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.030
Looks like you're over your cold.

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:22.150
Yeah.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.860
The next time you're sick, call me, okay?

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.030
You must've felt so alone all by yourself.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:30.330
Unless... someone else
came over and took care of you?

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.670
Wh-What are you talking about?
Like that'd ever happen!

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.630
I was alone in bed the whole time!

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.380
Actually, I saw you today.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:39.920
D-D-Doing what?

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.880
Walking with a really big guy.

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.640
Oh, it's not what you think!

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.100
Takeda-<i>senpai</i>'s just one
of my superiors at work.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.810
I was only helping him pick a smartphone!

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:54.140
Oh, so you call him Takeda-<i>senpai</i>.

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.600
I'm hanging up now
because I'm going to bed.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.320
Okay, talk to you later, then! Good night!

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.900
Natsumi can be a pain sometimes...

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:03.650
"F: Yeah, thanks. I'll be okay."
"N: Well, call me if anything happens."
"F: Okay, bye!"

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:04.900
"Itomaki Room (14)"
"Grandpa"
"Sakurai Touko"
"Takeda Harumi"

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:08.160
He hasn't tried contacting me...

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.290
Oh, I see you got a smartphone.

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:16.080
--Kazama?
--Yes?

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.090
How do you send someone
a message on a smartphone?

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:20.090
You're kidding, right?

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:24.220
I started last night,
and I've been trying ever since...

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.260
Tap on the word balloon icon...

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:34.560
Futaba-<i>chan</i>?

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.440
Sakurai-<i>san</i>?

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.770
What are you looking at?

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:39.730
N-Nothing special.

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:41.690
Just some bear images.

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:46.610
Takeda-<i>san</i>'s in your contacts.
So, he finally got a smartphone, huh?

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:51.080
Well, you see?

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.750
I "heard" that Takeda-<i>senpai</i>
got a smartphone yesterday,

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:58.000
so I was just adding him to my contacts.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.880
You don't say.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.130
She's so easy to read.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.840
"Takeda Harumi"
"Thanks."

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:13.430
It took him five whole minutes
to send a single text...

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:16.690
I finally managed to send it.

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.520
Good job...

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:28.610
"T: Sorry, I've got a cold,
so I'll be taking the day off."

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:30.910
I think this is the first time
that Takeda-<i>kun</i>'s

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:33.870
taken time off since he
started working here.

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:35.500
Is that right?

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.370
Now that you mention it, I don't think
he's taken any time off before.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.580
And that time the flu was
going around like crazy?

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.040
He was the only one who didn't get sick.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.630
I guess even Takeda-<i>san</i>
can catch colds sometimes.

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.590
You wouldn't think so
from the way he looks.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:54.760
I wonder if he caught my cold...

00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:59.230
A cold, huh?

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:02.020
Oh, Tsukishiro-<i>san</i>
and Sakurai-<i>san</i>, it's you...

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:05.780
Colds are no laughing matter.
In Siberia, they'll be the death of you.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:06.990
What...?

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:09.700
So, what are you going to do, Futaba-<i>chan</i>?

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.950
Aren't you going to go take care of him?

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:13.780
Why would I?

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:16.490
I'm not going to.

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.540
I'm going back to my desk now.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:19.960
All right.

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:23.500
Touko.

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:28.510
Touko, Siberia cakes
are pretty tasty, you know.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.720
"100.94* F"

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.390
Darn, it hasn't gone down.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:44.690
Man, I'm hungry.

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:47.360
And there's nothing in the fridge...

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.400
Guess I'll have to go grab something...

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:55.240
I'm so out of it...

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.250
Going to the convenience store
is such a pain...

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:09.670
Igarashi?

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:14.640
Knowing you, Senpai, I figured you
haven't been eating all that well,

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.390
and seeing as you took
care of me last time...

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:23.900
Uh... well... um... I guess
what I'm trying to say is...

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.310
I came here to return the favor!

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.700
Uh...

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.950
Where are the cooking chopsticks?

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:42.410
Not in here.

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:46.710
Senpai, where are the cooking chopsticks?

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:48.590
Where did I put them...?

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:53.430
Oh, never mind, it's okay.
Please, just stay in bed.

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:55.010
I found them!

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:56.340
Sorry about that...

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.390
It's okay.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:09.070
Now we just wait a bit...

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:11.820
Oh, pot holders.

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:19.200
I can't believe they
had them in his size...

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.540
Guess he's never used them...

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:26.080
Well, why would he need to? The skin
on his hands looks thick enough.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:34.630
From this angle, it looks like
something different...

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.220
Home run!

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:52.190
Food's ready! I added plenty
of scallions and ginger.

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:54.190
Thanks.

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:56.240
Careful, it's hot.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.410
All right.

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:03.910
--Looks good!
--I knew he'd take it off barehanded...

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:05.710
Thanks for fixing me this.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:13.000
Wow, this is just amazing!

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.010
You'll make a great wife.

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.140
Um, Senpai?

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:24.970
Yeah?

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:28.020
You caught my cold, didn't you?

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.230
No, that's not it.

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:35.320
The other day I stood under a waterfall
as part of my midwinter judo training.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.610
A waterfall?

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:41.450
Really?

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:44.540
Yeah, I can't believe I did that.

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:49.500
Man, that was great!

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:50.960
Thanks.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.960
You're welcome.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.630
Now please, get some sleep.

00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:59.340
Sorry to trouble you.

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:00.340
It's no trouble.

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:26.490
Sheer momentum may have brought me here,

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:30.120
but I've never actually been
in a guy's room before...

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.560
He's fast asleep.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.770
I wonder if I've returned the favor now...

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.480
His face looks so relaxed
when he's asleep...

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:08.540
Come to think of it, he's always got
a little bit of a beard going here.

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:11.210
It's so prickly!

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.290
What are you doing?

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:25.100
Get well soon!

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:35.360
Could this get any worse? He saw what I
did. What the heck came over me, anyway?

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:54.960
I hope she'll fix me something else
sometime. Her food's so good.

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:00.510
Mornin'!

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:02.050
Good morning.

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:04.550
Good morning. Looks like
you're feeling better now.

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:07.180
Yeah, sorry to put you guys out.

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:09.180
Good morning.

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:11.430
I'm glad you're feeling better.

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:17.560
What is it?

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.070
Hey, what is with you?

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:25.700
Thanks for coming to visit me!
It really made my day!

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:31.790
Futaba-<i>chan</i>, didn't you tell me
you weren't going to visit him?

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:36.540
Hey, wh... wh... why'd you
have to tell them?

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.710
Wait. You didn't say anything?

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:41.000
Did Igarashi-<i>chan </i>visit you at home?

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.970
Yeah, she came to visit me when I
was sick. Igarashi's cooking is so g--

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:47.680
Don't say another word!

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:51.310
You even cooked for him? That's great.

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:54.600
I think I'll try hard, too...

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:58.400
This sucks!

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:05.360
Please don't say stuff like that!
It's embarrassing.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:10.580
I don't think it's anything to get upset
about. Your cooking really is good.

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:16.710
Well, Senpai, if you insist, I could
make you something else sometime...

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.540
Okay then, how about a Hamburg steak?

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:22.210
Huh?! You're actually making a request?
