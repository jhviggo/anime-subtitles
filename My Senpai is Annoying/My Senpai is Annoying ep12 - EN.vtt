00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.930
Yes, this is well-organized.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.060
Good work!

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.140
Thank you!

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.400
You do a good job of putting
the documents together?

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.980
Yes, the chief complimented me on it.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.490
That's great! I'm so happy for you.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.370
I told you not to tousle my hair!

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.080
I've said this so many times, Senpai!
You treat me like a child way too much!

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.170
No matter how you look at it,
I'm a grown woman!

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.300
"A Grown Woman"

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.550
What?!

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.680
Anyway, one day I'll be good enough
for you to rely on, Takeda-<i>senpai</i>!

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.810
So, you'd better watch out!

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.810
What are you, a yakuza?

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.820
What the heck are you going on about,
Igarashi? I count on you plenty.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.110
Oh, really?

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.820
Yeah, your cooking's <i>so </i>good.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.530
That has <i>nothing </i>to do with work!

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:55.500
Thanks to Takeda-<i>kun </i>here, we landed
a contract with a major client!

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.130
Let's give him a big hand!

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.300
It was just a matter of good timing.
Thanks for your help, everyone!

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.390
Takeda-<i>san</i>'s incredible, huh?

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.850
Yeah, pretty impressive.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.140
He always looks so imposing.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.480
How can a guy get that buff?

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.900
Takeda-<i>senpai</i>'s worked so hard and all...

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.820
Hello there.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.580
Mona-<i>san</i>! Don't sneak up on me like that!

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.120
Sorry.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.460
Why were you smiling to yourself just now?

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.290
Huh?

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.460
Did something good happen?

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.540
Uh, well...

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.170
Not to me, but...

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.340
My <i>senpai </i>just landed an important
contract with a major new client.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.430
Kudos!

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.760
"Kudos!" "Kudos!"
Huh? What?

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.140
"Kudos!" "Kudos!"
Isn't that a great accomplishment?

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.310
Yes, it is!

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.770
And yet, he says it was just
a matter of good timing...

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.730
How modest of him.
I think he's pretty amazing.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.280
Yes, he is!

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.570
He's really, really amazing!

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.820
Then, why are <i>you </i>so happy, Igarashi-<i>san</i>?

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:06.990
Huh?

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.370
No, no. I wouldn't say that...

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.080
Takeda-<i>senpai </i>was like a mentor to me.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.840
I mean, he took me under his wing, so...

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.210
So you respect him.

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:22.920
Or maybe it's affection?

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.800
My face feels so flushed...

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.850
Why did Mona-<i>san </i>have to
say something weird like that?

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.860
Senpai, are you working on
the documents for the new client?

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.150
Yeah.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.320
Would you like me to help?

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.070
That's okay, I'll be done soon.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.110
Oh...

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.370
Wow.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.660
Takeda-<i>san</i>'s pretty amazing, huh?

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.920
Yeah, but...

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.920
...because of that,
he does everything himself...

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.420
So, you're lonely because
he doesn't rely on you?

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.930
N-No, it's not like that at all...

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.600
Well, see you later.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.020
Okay.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:20.440
All this time I've worked hard to become
a full-fledged salesperson, but...

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.400
...maybe Senpai still thinks I'm a rookie.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.040
I wonder when I'll be able to stand
on my own two feet...

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.170
There's been a problem?

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.760
Yeah, they asked me to
come over right away.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.100
But you've got a presentation to give.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.390
I don't know what to do.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.440
Say, why don't I do
the presentation instead?

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.770
I helped you prepare it, Senpai,
so I know all the details.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.190
We go to this client all the time.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.070
And I know how to give one.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.160
Will you be okay all by yourself?

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.620
I'll be fine!

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.710
Igarashi, can I count on you?

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.960
Yes! I got this!

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.460
Then, go get 'em!

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.050
Good luck, Futaba-<i>chan</i>!

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.260
Take care!

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.470
Okay, I'll be right back!

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.560
Don't worry! You got this!

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.320
Senpai's taught you so much already.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.610
So...

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.870
...now it's your turn to help him!

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.950
May I come in?

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.170
Yes... Yes, the presentation went well.

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:06.090
The client was happy and said
our proposal was fine as it is.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:09.630
Okay. Good work, Igarashi.
You're a real lifesaver.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.050
All right, I'll be back shortly!

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.680
Yay, I did it!

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.270
"Soba"

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:26.900
A bowl of udon after a hard
day's work sure hits the spot!

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.400
Hey, you shouldn't laugh so much.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.530
But it's hilarious.

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:34.740
Come to think of it...

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:39.330
It's been a while since
I've had lunch by myself.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:44.420
He kept saying, "Just one more bar."
And we wound up going to five more.

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:54.220
I'm back!

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.810
Welcome ba--!

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:02.480
Takeda-<i>san</i>! I heard you
landed a huge contract.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.350
Let's all go out and celebrate!

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:07.570
I know a bar that serves
only the good stuff!

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.400
You can drink and tell us all about it.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.700
Takeda-<i>san</i>'s pretty popular
with the ladies...

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:16.030
That's because he landed
that amazing contract.

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:17.870
He's our company's savior.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:22.040
Well, then I want to be a savior, too!
So the ladies'll come flocking to me!

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.620
Okay, okay.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:28.040
What's this feeling inside my chest?

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:32.260
Igarashi. Hey, Igarashi.

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:35.720
Wh-What is it?!

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.760
What's the matter? You look out of it.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.140
I-It's nothing.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.730
Thanks for what you did today!

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:45.400
You're welcome...

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.980
So, where's the party going to be at?

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:48.820
Huh?

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.740
They invited you just now, didn't they?

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.570
Oh, I turned them down.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:55.490
But why?

00:08:55.490 --> 00:09:00.370
Well, I don't mind going out for drinks.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:06.040
But I'm not big on having
parties thrown for me.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:10.000
I'm surprised how shy
you can be sometimes...

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.510
But everyone wants to celebrate with you.

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:15.470
You should definitely go!

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.140
But...

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:22.850
As an adult, it reflects badly on you not
going because you're not big on parties.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.560
And besides, Senpai, you said it yourself.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:29.190
It was thanks to everyone
that we landed the contract.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.820
I never thought I'd get
lectured by my <i>kouhai</i>.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.190
All right.

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:36.650
I'll tell them I'm going.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:39.030
Want to come to the party with me?

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:40.950
No, I'll sit this one out.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:45.080
Go by yourself and let them
celebrate all they want, Senpai.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.370
Oh, okay.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:51.250
That's strange...

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:56.760
I'm really happy his hard work's
being recognized, but...

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.390
...I don't want to see the ladies
fawning all over him.

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:01.890
Okay, let's go.

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:04.470
Hey, hey, there are so many of you.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.770
Guess I'll be going home now.

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:10.860
I hear this place makes great ramen.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.270
It looks <i>so </i>good.

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:13.730
That's great!

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:15.690
I'm very particular about my ramen.

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:16.900
But it all tastes the same to you.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.150
Aw, can it!

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.200
Kurobe-<i>san</i>!

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:29.790
What a coincidence!

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:30.790
You out for a run?

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:34.750
Uh-huh! I want to catch up with
the other guys in the basketball club,

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.510
so I run every day.

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:39.840
I see you're working hard.
How's the basketball club?

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.930
It's a lot of fun! I'm still not
very good at it, but...

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:47.480
Talking while running...
You do that on purpose, right?

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.560
Yeah, that's the idea.
Want to walk instead?

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.230
That's okay!

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.940
No answer...

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.150
"G: Touring with my best bud!
I'll send you a souvenir!"

00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:59.650
"G: Touring with my best bud!
I'll send you a souvenir!"

00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:59.650
Grandpa?

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:03.870
"G: Touring with my best bud!
I'll send you a souvenir!"

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:05.240
"Looking forward to it!"

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.840
I'm really in the mood
for a drink tonight.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.340
But it's pretty hard to walk
into an <i>izakaya </i>alone...

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:23.350
Welcome! How many in your party?

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:24.300
Just me.

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.510
Come on in! Someone will
show you to your seat!

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:30.190
I'm a full-fledged salesperson now!
I'll be fine!

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.860
Thank you for coming!
Will your party be joining you later?

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:39.190
Oh, um, I came here alone today...
Is that all right?

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:41.700
Of course! Please have
a seat at the counter.

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:53.580
Okay! I'll do my best!

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.290
I'm looking forward to working with you!

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:57.340
Me, too. We're counting on you.

00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.010
Cheers!

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:03.340
I remember when I
was a new hire like him...

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:10.020
My name is Igarashi Futaba,
and I will be working here starting today.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.770
Nice to meet you.

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:20.110
"Takeda: Meeting Client
Then Coming to Work"
"New Hire's Self-Introduction (11:00-)"

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.240
Igarashi-<i>san</i>?

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:27.620
I'm Sakurai Touko. Nice to meet you.

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.790
N-Nice to meet you too, Sakurai-<i>san</i>.

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:31.750
Say...

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:32.910
Yes?

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:35.460
Do you mind if I call you "Igarashi-<i>chan</i>"?

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.090
Why would you?

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:42.720
Because you're just so small and adorable.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.970
Sakurai-<i>san</i>!

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:48.220
Granted, I may have
somewhat childish features.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:54.350
But while I may be new here, keep in mind
that I'm also an adult member of society.

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:57.110
So, please don't treat me like a child!

00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:00.940
Oh... Then, would "Futaba-<i>chan</i>" be okay?

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:02.690
Were you even listening to me?

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:06.360
Anyway, I think those forms of
address are much too casual

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.030
for someone you've just met.

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:10.620
Where are you going, Futaba-<i>chan</i>?

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.540
To get something to drink!

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:20.710
I know I never got my
growth spurt, but still...

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:23.840
Sakurai-<i>san</i>'s got such a nice figure.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:28.220
Ow, that's hard... Huh?!

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:32.140
H-He's so huge!

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.430
Huh? Haven't seen you around here before.

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:37.940
I-I-I-I'm really sorry! I wasn't
watching where I was going...

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:41.270
Hey, don't sweat it!
You here to get a drink?

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:42.730
Uh, yes.

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:44.030
Which one?

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:45.200
Oshiruko...

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.280
Okie dokie.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.280
It's my treat. Catch!

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:53.370
Uh, thank you...

00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:00.840
Um... Do you work in the sales department?

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.710
Yeah. I had to go see a client first,
so that's why I'm late.

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:07.760
I ran all the way here, so I'm parched.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.260
I see...

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.310
Good... He seems like a nice guy.

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:15.270
Oh, right! I'd better introduce myself.

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:16.350
Hello. Today's my first--

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:18.770
So, you come here today on a field trip?

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:19.940
What?

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:24.400
I remember someone saying some junior
high students were coming on a field trip.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.950
Anyhow, you're a wee little thing.

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:29.700
Just eat a lot, and you'll grow.

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.370
Your future's ahead of you.

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:39.420
Take care. I've got to go mentor
the new guy who's starting today.

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:49.180
Kazama, are you letting junior
high students tour the office?

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.930
Huh? No, nobody came today.

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:55.810
That's weird. There was this girl
who looked like she was in junior high.

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:57.480
I think the girl you saw is probably--

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.810
Takeda-<i>kun</i>, come over here!

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:01.860
I'll be right there.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.730
Sorry, got to go.

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:06.280
I'm back.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.740
Igarashi-<i>san</i>, did you
happen to run into...

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:10.820
Yes?

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:13.910
Oh, sorry. Never mind.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:16.450
Looks like he screwed up big time...

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:17.910
What's the matter?

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:20.500
Chief, sorry I'm late.

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.250
No problem.

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:26.340
But I already had the new hire address
the staff and introduce herself.

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:29.170
Igarashi-<i>san</i>, come over here!

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.970
Hello there. I'll be working
with you starting today...

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:32.840
Huh?!

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.390
What's this? You know each other already?

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:37.810
You're a grownup?

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:40.730
Sorry if I look like I'm in junior high!

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:42.350
Chief, give me somebody else.

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:45.730
W-W-Well, that's not how it works.

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:48.690
Takeda-<i>kun</i>, do you have
any idea what's wrong?

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:50.740
Yeah... a little...

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:55.240
Anyway, Igarashi-<i>san</i>, I know that
deep down you may not want to,

00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:00.620
but at this office you are <i>senpai </i>and
<i>kouhai</i>, so let's all work together, okay?

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:06.040
Hey, you still mad about what happened?

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.420
Not really.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:17.470
Well, since I can't very well
get out of it...

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:21.100
I'm looking forward to working
with you, Takeda-<i>senpai</i>.

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.820
Yeah. Same here, Igarashi.

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:32.610
He was annoying from the day we met.

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:37.120
But we've been together ever since...

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.580
Together... this whole time...

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:59.720
Hey, wassa grade schooler doin' here?

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.060
I'm not a grade schooler!

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:06.520
Yew shouldn't be in a place like dis.

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.980
--Where's yer mommy?
--Uh, hey...

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:10.940
Don't sit next to me, please!

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:15.030
Why not? Nobody's sittin' here.

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:21.870
Wass yer name, little girl?

00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:24.290
Ah'll stay here wit'cha
till yer mommy comes.

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:25.580
Don't!

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:36.890
Who are yew?!

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.890
I'm her <i>senpai</i>.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.940
Oh, I'm so sorry for the disturbance.

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:49.560
Hey, you shouldn't
go around bothering people.

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:55.110
Give me a draft beer.

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:57.740
One draft beer, coming up!

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:01.080
Senpai, didn't you go to
the party they threw for you?

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.870
Yeah, I went.

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:05.790
I showed up, said a few words, and left.

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:07.710
Wasn't it a bit too soon for that?

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:09.420
You think so?

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:12.000
But then I thought...

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:17.340
...I'd rather be drinking
with you than with all of them.

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.760
Come on, what are you talking about?

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.480
Honestly...

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:34.900
Hey, it's not like you to drink so much.

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:38.820
Well, it's because you say
such weird things, Senpai.

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.490
What did I say?

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.950
Argh!

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:48.750
Senpai...

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:49.580
Yeah?

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.000
You must...

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:57.920
Huh? What's the matter?

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:00.550
Oh, n-never mind.

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:04.640
Shenpai, you must really like me!

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:10.480
Why did I start to say that again?

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.940
This reminds me of the time...

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:17.780
No, more like every time...

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:21.240
We were sitting here drinking like this.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.700
What's gotten into you all of a sudden?

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:30.790
Yeah, well, compared to then,
Igarashi, you've grown a lot.

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:37.670
That's because you were
there for me, Senpai.

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:42.010
I know I put you through a lot and...

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:46.180
...I'm sure I was a pretty sassy rookie.

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:49.020
But you really looked after me and...

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:52.560
...well, I'm grateful for that, I guess.

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:57.650
You're drunk, aren't you?

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:01.860
We drank a bit too much.

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:03.740
We sure did.

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:05.740
It's almost time for the last train.

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:09.540
Sorry to keep you out so late.

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:10.910
You should be.

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:13.830
I can't believe you'd keep
a lady out this late at night.

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.550
It's fun drinking with you.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:25.260
Senpai, I went to a client's
all by myself today.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:26.220
Yeah.

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:30.310
I gave a presentation
and ate lunch alone, too.

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:31.850
Uh-huh.

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:36.150
Soon I'll be a full-fledged salesperson.

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:41.320
So, don't expect me
to always be by your side.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.160
Say, Igarashi.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.700
Yes?

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.290
It's nothing serious.

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:55.170
Look, I don't know who'll be
with you down the road, but...

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:58.840
...I'll be by your side,
protecting you until then.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:06.260
You're drunk, aren't you?

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:10.100
Yeah, I guess.

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:15.020
Well, just make sure you
protect me until then, all right?

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:51.160
"Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo
Scattered Showers in the Afternoon"

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:56.580
It's really coming down hard...

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.540
"Itomaki Ramen"

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:00.460
What's the matter?

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:02.210
I forgot my umbrella.

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:03.710
Oh.

00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:05.510
Then, you want to share mine?

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:07.470
What? But I couldn't...

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:09.510
Come on, don't be shy.

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:19.310
W-We're walking under the same umbrella!

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:26.150
I'll buy myself an umbrella at
the closest convenience store.

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:28.280
You don't have to do that, you know.

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.990
You're walking under mine.

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:31.110
B-But...

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:34.030
You're getting wet. Come in closer.

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:40.330
D-D-Dum...!

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:52.050
Senpai, you really are annoying.
