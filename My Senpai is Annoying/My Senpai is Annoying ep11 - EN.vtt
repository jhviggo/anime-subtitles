Can the rest wait until after
the new year?

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.280
I think so.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.610
Have you checked with them about it?

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.820
Yes, they said it was no problem.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.160
Igarashi-<i>chan</i>!

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.700
Thanks for putting this together for me.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.000
We managed to get it done
before the end of the year.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.830
That's great!

Well, well, Igarashi-<i>chan</i>.
You're getting to be a real pro at sales.

how many years they've been at it.

Igarashi-<i>chan</i>, are you
going home for New Year's?

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.120
No, I'm going to spend
it here with friends.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.580
Really?

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.040
What about you, Sakurai-<i>san</i>?
Got any big plans for New Year's Eve?

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.460
No, nothing big planned...

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.380
Who you gonna spend it with?

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.760
How 'bout with me?

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.380
Shut up, you guys!

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.300
I'm spending the New Year's
with my little brother.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.470
What about you, Kazama?

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.730
I'm going to spend it at home gaming.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.440
That sounds like you.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.860
I spend my New Year's at a ski resort.
It's a New Year's tradition.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.990
You ski, Chief?
I never would've guessed.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.200
What about you, Takeda-<i>kun</i>?
You going somewhere?

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.250
Well, I've got midwinter judo training
until the very end of the year, so...

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.250
...I'll be spending
New Year's vegging out.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.540
Vegging out for New Year's.
That sounds nice, too.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.820
Kazama-<i>kun</i>, would you like to come
to my place for New Year's Eve?

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.160
Yuto's been wanting to see you.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.290
Okay.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.160
Let's have some <i>toshikoshi </i>soba.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:00.340
What?

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.220
I bet your grandpa misses you.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.720
Futaba! Come home!

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.930
I miss you so much I could die!

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:21.480
Grandpa's going on a fishing trip with his
friends, so I'll go home some other time.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.860
Well, that sounds like something he'd do.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.870
Okay, I hope we can keep
working together next year.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.340
Sis?

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.800
What's the matter?

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:31.300
Sorry, I forgot I promised to go to a New
Year's Eve party at a friend's tonight.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.350
I'm going there now.

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:34.560
What?!

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.770
I'm really sorry!

When are you coming back?

Well, it's a New Year's Eve party,
so probably sometime tomorrow.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:44.690
Tomorrow?!

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.900
My friend'll get mad, so...
I've got to go now! Sorry!

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.870
What should I do?
If I don't do something, then...

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.580
What's the matter? Did you forget...

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.300
Uh... well, I came over
for New Year's Eve...

Hey. Where's Yuto-<i>kun</i>?

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.760
Uh... actually, he went out.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.100
What?

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:21.850

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:40.870
Yeah, he forgot he made other plans...

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.920
Hey, it smells like something's burning.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.960
Hmm? Oh, no!

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:53.930
Is everything all right?

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.260
Oh, darn!

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:01.060
Futaba?

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.690
Yeah?

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.810
You need any help?

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:09.110
No, I'm fine. Make yourself at home.

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:12.900
Okay, I'll do that.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:13.820
Oh.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.160

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.280

Hey, Futaba! Tada-ta-ta-tada, ta-da!

Wow! That's a huge fish!

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.810
Yeah, pretty amazing, huh?!

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:41.770
Eek!

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:43.770
Oh...

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:46.940
So, this is your granddaughter...

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.020
What a cutie!

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.860
So, you're Futaba-<i>chan</i>?

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.070
How would you like to be my granddaughter?

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:55.360
Who'd let you have her, you old coot?!

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.070
You're such a stingy bastard!

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:59.160
What do you mean "stingy"?

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.410
Grandpa, I've got to go now.
Be careful out there!

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:07.250
Okay, I'll send you some fish!

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:10.840
Grandpa's circle of friends...

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.800
What a mystery, huh?

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.300
"Soba"

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:21.390
I wonder what Takeda-<i>senpai</i>'s up to now...

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:30.610
Wait a sec! Who cares what he's doing?

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.610
Sorry about the wait.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.160
Oh, this looks really good!

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.200
Shall we?

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.490
Yeah.

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.540
Let's eat!

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:46.710
Mmm!

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:51.000
How was your year, Futaba?

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:08.650
W-Well, I worked pretty hard, I guess.

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:13.070
Work, huh?

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:13.900
What?

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.240
Oh, nothing.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.030
Get outta here!

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.490
I'm so sorry...

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:24.290
It's no problem at all.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.910
I came here to see you, Sakurai.

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:30.040
I would've liked to eat your soba, but...

No, don't!

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.230
Kind of hard not to laugh, huh?

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:48.480
Yeah.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.820
When we're done eating, let's head to
a shrine for our first visit of the year.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:55.860
Okay.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.420
Futaba?

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.390
Whoa!

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.730
Wow!

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:41.740
Kazama-<i>kun</i>?

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.950
Happy New Year.

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:46.830
Yep.

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:49.000
Happy New Year.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.540
"Itomaki Shrine"

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.580
Pretty crowded, huh?

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.540
It's New Year's Day.

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:07.680
Takeda-<i>san</i>!

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:10.060
Hey, Natsumi!

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.560
Oh, hey there!

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.190
You here for your first shrine visit?

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:18.020
Yeah, I was on my way to my favorite
ramen shop and thought I'd stop by.

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.110
Oh, you're here, too.

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:25.320
Yeah, well... Happy New Year.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.370
Thanks! Happy New Year!

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:32.460
Oh, no!

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:38.290
I just remembered some really important
business that I can't get out of, so...

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.670
...I'd better be going!

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:41.880
What?!

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.630
You two have fun now!

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:45.800
Natsumi?!

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.220
It's the start of the new year,
and she's already got stuff to do.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.730
You wore a kimono?

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:57.770
Yeah, because it's New Year's.

00:12:57.770 --> 00:12:59.150
That's great.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.360
You want to do your
first shrine visit with me?

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.700
Okay.

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:15.420
God, please help me land more contracts.

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:19.130
And make my boobs a little bigger.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:20.630

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.470
Yeah?

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:31.140
I hope you have a great year.

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.310
I hope you do, too.

"Fortunes"
Let's get our fortunes told.

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.990
That's a great idea!

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.950
Last year I drew a <i>chuukichi</i>.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:49.700
Well, mine was <i>kichi</i>.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.740
Oh, yeah? That's not too bad, I guess.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:56.500
Huh? <i>Kichi</i>'s the next best
fortune after <i>daikichi</i>, isn't it?

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.250
No, it's not.

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:04.260
I'm sure the order is <i>daikichi</i>,
<i>chuukichi</i>, <i>shoukichi</i>, <i>kichi</i>.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:10.140
No, you're wrong. The correct order
is <i>daikichi</i>, <i>kichi</i>, <i>chuukichi</i>.

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:13.180
What? <i>Chuukichi</i>'s better than <i>kichi</i>.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.560
Nuh-uh, <i>kichi</i>'s better.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:19.400
Okay, whoever gets the better
fortune today wins the dispute.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.770
No hard feelings no matter what you get.

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:22.650
All right.

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:25.610
Whoa! This gal's amazing!

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.660
Look, it's Mona-<i>san</i>...

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:33.410
"Daikichi"

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:36.540
"Daikichi"
Wow! She drew another <i>daikichi</i>!

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:42.040
I've got another one right here.
Read it and weep.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.550
"Daikichi"

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.670
She draws a <i>daikichi </i>every time!

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:47.590
Incredible!

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:49.760
Happy New Year!

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.430
They're all <i>daikichi</i>!

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:54.220
Draw my fortune for me, please!

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.060
Whoa...

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:01.230
That's amazing. It must be pretty easy
to get a <i>daikichi </i>at this shrine.

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:02.440
Let's give it a try!

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.110
Okay.

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:06.110
"Fortunes"

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:09.530
Fortune, please.

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:11.110
All right.

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:12.700
Here you go.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:13.990
Thanks.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.870
"Hankichi" "Hankichi"

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:28.340
--What is it?
--What?

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:29.380
Oh, nothing.

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:30.970
"Itomaki Shrine Office"

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:32.590
"Itomaki Shrine Office"
Let's tie them up and go.

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:33.640
"Itomaki Shrine Office"
Okay.

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.980
Fortunes only provide a false
sense of security, anyway.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.810
Exactly.

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:45.860
"The person you are waiting for
is standing next to you."

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:50.650
Okay, here's your New Year's ramen.

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:53.160
What makes it so special?

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.580
It's got more <i>naruto </i>in it.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:59.370
Really? That makes it a bit more festive.

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:00.830
It sure does.

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:02.420
Let's eat.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.210
Yeah.

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:05.960
"Menu"

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:13.390
Well, I guess those fortunes
were pretty unimpressive, huh?

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:14.760
Yeah.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:19.430
Speaking of which, Takeda-<i>senpai</i>...

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:20.600
Yeah?

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:25.480
What exactly... did your fortune say?

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:27.980
Well...

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:29.940
"The person you are waiting for
is standing next to you."

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:36.070
Nothing special. Pretty average stuff.

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:39.120
Are you hiding something from me?

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.200
What about yours, Igarashi?

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:45.920
Mine? Um, well...
mine was also pretty average.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:49.000
You hiding something from me, too?

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.220
"Too"? That means <i>you're</i>
also hiding something!

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.430
And so are <i>you</i>!

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.140
Let's drop this, okay?

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:02.560
We don't need to get so worked up
over our fortunes, do we?

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.980
Um... Well...

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:07.230
I guess you're right.

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:12.150
Okay, let's go to our reporter
live at the scene. Suzuki-<i>san</i>?

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:16.870
Hello! I'm here at Itomaki Shrine.

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:22.830
Now, let's go ask a couple what they think
of their first shrine visit this year.

00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:24.290
Hello there.

00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:29.710
Uh, well, this isn't really a date...

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:31.550
It's our first shrine visit this year.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:36.510
Oh, I see. So, how was it?

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:39.720
We happened to see our coworkers
here a little while ago.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:44.560
We didn't want to disturb them,
so we didn't call out to them.

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.980
Were they on a date?

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:52.320
I don't know if you'd call it that,
but the two of them are really close.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.740
At first, things were pretty
tense between them.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.990
--What's wrong? Your ramen's getting cold.
--Oh, really?

00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:59.530
Oh, right!

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:01.660
Now what are things like?

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.500
Oh, take a look at this.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.830
Are they... father and daughter?

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:10.630
Oh, she's sleeping next to him!
That's so cute!

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:11.710
Huh?!

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:15.510
When we were on the train, she fell
asleep against our <i>senpai</i>'s shoulder.

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:17.630
If she finds out,
don't come running to me.

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:20.930
You can really tell what
a good match they are.

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:21.680
--It's a shame I can't
show this on camera.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.260
--Extra noodles, please!
--It's a shame I can't
show this on camera.

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:24.720
--You got it!
--It's a shame I can't
show this on camera.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.730
The two of them just had
their fortunes told here...

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:33.820
Senpai, I'll be right back.
Please wait for me here.

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.110
What's the matter? You forget something?

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:38.450
Something like that.

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:42.990
What's with her...?

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:45.540
Hey, Harumi. Here're your extra noodles.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:47.750
Oh, thanks.

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:49.540
"Kazama Souta Sent a Photo"
"Kazama Souta: Guys,
I'm counting on you."

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:51.290
"Kazama Souta Sent a Photo"
"Kazama Souta: Guys,
I'm counting on you."
It's from Kazama...

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.960
What's going on?!
Stop the camera!

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.990
Oh, you're awake.

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.240
Are you all right?

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.990
Sakurai...

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:31.880
You were looking at my chest
just now, weren't you?

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.670
Yeah, I was.

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:36.840
Thanks for being honest.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:40.260
That picture you took of them on
the sly wound up getting erased, huh?

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:44.010
I uploaded it to the cloud first,
so it's not a problem.

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:45.970
How smart of you.

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:47.930
Guess I'd better download it.

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.060
Kazama-<i>kun</i>?

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.820
Why'd you come with me today?

00:19:55.820 --> 00:20:00.070
You said you were going to spend
New Year's at home gaming.

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:04.320
Well...

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.370
Lots of guys were asking you out, Sakurai.

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:12.330
So, I was really glad when you asked a
nobody like me over, and not one of them.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:14.580
I just thought it'd be way more fun...

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:19.460
...to spend New Year's Day
with you than to spend it alone.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.510
Oh...

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:28.470
Or something like that.

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:38.270
I'm stiff from having your head in
my lap this whole time, Kazama-<i>kun</i>.

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.610
I'm going to get us some drinks.
What do you want?

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:43.530
I'll have some hot tea.

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:45.160
All right.

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:50.450
Hey! Hey mister!

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:53.790
Who's that lady that was here just now?

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:56.750
Her? She's a colleague at work.

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:58.500
A col-league?

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.170
It means we're friends.

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:03.930
Really? You guys aren't dating?

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:05.680
N-No...

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.510
Do you have feelings for her?

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:09.720
Huh?!

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:12.520
Well...

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.230
Yeah, I do...

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:22.070
But she's way out of my league,
and I don't know how she feels about me.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.950
Then, take a look at this!

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:29.950
A toy camera?

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:32.540
I'm back!

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:35.250
Oh, what a cute little girl!

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:36.210
Hey.

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:38.540
Quick! Take a look!

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:40.550
A-All right.

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:45.260
What's this? There's something
fishy going on here.

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.220
No, don't!

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:50.970
Sakurai?

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:56.440
You see this?

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.520
What?

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:02.940
Did you see this, Kazama-<i>kun</i>?

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:05.110
No, I didn't...

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:09.660
Well, you can't! I absolutely forbid it!

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:11.530
What's so bad about it?

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:13.240
Everything!

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.120
But it was a really good shot...

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.420
You mustn't take pictures like this!

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:18.830
Are you going to erase it?

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:20.540
Of course I am!

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.460
Aww!

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:59.520
